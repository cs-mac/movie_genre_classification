1
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,883
For a camel,
you make a triangle like this.

2
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,845
That's the hump.

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,561
It's so easy. See?

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,721
Then some lines for legs here.

5
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,460
Teacher taught me how to do this.

6
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,881
He showed me elephants and cats, too.

7
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,327
But I told him you like camels.

8
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,446
That's the neck.

9
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,288
You're not watching.

10
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,020
Then on top, I put
another triangle for a head.

11
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,808
They have big round eyes
and a skinny tail here.

12
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,131
Little baby, playing with girls?

13
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,246
Get off! Get off him!

14
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,126
Stop!

15
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,564
Don't touch her!

16
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,006
He's dead.

17
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,323
Eleazer's dead!

18
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,362
Over there. He did it.

19
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,043
You! You killed him!

20
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,689
That man told you to say that.

21
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,685
What man?

22
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,650
The apple! Eleazer tripped on the apple.

23
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,209
You killed him. We all saw it.

24
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,201
He did it. He killed him. He killed him.

25
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,930
Eleazer!

26
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,321
Eleazer...

27
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,810
You killed Eleazer. We all saw it.

28
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,962
- Mama.
- Come.

29
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,171
- There was a man. He told them that I...
- Shh.

30
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,561
Go.

31
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,928
Go home. Go.

32
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,450
James, close the door.

33
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,687
Sit.

34
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,491
Show me your face.

35
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,843
- What's happened?
- Jesus killed Eleazer!

36
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,020
Don't say that! He's your cousin.

37
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,849
He couldn't. There's no evil in him.

38
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,441
But he did! He cursed him,
and Eleazer fell dead.

39
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Don't you threaten me.
Never! Not my nephew!

40
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,620
Joseph, they're all out there.

41
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,166
Jonathan bar Zakkai and his brothers.

42
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,163
They're saying he killed that boy.

43
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,201
How could that be? Eleazer's twice
as big and a bully to boot.

44
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,380
It's envy, that's what it is.

45
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,686
We've got the jobs they wanted.

46
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,001
Enough!

47
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,540
Is the boy dead?

48
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,324
Our son is not a murderer.

49
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,807
Is he dead or does he live?
Can anyone tell me?

50
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,580
Is the boy dead?

51
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,330
He was not moving.

52
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,849
You saved me.

53
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,725
I didn't hurt him.

54
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,770
Just do what you did before.

55
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,365
Like the dead bird.

56
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,605
Go on.

57
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,770
I won't tell.

58
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,890
Wake up.

59
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,682
Wake up now.

60
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,641
You!

61
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,580
How dare you come here!

62
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,808
Get out! Get out, you vile little...

63
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,767
Vile...

64
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,242
Son of David! Son of David!

65
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,251
Come! Come! Quickly, help!

66
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,721
Go!

67
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,167
Where did you learn medicine?
From cavemen in Britain?

68
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,163
The boy was dead, I'm telling you.

69
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,444
How could that boy be dead? Look at him!

70
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,931
He was dead.

71
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Because of him.

72
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,900
Well, he's not dead now.

73
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,286
He's possessed.

74
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,540
He killed my boy
and then brought him back again.

75
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,687
Only Satan can do that.

76
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,968
So you're complaining he's alive?

77
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,645
Why don't you go back to Galilee?

78
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,851
Take your tools and your women and your
bewitched children, and just leave.

79
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,171
Seven years is too long.

80
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,322
We're done with you.
We don't want you here.

81
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,209
Eleazer is alive.

82
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,483
For which we thank God.

83
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,280
As it happens, we're going back
to Galilee anyway.

84
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,410
What, because of a little
hubbub in the street?

85
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,846
No.

86
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,845
Because Herod is dead.

87
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,371
We can return now.

88
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,961
Is that true?

89
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,684
- Is it all my fault?
- Yes!

90
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,203
He's just a little boy!

91
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,245
Wait for me here.

92
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Nobody else can do what you did.
You know that?

93
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,407
How can I? Tell me.

94
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,620
Please?

95
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,210
They won't let me.

96
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,083
They're saying that with a touch,

97
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,491
a simple touch,
he raised him from the dead.

98
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,763
It's confirmed, isn't it?

99
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,820
Did you ever doubt it?

100
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,048
No. No. It's just...

101
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,603
It's just so soon.

102
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,288
How do you know that Herod's dead?

103
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,810
I had a dream today.

104
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,971
Before all of this.

105
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,540
That he's dead?
Or that we have to go back?

106
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,926
Both.

107
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,171
It was a dream that I had that
brought us here, remember?

108
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,489
And it turned out to be true.

109
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,287
Had we not left Bethlehem that night,
our son would be dead.

110
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,807
This was the same kind of dream.

111
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,490
So we're destined to wander.

112
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,445
Like all Jews.

113
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,688
Not wandering, going home.

114
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,891
Nazareth, not Bethlehem.

115
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,170
Never Bethlehem.

116
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,522
What do we tell our frightened little boy?

117
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,646
How do we explain what happened today?

118
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,642
How do we explain God to his own son?

119
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,163
I can't. Can you?

120
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,528
You're a child that
needs a meal and a nap.

121
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,927
- What is it?
- Him!

122
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,207
Him! Don't you see him?

123
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,567
- Who?
- Him!

124
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,009
- Who?
- Him!

125
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,409
Come, child, you need to rest.

126
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,571
This sea air's enough to kill an elephant.

127
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,887
You're the one who said you
didn't want to die in the desert.

128
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,763
- Who's dying?
- All of us.

129
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,445
But it'll probably be in Jericho
or Bethlehem or some other snake pit.

130
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,569
I was born in Bethlehem.

131
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
Were you, boy?

132
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,980
How old are you?

133
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,889
Too young to talk to strangers.

134
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,406
We live up north. Nazareth.

135
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,568
No boys his age in Bethlehem anyway.

136
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,449
Why not?

137
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,041
Herod took care of that.

138
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,482
Come over here, little one.

139
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,860
You going through Jerusalem?

140
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,530
Greatest city in the world!

141
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,580
Avoid it.

142
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,526
Pilgrims seeking answers in the temples
find only riots and violence there.

143
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,207
Bandits, rebels, soldiers taking
what and who they want.

144
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,002
- Herod's soldiers are protected...
- What is it?

145
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,849
It's the best camel I've ever seen!

146
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,001
Here.

147
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,608
It's a gift for the boy from Bethlehem.

148
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,329
For your travels.

149
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,851
Thank you.

150
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,940
It won't be long
before we have a kitchen again.

151
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,246
You'd like that.

152
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,365
Stop!

153
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,521
Come, daughter.

154
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,888
Husband, who are you talking to?

155
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,081
God.

156
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,980
He's talking to God.

157
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,100
Ah...

158
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,521
Tell Joseph.

159
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,607
Cleopas.

160
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,487
Uncle Cleopas is coughing again.

161
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,524
We'll rest for a few minutes.

162
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,167
I'm not tired. Can I go ahead?

163
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,681
All right, but not far.

164
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,042
Just up to the pass, and then wait for us.

165
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,180
James, go with him.

166
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,770
He'll be fine.

167
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,646
Whoa.

168
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,801
Psst.

169
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,323
Go! Get on! Get out!

170
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,526
Stay!

171
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,521
Boy!

172
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,968
Son, come here!

173
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,642
We had nothing to do with this, Centurion.

174
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,362
We are not rebels. We're travelers.

175
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,368
Next time there will be no mercy.

176
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,161
Go!

177
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,091
Come with me.

178
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,521
Fill it.

179
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,766
Go.

180
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,650
There's a boy who can perform miracles.

181
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,688
And in Alexandria,
he raised a boy from the dead.

182
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,380
That's the rumor.

183
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,481
Rumor?

184
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,362
You call them the mob, Severus.

185
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,723
We call them the Rejected.

186
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,300
Listen to them, to the street,
and you'll know what's going on.

187
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,607
Sounds like the Jewish madness.

188
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,002
There's a messiah behind every tree,
under every rock.

189
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,562
I'm Jewish. Do I have the madness?

190
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,325
You served my father.

191
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,404
How long have you been in Judea?

192
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,580
Eight years.

193
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,920
Were you in Bethlehem?

194
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,500
Yes, I was.

195
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,250
Then you understand.

196
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,529
You've done it before.

197
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,281
Oh...

198
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,245
Damn serpents!

199
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,642
I can't send my troops.

200
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,163
Jews won't do it again.
Not a child. Not the...

201
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,244
Not the Messiah.

202
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,921
Get out!

203
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,802
I've had enough of you,
witches and lizard-eaters. Go! Go!

204
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,202
I know what they said about my father.

205
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,886
They won't say it about me.

206
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,206
You have your assignment,

207
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,969
Centurion.

208
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,768
I saw him! That man who died.

209
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,929
You were sleeping. It was just a dream.

210
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,411
It was so real.

211
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,780
You have to watch out
for those dreams, nephew.

212
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,370
It runs in the family.

213
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,566
Well, they do.

214
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,407
In fact, we have dreams
to thank for being here.

215
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,220
Come to think of it,
every big decision this family has made

216
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,005
in the last eight years
is because of dreams.

217
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,685
Hush.

218
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,002
- What do you mean?
- You're not to ask.

219
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,926
Why not? Teacher always
answered my questions.

220
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,645
So did the rabbi.

221
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,161
Uncle?

222
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,842
You've got to tell him sometime.

223
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,604
I'll get water. Joseph!

224
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,380
Cure him! Cure him! I know you can.

225
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,370
I can't! They told me not to.

226
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,801
I don't understand. Don't you love him?

227
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,300
You know what they say about
Herod the Dead, don't you?

228
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,686
Do you mean Herod the Great?

229
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,729
They say he choked to death
on the blood of children.

230
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,720
You've killed children before.

231
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,370
So have you.

232
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,843
No doubt I'll kill more.

233
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,244
You didn't tell the men.

234
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,165
A few officers know.

235
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,006
They'll keep watch for him and so will we.

236
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,924
I don't want to start a general panic.

237
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,620
No.

238
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,725
And when we come across him,
we'll do our duty.

239
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,525
It's a small task.

240
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,166
It's a small boy.

241
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,403
I do as ordered. The boy must die.

242
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,605
Praise to the Lord!

243
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,085
I will sing praises to God!

244
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,086
But no, not to so-called princes,

245
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,120
kings, tax-mongers, bandits, mercenaries!

246
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,569
He's scaring everyone.
I'm going to get him.

247
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,566
Leave him. If he's to die,
let him die as he wants.

248
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,689
By the River Jordan,

249
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,285
raving over king and taxes
and shouting at the Lord.

250
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,042
O Lord of Zion, you shall reign forever

251
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,940
as you wash me in your living waters!

252
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,201
Father?

253
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
Father?

254
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,521
Oh, Lord, everyone yet
to be born will hear me,

255
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,963
praise your faithfulness!

256
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,610
Happy am I,

257
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,651
brother to the prophesized virgin,

258
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,325
uncle to the promised.

259
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,848
Lord Father, let us keep him.

260
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,247
God, I ask this. Is this too much?

261
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,968
Let us keep him, please,
for as long as you will.

262
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,404
Did you see that? He's a healer.

263
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,324
That little boy, I saw him do it.

264
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,330
That man was sick and now
he's well, and the boy did it.

265
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,331
- Maybe it's the Devil.
- Nonsense.

266
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,250
- Give him to me.
- We should rejoice!

267
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,807
- He's fine!
- How do you know?

268
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,923
Because of who he is.

269
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,780
This is dangerous.

270
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,530
It's a miracle!

271
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,611
There are witnesses.

272
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,420
They're charlatans using
our faith against us.

273
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,124
Rabbi, praises!

274
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,340
We saw.

275
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,441
They'll hurt us all, don't you see?

276
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,080
Bless the Lord!

277
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,361
Son...

278
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,485
Where's the food?

279
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,800
Drink.

280
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,324
He's all better.

281
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,765
Are you mad at me?

282
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,770
How could we be mad at you?
We love him, too.

283
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,370
We just have to be careful.

284
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,140
Am I dangerous?

285
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,720
No, but others are.

286
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,844
And we need to keep away from them.

287
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,126
Because of me?

288
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,881
Because I can do things nobody else can?

289
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,330
There were angels at the river.

290
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,571
I couldn't see them, but they were there.

291
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,483
How do I know that?

292
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,090
You have to stop asking these questions.

293
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,820
Why won't you tell me?

294
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,001
Because you're too young to know.

295
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,762
When will I be old enough?

296
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,163
When your father decides you are.

297
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,161
Mother?

298
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,682
I prayed for my big brother to get better.

299
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,205
And he did.

300
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,722
Let that be enough for today.

301
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,562
We're done. Go. Leave!

302
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,681
Well?

303
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,126
They claimed to have seen a boy
heal a sick man at the Jordan River.

304
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,260
A miracle.

305
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,460
What happened to the boy?

306
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,641
They don't know.

307
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,765
Anything else? Names?

308
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,083
Other people traveling with them?

309
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,082
Something distinctive?

310
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,660
No. Just Jews.

311
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,091
Same story again.

312
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,965
Yes. It's a popular one.

313
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,442
They all love their miracles.

314
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,446
There's only one miracle.
That's Roman steel.

315
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,441
Mother?

316
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,921
Come.

317
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,602
- Joseph!
- Come on, come on, come on!

318
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,922
- Stay away! Stay away!
- Shh.

319
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,248
It's all right. I won't hurt you.

320
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,323
- Stay away! Stay away!
- Shh.

321
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,740
- Stay away! Stay away...
- Shh.

322
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,001
I won't hurt you.

323
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,042
- Are you...
- What? Unclean?

324
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,169
That's not what I meant.

325
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,684
I just wondered if he...

326
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,481
Yes, he did. And he'd do it to you, too.

327
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,368
He killed my master and his wife,
then burned the house.

328
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,980
I hid in the tunnels.

329
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,286
Tunnels?

330
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,046
Under the house.

331
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,530
But he found me.

332
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,164
Bandits. They're like locusts,
destroying everything in their path.

333
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,722
He was taking me to Sepphoris to sell.

334
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,610
I was born in Sepphoris.

335
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,924
It's not far from here, near Nazareth.

336
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,967
You're good Jews. Don't go there.

337
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,489
It's a world on fire.

338
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,685
Here. You'll need these
to walk to Nazareth with us.

339
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,802
Am I going to Nazareth with you?

340
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,050
Joseph will decide.

341
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,004
We're safe. All of us.

342
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,885
He's buried. No one will find him.

343
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,885
Father, can she come with us?

344
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,250
As a sister?

345
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,326
Yes.

346
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,884
Smells like Egypt.

347
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,530
Nephew. Nephew.

348
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,251
It was a killing, but it wasn't murder.

349
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,406
The wrong was his. Not hers, not ours.

350
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,725
The water...

351
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,220
The purification ritual...

352
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,881
God himself gave it to the Jews on Sinai.

353
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,980
Yes. But now I know why.

354
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,241
This is good.

355
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,331
Hand me the tunic.

356
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,043
You should be with your mother.
Go now. Go on.

357
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,563
- What are you doing?
- Listening to him.

358
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,290
You might consider doing it yourself.

359
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,371
Can't you see he's bursting
with questions?

360
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,611
He's seen a lot for a little boy.
For that matter, we all have.

361
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,900
What are you implying?

362
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,966
I don't imply. If I have something
to say, I say it.

363
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,967
- Then say it!
- He needs answers!

364
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,300
We need answers.

365
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,640
I don't have them!

366
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,806
He has them! Must I remind you
that we are men of faith.

367
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,764
He's just a child.

368
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,006
No.

369
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,526
I was just a child, and so were you.

370
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,681
But, he...

371
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,248
He is not just a child.

372
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,405
Come with me, boy.

373
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,842
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

374
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,851
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

375
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,361
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

376
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,170
He restoreth my soul.

377
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,207
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

378
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,100
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

379
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,965
I will fear no evil for thou art with me.

380
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,169
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

381
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,220
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

382
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,120
Thou anointeth my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

383
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,340
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow...

384
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,885
...all the days of my life.

385
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,566
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

386
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,284
Keep on, son. Keep walking.

387
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,925
Keep walking.

388
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,361
Eyes down. Do as I say.
Do as I say. Eyes down.

389
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,321
Nazareth. Right where we left it.

390
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,169
Mother, are we almost there?

391
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,682
Yes, it's just ahead.

392
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,331
Jews!

393
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,126
Stay where you are.

394
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,125
Look at you.

395
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,171
All the Nazarenes that are left
gathered here together

396
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,524
in one courtyard.

397
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,320
Let's crucify them.

398
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,085
We're not guilty of anything.

399
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,325
Not one single rebel among you?
Not one escaped slave?

400
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,764
We can't go back without someone.

401
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,410
- I'll go. Take me.
- No!

402
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,649
I was saved at the river for this.
To die for the family.

403
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,844
No. If someone must go,

404
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,087
it'll be me.

405
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,084
- State my crime.
- It should be me.

406
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,740
You all know why.

407
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,080
I like her idea.

408
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,888
My lords!

409
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,651
Quiet! An old lady speaks.

410
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,321
My lords!

411
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,402
I would bow, my lords,
but I'm too old for that.

412
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,607
And you are young men.

413
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,523
I offer you sweetcakes

414
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,207
and the best wine

415
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,927
from the vineyards of our kindred.

416
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,603
You'd feed an army that's
crucifying your own people?

417
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,762
I'd offer you ambrosia
from the gods of Mount Olympus

418
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,811
and conjure up dancing girls
and woodland nymphs

419
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,327
if you would spare these children
of my father's house.

420
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,402
If you tell me these men
are not bandits and thieves,

421
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,521
I'll believe you.

422
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,082
They've been in Alexandria seven years.

423
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,044
They're craftsmen.

424
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,091
I received a letter only a month ago

425
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,524
that tells of their plan to come here.

426
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,529
You know we have to
put down this rebellion.

427
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,400
It's good wine. It's very good wine.

428
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,530
For the life of my family,
would I give you bad wine?

429
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,401
Take it.

430
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,081
Take it with you.

431
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,771
It's a hard thing you have to do.

432
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,641
Yes.

433
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,601
We leave this village as it is.

434
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,844
I thank you, grandmother.

435
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,445
The Lord bless you and keep you.

436
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,650
The Lord make his face to shine
upon you and be gracious unto you.

437
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,806
The Lord lift up his countenance upon you!

438
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,611
And give you peace.

439
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,567
What would you know about woodland
nymphs and gods who eat ambrosia?

440
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,328
Well, look in the boxes
of scrolls, o curious one.

441
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,008
Do you think my father had no room
in there for Homer and Plato?

442
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,162
Where are the rest
of the people, Old Sarah?

443
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,921
They're hiding in the hills
in the caves, child.

444
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,642
Or in the tunnels. But I'm too old
to go crawling through tunnels.

445
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,286
And besides, the Romans fear the young.

446
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,641
Let us pray they don't come back.

447
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,650
They're Romans. They're everywhere,

448
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,444
protecting a corrupt Jewish king.

449
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,250
How can we pray they don't come back?

450
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,763
Because a messiah is born
who will save us.

451
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,289
His star has been seen.

452
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,048
He lives. He will deliver us.

453
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,002
Amen!

454
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,885
Ooh. Mmm.

455
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,045
Son! Are you here?

456
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,326
There you are. You're all alone.

457
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,446
I was praying. And playing.

458
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,888
I'm sorry. I was supposed to help James.

459
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,728
I think he's climbing a tree somewhere.

460
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,886
Sit.

461
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,209
I know this isn't Alexandria.
Do you miss it?

462
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,648
No. Do you?

463
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,365
I don't think of it like that.

464
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,807
But it was the only home
that you ever knew.

465
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,327
And this is so quiet and isolated.

466
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,403
We're safe here.
No one knows what I've done.

467
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,083
And you must never tell anyone.

468
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,642
I know you have many questions.

469
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,084
But you need to let them sleep
in your heart for now.

470
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,291
Why?

471
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,803
Because your questions
are the questions of a child.

472
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,329
But the answers

473
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,770
are the answers for a man.

474
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,528
That is one bridge I cannot build.

475
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,161
I don't know how.

476
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,001
But God can, and we must trust him.

477
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,761
I do. I trust him for everything.

478
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,440
My boy.

479
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,841
Sit.

480
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,569
Yes, my king.

481
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,330
I give you your mission,
and where are you?

482
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,361
Out crucifying rebels
like some common Roman.

483
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,964
I am vulnerable!

484
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,980
Do you not see that?

485
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,605
Yes, my Lord, I understand.

486
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,600
It's difficult.

487
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,650
Where's the boy?

488
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,724
Where's the boy?

489
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,362
I can't question
every 7-year-old in Israel.

490
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,202
- Ahhh!
- I don't want every 7-year-old!

491
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,446
I want one 7-year-old.

492
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,925
One.

493
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,205
A man came to me today with the story
of a boy that age born in Bethlehem.

494
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,610
He heard a rumor we were looking for one.

495
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,561
Where is he?

496
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,930
I had him crucified.

497
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,685
Seleni...

498
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,601
Oh...

499
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,289
Come with me. Come.

500
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,370
He's down the road.

501
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,089
He's probably still alive.

502
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,601
Come.

503
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,967
This boy, where was his family heading?

504
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,484
He's just like his father.

505
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,100
Who? The boy?

506
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,850
Herod.

507
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,327
I'll give you water. Give him water!

508
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,161
So I can suffer longer?

509
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,730
What then?

510
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,961
Uh-huh.

511
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,728
North. That's all I remember.

512
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,842
Some little town.

513
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,860
Near Galilee?

514
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,041
Aye.

515
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,689
I gave the boy a toy camel.

516
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,020
Why did you go to Herod?

517
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,691
Reward. Blood money.

518
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,244
Don't make me wait.

519
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,300
Brother, you won't mind if I teach him
a thing or two myself, will you?

520
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,528
Since I was almost a scribe.

521
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,286
Your uncle has always
been very imaginative.

522
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,282
These are our sons, Rabbi.
It's time to resume their education.

523
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,441
I know James, your cousin
whom you adopted, but

524
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,248
- who is this?
- Jesus bar Joseph. He's my son.

525
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,606
Everyone here remembers your betrothal.

526
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,448
There are other things we also remember.

527
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,444
The morning your betrothed,
young Mary, came out of the house,

528
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,970
crying about an angel,
upsetting the village.

529
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,610
Rabbi, is it not for his father
to tell him these things in time?

530
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,900
Where was he born?

531
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,331
Bethlehem.

532
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,449
The City of David.

533
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,089
And then you went to Egypt, I understand.

534
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,402
They have good rabbis there, too.

535
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,481
Same old Cleopas.

536
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,969
Look at me, Jesus bar Joseph.

537
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,921
Why did the Phoenicians
cut the hair of Samson?

538
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,408
Forgive me, Rabbi,
but it was not the Phoenicians.

539
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,284
It was the Philistines, and they
cut his hair to make him weak.

540
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,685
Where is Elisha who was taken up
in the chariot?

541
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,167
It was Elijah who was taken up.

542
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,323
Elijah's with the Lord.

543
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,528
Who resides in the Garden of Eden?

544
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,844
No one. There is no one in Eden.

545
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,820
There is no one in Eden writing this

546
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,526
and all the deeds of the world down?

547
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,644
Men say it is Enoch, but Eden is empty,

548
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,203
until the Lord says all the world
will be Eden again.

549
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,962
Why did the Lord break
his covenant with King David?

550
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,482
The Lord does not break his covenants.
The throne is there.

551
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,483
- Where is the King?
- He will come.

552
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,244
And his house will last forever.

553
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,042
Will a carpenter build it?

554
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,211
Yes. There's always a carpenter.

555
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,086
Even the Lord himself
is a carpenter sometimes.

556
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,369
How is the Lord a carpenter?

557
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,001
Tell me.

558
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,966
Didn't the Lord himself
tell Noah how to build the ark?

559
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,450
What kind of wood to use,
and how it should be pitched?

560
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,260
And wasn't it the Lord

561
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,445
who granted the vision
of the new Temple to Prophet Ezekiel

562
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,890
with the dimensions of the galleries,
the gates, the altar?

563
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,563
Yes, it was.

564
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,166
And when the Lord made the world,
wasn't wisdom there like a master craftsman?

565
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,090
If wisdom is not the Lord, what is wisdom?

566
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,443
And when Cyrus the Persian decreed
that we could return to our Holy Land,

567
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,820
the carpenters came home to build the
Temple as the Lord said it should be built.

568
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,967
And how...

569
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,847
This is a good child.

570
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,971
I like this child.

571
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,205
School tomorrow morning.

572
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,601
Ah...

573
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,011
Let me edify you.

574
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,450
Whilst Mary was weaving the veils
for the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem,

575
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,924
I studied with the Pharisees.
Some of the best ones, too.

576
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,300
And some maybe not so good.

577
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,845
Like some of the students.

578
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,140
Sometimes I amaze myself
at what I might have done...

579
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,241
Son?

580
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,900
...had I not gone off to Egypt.

581
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,126
Son, are you all right?

582
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,484
Your hand, it's very warm. Son! Son!

583
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,645
I think I could've been a prophet.
Joseph, what do you...

584
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,084
It's the fever.
Riba, get more water and rags.

585
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,321
Dear God, heal my child, I beg you.

586
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,529
May your love and compassion
shine upon your blessed child

587
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,682
and spare him from suffering.

588
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,731
Please forgive the sins
for we have this day.

589
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,607
Send a word from his righteous path...

590
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,570
You are no child.

591
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,160
Who are you?

592
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,885
Why don't you dwell

593
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,730
in the house of the Lord in Jerusalem?

594
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,089
Answer me!

595
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,602
You don't know the answers.

596
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,406
You don't know what's going
to happen, do you?

597
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,447
You don't know how it's going to end.

598
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,400
Who are you?

599
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,285
- I demand you tell me!
- Don't touch me!

600
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,124
Never, ever lay your hands on me.

601
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:16,410
Or what, angel child?

602
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,929
I'll drop dead?

603
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,006
Let me show you your precious Jerusalem

604
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,920
last Passover.

605
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,445
Is that it?

606
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,603
Is that all you can do?

607
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,370
I'm watching you, angel boy.

608
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,804
So, go on, walk like a child,

609
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,841
talk like a child,

610
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,642
play like a child when I'm watching.

611
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,001
I may not know the future,
but I know this.

612
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,325
Your mother's a whore.

613
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,410
Your father's a liar.

614
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,240
And the floors of your house are dirt.

615
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,041
Your cause is lost.

616
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,281
Every day and every hour it's lost,
and you know it.

617
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,650
Your little miracles can't save
these foolish people.

618
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,888
I tell you, chaos rules!

619
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,804
And I am its prince!

620
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,620
What are you doing out of bed?

621
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,881
I'm all better.

622
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,660
You have to rest.

623
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,250
No.

624
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,885
I want to go to Jerusalem for Passover.

625
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,090
It's dangerous.

626
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,564
Herod, the Romans,

627
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,442
Jerusalem, the Temple.

628
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,768
It's been purified. It's calm for now.

629
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,567
There's no time. We haven't prepared.

630
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,965
We can manage it.

631
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,249
That's not all I mean. I'm not prepared.

632
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,523
This path that he's on,
I don't know where it leads,

633
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,127
except that his enemies will be there.

634
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,963
Such fierce enemies.

635
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,203
Why did God choose me?

636
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,842
What if I'm not strong enough?

637
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,048
You're the brave and shining girl

638
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:02,322
who protected her infant son from an army
that was dedicated to murdering him.

639
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,290
It is they who should fear you.

640
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,688
You've taken on so much.

641
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,010
That you married me and took Jesus
as your son truly is a miracle.

642
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,168
One that only God will ever know.

643
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,885
Not really,

644
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,850
except for me.

645
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,563
I thank God for choosing me every day.

646
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,721
Every day.

647
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,846
We're going, Sarah. We're going
to Jerusalem for Passover.

648
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,567
Yes, yes, as you must.

649
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,482
- Thank you.
- Come on, brother!

650
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,060
Let's go! Before my naptime.

651
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,122
Was there a boy about seven
or eight years old with them?

652
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,620
Yes, there was.

653
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,960
When was this?

654
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,126
Just after the uprising in Sepphoris.
We were establishing order.

655
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,763
It's a bloody business,

656
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,044
- establishing order.
- Yes, sir.

657
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,964
And what of this family?
Did you establish order?

658
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,000
They appeared innocent.

659
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,325
We left them untouched.

660
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,561
Was that before or after
they gave you the wine?

661
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,921
Hmm?

662
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,050
Your own men won't even lie for you.

663
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,684
We're going. Move!

664
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,089
Back for more cakes and wine?

665
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,641
We're looking for the family
recently arrived from Egypt.

666
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,889
Gone to Jerusalem for Passover.

667
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,405
Is the boy with them?

668
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,444
We have many boys in our family.

669
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,169
The boy born in Bethlehem.
The boy who's seven.

670
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,450
If my memory serves,

671
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,300
all the boys that age born in Bethlehem

672
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,006
were slaughtered by Herod's soldiers.

673
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,571
Or perhaps I'm wrong.
Perhaps they were Roman soldiers.

674
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,241
Perhaps they seek a boy
because they ran out of girls.

675
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,241
There are plenty of girls. Plenty.

676
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,328
And children die easily. What's the name?

677
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,921
What's the boy's name?

678
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,245
Jesus bar Joseph.

679
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,131
Jesus bar Joseph of Nazareth.

680
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,770
What have I done?

681
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,169
Who is this child?

682
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,320
Tell me, who is he?

683
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,123
I asked Father about going
to Jerusalem for Passover, too.

684
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,646
Then you ask, and suddenly we all go.

685
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,820
I didn't know that.

686
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,524
There's plenty you don't know.

687
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,167
You're the only one who really matters.

688
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,767
That's not true. Everybody loves you.

689
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,849
- I'm mean.
- You're not mean to me.

690
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,920
Yes I am! I hated you when you were born.

691
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,722
I hated you before you were born.

692
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,169
Everything changed.

693
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,842
There were angels and three nobles.
The ones in Bethlehem.

694
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,726
These three noblemen
from the east arrived to see you.

695
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,243
Everyone in Bethlehem saw them come.

696
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,366
They believed in magic. They read stars.

697
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,003
And they advised the kings of Persia
what they should do.

698
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,730
They said they followed
a great star in the heavens

699
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,482
to that house where we were staying.

700
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,165
They called you king, and their
servants laid gifts in front of you.

701
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:21,040
Gold and other things. I don't remember.

702
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,801
Looks like you two found
something to talk about.

703
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,367
Here. Have some water.

704
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,202
A little shower would be nice to cool off.

705
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,049
Come on, on your feet now.

706
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,641
So why did we have to leave Bethlehem?

707
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,010
Don't ask me anymore.

708
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,650
Thanks for talking to me.

709
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,850
Don't make it rain. I know you can.

710
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,660
I told you not to!

711
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,331
I didn't. I didn't!

712
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,926
Come on!

713
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,127
Father!

714
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,527
I found a cave.

715
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,801
Travelers!

716
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,483
We seek a family from Nazareth,
with a boy of seven

717
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,490
named Jesus bar Joseph.

718
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,164
If you know such a family,
and you know this child,

719
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,966
then tell us

720
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,207
and Rome will reward you.

721
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,731
They know who we are and where we're from.
They're offering money.

722
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,900
- We have to turn around.
- But we can't go home.

723
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,180
If they don't find us in Jerusalem,
they'll go to Nazareth.

724
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,620
We'll live in caves.

725
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,165
- I hate living in caves!
- Shh.

726
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,722
She's right. We can't go.

727
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,380
She's just a woman.

728
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,686
And she's right!

729
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,408
Tomorrow we go back.
The Essenes will help us.

730
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,245
We can find a way.

731
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,082
Not the Essenes.

732
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,245
At least the Romans are rational,
you can deal with them, but the Essenes?

733
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,247
They live in the wilderness
with hyenas and crazy people.

734
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,206
Maybe it's the water or too much sun
on their hairy heads, but...

735
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,166
Lord Father in heaven,
guide me on this path.

736
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,968
Watch over my family
and calm their hearts.

737
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,006
When I enter your temple,
please take my questions

738
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,687
that I might receive your answers.

739
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,688
Your will be done. Amen.

740
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,521
Well?

741
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,451
- He's gone.
- Gone?

742
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,980
Could someone have taken him?

743
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,206
That's impossible.

744
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,206
We were here.

745
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,609
I could've told you he'd go!

746
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,571
Because you decided to turn back!

747
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:17,122
He wants answers,
and you won't give him any!

748
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,249
That's why he wants to go for Passover.

749
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,460
We have to find him.
Mary and I will go ahead.

750
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,562
The rest of you
follow with the pack animals.

751
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,641
You there with the donkey.

752
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,807
- Name.
- Eli.

753
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,300
Where are you from?

754
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,401
Jericho.

755
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,005
Your name.

756
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,020
Name!

757
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,246
He can't speak.

758
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,410
He's been that way since birth.

759
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,323
Go. Go to your temple.

760
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,207
You are alone?

761
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,050
It's all I can give you.

762
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:42,321
God be with you and watch over you.

763
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,611
Thank you.

764
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,766
This bird is no good. I tell you, no good!

765
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,649
The priest won't accept it. It's flawed.

766
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,326
I don't have any more money.
Please, I need to exchange it.

767
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,686
Come on, get away from here.

768
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,286
How can you cheat me
in the Temple in front of God?

769
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,124
I have to have a sacrifice!

770
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,763
Little boy, do you want a bird?
A flawed bird!

771
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,281
Huh?

772
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,442
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

773
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,521
Anything else?

774
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,481
It's no good, you know.

775
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,964
- It can fly.
- Tell it to a rabbi.

776
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,481
Where are they?

777
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,007
Over there, in Solomon's Portico.

778
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,122
This time I want one that is unblemished.
Do you hear me?

779
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,681
He's here.

780
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,205
He's in the Temple.

781
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,767
The Spirit of the Lord will be with him

782
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,600
to give him understanding,
wisdom and insight.

783
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,607
He will be powerful.

784
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,660
And he will know and honor the Lord.

785
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,206
His greatest joy will be to obey the Lord.

786
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,443
Yes! We have a real student here.

787
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,604
Now, isn't that wonderful! Come. Sit.

788
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,001
Ah...

789
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,602
Tell me, what does a boy want with me?

790
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:41,921
Mmm?

791
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,602
- Rabbi, about seven years ago...
- Mmm-hmm.

792
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,009
...a boy was born
in a stable in Bethlehem.

793
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,201
Three magi came from the east
and gave him gifts.

794
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,125
Yes, I know this tale well.

795
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,642
What happened to the boy after that?

796
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,450
No one talks about it.

797
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,568
- Why do you want to know?
- It's all I can think of.

798
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,210
It's why I've come from Nazareth.

799
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,811
It's as you said.

800
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,820
Those three magi visited Old Herod,

801
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,161
the one they called Herod the Great.

802
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,020
He told those three kings

803
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,646
to return once they had found the child.

804
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,720
The magi never returned to Herod.

805
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,251
However,

806
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,682
when Herod found out
that he had been deceived

807
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,442
and that they had found the child,
he went into a rage.

808
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,925
Such a rage, beyond hell.

809
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,283
He sent his soldiers in the night...

810
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,244
...to kill every child under two.

811
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,211
Not one survived. Not one.

812
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:12,164
Think of it, an army of men
to slaughter infants.

813
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,725
Son, it's over.

814
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,487
It's a long time ago.

815
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,886
I should never have told you. I forgot
you're such a little boy with a heart.

816
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,041
Here, son, take it.

817
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,648
- He's here.
- Where?

818
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,442
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

819
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,809
The boy, he's here.

820
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,291
He's yours.

821
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,005
By the blind rabbi. Look.

822
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:07,921
Go!

823
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,769
Thank you, Rabbi.

824
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,961
I'll remember you.

825
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,602
- Here?
- Outside.

826
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,644
We'll do it quietly.

827
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,401
A miracle! It's a miracle. I can see!

828
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:15,900
What's the matter?

829
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,580
I can see!

830
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,205
Praise God!

831
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,203
God, I can see!

832
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,761
The boy...

833
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,841
Where's the boy? Where is he?

834
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,766
Is it you? And you?

835
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,846
Out.

836
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,047
He was here! He was here beside me.

837
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,043
Please, help me find the boy.
The boy was here!

838
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,441
Did you do that?

839
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,130
Yes.

840
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,966
Who are you?

841
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,688
You saved me once before.

842
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,091
It was you.

843
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,049
You were also at Bethlehem.

844
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,083
How could you know that?

845
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,764
Is that him? Is that the boy?

846
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,401
No, no, no, no. It's not him.
Keep looking, keep looking.

847
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,570
On your way! Go on, it's not him.

848
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,570
Severus! Severus!

849
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,922
Back! Back! Back!

850
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,140
Go on! Go on! Away!

851
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,241
It's not him!

852
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,482
Keep looking! On your way. Go! Go!

853
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,324
- Son! Son!
- That's my son!

854
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,166
Son!

855
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,609
I've come to take him home.

856
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,806
Let us out! Let us out of the Temple!

857
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,860
Romans, leave our temple! Leave us!

858
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,645
Romans, out of our temple!

859
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,201
Go.

860
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,566
All of you.

861
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,721
Go.

862
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,160
He's dead.

863
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,380
I killed him.

864
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,891
You killed him?

865
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,688
I wanted to meet this miracle worker.

866
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,762
The Son of Man, the...

867
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,251
The Wonder-Counselor, the Prince of Peace.

868
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,129
The little boy who can make
the dead breathe and the blind see.

869
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,288
Why did you kill him, Centurion?

870
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,921
Your orders.

871
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,125
Your orders.

872
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,489
You said it was like...

873
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,446
Like Bethlehem.

874
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,685
How did you do it?

875
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,967
Strangling? Knife under the ribs?

876
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,930
Head against a rock?

877
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,804
Did the thunder come?

878
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,683
Did the heavens weep?

879
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,445
Did you hear that?

880
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,331
- What, sir?
- That.

881
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,485
That. Can't you hear that?

882
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,369
- Hear what?
- That hissing!

883
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:58,530
It's a serpent or a snake!

884
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,490
- There's no snake.
- There is!

885
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:15,402
There is. Of course there is.
I need useful men around me!

886
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,362
I was just 14 when you were born.

887
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,090
A girl really.

888
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,369
Tell me about the angel.

889
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,331
Of course. I knew you'd ask that.

890
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,163
But listen well, because I'm only
going to tell this story once.

891
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,570
I was a good girl,

892
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:58,405
strictly raised and betrothed to Joseph.

893
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:06,089
When one morning
my room filled with light.

894
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,204
It was white light

895
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:16,926
like the sun, but with no heat or pain.

896
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,964
It was pure

897
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,084
like the air itself was glowing.

898
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,969
I saw a figure

899
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,366
larger than a man,
but like a man, inside the light.

900
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,842
And it spoke to me. It said,

901
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,607
"Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee."

902
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,686
I had found favor with the Lord,
and I was blessed among women.

903
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:02,766
It said that from my womb
would come a son.

904
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,806
You.

905
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,325
Named Jesus.

906
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,970
This is nice.

907
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,964
You're getting so big we won't be able
to do this much longer.

908
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,122
Go on with the story.

909
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,380
Oh...

910
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:43,326
I said I had never been with a man.

911
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,807
So the angel said that the Holy Spirit
would come over me,

912
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,686
and that I would give
birth to a Holy Child.

913
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,486
I answered, "I am a servant of the Lord.

914
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,964
"Let it be done."

915
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:03,566
What did Joseph say?

916
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,050
Yes, that was a worry.

917
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,209
But an angel also came to him
and told him everything.

918
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,727
Then, is the angel...

919
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,683
No. No.

920
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,042
The angel is not your father.

921
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,765
God is.

922
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,409
God is your father.

923
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,407
But we're all children of God.

924
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,049
Yes. Yes, we are.

925
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,011
But you...

926
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,249
You are begotten of God.

927
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,686
That is why you can make dead birds fly,

928
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,446
the sick well, the blind see,

929
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,605
and why you were able
to make Eleazer live again.

930
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:15,340
He's made you a child to grow in wisdom

931
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,442
as well as in all other things.

932
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,180
Keep your power inside you,

933
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:28,727
until your father in heaven
shows you the time to use it.

934
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,562
He did not give you to a scribe

935
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,048
a rabbi or a king.

936
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,804
He gave you to Joseph bar Jacob,
the carpenter,

937
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,009
and me, his betrothed,

938
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,481
to raise you until that time.

939
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,161
I've learned so much since leaving Egypt.

940
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,486
I know everything I can for today.

941
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,048
I even know I'm going to die.

942
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,850
I used to wonder
if angels would come to me,

943
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,849
if they would sing to me,

944
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,042
if they would fill my dreams.

945
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,009
There is still so much that I don't know,

946
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,688
but I do know this.

947
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:42,651
I don't think I'm here to see angels
or to hear them sing.

948
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,940
And I don't think I'm here

949
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:50,489
to make it rainy or sunny
or anything like that.

950
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,929
I think I'm here just to be alive.

951
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,649
To see it, hear it, feel it,

952
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,041
all of it.

953
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,885
Even when it hurts.

954
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,330
Someday you will tell me
why else I'm here.

955
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,004
I don't know when, but you will.

956
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,046
I know that.

957
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,765
Because, Father,

958
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,450
I am your child.
