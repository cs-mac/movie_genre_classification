{1017}{1112}< The Tiger And The Snow >
{3822}{3904}Dear Attilio,|we are all gathered here together...
{3909}{4009}Who's the half-wit who left his car outside?
{4069}{4139}- That’s mine.|- Well you can't leave it there
{4144}{4192}- Ten Minutes!|- Too long.
{4202}{4257}- Five!|- No more than five.
{4322}{4390}In five minutes I'm going to clamp you!
{4394}{4463}Gang of loonies, here every bloody night...
{4468}{4541}This woman has something to say to you.
{4630}{4727}Attilio De Giovanni,
{4732}{4843}I sing your name,|it opens the gates of Paradise.
{4852}{4924}You will be mine forever,|so grant me gods.
{4932}{5009}When you kiss me, the Four Horsemen|of the Apocalypse gallop forth
{5014}{5098}and when I think of your body,|so troubled and vague,
{5103}{5150}the ground opens beneath my feet.
{5157}{5232}Your divine manhood ascends to heaven,
{5245}{5285}you're beautiful!
{5294}{5357}You sunflower crazed by light,
{5362}{5446}when you raise your eyes you|set the sky ablaze.
{5458}{5529}Friends, see how the Earth,
{5534}{5622}like a mother,|gives suck to her most precious child.
{5651}{5739}Oh my beloved,|all creation overflows with passion,
{5744}{5843}and like a golden comet in the sky,|from my mouth burst forth this cry.
{5848}{5878}I love you.
{5980}{6033}I want to make love to you now.
{6059}{6156}That’s the best line|I ever heard in my life.
{6930}{6958}Still not here?
{6963}{6996}No.
{7064}{7098}Here he is!
{7152}{7226}- On the dot!|- You're 20 minutes late, Daddy!
{7231}{7332}- Yes, 20 minutes on the dot.|- You couldn't find the car?
{7337}{7411}- Hi Carla, everything okay?|- Fine, thanks.
{7416}{7513}I have a programme and tomorrow|I'll have them at school at 9:00 sharp.
{7518}{7577}- At 8:30!|- I know.
{7582}{7652}- I'll remind him.|- I'll remember all right!
{7657}{7690}Mamma doesn't trust you.
{7708}{7741}She doesn't trust me?
{7746}{7776}She doesn't trust you.
{7781}{7871}- Where are we going?|- A surprise!
{8023}{8091}- Sure I'm not hurting him?|- Course you are not.
{8096}{8140}Shall I wash his feet too?
{8145}{8190}I honestly couldn't care less.
{8195}{8257}Still the same guy, what’s-his-name?
{8262}{8355}Yes, Francesco Verri,|he's not even in my class.
{8362}{8450}- The less I see him the better.|- Is he really that bad?
{8458}{8513}Very bad, hateful
{8521}{8568}- Hateful?|- Hateful.
{8583}{8642}- In other words, you love him.|- Yes.
{8650}{8709}- A lot?|- Lots and lots.
{8726}{8800}- Emilia, Daddy!|- Rosa!
{8805}{8828}Hang on!
{8834}{8929}- The best camel driver ever.|- What a fantastic present!
{8934}{9023}Thank the director here, thanks Camillo.
{9028}{9084}Now we're in Rome I hope|we'll see you more often.
{9089}{9131}- Want to have a go?|- Me?
{9137}{9237}- You're scared.|- Daddy's not scared of anything.
{9273}{9307}He's all right?
{9312}{9353}- Does he spit?|- No.
{9425}{9511}This is great,|how do you get him to stand up?
{9581}{9636}It’s twice as high as a horse!
{9662}{9697}No seat belt!
{9724}{9761}How about that then, eh?
{9784}{9827}Just when I'm on a camel!
{9863}{9889}Attorney!
{9894}{9937}You've got the hearing this morning.
{9944}{10031}For the furniture you shouldn't have sold,
{10038}{10083}ignoring a summons back in '98...
{10088}{10159}I can't right now, can we do it tomorrow?
{10164}{10270}You've got to be here within three minutes|or they'll sentence you!
{10275}{10365}Three minutes, make that two!
{10372}{10418}Down, boy.
{10422}{10462}Slowly.
{10478}{10550}Ubruk!
{10590}{10637}How about that?
{10650}{10721}Camels may be smelly, but they're smart.
{11088}{11134}- What’s that?|- A bat!
{11159}{11206}Get down, keep down!
{11222}{11320}It’s casing the joint,|let’s see what it’s up to!
{11422}{11473}Let’s get under the bed.
{11490}{11529}Go away, beastly bat!
{11534}{11588}Don't say that.
{11599}{11694}You'll offend it if you call it a|beastly bar, you've got to be nice.
{11734}{11828}Oh bat, sweet creature of the night,
{11837}{11901}you'll find the window on your right!
{11998}{12019}"What luck!"
{12024}{12122}That’s what poetry's all about,|you called it a beastly bat...
{12131}{12159}It always works.
{12164}{12226}I was shaving in the bathroom yesterday.
{12231}{12263}A spider climbed in
{12268}{12331}and I said to it,|"Spider dear, get out of here".
{12336}{12419}- It went!|- And if you find a mouse?
{12424}{12501}"Mr. Mouse, leave this house"|then run for it.
{12511}{12570}Will you teach me to write nice poems?
{12578}{12637}How did you become a poet?
{12642}{12669}How do you start?
{12674}{12768}I was small, younger than you are now,|eight or nine.
{12776}{12874}I was with my mother,|I loved her so much...
{12882}{13006}We were at Uncle Giustino's|and there was a wood.
{13012}{13089}- Do you know what happened?|- What?
{13103}{13257}A little bird flew by,|singing, flying lower...
{13289}{13323}and lower.
{13409}{13468}He landed right here on my shoulder.
{13488}{13537}I swear!
{13545}{13598}He'd chosen me, of all people.
{13603}{13684}I was afraid he'd fly away,|so I pretended to be a tree,
{13690}{13730}I didn't move a muscle.
{13867}{13970}I started to feel my heart beating,|thumping actually.
{14008}{14053}- And then?|- It flew away.
{14058}{14117}I wanted to tell my mother.
{14124}{14221}"Mamma, a little bird, flying and singing...
{14232}{14323}landed on my shoulder|and sat there for an hour. "
{14331}{14429}She said, "I thought something awful|happened" and carried on chatting.
{14436}{14501}That was mean of Granny,|didn't she like birds?
{14506}{14590}No, Granny wasn't mean,|and she did like little birds.
{14598}{14663}It wasn't her, it was me.
{14674}{14747}It was my fault for not telling|the story properly,
{14757}{14829}for not making her feel what I'd felt.
{14847}{14893}I was so upset I told myself,
{14898}{14997}"There must be people whose job|it is to use the right words,
{15006}{15055}put things in a way...
{15060}{15145}who when their hearts beats,|can get other people's hearts to beat. "
{15161}{15211}That day I decided to become a poet.
{15241}{15341}- My heart beat.|- Mine too, but Granny's didn't.
{15350}{15425}If the words aren't right, nothing's right.
{15437}{15533}If I say now, "go to sleep",|those are the right words.
{15538}{15623}- And if another bat comes in?|- Off to bed with you.
{15628}{15686}I've got to get you to school|at 9:00 tomorrow.
{15693}{15725}At 8:30!
{15730}{15821}I know.
{15950}{16018}Oh my beloved,|all creation overflows with passions,
{16023}{16113}and like a golden comet in the sky,|from my mouth bursts forth this cry,
{16123}{16149}I love you!
{16154}{16293}My love, I want to stay|with you here forever,
{16301}{16339}for all eternity.
{16352}{16410}Don't you have to take|the girls to school at 8:30?
{16449}{16509}Give me five minutes, be right back.
{16702}{16772}You don't remember|where I left the car, do you?
{16801}{16872}- Same bloody car parked outside...|- It’s mine, I'll move it.
{16877}{16925}Five minutes.
{16950}{17020}Come along, don't hang around,
{17025}{17062}take your time.
{17067}{17146}Don't start writing love poems,
{17153}{17227}they're the hardest,|wait till you're at least 80.
{17232}{17375}Write about something else, the sea,|the wind, a radiator,
{17380}{17477}a tram running late,|no one thing's more poetic than another.
{17490}{17551}Poetry isn't without, it’s within.
{17556}{17637}Don't ask what’s poetic or true,|look in the mirror, poetry's you.
{17662}{17745}Dress your poems up,|choose your words carefully,
{17750}{17853}be selective, some things you need|eight months to find one word.
{17858}{17933}Beauty started when people began to choose,
{17938}{17964}since Adam and Eve.
{17969}{18081}You know how long Eve took|to pick the right fig leaf?
{18095}{18222}How about this one? She stripped bare|all the fig trees in Paradise.
{18227}{18342}Fall in love,|if you don't love it’s all dead!
{18347}{18394}Fall in love and|everything will come to life.
{18398}{18501}Squander yourjoy,|dissipate your cheerfulness.
{18506}{18578}Be sad and silent with enthusiasm,
{18583}{18661}hurl your happiness into people's faces.
{18669}{18762}And how? Let me look at my notes,|I've forgotten.
{18769}{18814}That’s what you should do.
{18826}{18865}I can't read 'em.
{18919}{19008}To convey happiness you must be happy,
{19013}{19089}to convey pain you must to happy.
{19112}{19203}Be happy, you must suffer!|Don't be scared of suffering,
{19208}{19270}the whole world suffers!
{19305}{19396}If you don't have the means, don't worry,
{19401}{19454}only one thing is necessary|to write poetry, everything.
{19459}{19559}Don't try to be modern,|it’s the most old-fashioned thing there is.
{19567}{19652}If a line doesn't come to|you in this position,
{19670}{19739}chuck yourself on the ground like this!
{19777}{19851}It’s lying down that you see the sky.
{19857}{19896}Why didn't I do that before?
{19928}{20001}What are you looking at?|Poets don't look, they see.
{20006}{20052}Make words obey you.
{20063}{20164}If the world "wall"|doesn't take any notice,
{20170}{20234}don't use it again for eight years,|that’ll teach it.
{20239}{20283}What’s that? No idea!
{20295}{20348}That’s true beauty, like those lines there,
{20353}{20410}that I want left there forever.
{20415}{20485}Erase it all, we've got to start,|the lesson's over.
{20490}{20544}See you Wednesday... Thursday.
{20555}{20611}Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
{20734}{20792}The room's all yours, Professor Browning.
{20805}{20857}Thank you Signor De Giovanni.
{20981}{21049}Please don't, I'll do it.
{21099}{21149}Still having problems with the principal?
{21154}{21278}Lots, about the course,|I'd like to discuss it with you.
{21358}{21406}Can we sleep together tonight?
{21479}{21508}Nancy!
{21513}{21580}Last time we slept together it snowed,
{21586}{21661}it was the coldest|most beautiful day in January.
{21810}{21891}- Lets sleep together.|- The kids'll be back.
{21896}{21947}It’s laying down that you see the sky.
{21952}{21999}Don't you like me anymore?
{22204}{22269}I had such a wonderful time with you,
{22274}{22341}why did you want to cut it so short?
{22359}{22420}When I fell in love with you...
{22425}{22515}I fell in love with you|because you fell in love with me.
{22520}{22586}And a wonderful fall it was.
{22594}{22633}What are you doing this evening?
{22662}{22745}- Nothing.|- Let’s sleep together tonight.
{22777}{22833}Attilio, we've gotta go.
{22838}{22886}Hi Ermanno.
{22893}{22947}Do you remember where I left the car?
{22959}{23052}- Near the entrance.|- Thank you, Nancy.
{23110}{23188}Knock-knock, I look through the peep-hole,|all I see is hair.
{23193}{23327}I open the door and a bear says,|"Hello Ermanno, give me a Kiss. "
{23342}{23381}I ask, "Who are you?"
{23386}{23461}And she, "Don't you recognize me, my son?"
{23486}{23509}No!
{23534}{23565}And she starts crying.
{23570}{23674}I say, "I'm sorry, Mamma",|and put my arms around her,
{23681}{23749}then this morning|when I woke up I felt so happy.
{23754}{23849}- Your mother was a bear?|- I'd just never realized it before.
{23854}{23939}I kept dreaming about vultures,|hyenas, crocodiles...
{23961}{23994}Good for you.
{23999}{24053}I always have the same dream.
{24058}{24097}The same animal?
{24105}{24140}No, no animal at all.
{24146}{24200}I'm at a kind of wedding|with lots of people,
{24205}{24308}and then in she walks,|the woman I'm crazy about.
{24313}{24388}She ends up telling me,|"I want to make love with you, kiss me. "
{24393}{24436}So what do you do?
{24455}{24497}I pass out.
{24506}{24572}- It’s wonderful.|- What kind of animal is she?
{24590}{24656}It’s her, the love of my life.
{24661}{24709}What kind of a dream is that?
{24718}{24847}It’s like saying I like cherries|and in my dream I eat cherries.
{24858}{24923}It denotes a primitive subconscious.
{24934}{25009}- A Dream that won't come true?|- Come true!
{25014}{25106}If I like a woman,|I dream about her in a symbolic fashion,
{25111}{25199}she's a penguin bearing|the mythological baggage of penguins,
{25204}{25296}or she's a iguana, that’s a mature dream.
{25301}{25366}- You think?|- What, me? Sigmund Freud thinks so.
{25412}{25440}Freud.
{25458}{25494}Dream about an animal?
{25608}{25679}Right on time, just starting.
{25838}{25925}Love thou thy dream,|all base love scorning.
{25945}{26022}Love thou the wind, and here take warning.
{26038}{26148}That dreams alone can truly be.|For this dream I come to thee.
{26222}{26298}He's the greatest living Arab poet.|Beautiful that poem, eh?
{26303}{26353}- Rips you apart.|- Sure does.
{26385}{26435}You'll hear the rest.
{26442}{26537}Fuad concluded with a homage to one|of his inspirational mentors.
{26550}{26609}Fuad, in these difficult days|for his home country,
{26614}{26693}decided to leave France|and go back to Baghdad.
{26706}{26823}Let’s hope this senseless war|never breaks out.
{26830}{26894}Let’s thank Fuad, goodbye to all.
{26954}{27013}Damn, I think it’s over!
{27023}{27101}- Shall we go eat?|- I want to go and say hello to him.
{27106}{27142}Fuad, remember that name.
{27147}{27246}In four, five years' time,|he'll get the Nobel Prize.
{27251}{27336}It’ll be a wrench to leave|Paris after 18 years...
{27341}{27430}- When will you go back to Baghdad?|- As soon as possible.
{27445}{27503}How much time do you need|to finish the book?
{27508}{27603}The publishers want it in September,|but I refuse to rush.
{27608}{27661}I'd like to spend at least|a week with you.
{27666}{27693}We'll find the time.
{27698}{27774}Goodbye, see you soon.
{27830}{27860}Attilio!
{27874}{27909}- Fuad!|- Where were you?
{27918}{28032}Back there, I got here a bit late|but I enjoyed the whole thing.
{28050}{28153}You've got fans here,|when I quoted you at the start
{28158}{28221}they all cheered, did you hear it?
{28255}{28283}Vittoria!
{28288}{28319}Your book.
{28330}{28361}Oh, thank you.
{28558}{28583}I'm losing my mind.
{28588}{28691}- Do you have time for dinner?|- Let’s have dinner together.
{28696}{28743}Then I'll leave you to it.
{28793}{28830}Goodbye.
{28846}{28927}Dear Attilio, it’s as|if no time has passed at all.
{28982}{29009}Attilio?
{29014}{29079}Fuad, thanks, I'll say goodbye then.
{29084}{29118}Goodbye, Fuad, goodbye.
{29122}{29202}- When are you leaving?|- Right after dinner.
{29207}{29255}Plenty of time!
{29260}{29331}Love you.
{29338}{29443}- What about dinner?|- Sure, any time.
{29456}{29541}- You coming to eat then?|- Sure, any time.
{30418}{30498}- I came here to have tea by myself.|- So did I.
{30503}{30622}We can have it together! Two teas.
{30669}{30758}Mr. Poet Attilio De Giovanni,|there's absolutely no question.
{30770}{30844}I don't want to disturb you, heaven forbid.
{30878}{30953}Since we don't see each other often...
{30958}{30999}You see,
{31015}{31081}the two of us, not immediately...
{31127}{31216}Why do you keep pestering me?
{31221}{31284}Haven't you got anything else|to think about?
{31296}{31397}Me think about you?|Whoever thinks about you?
{31426}{31498}Someone said they even saw you in Verona!
{31502}{31555}No, wait!
{31560}{31647}What’s that? Me, in Verona?
{31653}{31702}- Who told you that?|- Settembrini.
{31710}{31760}He saw you outside my hotel for hours.
{31765}{31839}Listen, I was not in Verona.
{31844}{31922}Why on Earth should|I care if you're in Verona
{31927}{31981}or Piazza dell'Esquilino?
{31989}{32047}I don't believe it, you were there too?
{32052}{32163}I never know where you are|and I don't care.
{32284}{32369}Why don't you come to my place?
{32382}{32453}To see where I live,
{32462}{32542}sleep, read, write, wash the dishes.
{32547}{32669}Come on, let’s walk round Rome,|you can come over and...
{32680}{32728}We can be together.
{32754}{32800}Yes? Huh?
{32805}{32897}You tell me who's speaking, you called me.
{32922}{32956}Valeri who?
{32961}{33019}Yes, I was at Fuaïs, why?
{33075}{33123}In fact, this jacket isn't mine.
{33141}{33178}This phone isn't either!
{33183}{33308}This jacket is five times too big,|yours must be too small.
{33314}{33350}Pay more attention!
{33355}{33436}He took my jacket instead of his.
{33441}{33560}I can't, I'm in a meeting.
{33592}{33626}Yes, okay.
{33633}{33781}I'm in the bar round the corner,|but right away, I'm busy.
{34453}{34497}Signor Valeri, over here,
{34505}{34564}how did you mistake my jacket for yours?
{34571}{34656}- It’s three sizes larger!|- Yes in fact, I didn't...
{34661}{34770}Signor Valeri mistook my jacket for his.
{34776}{34868}- Didn't you realize it was tight?|- I didn't put it on.
{34873}{34960}Now I know why you didn't realize it.
{34966}{35038}All's well that ends well, goodbye.
{35044}{35140}Some people are so scatter-brained.
{35149}{35198}He hardly knew what to say,
{35203}{35281}at one point he said, I love you,
{35301}{35363}I dream of you every night,|let’s get married.
{35374}{35429}What would you have said?
{35445}{35497}- The check, please.|- No, let me.
{35502}{35546}- Thanks.|- Don't mention it.
{35575}{35605}Vittoria!
{35638}{35706}How much is it?
{35722}{35766}Keep the change.
{35774}{35831}The tea had absolutely no taste.
{36202}{36254}I want to see where you wash your dishes,
{36267}{36317}take me home.
{37553}{37621}"SURPRISE!"
{39061}{39145}- Let’s walk up, I prefer it.|- Me too.
{39157}{39237}"I've walked down millions of|stairs holding your arm,
{39242}{39320}now you're no longer here,|there's a void beneath every step. "
{39329}{39441}- Dammit, I tripped...|- Serves you right.
{39446}{39515}We're here, this is me.
{39534}{39640}I trip on that wretched step every day.
{39654}{39686}Go ahead.
{39928}{39968}Please do come in, Vittoria.
{39973}{40083}Here we are,|Vittoria and I together at home...
{40097}{40179}I always leave the candles on.
{40212}{40287}And the television.
{40377}{40467}I always like to have things ready|in case Vittoria comes...
{40472}{40571}I'll go make some coffee,
{40576}{40674}I'll make you some too,|it won't take a sec...
{40763}{40789}What’s the matter?
{40794}{40870}Nothing, I just burnt myself slightly.
{40875}{40985}- The coffee is ready?|- I make it in case Vittoria comes.
{40994}{41021}Have a seat.
{41026}{41074}It was coming to the boil as we came in.
{41100}{41124}Here.
{41129}{41187}I always like to tell the truth.
{41196}{41263}Seeing you sitting here|at night alone with me,
{41269}{41359}drinking coffee, it makes my heart race.
{41418}{41450}You're so beautiful!
{41462}{41556}Women are so beautiful|when they're about to make love.
{41591}{41686}Why not live together|for the rest of our lives? It’s easy.
{41700}{41758}As easy as seeing a tiger in the snow.
{41765}{41821}When I do, we will be together forever.
{41830}{41912}Off to Tibet with us then,|it always snows on tigers there.
{41922}{41953}But we live in Rome.
{41958}{42028}Snow falling on a tiger in Rome!
{42043}{42079}I get it.
{42096}{42189}Please stay and sleep with me.
{42194}{42273}You've got a man here who loves you.
{42278}{42394}A man who loves you is|a sight worth seeing, isn't it?
{42400}{42500}It’s a cold, grey world outside, stay here.
{42506}{42591}We can have a nice hot bath together.
{42598}{42691}I'll dry you,|I'll wrap you in a blue bathrobe.
{42696}{42821}You know what you are, Blondie!|You're on big son of a bitch!
{42940}{43024}All this, every evening for me,
{43033}{43133}you've forgotten one thing though,|the champagne.
{43234}{43314}Explain the rest later,|but I want to know how you did that.
{43319}{43397}You know, tricks of the trade.
{43402}{43448}But just as I said "champagne".
{43453}{43487}A bit of luck.
{43510}{43539}Here, Vittoria.
{43635}{43719}I want to do with you|what the spring does with cherries.
{43724}{43773}Now, now, now.
{43790}{43832}You haven't said anything about the house.
{43837}{43937}I'd move this table,|I'll finish my champagne then go...
{43942}{44045}and your books, don't try and stop me,|shouldn't be on the floor,
{44050}{44085}it’s a bit too bohemian.
{44090}{44186}There's a time for everything,|peach trees don't bloom in December.
{44194}{44241}This green wall's hideous.
{44248}{44307}I long to feel your arms around me.
{44312}{44372}This floor... but I can't...
{44378}{44415}is office-like.
{44425}{44496}I'm not sure if I should stay or go.
{44501}{44577}What’ll I do? You decide.
{44625}{44681}My compliments on your apartment.
{44714}{44837}I think I know what you're getting|at about the apartment,
{44846}{44900}I think this is the best solution.
{44907}{45024}As far as the floor's concerned,|let’s leave it as it is.
{45034}{45106}About the table,|I agree with you, I'd move it,
{45111}{45201}and make more space,|I'd put two armchairs there.
{45206}{45329}For the fittings, I know|a carpenter downstairs, so that’s sorted.
{45337}{45456}The floor we said leave as it,|the ceiling isn't great...
{45461}{45530}I wasn't really planning|on staying here long,
{45535}{45699}I'm only renting and I can't|remember when my lease ends.
{45726}{45821}All I know is|that tonight’ll never come back.
{45834}{45937}There's just one word|on the great clock of time, now.
{45964}{46020}But you're right about one thing, my love.
{46034}{46080}That green wall has got to go.
{46365}{46395}Where are you going?
{46458}{46509}I'm going to put on the blue bathrobe.
{46514}{46593}If only you knew what I have inside of me,
{46598}{46749}fleets of minesweepers dropping|death-charges into my chest,
{46754}{46802}torpedoing my thorax,
{46806}{46869}circumnavigating my heart.
{46882}{46957}Now I can tell you, I was Verona,
{46962}{47029}and in Piazza dell'Esquilino.
{47034}{47076}Two and a quarter hours!
{47088}{47135}I'm ashamed to say,
{47150}{47237}I was in Catania too, I never told you.
{47254}{47361}I dream of you every night,|always the same dream, always you.
{47366}{47465}I see you everywhere,|my whole life hears you.
{47477}{47571}In all creation|I feel the beating of your heart.
{47579}{47668}You these books,|the bubbles in my champagne,
{47679}{47771}you're the flame of these candles,|these trees,
{47776}{47831}you're down the street...
{47902}{47937}Vittoria?
{47958}{47989}Vittoria!
{48059}{48126}I'll fix her, when I catch her!
{48133}{48174}Vittoria, I'll sue you!
{48179}{48252}I'll take you to court!
{48270}{48398}Vittoria! Vittoria!
{48405}{48429}Wait!
{48438}{48469}Vittoria!
{48583}{48673}Stop!
{48678}{48712}Vittoria!
{48717}{48757}Stop this tram!
{48762}{48877}Driver, stop!
{48882}{48965}Vittoria!
{48982}{49029}You know what you are?
{49039}{49153}You're one big daughter of a bitch!
{49310}{49341}It’s raining!
{49346}{49441}It rains on the city,
{49450}{49530}like tears in my heart.
{49605}{49679}Oh my beloved,|all creation overflows with passion,
{49684}{49775}and like a golden comet in the sky,|from my mouth bursts forth this cry.
{49781}{49809}"Kiss me!"
{49825}{49870}Please my love.
{49887}{49951}I said kiss me.
{49956}{50011}Attilio. Attilio!
{50026}{50114}It’s her, the symbolism is so obvious!
{50119}{50171}I know, I guessed it right away
{50176}{50234}but I'm not kissing a kangaroo,|it’s revolting.
{50239}{50320}Revolting? Goodbye then,|you'll never see me again.
{50325}{50364}Oh!
{50383}{50418}Vittoria!
{50428}{50482}I wasn't talking to you.
{50491}{50509}Vittoria!
{50510}{50549}Stop!
{50636}{50665}What a coincidence!
{50670}{50701}Vittoria!
{50718}{50804}I was walking along thinking of|everything except you...
{50812}{50841}Vittoria!
{50848}{50883}What are you doing, leaving?
{50888}{50936}Okay, I get the message.
{50941}{51009}Since I know you're leaving,|I just came to tell you this.
{51014}{51143}It’s all over between us,|you'll never see me again.
{51149}{51212}Goodbye forever!
{51369}{51441}Sorry, I forgot to tell you something.
{51458}{51589}Oh Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!
{51595}{51689}Peace! Peace!
{51694}{51785}You tell him,|I can't in half an hour, Attorney.
{51790}{51881}Go to prison? But I'm in the right!
{51886}{51973}- This is an act of violence.|- War's an act of violence.
{51979}{52061}Hanging out the peace|banner never hurt anyone.
{52119}{52171}I can't in half an hour.
{52176}{52195}Professor!
{52196}{52224}Yes?
{52345}{52480}Mamma Mia, what a bang!|Almost killed me!
{52487}{52517}What the...
{52618}{52698}Stop hopping about like that.
{52703}{52781}Will you please stop hopping?
{52786}{52866}Vittoria, I will not get into your pouch,
{52871}{52954}I won't fit, be a good girl.
{52963}{53058}Don't kiss me,|I know it’s you but stop it.
{53065}{53161}Behave, Vittoria.
{53203}{53263}Vittoria...
{53813}{53908}Yes, speaking.
{53919}{53953}Who is it?
{53966}{53996}Who?
{54015}{54129}Fuad, what a nice surprise!
{54140}{54195}I'm glad, how are you?
{54246}{54287}What’s wrong?
{54355}{54409}Vittoria? Of course.
{54418}{54507}She's there with you, right?|She talked about me, eh?
{54561}{54596}What happened?
{54900}{54935}Is she dead?
{54940}{55027}I don't know,|I just came back from the hospital.
{55044}{55113}The doctor is afraid she won't make it|through the night.
{55122}{55210}She's alive but there's nothing to be done,
{55215}{55275}We've got no medicine or supplies here.
{55313}{55368}We'd nearly finished out work,
{55373}{55483}we were walking in Baghdad,|there was an explosion, a building fell.
{55504}{55533}What?
{55555}{55670}I don't know, when I opened my eyes|she was lying there unconscious.
{55677}{55756}What’s the hospital called?
{55763}{55880}I'll be there right away, see you soon.
{55886}{55922}See you soon in Baghdad.
{55927}{56009}I'll call you as soon as I arrive.
{56359}{56465}Carla, it’s me, I know, sorry but...
{56471}{56508}Everything's fine, don't worry.
{56513}{56571}They're both fine, they're asleep.
{56576}{56611}I've got to go away right now.
{56616}{56678}I'm not sure when, please don't start.
{56683}{56740}I've got to go, I don't know when.
{56745}{56864}Come early tomorrow morning,|I'll leave the keys out,
{56870}{56961}you look after Rosa and Emilia.
{57225}{57279}- Good morning.|- Yes?
{57310}{57392}I'd like a ticket to Baghdad,|first available flight.
{57437}{57466}What?
{57478}{57590}I said I'd like a ticket to Baghdad,|first available flight.
{57604}{57691}- Maybe I misheard.|- What’s the problem?
{57696}{57727}Not again.
{57741}{57793}- I am at the airport, aren't I?|- Of course.
{57798}{57848}I'd like a ticket to Baghdad please.
{57859}{57955}Perhaps you haven't heard,|but there's a war in Iraq.
{57962}{58041}There are no flights,|there's no longer an airport!
{58050}{58101}- I have to go to Baghdad.|- You can't!
{58106}{58154}There must be an airport near Baghdad!
{58159}{58224}Give me a ticket for|an airport near Baghdad
{58229}{58372}then I'll take a taxi, boat, or walk,|that’s up to me.
{58378}{58445}- Give me the nearest airport|- Nearest to what?
{58450}{58469}"Baghdad!"
{58474}{58502}Where do you want to go?
{58507}{58645}No, just wanted to know...|no time to waste.
{58650}{58749}You're very kind, extremely kind, goodbye.
{58789}{58823}Everything okay?
{58843}{58889}A ticket for Baghdad!
{58905}{58961}Was he joking?
{59134}{59223}Hi Eleonora, what’s for dinner?
{59238}{59314}They sent the certificate back,|you've got to call them.
{59319}{59422}- How are you? You look tired.|- The usual stuff...
{59430}{59531}Apart from this morning|some guy comes in all agitated
{59536}{59589}asking for a ticket to Baghdad!
{59594}{59658}Imagine, wanting to go to Baghdad|that game day!
{59663}{59714}A ticket for Baghdad? What was he like?
{59719}{59758}Quite ordinary looking.
{59804}{59841}Like that guy there.
{59882}{59960}That guy there unloading|the crates in Iraq.
{60047}{60092}It’s the splitting image!
{60134}{60165}Eleonora!
{60178}{60210}That’s him!
{60215}{60275}Will you help me drain the pasta?
{60378}{60429}How the hell did he manage that?
{60470}{60570}No, these stay here in Basra,|those are got Baghdad.
{60575}{60641}Where's Gauzzelli?
{60646}{60711}- What is it?|- We've got to leave for Baghdad.
{60716}{60797}- We haven't gotten the okay.|- Yes we have, from Mrs. Serao.
{60802}{60876}- Come on, let’s go now.|- Start it up!
{60905}{60959}- Mrs. Serao!|- Finally found you.
{60964}{61057}You're a marvelous, wonderful person.
{61064}{61175}Sorry if I pressed you,|but I'm so happy to be here!
{61267}{61310}Thank you, Doctor,
{61315}{61391}Sorry if I seemed doubtful in Rome.
{61396}{61501}So many people want to help|but just end up wasting our time,
{61511}{61573}but we can't get enough of|surgeons like you.
{61578}{61653}- Thank you, Doctor.|- Thank you, goodbye.
{61661}{61717}Let’s go!
{61954}{62037}- Can't you go a bit faster?|- No.
{62060}{62132}- Shall I drive?|- Why don't you take a nap?
{62506}{62540}What’s the problem?
{62577}{62641}Doctor Guazzelli, why've we stopped?
{62646}{62720}We just got the order to go back to Basra.
{62726}{62788}Back to Basra?
{62794}{62821}You crazy?
{62826}{62942}Stop, counter-orders!
{62947}{62995}- How far is it to Baghdad?|- About 100 kilometers.
{63000}{63093}Wait, stop.
{63101}{63189}I've got to get to Baghdad.
{63194}{63250}- But it’s all desert.|- I've got to get to Baghdad.
{63255}{63343}Thanks, I'll tell Guazzelli, don't worry.
{63348}{63399}Go, go!
{65576}{65624}Fuad, it’s Attilio.
{65638}{65733}I'm glad you called,|I've been trying to reach you all day.
{65738}{65845}I've found a way to get you|to Iraq in a few days.
{65850}{65929}- I'm in Baghdad!|- What do you mean?
{65934}{66072}There are two huge hands|holding two scimitars.
{66078}{66137}- Where's the hospital?|- I don't believe it!
{66142}{66187}I'll take you, don't move.
{66579}{66608}Fuad!
{66638}{66686}You took your time!
{66715}{66794}- How are you?|- Fine. How'd you get to Baghdad?
{66799}{66833}By bus.
{66841}{66900}Where's the hospital? Let’s go.
{66954}{66995}We're off.
{67687}{67717}Come along.
{67775}{67823}- Where is she?|- Over here.
{67891}{67935}- That’s odd...|- What?
{67940}{67977}She was here last night.
{67997}{68124}- I'm afraid it’s a bad sign.|- You're joking!
{68133}{68213}It’s a good sign, they've probably moved|her to a convalescent ward.
{68218}{68335}Let’s ask, there must be a doctor,|a surgeon, a sister a brother...
{68340}{68397}I'll try and find someone, don't worry.
{68410}{68445}I'm quite happy.
{68451}{68551}It’s a very good sign,|I'm happy she's recovered,
{68559}{68605}I'll go look for her...
{69545}{69576}Vittoria?
{69638}{69675}Vittoria.
{69689}{69724}See who it is?
{69756}{69796}See who it is?
{69888}{69944}What a coincidence!
{69949}{69999}You in Baghdad, too!
{70115}{70209}With that blanket on your face you seemed...|but you're breathing!
{70215}{70261}You're looking great.
{70266}{70307}Really great.
{70321}{70432}They told me you weren't well,|I got a bit scared.
{70638}{70671}What was that?
{70717}{70787}Thought you said something.
{70890}{70933}You know...
{70950}{71041}Fuaïs gone to talk to this doctor
{71050}{71089}who is just great.
{71146}{71240}The whole of Baghdaïs talking about him.
{71247}{71290}I said, "Who is he?"
{71343}{71431}The hospital's empty, he's cured everyone.
{71442}{71566}I've spoken to him,|I'll have you home in a couple of days,
{71573}{71596}I promise.
{71604}{71654}Found her.
{71659}{71791}Bed stuck away at an angle,|a blanket covering her face,
{71796}{71815}I thought she was dead.
{71820}{71888}The doctor doesn't speak Italian,|I've spoken to him.
{71898}{71968}- The prospects aren't good.|- Why?
{71973}{72030}Great colour in her cheeks...
{72043}{72105}Look, Fuaïs here, see?
{72113}{72146}She's all right.
{72212}{72263}She's better, she can leave now?
{72282}{72317}She's better?
{72370}{72392}What did he say?
{72397}{72461}There's no hope.
{72485}{72604}Are you nuts, in front of her?|She can hear every word.
{72610}{72665}So she's better, I knew it.
{72698}{72758}He said there's no hope,|but he didn't say she's dead.
{72763}{72807}- Is she dead or alive?|- She's alive but...
{72812}{72888}What does "she's alive but" mean?|She's alive!
{72893}{72945}Couldn't be better!
{72960}{73053}What needs to be done? Ask him.
{73162}{73241}- What did he say?|- Vittoria has a cerebral edema.
{73249}{73299}She's not reacting,
{73314}{73371}we've got no drugs to treat edemas,
{73382}{73429}this means
{73444}{73486}she'll die soon.
{73544}{73642}Unless we find the right medicine,
{73655}{73754}she takes it, the edema goes|and she'll be up and about.
{73794}{73833}How long do we have to find the medicine?
{73846}{73981}- There must be a pharmacy open!|- There are no medicines in Baghdad!
{73986}{74018}I got that, but...
{74023}{74121}Ask him how long she's got|without this medicine,
{74126}{74244}30, 34, 47 minutes,|get him to tell you something.
{74464}{74512}- What’s he say?|- It’s all written here.
{74522}{74609}He wrote the name of the medicine?|How long have we got?
{74634}{74666}No more than four hours.
{74702}{74790}Four hours!
{74795}{74825}More than enough!
{74830}{74891}Give us time to have a coffee too!
{74910}{75001}Let’s go get it, four hours...
{75006}{75082}Let me say goodbye to Victoria.
{75098}{75168}The doctor said you could come with us,
{75173}{75245}but I reckon more bed rest won't hurt you,
{75256}{75288}get your strength back.
{75293}{75355}Then I'll find you a better spot,
{75360}{75465}I saw a fancy spot under the stairs|where no one comes by.
{75470}{75519}Goodbye.
{75524}{75560}Okay, Fuad.
{75655}{75721}Here's one open.
{75735}{75800}Pharmacist! Anybody there?
{75808}{75853}Pharmacist!
{75858}{75902}Clients!
{75938}{76001}This one's closed too, now what?
{76023}{76073}Maybe there's one there.
{76078}{76114}Look!
{76122}{76225}How do you say in Arabic?|Bazaar, they've got everything.
{76230}{76288}Give me the prescription, thanks.
{76296}{76330}They'll have everything there.
{76394}{76488}Good morning, I'm Italian.|Do you have this medicine?
{76493}{76617}I need that. I look around, maybe you have|the medicine and maybe you don't remember...
{76622}{76772}...in this confusion. I have a look.|Where is medicine?
{76786}{76829}Medicine?
{76834}{76893}Come along.
{76917}{76950}You don't have...
{76955}{77049}They've got Etruscan vases,|diving equipment,
{77054}{77097}motor-cycle helmets,
{77102}{77152}and they don't have any medicine!
{77157}{77257}- It’s no use, this medicine...|- What does it do?
{77264}{77310}- It’s an anti-edema.|- Let’s get it made!
{77315}{77363}- Who by?|- Don't you know a pharmacist?
{77368}{77437}- A pharmacist?|- You're from Baghdad!
{77442}{77479}I know one!
{77493}{77581}Al-Giumeili, an old friend of my father's,
{77606}{77649}a formidable man.
{77839}{77881}- Is he home?|- Yes.
{77886}{77982}- I told you so, come on.|- She's gone to ask permission.
{77987}{78050}He's extremely old,|I wonder if he remembers me.
{78061}{78103}My father used to hold him up|as an example
{78108}{78177}of the most noble man he ever knew.
{78187}{78269}- Why, what did he do?|- He as a real poet.
{78276}{78349}He was young, fell in love|with a woman and married her.
{78362}{78420}A few years later while he was|fighting in some war,
{78425}{78536}he heard his wife and contracted smallpox|and had been disfigured.
{78561}{78651}So Al-Giumeili said, "My eyes hurt".
{78656}{78725}And then, "I've gone blind".
{78741}{78842}When his wife died, 12 years later,|he opens his eyes again.
{78894}{78968}So as not to upset his wife,
{78973}{79029}he pretended to be blind for 12 years?
{79055}{79152}Every person is a chasm,|it makes you dizzy to look down...
{79161}{79209}He never explained to anybody
{79294}{79378}I'll go and talk to him|first then I'll call you.
{79914}{79940}For me?
{79974}{80036}It’s a present for me?
{80047}{80112}It’s a beautiful present.
{80166}{80188}Come.
{80193}{80246}- Bye.|- Bye.
{80519}{80544}Attilio.
{80550}{80579}Hello.
{80675}{80698}Thank you.
{80756}{80851}What did he say?|Can we make it in three hours?
{80882}{80917}I'm sorry,
{80927}{80997}he can't make the medicine we need,
{81005}{81067}he hasn't got any of the equipment,
{81075}{81178}he needs mannitol, cortisone,|and various other things.
{81187}{81219}It’s not possible.
{81277}{81355}Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
{81366}{81425}Mannitol, cortisone, what are they?
{81430}{81474}Can you tell him something else?
{81479}{81554}Tell him in Arabic, fifty years ago
{81559}{81624}there was no mannitol or cortisone.
{81662}{81720}When someone got a bump on the head,
{81725}{81792}people did say, "He's got an edema,|he'll be dead soon"...
{81963}{82058}So what did he,|Iraq's foremost scientist, do?
{82216}{82327}- We tried gastric treatment.|- What did they pump into the stomach?
{82395}{82423}Glycerine.
{82454}{82482}Glycerine.
{82487}{82560}I've heard of that, you see.
{82565}{82683}Where do we buy it?|Forget it, I know everything's closed...
{82688}{82820}Can we make some glycerine|and feed it into her stomach?
{83058}{83098}There's a way.
{83147}{83175}Really!
{83202}{83248}He's trying to remember.
{83451}{83513}What time is it? How long do we have?
{83805}{83905}Al-Giumeili my old friend,|find me this glycerine.
{83919}{84044}I know you can,|otherwise she's going to die.
{84049}{84072}If she dies,
{84113}{84202}they can close|this whole show of a world...
{84207}{84332}They can cart if off, unscrew the stars,
{84337}{84458}roll up the sky and put it on a truck,
{84463}{84569}they can turn off this sunlight|I love so much,
{84578}{84616}you know why I love it so much?
{84621}{84685}Because I love her|when the sun shines on her.
{84696}{84831}They can take everything away,|these carpets, columns, houses,
{84840}{84953}sand, wind, frogs, ripe watermelons,
{84971}{85084}hail, seven in the evening,|May, June, July,
{85089}{85210}basil, bees, the sea, courgettes...
{85230}{85281}Courgettes, Al-Giumeili!
{85287}{85329}Get me this glycerine!
{85846}{85946}- What’s he say?|- Butter, palm oil, olive oil.
{86072}{86197}The base is soda,|but ashes will do, fat and ashes.
{86213}{86270}It might work, I've got it all,
{86275}{86335}we can do it in a couple of hours.
{86445}{86513}A thousand thanks, Al-Giumeili.
{86712}{86754}Thank you.
{86930}{86992}I reckon it’s ready, come here!
{86997}{87064}- A little more ash.|- No, we've got quite enough.
{87069}{87150}- Doesn't need any more.|- Just another spoonful.
{87155}{87187}Thank you, Fuad, for everything.
{87192}{87239}I'll do this, go have a rest.
{87244}{87316}- Did you get any sleep?|- A little, in this chair.
{87321}{87413}Al-giumeili intimidated me a bit.|Was that his daughter?
{87420}{87494}She's the last wife of his son Ali.
{87501}{87576}He was murdered six months ago,
{87588}{87634}he was a real free spirit.
{87662}{87720}Saddam Hussein didn't like free spirits.
{87735}{87772}Poor Al-Giumeili.
{87821}{87897}Time has left me nothing
{87914}{87964}to sustain my eyes
{87969}{88009}and my heart.
{88040}{88077}Come on, Fuad,
{88082}{88200}if this stuff works|we'll have dinner and celebrate.
{88529}{88586}Good, eh?
{88591}{88697}It’s home made, hand-made by me and Fuad,
{88701}{88770}no preservatives, colorings, chemicals,
{88775}{88880}just like home-made tagliatelle,|"butter please, oil please,
{88885}{88940}chop some onions, put in garlic",
{88945}{89068}really delicious,|Fuad and I both had second helpings.
{89073}{89192}Fuad wanted a third but I said,|"No, leave some for Vittoria!"
{89201}{89296}You're looking well, I tidied you up...
{89301}{89341}Really well.
{89370}{89452}I was forgetting, look what I've got!
{89463}{89533}Hang on, close your eyes.
{89541}{89599}Close 'em!
{89666}{89701}Open your eyes.
{89707}{89737}Open!
{89773}{89873}I'll hang it here, okay?
{89961}{90025}How's that? I banged my head!
{90042}{90109}I'll be getting an edema next!|It’s full of flies here!
{90117}{90179}You like it? Look.
{90187}{90284}Take a quick look,|tell me whether it’s okay or not.
{90373}{90409}One second...
{90897}{90985}Did you move?|I thought before you were like that...
{91060}{91105}She looks worse than ever to me.
{91181}{91232}That brew didn't do much good.
{91347}{91443}I'll go have a word with the doctor,|a personal matter,
{91464}{91496}be right back.
{91574}{91606}Doctor?
{91620}{91726}Doctor, excuse me, doctor.|Excuse me, but ahh...
{91738}{91831}...she seems worse.|The glycerine didn't help.
{91837}{91860}- Didn't help at all?|- No.
{91865}{91960}Without it she'd be dead already.|It’s a miracle she's still alive.
{91965}{92059}Now we must wait and hope|that the medicines arrive soon.
{92065}{92209}Doctor, if I can lend a hand,|if you need anything I...
{92215}{92277}Thank you, I will get to her|as soon as possible.
{92282}{92311}Yes...
{92499}{92565}Hey, what are you doing?
{92571}{92621}Doctor! Who the hell is he?
{92646}{92699}Where do you think you're going?
{92805}{92825}Who are you?
{92834}{92906}What have you done to her?
{92914}{93029}Doctor, he was leaning over Vittoria|like this. What did he want?
{93053}{93085}This, I suspect.
{93090}{93176}Vittoria's chain.
{93186}{93256}You have thieves in the hospital?
{93297}{93409}I think it’s better if you keep that.|It’s a nightmare...
{93414}{93525}...looters everywhere. The Americans|promised us some security people...
{93532}{93566}...let’s hope they get here soon.
{93571}{93649}Doctor, how is she, she looks very pale.
{93653}{93697}Do you think she can breathe all right?
{93703}{93757}She could probably do with some oxygen.
{93771}{93793}Goodbye for now.
{93836}{93870}Thank you, excuse me Doctor.
{93875}{93953}You breathing?
{93985}{94045}Breathe, Vittoria.
{94081}{94193}The only ones breathing are the flies.
{94199}{94277}Damnit, where do they get so much oxygen?
{94296}{94397}It’s a nightmare.|I'll go find you some oxygen right away.
{94404}{94437}Hang on.
{94458}{94586}Poor doctor, hasn't even got any band-aids.
{94594}{94683}Hi, it’s Attilio.
{94697}{94789}By any chance to you|have an oxygen tank at home?
{94808}{94841}Yes, oxygen tank.
{94846}{94947}You might have forgotten you had one...
{94967}{95129}You don't know anyone|who might have some oxygen?
{95186}{95226}Got it!
{95231}{95304}Don't worry, don't need it any longer.
{95309}{95347}Thanks bye.
{95362}{95467}I'll get you some oxygen, I know where.
{95473}{95506}I'll go fetch it.
{95657}{95699}Goodbye Vittoria.
{96054}{96085}Mamma Mia!
{96301}{96363}It’s total hell!
{96483}{96538}Look out!
{96605}{96655}It was here, who pinched it?
{96668}{96699}Excuse me, did you see where...
{96704}{96738}Where've they put it?
{96808}{96854}Have you seen
{96882}{96941}A wet-suit with a mask?
{96952}{97021}Stop!
{97056}{97115}Hey Mr. Arab, stop!
{97122}{97160}I said stop!
{97166}{97290}Mr. Arab, whatever your names is, stop!
{97300}{97337}You crazy?
{97342}{97387}Stop!
{97392}{97487}Friend. Italian. I am Italian.
{97545}{97708}I need the oxygeno.|Oxygen tank, for me. Oxygen.
{97713}{97785}I need. I pay. I pay. I pay.
{97790}{97815}Dollar?
{97820}{97868}Like Dollar. Euro... Do you know?
{97873}{97944}Italy, France, Germany,|Luxembourg... I pay...
{98009}{98114}More? How much does he want?
{98160}{98212}He's left me the whole cart!
{98222}{98260}The tank!
{98316}{98374}It’s stuck.
{98422}{98525}I'd better go, if anyone comes
{98530}{98580}tell him I paid for all this lot!
{98623}{98659}I paid for it!
{98729}{98813}Hang on, there's more, there's this too.
{98820}{98885}A dog, where shall I put it?
{98895}{98964}Next to you?
{98985}{99072}Here, that way he can keep an eye on you.
{99078}{99102}Looks good here.
{99107}{99224}I spent a fortune but it was worth it,
{99229}{99303}above all because|I found something absolutely fantastic.
{99310}{99353}Really close your eyes.
{99366}{99474}A fly whisk! I've found the weapon|of mass destruction.
{99479}{99513}I found it!
{99534}{99635}I'm going to have myself a massacre,|you're dead!
{99749}{99800}Breathing okay?
{99805}{99871}What’s the weather like up|in the mountains?
{99926}{99975}Is it snowing?
{100000}{100090}If only you know|how pretty you are in blue.
{100101}{100169}I've put some tape here, hope it works,
{100255}{100323}Do you like music? I'll show you.
{100339}{100405}I've found an old record player,|it’s all Arab music,
{100409}{100439}but they're nice, I bet.
{100444}{100508}Can't figure out a thing here...
{100513}{100589}Look who's here in Baghdad.
{100616}{100691}Look who I've found, close your ears,
{100696}{100774}this is incredible, just listen.
{101242}{101347}As soon as you're better|we'll go to Granada together and dance.
{101352}{101439}How are you muchacha, breathing okay?
{101478}{101513}The light’s gone again.
{101753}{101797}Fuad, yes, hello.
{101808}{101844}Fuad, is that you?
{101849}{101917}It’s you Attorney, I can't hear you well.
{101927}{101981}Be in my office at 8:00 tomorrow,
{101985}{102101}you've got to sign the charge sheet,|or off tojail with you!
{102111}{102161}No messing around.
{102178}{102224}Attilio! Attilio!
{102229}{102275}Hello? Hello?
{102296}{102328}Thank goodness.
{102573}{102637}Doctor, good evening. Doctor, excuse me,
{102641}{102698}I have done everything you said, but...
{102703}{102787}...she doesn't answer. She doesn't move,|she doesn't react in anyway.
{102821}{102865}She's like ahh... dead.
{102869}{102896}I don't know what else...
{102901}{102998}But ahh, how can I tell|if she's getting better, recovering.
{103023}{103132}If there's the slightest movement,|a finger, a hand, an eye.
{103137}{103208}You'll know she has made it,|any movement is from the mental.
{103241}{103309}What on earth? Claudio Villa!
{103460}{103485}What is that?
{103512}{103601}An old record I found,|the music might cheer her up.
{103612}{103645}Is the oxygen okay?
{103654}{103687}Yes, but it’s finished.
{103694}{103712}Already?
{103713}{103746}Yeah. This can be removed.
{103751}{103835}You hear that? The oxygen's done you good.
{103872}{103900}How is she?
{103929}{103956}She is alive.
{103971}{104061}Alive? But Doctor. Doctor...
{104066}{104154}Without water, without food,|how can she go on.
{104167}{104217}Isn't there anything we can give her?
{104225}{104250}If only I had...
{104255}{104280}Had what?
{104285}{104341}Some sort of nutritional drip|I could give her...
{104346}{104449}along with the cortisone|and the antibiotics... never mind.
{104457}{104492}But what can we...
{104497}{104531}It will help a lot.
{104536}{104571}Goodbye for now.
{104605}{104661}Now he tells me one thing at a time!
{104686}{104741}The nutritional drip is crucial.
{104750}{104799}I'll find you something to eat,
{104804}{104900}don't worry, I'll get food for you.
{104918}{105035}Right away, if I say I will, I will.
{105040}{105081}Nunzio, how are you?
{105087}{105212}It’s De Giovanni.|Doctor Guazzelli, I've missed you!
{105217}{105314}I'm in Baghdad, I'm all right.
{105322}{105346}And you?
{105351}{105422}Where are you? When'll you get here?
{105433}{105543}Yeah right! We need things now,|there are sick people here!
{105548}{105688}They won't let the Red Cross through|the road blocks? Knock'em down!
{105697}{105763}You know what, I'll come to you.
{105773}{105827}Goodbye, Nunzio. Goodbye.
{105844}{105891}I'll get you some food.
{105901}{105999}I'll get a couple of candles|so we can have dinner together.
{106021}{106109}I'm off, they're not far, 50 kilometers,
{106114}{106172}I'll borrow the doctor's bike,
{106177}{106247}if I go at 100,|I'll be there in half an hour.
{106252}{106281}Don't move,
{106286}{106404}actually do move...|a finger, a hand, an eye, whatever.
{107387}{107463}Might have know it, now I've hurt...
{107521}{107554}my foot.
{107745}{107870}Out of gas in Iraq, it’s too much!
{107885}{107969}On we go, then we'll see.
{108363}{108469}Hello! Hello! I am Italian!
{108487}{108528}Anyone there?
{108537}{108573}Hello! Please!
{108605}{108644}I'm borrowing a camel.
{108649}{108734}I'll bring it right back.
{108817}{108950}You're much more beautiful than him,|my favorite camel.
{108972}{109008}Now be good, down.
{109013}{109120}Let me get on,|how do you say "down" in Arabic?
{109231}{109286}You've got to get down!
{109473}{109604}You're more beautiful than he is,|and he's deaf too!
{109609}{109647}Now let’s go.
{109657}{109757}Hang on.
{109821}{109892}Slowly!
{109917}{110010}Now this is a real camel,|you're ugly and dead too!
{110019}{110085}That way!

{110478}{110513}Down boy!
{110523}{110596}I can't jump off, I've hurt my foot.

{111951}{112029}- The Italian Red Cross?|- Doctor!
{112035}{112105}Is Nunzio around, Dr. Guazzelli?

{112340}{112441}Everything, don't know how you'll|manage this lot on your bike.
{112445}{112552}What I can't squeeze in,|you can bring back with you.
{112587}{112629}You put some gas for the bike?
{112633}{112699}Did you recharge my cell phone?
{112832}{112943}What do you think, Chemiotina or Talamagil?
{112948}{112969}Chemiotina.
{112974}{113106}I might as well take both,|except I've got no more room.
{113170}{113296}- When will you get to Baghdad?|- They won't let us in.
{113301}{113400}It’s a real nightmare in Baghdad,|they haven't even got band-aids.
{113409}{113458}- Are they in here?|- Right there.
{113480}{113552}Thanks a million.

{118441}{118494}Damn thing's stuck,
{118507}{118547}Just won't budge.
{118612}{118658}Ahh Doctor this too.
{118702}{118766}Thank you for this, and for all the rest.
{118772}{118855}Even if it’s just a drop in the ocean.|She's okay now.
{118874}{118895}Thank you.
{118896}{118920}I must be going.
{118925}{118985}She's okay, Doctor,|but she still isn't moving.
{118992}{119056}I mean, rather than do|one thing at a time,
{119061}{119101}how about if you do everything at once.
{119106}{119133}What can we do now?
{119138}{119243}At this stage, there is nothing more|we can do. Just hope and pray to Allah.
{119253}{119284}Ah, thank you.
{119364}{119406}You hear that?
{119413}{119492}He said we've done all we can.
{119506}{119566}You're fine, it’s all inside here.
{119575}{119711}There's nothing more we need to do,|just relax.
{119719}{119762}He told me to pray to Allah.
{119862}{119961}It’s the only thing we can do,|pray to Allah.
{119972}{120012}I would pray.
{120089}{120133}We've done everything else...
{120137}{120303}Allah, the only prayers|I know is the Lorïs Prayer in Italian,
{120309}{120368}you understand Italian?
{120379}{120428}It’s a beautiful prayer.
{120458}{120515}How about it?
{120578}{120624}Allah, here goes.
{120673}{120724}Our Father, who are in heaven,
{120732}{120784}hallowed be thy name.
{120803}{120887}Thy kingdom come, they will be done
{120892}{120937}in Earth as it is in heaven.
{120942}{120997}Give us this day our daily bread,
{121003}{121054}and forgive us our trespasses
{121060}{121100}as we forgive them|that trespass against us
{121105}{121135}and lead us not into temptation,|but deliver us from evil...
{121140}{121168}Now we've really done all we can.
{121419}{121488}Rest, I'm going to have|a little rest myself.
{121571}{121605}Bye Vittoria.
{121761}{121813}Anything you need, I'm at the barber's.
{121963}{122013}That’s just what I said to Vittoria
{122018}{122089}when she asked|why I'd come back to Baghdad.
{122105}{122213}I told her about the 351st Arabian Night,|remember it?
{122222}{122314}You know all 1001? How about 406th?
{122319}{122428}406 is about the Italian poet|with a funny sole.
{122452}{122510}"The Arabian Nights", wonderful!
{122534}{122573}"Beautiful sky!"
{122578}{122640}The Baghdad sky is|the pillow of the world.
{122689}{122746}Looks like they're firing angels.
{122797}{122880}80km from here, over 3,000 years ago,
{122885}{122978}they built the Tower of Babel|so they could climb up to this sky.
{122993}{123068}80km from here all|our languages were born.
{123073}{123169}Since they tried to touch this sky,|we no longer understand each other.
{123233}{123379}A Muslim legend says that now|and then Allah comes back to Earth
{123384}{123434}because he misses the look of|the starry sky from below.
{123441}{123534}Centuries of wisdom|and what have we learned? Nothing.
{123541}{123588}You know why there are wars?
{123604}{123707}Because the world started without men|and without men it’ll finish.
{123800}{123906}Come over and get a good night’s|sleep in a proper bed.
{123911}{124034}Thanks, but I've got|a comfortable barber's chair.
{124041}{124081}I'll sleep like a log near Vittoria,|you never know.
{124086}{124115}I do know.
{124137}{124160}Goodbye.
{124171}{124205}Goodnight, Fuad.
{124235}{124260}Fuad?
{124270}{124367}Come on, if we're good and behave well,|we'll get to heaven!
{124381}{124432}There's nothing after this.
{124435}{124488}Even less than nothing,|which would at least be something.
{124493}{124554}Still, I'm glad I was born,
{124559}{124668}I'm sure even when I'm dead|I'll remember when I was alive.
{124685}{124717}Good night, Attilio.
{124753}{124785}See you, Fuad.
{128538}{128561}Fuad!
{128713}{128735}Fuad!
{129475}{129504}Oh Vittoria!
{129542}{129627}Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!
{129645}{129733}No, you can't take her away yet.|She can hardly stand.
{129741}{129837}You'll have to give her a day or two.|Look it’s almost a miracle,
{129842}{129878}but in here they do happen sometimes.
{129883}{130028}But, sorry... sorry to keep asking|you doctor. But she really is better?
{130033}{130098}Yes, she's better. Come and see.
{130103}{130140}But do you think she'll recognize me?
{130145}{130165}Of course she will.
{130169}{130199}- Yes.|- Yes.
{130283}{130347}I bet she won't. Wait, Doctor...
{130352}{130440}Maybe first, a pair of new shoes...
{130445}{130556}...or some flowers, or maybe a shower,|I must stink like a camel.
{130561}{130665}Fine, we'll try to get her walking.|There's still so much to do.
{130669}{130728}Thank you Doctor.|Doctor, Doctor... Excuse me.
{130749}{130849}Forgive me but ahh...|Have you even been kissed by a camel?
{130958}{131027}I'll give her a surprise.
{131247}{131282}A dark brown.
{131373}{131444}They are used. But they are beautiful.
{131461}{131568}Thank you. Beautiful, yes, thank you.|Okay, so how much is it?
{131586}{131614}Only twenty dollar.
{131854}{131954}I... I... I don't... Excuse me.
{131959}{131986}Yes?
{132050}{132159}May I try just two, three steps?
{132164}{132223}Just to see how they fit me?
{132228}{132293}- Yes.|- Sometimes they are large, they are tight.
{132298}{132330}Take your time. Take your time.
{132335}{132461}To try, yeah? Two, three steps, yeah?
{132467}{132494}They are wonderful.
{132501}{132520}Yes.
{132525}{132596}Wonderful. What a beautiful good man.
{132601}{132645}- Couple of steps more.|- Please.
{132677}{132700}It’s not bad.
{132790}{132828}Sir! Sir!
{133193}{133241}All for a pair of shoes that are too big!
{133322}{133363}Leave me alone!
{133368}{133478}Stop, that’s a minefield!
{133557}{133602}You're scared!
{133608}{133641}Wimps!
{133889}{133913}Don't move!
{133918}{133962}Careful where you tread!
{134027}{134097}You want your wretched shoes!
{134108}{134147}Boom! Boom!
{134152}{134195}I'll give them back.
{134201}{134273}Here, have 'em!
{134458}{134529}The other one too? Want both?
{134560}{134605}So long as you leave me in peace.
{135033}{135107}There are mines!
{135116}{135180}Now what’ll I do?
{135198}{135249}Mines!
{135254}{135347}Allah, do a friend a favor,
{135353}{135400}I'll never ask for another.
{135406}{135448}Help me.
{135459}{135548}Maybe if I tread where I trod before...
{135563}{135595}dead east,
{135620}{135660}Let’s go.
{135687}{135733}There, just as I thought.
{135744}{135796}That’s my footprint...
{135816}{135929}Would you believe it?|Stuck in the middle of a minefield!
{135943}{135980}There and there.
{136264}{136300}Oh Mamma Mia!

{143157}{143201}See who's here, your attorney!
{143209}{143315}They actually put me in prison!

{143389}{143458}See what your attorney does?
{143474}{143555}I'll drive you home.
{143614}{143693}This damned pollen,|it won't let me sleep at night.
{143748}{143787}But that’s a zebra!
{143804}{143832}Beautiful!
{143853}{143926}What’s a zebra doing here?|That looks like an ostrich.
{143945}{144001}They've turned it into a zoo?
{144009}{144077}Could be, there's a cop, ask him.
{144112}{144161}Officer, what’s with the zebra?
{144166}{144280}There's even a monkey in my garden,|what’s going on?
{144285}{144368}There's a fire at the circus, back up!
{144612}{144669}- Here you go.|- Thank you.

{148295}{148343}Mamma's looking well, isn't she?
{148358}{148426}Yes, but she was very sick,

{148485}{148516}They don't know who saved her,
{148521}{148584}some unknown Italian doctor,
{148589}{148627}a medical genius.

{148925}{148995}- Dreadful, isn't he?|- Yes, he is just dreadful.
{149000}{149076}- You can't stand it any longer.|- Quite right.
{149082}{149138}- Can't live with someone like that.|- No.

{150639}{150696}Nancy took off, you know.
{150701}{150810}She went back to England for good,|just quit and left.
{150829}{150849}I'm sorry.
{150853}{150912}There hadn't been anything|for a long time.
{150926}{151006}- I must say, you...|- I was upset.
{151015}{151077}- I'd rather not talk about it now.|- Nor me.
{151178}{151263}The girls are beauties,|Emilia's just like you,
{151268}{151351}tough, takes things hard.
{151367}{151413}I'd like to see more of them.
{151419}{151482}So you should, you just disappeared.
{151489}{151559}The girls asked about you, then I was away.
{151568}{151628}I haven't been very well,|I must take it easy.
{151649}{151741}It’s a long story,|but I'll tell you some other time.
{151757}{151847}I have very sad news through, Fuaïs dead,
{151852}{151883}he killed himself.
{151903}{151976}- Maybe you read it.|- Yes, I know.
{152109}{152176}- How's the book going?|- I haven't finished it.
{152314}{152347}Here...
{152533}{152561}You know,
{152566}{152705}I still dream about us getting|married every night.
{152724}{152798}Even if we don't that’s fine.
{152803}{152910}- What?|- Would you like another cushion?
{152923}{152957}No, thank you.
{153132}{153205}I'll go, get some rest.
{153217}{153386}I'll see you soon, tomorrow,|the day after, I'll come often.
{153391}{153456}- Stay if you'd like.|- No, you look tired.
{153461}{153508}Goodbye, Vittoria.
{153753}{153801}Sorry, I took the wrong...
{153914}{153944}My jacket...
{155072}{155101}The birds!
{155721}{155771}They sing and fly...
{155898}{155926}Bye.
