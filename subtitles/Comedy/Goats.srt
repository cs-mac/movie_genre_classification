<i>Goat Man took me
on my first trek when I was 11.</i>

3
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,934
<i>Not long after that,
he taught me how to do bong hits.</i>

4
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:27,774
<i>It doesn't matter
where we go on these treks.</i>

5
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,174
<i>We just wander.</i>

6
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:33,293
<i>Goat Man says it's
the journey that counts.</i>

7
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,055
<i>Which I know is cliché.</i>

8
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,174
<i>In a few days, I leave
for the prep school my father went to.</i>

9
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:45,335
<i>Goat Man's calling this my "farewell trek".</i>

10
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:48,814
<i>He says I should soak up as much
of the Sonoran sun as I can.</i>

11
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,494
<i>But he's the one doing
most of the soaking.</i>

12
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:57,654
Whoo!

13
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:01,175
You won't have all this
at Gates Academy.

14
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:05,216
Naked men shouldn't squat.

15
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,774
Do you ever worry
about your parents?

16
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:15,055
Did you ever?

17
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:16,255
No.

18
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,576
Not really.

19
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,615
Wendy will be fine.

20
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,537
I'll watch her.

21
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:32,657
<i>Goat Man once told me
that in certain Native American tribes,</i>

22
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:35,737
<i>an elder leads a young man out
into the wilderness to fend for himself</i>

23
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:37,296
<i>until he has a vision.</i>

24
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:40,016
She never lets me milk her.

25
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:43,817
<i>In one tribe, if no vision comes
they'll chop off a fingertip</i>

26
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:46,136
<i>and sacrifice it to the Great Spirit.</i>

27
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:47,256
Thanks.

28
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,776
<i>Goat Man says I'm not quite ready
for this rite of passage.</i>

29
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:51,577
Sorry I messed up the trek, Goat Man.

30
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:52,856
It's not your fault.

31
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,258
I should have never let you
come out here with brand new boots.

32
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,816
I should have oiled them
and let you walk around in them

33
00:02:57,857 --> 00:03:00,136
for a couple days
before coming out here.

34
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,057
<i>Goat Man was my parents' friend first.</i>

35
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,937
<i>My mother claims
she can't remember how they met,</i>

36
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,618
<i>but Goat Man told me
he used to sell them peyote.</i>

37
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,178
<i>At one point Goat Man was broke,</i>

38
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,378
<i>so in exchange for cleaning the pool
and taking care of the landscaping,</i>

39
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,297
<i>they let him live in our pool house.</i>

40
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:20,538
<i>When I was a baby, my father left</i>

41
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,299
<i>and Goat Man stayed.</i>

42
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,859
<i>My mom hasn't paid
a bill in her entire life.</i>

43
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:38,139
<i>Yet somehow she always knows</i>

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,699
<i>how much money she
has in her trust fund.</i>

45
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,659
Ten more minutes.

46
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,300
I'm going away to school, Frieda.

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,300
I need you to listen
to Goat Man while I'm gone.

48
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,141
<i>This is my neighbor Aubrey.</i>

49
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:09,181
<i>She's hot, yes,</i>

50
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,740
<i>but at the risk
of sounding like a misogynist...</i>

51
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:13,020
I see you, Ellis!

52
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:14,900
What, are you jacking off back there?

53
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,540
<i>...she's sort of a rancid bitch.</i>

54
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:18,299
No, Frieda just stopped to eat.

55
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,542
- That's a goat.
- You're so dead!

56
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:24,461
Pervert!

57
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,580
Ignore the pain.

58
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:32,741
Luckily, her meat headed boyfriend
was barefoot.

59
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:36,341
Messed up feet
and a big cut on your forehead.

60
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:38,021
Not a very good send off.

61
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,621
Thanks, Goat Man.

62
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,381
Are you packed yet?

63
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,462
Yeah, I finished this morning.

64
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:48,341
I prepared a bag of buds for you.

65
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,743
That shit will cream your spinach.

66
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,022
Ever heard of security checks?

67
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:56,862
I'll mail it to you.

68
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,423
My roommate better be cool.

69
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:05,062
He could have the best weed
on the East Coast.

70
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,342
Probably a Facebook addict with halitosis.

71
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,223
My boy's leaving me tomorrow.

72
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:20,703
Leaving me for the big bad world
of Gates Academy.

73
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:23,383
Ellis, your feet are all red!

74
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,503
From my new hiking boots.

75
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,424
Figures Fucker Frank would send you
third-rate hiking boots.

76
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:31,904
- Tightwad.
- Those are, like, $300 boots from Italy.

77
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,183
I wish I had a pair.

78
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:35,064
That's not good parenting.

79
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,623
He should try calling
you once in a while,

80
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,303
at least pretend to care.

81
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,144
I ordered you 14 Oxford shirts.

82
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:42,824
You'll barely ever have to do laundry.

83
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:43,864
- Okay?
- Thanks.

84
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,985
Not to mention everything else
that I bought you.

85
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:47,664
I appreciate it.

86
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,705
You don't have to leave, you know.

87
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,705
You can still change your mind.

88
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,625
You act like I'm going off to war.

89
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:57,863
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

90
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:00,586
- I'm sad.
- You still have me.

91
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,025
Jav!

92
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:06,144
I paid 700 extra to
the electric company,

93
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:10,185
so you won't have to worry about that
for another three months.

94
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:13,186
All the other bills are paid,
and I renewed the insurance on the Volvo.

95
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:15,705
You don't even know
how much I'm going to miss you.

96
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:18,947
You don't know. You don't know.
You don't know.

97
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,466
I'm gonna miss you, too.

98
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,786
A lot.

99
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:50,827
Mom.

100
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:54,028
My flight's in two hours.

101
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:05,947
<i>The white zone is for</i>

102
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:08,388
<i>immediate loading
and unloading of passengers...</i>

103
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,508
You don't have to wait.

104
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:11,228
My flight's not, like, for another hour.

105
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:12,908
- You sure?
- Yeah.

106
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,508
Go on. The goats are roasting in there.

107
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:16,347
I'll be fine.

108
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,548
You take care of Wendy, all right?

109
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,428
- I'll call you once I get there...
- Don't worry.

110
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,828
Many rivers to cross, partner.

111
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,509
Bye, guys. Be good.

112
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,510
- I think Frieda ate a map.
- Bullshit.

113
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,629
Frieda!

114
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,828
Damn it.

115
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,271
<i>Wendy has referred to my father
as "Fucker Frank"</i>

116
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,190
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

117
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,830
<i>So you can imagine her reaction
when I told her</i>

118
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:13,390
<i>I had secretly applied
and was accepted here,</i>

119
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,430
<i>the same prep school he went to.</i>

120
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,751
So I heard this story
about this guy who went to Berkeley,

121
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:21,032
and every night when
he would go to sleep,

122
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:22,751
he would wake up
and his ass would be sore.

123
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,750
So after three months of this,
'cause it got really bad,

124
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,552
he decided to go to the doctor
and try to find out what's going on.

125
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,110
And the doctor said, "Well, have you
been having any anal sex lately?

126
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,112
"Because that's what it looks like
your ass has been doing. "

127
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,431
And the guy's like, "No, no. I'm straight.
Why would I be doing that?"

128
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,391
So the guy calls the cops to see if they
can maybe figure out what's going on,

129
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,272
and it turns out that his roommate

130
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,351
was knocking him out
with colorform every single night

131
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,271
and butt fucking him. Crazy, right?

132
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,351
Can I hang this on the door?

133
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:53,072
You must be Barney Cannel.

134
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:54,752
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,473
I was hoping Wilt Chamberlain there
was Barney Cannel.

136
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,632
How tall are you, son?

137
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,671
I was 5'10" last time I checked.

138
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:04,872
- I'm out of shape, though.
- Get in shape. Run for us.

139
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:06,992
I don't think I'd be any good.

140
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:09,433
Come on, don't tell me
you're not going to play any sports.

141
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:10,953
I haven't really thought about it.

142
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:12,313
Well, think about it.

143
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,314
Dough boy,
we practice every day from 3:00 to 4:00.

144
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,674
You miss two, you're off the team.

145
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,112
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:23,953
Where are you going to go to college?

147
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,354
My brother Todd, he goes to Yale.

148
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,114
That's where I'm going. Yale.

149
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,394
- Are you serious?
- Is that guy homeless?

150
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,793
No. He's a botanist.

151
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,675
And a goat trekker.

152
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,594
Is he your dad?

153
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:39,794
No.

154
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,475
You're only supposed to be buttoned up
for the convocation, moron.

155
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,035
Welcome to Gates, boys.

156
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,635
Hi, I'm Barney Cannel,
Todd Cannel's younger brother.

157
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:50,633
Right.

158
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,074
Todd told me to tell you
that he very much enjoys Yale.

159
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,315
Thank you.

160
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,714
- And you're Ellis Whitman?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:59,555
Dr. Eldridge.
We're happy to have you at Gates.

162
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:02,475
Your father Frank and I were roommates,
you know,

163
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,556
and I was lucky enough
to run with him senior year.

164
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,236
My father ran for student government?

165
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,275
He was class president,
but I meant cross-country.

166
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,675
We were on
the cross-country team together.

167
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,315
How is he?

168
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,756
He's fine, I guess.

169
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,556
You look like him, you know.

170
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:18,995
Tell him to give me a phone call, will you?

171
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:20,395
- Yeah, sure.
- See you, boys.

172
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:26,076
Hey, I didn't know
Eldridge and your dad boned.

173
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,157
<i>It's been 23 days
and four hours since I last got high.</i>

174
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:41,516
<i>The one kid I thought
was a stoner here</i>

175
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,437
<i>turned out to just be a slob.</i>

176
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,237
<i>There's no good Mexican food
in a 200-mile radius.</i>

177
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,318
<i>Goat Man's been incommunicado.</i>

178
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,876
<i>And when my classless,
Teletubby of a roommate</i>

179
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,236
<i>isn't whining about his grades,</i>

180
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,958
<i>he's copying my homework.</i>

181
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:56,558
Sorry.

182
00:10:58,438 --> 00:10:59,957
I shouldn't even be here.

183
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,278
Our secret.

184
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,879
You know that one girl
who works in the dining hall?

185
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,718
The one who Rosenberg says
is a prostitute?

186
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,399
That trashy townie chick?

187
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,879
She's always sneaking in the library
and using our shit.

188
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,038
Todd told me she is a prostitute.

189
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:24,639
She'll do juniors and seniors
for, like, 50 bucks.

190
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,679
Your brother's full of shit.

191
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,558
At least he's not a drug addict
who hangs out with goats all day.

192
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,639
Pot's not addictive.

193
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,239
Todd writes me and sends me letters.

194
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,398
Mr. Goat hasn't sent you shit.

195
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
His name's Goat Man, asshole.

196
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:01,723
Whitman. Come here.

197
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:05,282
I thought we weren't supposed
to talk to each other out here.

198
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,962
Only if you're going to go jerk off.

199
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,522
Rosenberg's from Maui.

200
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,523
He's one of three Jews on the island.

201
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,323
He can't seem to get better than a C
in any of his classes,

202
00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:17,203
but he's smart enough
to get his weed through airport security.

203
00:13:17,284 --> 00:13:19,282
Man, I knew you were a stoner.

204
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,524
- How?
- I saw your High Times calendar

205
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,164
and Barney said you smoke up
with your gardener.

206
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:28,683
He's not my gardener. He's...

207
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,284
Mr. Rosenberg.

208
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:32,645
Mr. Cannel's roommate.

209
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:38,284
Enjoying a little cannabis, I see and smell.

210
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:40,084
Just me, sir. Rosenberg didn't have any.

211
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,204
He was actually trying to convince me to...

212
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:42,604
I'll deal with you later.

213
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:45,485
I need a moment alone
to talk to the tall one.

214
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,724
Keep it moving.

215
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:51,966
Well.

216
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,405
Looks like you'll be enjoying
cross-country after all.

217
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,605
We practice at 3:00 tomorrow.

218
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:08,565
Pick it up, fellas. Pick it up!

219
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,445
I have bowels that run faster than you,
let's move!

220
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,046
Come on, Quadzilla, pick it up.

221
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,645
I can't.

222
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,806
You can't or you won't?

223
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:25,006
You weren't joking.
You really are out of shape, huh?

224
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,606
I have blisters.

225
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,327
Did those blisters stop you
from hiking into the woods

226
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:32,485
to smoke weed with Rosenberg?

227
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,966
Move it, move it, move it!

228
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,167
Five more hills, let's go!

229
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,606
Hounds misses Sharky.

230
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:47,767
Let go.

231
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:49,967
Her teeth!

232
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:55,926
Here comes Mrs. Sharky!

233
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:57,446
Let go!

234
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,208
That one scares me a little bit.

235
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,968
Who are you?

236
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,408
I'm Bennet, Wendy's lover.

237
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,728
Boy, oh, boy.

238
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,287
Oh, yeah.

239
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,969
Must be nice, Javier, living here.

240
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,688
Rent-free, just cleaning the pool.

241
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,128
Taking care of the landscaping. No worries.

242
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:27,008
It is nice.

243
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,609
That's your name, isn't it? Javier?

244
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,128
Sure.

245
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,649
That's so funny,
you don't look like a Javier.

246
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,129
Right, Wendy told me
about your goat treks.

247
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,129
Where do you go?

248
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,809
- I wander.
- Where?

249
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:45,209
I can't be specific.

250
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,130
Why not?

251
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,689
It's my job.

252
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,529
Hmm.

253
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,090
What do you do?

254
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,409
Uh...

255
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,490
I'm an artist.

256
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:00,011
Do you get high?

257
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:01,691
Oh!

258
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,770
I've moved beyond that.

259
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:05,931
Sadness.

260
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:12,451
Hey! Quit it, Lance!

261
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,569
It's about time.

262
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,371
What's up?

263
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:22,251
I got a package to mail.

264
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:24,891
Hey, is this enough stamps?

265
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:26,450
If this is what I think it is,
you might as well

266
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,172
just go check yourself
into prison right now.

267
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,292
Once I handed it to you,
I was home free.

268
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,051
Not even close.
How's Ellis out there, anyway?

269
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,610
I haven't heard from him yet,
but I'm sure he's okay.

270
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:36,892
What about all my stamps?

271
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:38,332
Peel them off.

272
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:40,571
Hey, you wanna get high?

273
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,492
I can't today.

274
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:47,172
Hey, leave it.

275
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,332
All right, come on, goats.

276
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:03,732
Shit!

277
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,053
I don't know why you're surprised.

278
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,613
All stoners are unreliable.
He's not going to send you anything.

279
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:12,653
Shut the hell up.

280
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:21,613
It just doesn't make any sense.

281
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:22,653
I haven't seen him in years,

282
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:24,213
and he thinks I'm just gonna
show up on his doorstep?

283
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:26,014
Well, at least your
dad sends you letters.

284
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,574
Mine's not allowed to.

285
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,614
Look, I'll be down there in DC
for Thanksgiving, too.

286
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,454
We can hang out and
party in Georgetown.

287
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,574
What are you going to do?

288
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:40,055
Sit around here and wait for pot
in the mail that probably won't come?

289
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:44,095
Don't stay here.

290
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:45,895
It's not gonna be any fun.

291
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:47,175
You're gonna do nothing.

292
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,895
And you're just gonna get depressed,
all right?

293
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,734
Come to DC with me.

294
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,054
What about her?

295
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:55,936
Go ahead and ask her.

296
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,655
We both will.

297
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,216
Excuse me, ma'am?

298
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,175
Please don't call me ma'am.
I'm barely 31.

299
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,096
May we ask you a favor?

300
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:09,695
Let me guess, you go to Gates,

301
00:18:09,777 --> 00:18:12,415
and you want me to buy you beer
or cigarettes or porno.

302
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:14,976
Just Budweiser.
A six pack of Budweiser.

303
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:21,096
Bottles or cans?

304
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,416
- Cans.
- Bottles.

305
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:23,856
Bottles.

306
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:28,096
Then she made me and Todd
watch a slide show on her laptop

307
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:31,216
of my dad kissing another man
on Poodle Beach in Rehoboth.

308
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,776
"There's your father, boys.

309
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,977
"There's your father and his boyfriend,
in love. "

310
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:39,377
Then she came over and made Todd say,

311
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,736
"My dad's a faggot. "

312
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:44,578
I wouldn't say it,
so she tried to move my jaw

313
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:47,498
and that's when she burnt me
with her cigarette.

314
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:50,977
By mistake.

315
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:54,977
- My mailman's gay.
- My dad's not gay.

316
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,818
That was just a phase.
He lives with some woman in Houston now.

317
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,217
I'm not allowed to see him.

318
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:04,738
I don't know if my dad's
in New York or DC.

319
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,378
- He's always with some new slut...
- I gotta pee.

320
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,339
Shit.

321
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,980
Fucker Frank.

322
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,819
Runners, come on, let's go.
Knees up!

323
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,261
Hello?

324
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,780
Who's this?

325
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:10,380
Let me talk to Wendy.

326
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:11,821
Tell me who this is.

327
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:21,981
Hello?

328
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,542
Is this 520-887-4311?

329
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,860
Who is this?

330
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:28,701
Put Goat Man on.

331
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:30,701
Tell me who this is.

332
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,742
My mom has a new asshole boyfriend.

333
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,543
She'll have a meltdown
if I go to Frank's.

334
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,663
So you'll stay here and eat
depressing meals with the teachers

335
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,462
and their grubby families?

336
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,342
Come to DC.

337
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:08,423
That one question where
you're supposed to find out

338
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:10,303
how many grandchildren
does Mrs. Smith have,

339
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:11,623
I kept getting negative six.

340
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,223
Yeah, Mrs. Smith and her grandchildren
can suck my dick.

341
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:16,543
Some dick got a 96
and messed up the curve.

342
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:19,744
Ellis and I studied our asses off all night,
and I only got a 73.

343
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:21,664
What'd you get, Ellis?

344
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:23,583
- Ninety-six.
- Douche.

345
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,064
Hey, here's my girl.

346
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:27,424
I see her here every Tuesday
and Thursday at this time.

347
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,703
Yeah, after she's done servicing
the juniors and seniors.

348
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:31,385
- You're an asshole, Barney.
- Shut the hell up.

349
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:34,025
Hi, Ellis.

350
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:35,224
Hey.

351
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:38,584
Ellis, how does
she know your name?

352
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:49,665
This is the doll.
She's brand new today, ladies.

353
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:52,625
We've done a version of Sasha before.

354
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:56,425
But this is a new configuration.

355
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,065
So it's the only day that...

356
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:00,345
Hello? Who is this?

357
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,626
Tell Wendy that I'm spending
Thanksgiving with Fucker Frank

358
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,064
and his girlfriend in Washington.

359
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,346
If she doesn't want me to,
she knows how to contact me.

360
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,986
And remind her that the Volvo
is supposed to be serviced this month.

361
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,306
So, this is Ellis?

362
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:15,306
Just tell her.

363
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,665
Oh, boy!

364
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:19,986
Mmm-hmm.

365
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,386
Ellis! Your mom just called.

366
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:32,827
She wants you to go to Tucson
for Thanksgiving, and not to go to DC.

367
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,426
So she calls now?

368
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:38,427
She sounded really stoned!

369
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,387
Come on. Let's go.

370
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,068
Oh, shit!

371
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:04,748
Could you come over here
and clean this, Javier?

372
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,188
I'll switch chairs.

373
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,948
Excuse me?

374
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,028
You just got to pick up the shards

375
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,548
and spray the juice with the hose
before it gets sticky.

376
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,468
- You broke the glass, not me.
- Yes?

377
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,149
Get up off your ass and clean it.
I'm busy with this bush.

378
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,748
Well, it's your job, not mine.

379
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,349
Hey, buddy, fuck you.

380
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:34,030
What did you say to me?

381
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,348
You're free-balling, man.

382
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,030
What?

383
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,069
One of your nuts wants out.

384
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:47,829
There you go.

385
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:51,311
I think that you and me and Wendy
need to have a talk

386
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,791
about your place around here.

387
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,869
You mean the pool house?

388
00:23:57,511 --> 00:24:01,510
- Oh! Who's awake!
- Me! Me! Yeah, I needed to sleep!

389
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:02,551
Yeah.

390
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:04,990
I've been so worried.
You know, Ellis never called.

391
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,391
The pool looks really nice, Javier.
It's so blue.

392
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,471
Aren't you the chick
that threw the rock at Ellis?

393
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:14,911
Yeah. So what?

394
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:18,112
- Besides, Ellis was spying.
- Come on.

395
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:19,751
I need to feel like a mom again.

396
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,872
It's been so long since Ellis left.

397
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:23,672
I'm going to take Aubrey to the mall.

398
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,271
I'll pick you up some of those
boxer shorts you like.

399
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:27,792
Mmm. What about me?

400
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,711
We'll get you a new swimsuit.

401
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:32,432
That is so sick!

402
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,231
And Bennet, clean up that juice mess
before the ants come.

403
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,033
What do you mean,
you're leaving right now?

404
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,112
It's Thanksgiving!

405
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:45,352
Stop, right now.
You need to behave.

406
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:46,833
Why do you have to go?

407
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:48,234
You know what,
because I need to go.

408
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,313
Please! This isn't fair!

409
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:50,632
It's totally fair.

410
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:53,952
Because you're acting out.
This is totally fair, now I feel justified.

411
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:01,073
She's such a bitch.

412
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,193
Tastes like ass.

413
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:17,074
You would know.

414
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:23,434
If your friend's sleeping over,

415
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:26,315
I don't want him touching anything
in the guest room.

416
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:29,235
I leave in two hours.
Don't touch anything.

417
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:31,034
The credit card is in the kitchen.

418
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:32,675
You can have Thanksgiving
at the Beckers'.

419
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:33,873
Fine.

420
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:37,555
At least you can do whatever you want
the whole weekend.

421
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:42,355
If she weren't so selfish, she would be
going to Paris on Monday instead.

422
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:46,715
My mom wrote the book on selfish.

423
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,115
Fuck.

424
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,396
- I'll call you later, okay?
- All right.

425
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:15,676
It's good to see you. You look tall.

426
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:18,916
I grew, I guess.

427
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:22,156
- You look different, too.
- Yeah?

428
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:23,156
Yeah.

429
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,837
Judy will be glad to know
that you think I look different.

430
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,557
She's been sort of
cultivating my new image.

431
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:33,796
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

432
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:38,597
I forgot to show you my store
back there on the right.

433
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:44,317
I actually sold all 48 stores
to a furniture conglomerate.

434
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:48,197
They're changing the name to Adobe,
which I think is dumb, but...

435
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,317
What do you do now?

436
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:56,358
I still... I keep pretty busy.

437
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,757
Yeah, I read a lot.

438
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,438
Yeah.

439
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,758
A senator from Georgia lived
in this house for 30 years in the 1800s.

440
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,118
That's actually a portrait of him there.

441
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,077
Dog lover, I guess.

442
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,559
Listen, about Judy and me,

443
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:19,798
the reason I wanted you to visit...

444
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,599
I thought I smelled it in the car.
Have you been drinking?

445
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,000
Hey, guys.

446
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,919
Ellis, it's so nice to finally meet you.

447
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,639
You, too.

448
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,559
Whoa. You been hitting
the bottle today?

449
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,960
That's what I thought.

450
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,319
Why don't you bring your bag upstairs?
It's the first bedroom on the left,

451
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,240
and then you can meet us at the table.

452
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:47,799
You can eat off any lingering inebriation.

453
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
He'll be okay.

454
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,441
I don't share Judy's cavalier attitude
about your drinking.

455
00:28:04,922 --> 00:28:07,721
I don't have a cavalier attitude.

456
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,520
Ellis, do you want some more stuffing?

457
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:13,081
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:15,201
Ellis, you can call me Judy.

459
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:24,001
You know, you're the one who's cavalier.
You're married again.

460
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,361
I'm gonna have a new brother or sister,
and you didn't even tell me.

461
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:28,482
Brother.

462
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:30,961
A new brother.

463
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,480
You're only 14 years old.

464
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:33,962
What were you drinking?

465
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,641
And where the hell
were this kid's parents anyway?

466
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:36,962
I'm 15 years old.

467
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:39,642
We were drinking scotch,
and Barney's mother's in Paris.

468
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:41,881
He never sees his father.

469
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,602
Is that supposed to mean something?

470
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,322
He spilled the scotch on me, by the way.

471
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:49,962
That's why you could smell it.
I barely had any.

472
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:53,163
Okay.

473
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:54,722
Excuse me.

474
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:04,203
Hey, Frank knows you're 15.

475
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:08,003
I mean, that's how he refers to you,
as his 15-year-old son.

476
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:11,163
He sent you those hiking boots
for your birthday last June.

477
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,444
I was with him when he bought them.

478
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:22,805
When he got your midterm grades,

479
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:26,204
he called to tell me about them. All As.

480
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:28,764
He said he never once
got all As at Gates.

481
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:31,685
He's proud of you, Ellis.

482
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,645
Whoa. No.

483
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:36,804
Thanks.

484
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:39,724
You've never heard of
Gates Academy? It's very famous.

485
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:40,924
It's very traditional.

486
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:46,525
No cell phones, no Internet in the dorms,

487
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:47,725
they force you to take Latin.

488
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:51,165
Tell Ellis not to worry.
I mean, Latin's a dead language.

489
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,125
- It's useless.
- I'm taking Spanish.

490
00:29:54,246 --> 00:29:55,965
Say something in Spanish, honey.

491
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,126
That one's smart.

492
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:02,805
She just said, "I want to eat cheese".

493
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:04,005
Sorry I'm late.

494
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:07,445
Ellis is with Frank, and he hasn't called.

495
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:09,165
He'll call.

496
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:11,407
- You stoned?
- No.

497
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,486
I told you I'm not.

498
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:14,846
I'm not.

499
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:18,926
I love your tie. It's so tribal.

500
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,607
Okay, everybody,

501
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:25,247
we are going veggie this year.

502
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:27,686
This is faux turkey.

503
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,607
- It smells wonderful.
- Tofu turkey. Who would've thought?

504
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:35,967
I wonder what kind of shit
they're feeding Ellis in Washington.

505
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:37,807
You promised. No Frank talk.

506
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:41,767
So, Javier, tell me about
the next goat trek you're planning.

507
00:30:42,528 --> 00:30:43,967
It's still in the works.

508
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:47,007
The goats are in training.
They're afraid of the water.

509
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:50,569
I'll be taking them up
to higher elevation soon, to snow.

510
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,207
Black and tan male
with the horns, Lance...

511
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:55,167
- Yeah, that's him.
- Lance. Yeah.

512
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:59,167
He bothers me when I'm reading
my paper by the pool. Very bad gas.

513
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,288
If goats don't fart,
their intestines will explode.

514
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,768
- I highly doubt it.
- No, I've seen it. A major mess.

515
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,650
I saw a baby goat once,
born inside out.

516
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:12,328
- Inside out.
- Gross!

517
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,768
You know, Jav, I think you may be
onto something with these goat treks.

518
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,768
Yeah, a return to the earth.

519
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:20,210
You know, I bet Johanna would love

520
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,489
to hear about these goat treks,
wouldn't she?

521
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,849
Wouldn't she? She's our spirit coach.

522
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,249
She's always interested
in new forms of spirit healing.

523
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,569
I'm not sure these treks
have healed my spirit.

524
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,010
I bet they have.

525
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,689
You didn't even notice,
'cause you're not in touch with your spirit.

526
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:35,809
It's a good point, Javier.

527
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,609
Oh!

528
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,011
What?

529
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:01,210
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom, it's me.

530
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:04,730
Ellis, I told you
I needed you here this weekend.

531
00:32:04,771 --> 00:32:06,850
Why didn't you at least
call me yesterday?

532
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,411
Ellis!
Do you want me to wash your fleece?

533
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:11,651
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

534
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:19,050
What does she look like?

535
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,571
It's not the same Judy.

536
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,931
It's not the same Judy?

537
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:24,810
This one's really nice and attractive.

538
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:26,531
Attractive?

539
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,773
Okay. How young is she?

540
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:30,892
I don't know.
Maybe a little younger than you.

541
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:32,692
Figures.

542
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,611
- What about Frank?
- He's fine, I guess.

543
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:39,693
He has new glasses. Poetry glasses.

544
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:42,292
Poetry glasses?

545
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:45,252
Hey, Ellis, Frank's home.
It's time to go.

546
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,572
Okay, thanks.

547
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,092
Hey, Mom. I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

548
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:50,693
Why?

549
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:53,492
Frank has some kind of tour planned.
He just got back.

550
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:58,934
You're making a big mistake.

551
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,053
Mom, I have to go.

552
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:07,734
- Bye. Okay?
- Fine.

553
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,653
I've been looking
for this record for years.

554
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:19,934
I can't even find it on the Internet.

555
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,494
Do you even have a turntable?

556
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:24,333
- Yeah, Goat Man got me one.
- Of course he did.

557
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:29,974
So, you like Judy?

558
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,694
Yeah, she's really nice.

559
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:35,894
Look, don't tell her I told you this,

560
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:37,255
but when you wrote for me
to come down here,

561
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:38,614
at first I thought you were talking
about the Judy

562
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:40,815
you brought to Tucson a few years ago.

563
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,535
- The loud obnoxious one...
- That was Trudy.

564
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,895
And she wasn't obnoxious.
She was nervous.

565
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:49,575
You know it was your mother
that kept me away from Tucson

566
00:33:49,656 --> 00:33:50,734
for all that time.

567
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,096
Every time I'd show up,
she'd start some new drama,

568
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:55,054
even if I didn't bring along a lady friend.

569
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:03,095
Does she still refer to me as
"Fucker Frank"?

570
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,496
- Hello.
- Can you put Wendy on the phone?

571
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:22,215
Who's calling?

572
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:25,176
You know who this is.
Just put her on the phone.

573
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,536
I can't. She went to a healing vortex
workshop in Sedona.

574
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:29,977
She won't be back till tomorrow.

575
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,457
Okay, when she gets back,
tell her I've gone on a trek,

576
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,736
backside of Mt. Lemmon.

577
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:35,818
Four days. She likes to know where I go.

578
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:39,297
Why? As far as I can tell,
she wouldn't care if you disappeared.

579
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:41,457
She's done
with your chemically-induced lifestyle.

580
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:46,698
I didn't ask for your response to that...
Hello?

581
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,617
Dick!

582
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:55,298
He's a dick!

583
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,460
Hey, guys.

584
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,740
You fuckers ate my weed!

585
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,501
That's it, you win!

586
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,940
We're going home.

587
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,461
Idiots.

588
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:57,103
Yikes.

589
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:11,183
You ordered the health food?

590
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,184
Dig in.

591
00:37:14,224 --> 00:37:15,425
Pizza.

592
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,464
Ugh. I already feel like a cow.

593
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:19,944
You're not a cow. Not even close.

594
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,263
He can come back anytime.

595
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:25,824
Hey, you know, you should really think
about joining us in Telluride this summer.

596
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:28,824
You can mountain bike and camp and swim.

597
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,703
And we'll have the baby by then.

598
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:35,785
Hello?

599
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:37,864
Hello. May I please speak
with Ellis Whitman?

600
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:38,905
Just a minute.

601
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:40,465
It's for you.

602
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,146
Is it my mother?

603
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:45,306
No, it's your roommate. He's very polite.

604
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,385
- What?
- I got pot!

605
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,028
I meant what I said about Telluride.

606
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,628
I think it'd be great
for you to come out this summer.

607
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:19,988
I don't think so.

608
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,630
- Frank, come on.
- Are you kidding, honey?

609
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,349
He shows up drunk for Thanksgiving dinner.

610
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,508
You sneak out last night
to do God knows what.

611
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,108
How are you going to stay in school?

612
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:31,510
I'm getting all As
except for an A- in Latin.

613
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:32,710
Mea culpa.

614
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,069
How do you expect me to do this
when you don't give a shit?

615
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,910
You don't give a shit, either.

616
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:44,190
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay. Guys?

617
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,069
All right.

618
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:57,869
You know,

619
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,591
if you were getting an inheritance
from your dad,

620
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,350
now you have to split it.

621
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:06,991
Haven't you had enough of that shit?

622
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:11,670
Don't tell me what to do.

623
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:28,631
You're gonna have
to wash those in the sink.

624
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:30,232
I can smell the alcohol from over here.

625
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,832
You can't leave them there,
we'll get busted.

626
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:37,272
- Go wash them in the sink.
- Fuck you, you're not my boss.

627
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:40,192
What's your problem?

628
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:41,712
Wash the fucking pants!

629
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:52,153
My award! You asshole!

630
00:41:02,554 --> 00:41:04,393
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get up!

631
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:06,873
Get up. Both of you calm down!

632
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:07,995
Are you okay?

633
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:15,233
Let's get to the bottom of this
so we can all get on with our lives.

634
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:17,073
Tell me what happened tonight.

635
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,635
Barney was being obnoxious,
so I tackled him.

636
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:20,794
And before that?

637
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:22,993
Barney was being obnoxious before that.

638
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,114
He means,
what did you do before the fight?

639
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,155
Like, were you and Barney
drinking any alcoholic beverages?

640
00:41:28,796 --> 00:41:31,353
I'm quite capable of expressing myself,
Mr. Rosenberg.

641
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:32,634
And why are you here, anyway?

642
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:34,835
I'm not feeling good.
I think I have the flu.

643
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:38,235
You can wait in the hall until I'm done
speaking with Whitman here.

644
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:42,114
But I'm suffering from FACT.
Fever, aches, chills, and tiredness.

645
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:43,514
The hall.

646
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:49,715
I'll tell you what happened.

647
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:53,275
You and Barney, Mr. Cannel.

648
00:41:53,356 --> 00:41:55,755
You and Mr. Cannel
were drinking on the bus.

649
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:58,556
You argued, you started to fight,

650
00:41:58,597 --> 00:42:01,876
you threw his award against the wall,
and he kicked you in the testicles.

651
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,756
That sounds pretty close, sir.

652
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,356
I've looked at your midterm reports,
Mr. Whitman. You're doing well.

653
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:12,436
- I study a lot.
- Mmm-hmm.

654
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:17,196
So tell me about your visit with
your father. How's he doing?

655
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,836
Okay.

656
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:24,756
Now, business.

657
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:26,877
No more weekend privileges,

658
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:28,837
and you're going to have
sequestered detention dinners

659
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,077
until next semester.

660
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:31,996
And, of course, you know
I'm going to have to call

661
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:33,957
your mother in Texas
to inform her of this incident.

662
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:36,156
- I live in Arizona, sir.
- Of course. Phoenix.

663
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:37,998
- Tucson.
- You bet.

664
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:00,759
Hi, Wendy.

665
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,559
Get down here and roll.

666
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,478
Listen to your body, Javier.
You know, it's good stress therapy.

667
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,718
No, thanks.

668
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,600
I was wondering if...

669
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,519
You know where your checks are?

670
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,398
If I could maybe...
I was thinking I could...

671
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,919
I could write myself one,

672
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,839
for, you know, last month.

673
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,159
I ordered that Fortunella japonica,

674
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:30,280
the kumquat bush for outside
the den window.

675
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,399
The headmaster called
from Gates this morning.

676
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,639
Ellis did some drinking
on the way back to school

677
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,840
from his stay with Fucker Frank.

678
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:45,120
He and his roommate got into a fistfight.

679
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:50,000
And I have to write a check for $700
to patch a wall that Ellis broke.

680
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:53,320
I can't see Ellis in a fight like that.
Is he okay?

681
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:56,161
No, of course he's not all right.
What do you think?

682
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,761
After a weekend with Frank,
I'm sure he's a total wreck.

683
00:44:00,482 --> 00:44:03,360
The headmaster also said that Ellis
has the highest grades in his class.

684
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:05,921
They're turning him into a Frank clone.

685
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:09,001
They're already talking to me
about colleges.

686
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,440
- He's only 15.
- I know.

687
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,561
He shouldn't have to worry about
things like that.

688
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:16,002
I can't take care of him from here, Javier.
I can't.

689
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:17,481
I can't do it.

690
00:44:17,564 --> 00:44:18,841
I miss him.

691
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:23,200
I miss him so. I miss him
way more than I thought. Way more.

692
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,802
- How are the bills and stuff?
- That's not why I miss him.

693
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:29,121
I'm a mother
and my son is 3,000 miles away.

694
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:30,922
I am missing a piece of myself.

695
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:33,241
He'll be home soon.

696
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:38,243
Johanna said that mothers and sons,
even though we share the same blood,

697
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:41,161
can sometimes be as cosmically distant

698
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:43,402
as two strangers on different continents.

699
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:48,403
I don't see why a mother should be
concerned about relating cosmically.

700
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:49,843
You should just call him up,

701
00:44:50,444 --> 00:44:54,844
and ask him about school, food, girls.

702
00:44:56,963 --> 00:44:59,282
I should really just be mainstream?

703
00:45:00,123 --> 00:45:01,403
Sure.

704
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:12,363
Sorry, nothing came for you.

705
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:15,044
Thanks.

706
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,683
You can check again tomorrow.

707
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:26,965
Hey.

708
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:34,085
Someone hasn't been
at dinner in a while.

709
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:37,325
I got sequestered detention dinners
until next semester.

710
00:45:39,246 --> 00:45:41,004
I never took you for a bad boy.

711
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:48,045
- You're always in here.
- I'm not illiterate.

712
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:55,445
I'm working my way through a list
of the 100 best novels of all time.

713
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:01,685
This is my third favorite book.

714
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:04,006
The Great Gatsby.

715
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,445
My second's To Kill a Mockingbird.

716
00:46:13,527 --> 00:46:15,647
All right. What's your favorite?

717
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,566
Wouldn't you like to know.

718
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:39,967
You know, you can play your music louder.
I don't mind.

719
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:42,648
Thanks.

720
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,448
I'm gonna fail algebra tomorrow,

721
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,008
and I'm gonna fail history on Wednesday,

722
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:10,049
and I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.

723
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,729
I guess you're not going to Yale.

724
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,849
I probably deserve it
for kicking you in the nuts.

725
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,729
That was a cheap kick.

726
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,530
I'm sorry.

727
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:23,849
I just...

728
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,929
I can't even do completing the square

729
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:28,209
and I only know
the first cycle of the Krebs cycle

730
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,890
and all the kings in history seem the same.
And I just...

731
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:33,049
I don't know what to do anymore.

732
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,449
I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.
I'm never gonna do anything.

733
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:57,850
Here's a good trick for history
that Goat Man taught me, all right.

734
00:47:57,931 --> 00:48:00,331
See this portrait of Pope Leo X?

735
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:02,130
Mmm-hmm.

736
00:48:02,771 --> 00:48:06,610
Look at him.
Remember his name and read what he did,

737
00:48:07,013 --> 00:48:09,290
then imagine him doing it. Okay?

738
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:34,372
You know, I owe you one.
You really saved my ass.

739
00:48:36,173 --> 00:48:37,133
I know.

740
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:40,492
I'm going to study over break,
so I'm not such a loser next semester.

741
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:45,812
I'm gonna float on a raft in the pool
and smoke a bale of pot

742
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:49,453
and go running a lot.

743
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:52,053
- Won't the pot cancel out the running?
- Hey, bad boy!

744
00:48:53,574 --> 00:48:55,173
Merry Christmas.

745
00:48:58,294 --> 00:49:00,854
You know, Smythe and VanBuren
were in the car with Minnie.

746
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:05,133
She's probably giving them a ride
to the bus station or something.

747
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:07,253
I bet she's giving them a ride.

748
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:10,013
The water's nice.

749
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:12,494
It's nice and warm.

750
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:14,454
I love the water.

751
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,814
Yes. Yeah.

752
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,093
Okay, boy.

753
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:19,214
Right there.

754
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,614
Good boy.

755
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:22,975
There you go.

756
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:28,934
You have pretty nice arms for a stoner.

757
00:49:31,696 --> 00:49:32,655
Oh, hey.

758
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:35,334
What are you doing?

759
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:38,455
The goats hate water,
so I'm training them not to.

760
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:42,015
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there's no water in there.

761
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:44,814
Well, you obviously
know nothing about training goats.

762
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:46,614
First they have to get used to the pool.

763
00:49:47,695 --> 00:49:49,136
What are you doing later?

764
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:52,735
You sure are nosy.

765
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:55,616
I just want to know
what makes you tick, Javier.

766
00:49:56,257 --> 00:49:57,937
For example, what are those?

767
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:05,255
Ever hear of art?

768
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:10,896
Bennet and Wendy are in Sedona

769
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:13,977
on that New Age bullshit
spirit workshop, right?

770
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:17,456
When do they get back?

771
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:43,818
That was quick.
I was just getting comfortable.

772
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:49,498
What do you do?

773
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,859
What do you do all day?

774
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:55,177
Do?

775
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,419
You know, I do the landscaping.

776
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:07,098
Work with the goats.

777
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,458
Clean the pool.

778
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,578
Don't you get bored?

779
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,620
Well, I do other stuff.

780
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,339
Like get high all day?

781
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:29,780
Is it true what they say
about you and your goats?

782
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,940
That you know them
in the biblical sense?

783
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:35,619
It's not true.

784
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,820
I hate my goats.

785
00:52:00,502 --> 00:52:01,461
What the hell?

786
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:04,461
- Sorry. Are you Ellis?
- Give me my bag!

787
00:52:04,502 --> 00:52:05,541
Pervert.

788
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,661
Oh! Oh!

789
00:52:06,743 --> 00:52:08,141
I'm not a pervert, I'm Bennet.

790
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:21,421
Wendy?

791
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,622
Mom?

792
00:52:24,262 --> 00:52:25,302
Ellis.

793
00:52:25,663 --> 00:52:27,462
You scared the hell out of me, Ellis.

794
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:29,382
Sorry.

795
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:34,101
I've had these miserable headaches
since September.

796
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:38,782
Starts in my heart, goes around my head,

797
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,823
and back down to my heart.

798
00:52:45,223 --> 00:52:48,383
Come here, come give your mom a hug
and tell me how was your trip.

799
00:52:52,424 --> 00:52:54,744
- I slept on my flights.
- Yeah.

800
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:58,824
Did you miss me?

801
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:04,102
- Of course I missed you.
- I couldn't tell.

802
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:18,704
Yeah, that's it.
Toke the fat pappy, girlie.

803
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:20,984
Hey, Ellis!

804
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:22,743
Aubrey?

805
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:24,065
That's my bong.

806
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:29,464
I thought your plane
didn't get in till tonight.

807
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:46,465
Lance, leave it!

808
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:49,146
Lance, quit it!

809
00:53:55,228 --> 00:53:57,506
I can't even get him to follow me.

810
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,825
Maybe he's disappointed in you.

811
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:06,747
- I know you think I'm a traitor, but...
- She's not even half your age.

812
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:10,586
She looks older, you have to admit.

813
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:17,466
You could have at least written me
or something.

814
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:18,586
Yeah.

815
00:54:21,866 --> 00:54:23,787
I'm bad at that.

816
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:27,067
Sorry.

817
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:29,306
And Bennet.

818
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:32,587
You should have warned me about him.

819
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,667
Yeah.

820
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:36,387
He's a royal dick.

821
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:42,668
Hey, I'm going on this big trek
the day after Christmas.

822
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,908
Down into Mexico.

823
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:47,468
You want to come, partner?

824
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:50,788
I don't know.

825
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,588
Frieda, come on.

826
00:55:57,392 --> 00:55:58,911
- Ellis!
- Hi, Jonathan.

827
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:00,630
How's the fancy prep school?

828
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,912
It's fancy. I study a lot.

829
00:56:02,952 --> 00:56:04,991
I got blackmailed
into running cross-country.

830
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:06,711
- What about the girls?
- What girls?

831
00:56:07,112 --> 00:56:09,031
- It's all boys.
- Exactly!

832
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:13,831
Did the Goat Man have any luck
sending you any provisions?

833
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:16,991
He tried sending something
via US Mail, but I stopped it.

834
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:17,992
Really?

835
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:20,511
It isn't worth the risk these days.

836
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:38,432
We have to make this fast!

837
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,673
Because your Spanish is horrible.

838
00:56:47,553 --> 00:56:49,473
It's past 6:00 already.
I should be home wrapping presents.

839
00:56:49,514 --> 00:56:50,553
I appreciate it.

840
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:52,554
You haven't shown me
how much you appreciate it.

841
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:55,433
I appreciate it this much.

842
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:00,994
What have you been
getting up to lately anyway?

843
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:07,593
I've been breeding non-eco intrusive goats
for the biosphere.

844
00:57:07,914 --> 00:57:09,874
Plus some rescue goats

845
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:14,074
that are trained to sniff survivors
out of the rubble in a disaster,

846
00:57:14,114 --> 00:57:16,194
should there be a disaster. Disaster goats.

847
00:57:16,836 --> 00:57:18,434
- Sounds important.
- I'm going to make this easy for you.

848
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:20,833
Just use the clippers. Just, you know...

849
00:57:21,475 --> 00:57:23,594
- You sure?
- Yeah, make me look like Steve McQueen.

850
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:28,074
I'm a scientist.

851
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:29,716
Not a hippie.

852
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:31,595
- No, olives are a party favor.
- When's the last time

853
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:32,675
you got olives as a party favor?

854
00:57:32,756 --> 00:57:34,474
That's 10 points
because it's a double word.

855
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:36,035
Ah! Mexican casserole!

856
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:38,995
"H." A party favor that begins with "H."

857
00:57:40,196 --> 00:57:41,636
- "Hookah. "
- That's a foreign word.

858
00:57:41,676 --> 00:57:42,835
It doesn't count.

859
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:44,715
Sorry I'm late.

860
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:49,796
- I'm cleaning up my act.
- Ooh!

861
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:52,355
You look amazing.

862
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:54,076
Let me touch. Touchy-feely.

863
00:57:54,118 --> 00:57:56,036
Hi, baby.

864
00:57:57,236 --> 00:57:59,237
Okay, if everybody's done
fawning over Goat Man,

865
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:00,997
hookah is a foreign word,
so that's doesn't count.

866
00:58:01,037 --> 00:58:03,196
I'll look it up in the dictionary,
the English dictionary,

867
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:04,995
- if you really want to challenge.
- Yeah, challenge. Yeah.

868
00:58:06,477 --> 00:58:08,996
Bennet. Bennet, honey,
you're going to lose your turn.

869
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:12,917
- "Hookah, an Oriental tobacco pipe... "
- Oriental.

870
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:15,676
"... with a long flexible tube
that draws the smoke through the water

871
00:58:15,717 --> 00:58:17,475
- "in a tin bowl".
- So that's still a foreign word.

872
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:19,357
No, but it's in
the English dictionary.

873
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:22,557
- Like "charlatan" is.
- Yeah.

874
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:24,997
Or "gigolo".

875
00:58:25,477 --> 00:58:27,717
Or "fellatio".

876
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:31,158
Honey, you lose your turn.

877
00:58:31,398 --> 00:58:32,477
All right, okay.

878
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:33,997
Honey!

879
00:58:34,158 --> 00:58:35,237
Hey, hey, honey.

880
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,317
"Hissy," noun.

881
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,439
- "A fit of anger. Temper tantrum. "
- Hey, hey, hey.

882
00:58:38,479 --> 00:58:40,517
Hey, you know what,
that's the kind of snarky bullshit

883
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,518
that Frank used to pull all the time.

884
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,398
My God, you are turning into him.
You're turning into him.

885
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:48,559
Wait, are you talking about Fucker Frank?

886
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,039
You know, you never finished
telling me that story...

887
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:51,078
- Aubrey! Aubrey!
- I know.

888
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,677
Well, you want to know more
about Fucker Frank, ask Ellis.

889
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:55,158
He's his new best friend.

890
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:58,039
And she should know the hell
that that man put me through.

891
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,239
And now he sends you an old sweatshirt
and everything is hunky-dory?

892
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,237
I bought you a $2,000 mountain bike,

893
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,760
and you don't have the
decency to try it out.

894
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,959
- I said thank you, like, 100 times.
- I didn't hear it.

895
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,359
- Feelings check.
- Did you hear it?

896
00:59:11,399 --> 00:59:14,039
Feelings check.

897
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:16,839
I feel that you might
be reacting negatively.

898
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:18,919
- Feelings check.
- Right, Wendy? Feelings check.

899
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,919
Feelings check. Shut the hell up!

900
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,759
You know, marrying that man was
the worst decision I have ever made.

901
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:30,920
Why don't you tell Aubrey about the time
that you and Frank got in a fight

902
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,680
and how you disappeared for six days?

903
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,759
And he had to find you
living in a cheap motel?

904
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:37,001
- So?
- Or why don't you tell everyone

905
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:39,321
why Frank never visits Tucson anymore?

906
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:41,720
How you hid the keys to his rental car
and made him miss his flight.

907
00:59:41,802 --> 00:59:45,201
Okay, I don't need to be attacked
by my own son!

908
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,921
Fucking genetics!

909
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,762
You are the biggest, selfish prick
I have ever met!

910
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:51,401
Bigger than your fucking father!

911
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,240
Mister, you are coming with me
to Sedona tomorrow,

912
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,642
and you are going to do that workshop
with Johanna!

913
00:59:58,123 --> 01:00:01,001
Yes, you are! No more fucking goat treks!

914
01:00:01,082 --> 01:00:02,442
Good job.

915
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:17,801
Listen, this is a special trek.

916
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:19,882
We're on a mission of philanthropy.

917
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:23,082
- What do you mean?
- We're helping a refugee

918
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:25,561
from Honduras into the United States.

919
01:00:26,524 --> 01:00:28,123
That's illegal, isn't it?

920
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:31,002
She's a political refugee.

921
01:00:32,843 --> 01:00:34,482
- You're joking, right?
- No.

922
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:36,882
My cousin Jesus set it up.

923
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:42,762
Is Jesus real Mexican or fake Mexican,
like you?

924
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:45,804
Fake Mexican?
What does that mean, fake Mexican?

925
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:49,162
Yeah, you know how you make
everyone call you Javier

926
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:51,724
even though your real name's Stephen
and you're Irish-Italian.

927
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,684
I don't make everyone call me Javier.

928
01:00:56,884 --> 01:00:58,164
They just do.

929
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:02,523
How are we gonna get the goats
across the border?

930
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:05,164
No one's gonna stop us.

931
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:06,804
Getting them to Mexico is no problem,

932
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:08,804
we'll be crossing the desert
on the way back.

933
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:30,285
After we meet Jesus at the Super Puerco,

934
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:31,884
we can party all night.

935
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:34,926
Don't use "party" as a verb.
It sounds vulgar.

936
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:39,165
Vulgar in the common, pedestrian sense,
not in the obscene sense.

937
01:01:39,246 --> 01:01:41,165
I knew what you meant by "vulgar".

938
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:44,045
The bar's either to the
left or to the right.

939
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:46,166
That's helpful.

940
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:56,366
Try to look presentable.

941
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:57,566
Like me.

942
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:15,247
Jesus!

943
01:02:16,929 --> 01:02:18,247
What the fuck do you want?

944
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:21,687
It's me, Javier.
I cleaned up for the trek.

945
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,127
You look like a cop, man.

946
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,487
Who's the kid?

947
01:02:25,968 --> 01:02:27,888
This is Ellis. He's good with the goats.

948
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:32,367
Go outside and wait with the goats.

949
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:39,927
All right.

950
01:02:43,329 --> 01:02:45,008
Can we do this in English?

951
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,687
Those are the ugliest dogs I've ever seen.

952
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,329
Thanks.

953
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,369
Get out of here, please.

954
01:02:58,928 --> 01:03:00,608
Sorry about Jesus.

955
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:03,289
Isn't Jesus married with some kids?

956
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,248
Those prostitutes were, like, my age.

957
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,569
- Where's the refugee?
- Hmm?

958
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,249
The refugee?

959
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:11,728
She had to go back to Tegucigalpa.

960
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,649
Family issues.

961
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,169
So this whole thing was a waste of time?

962
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,530
No, this was a good practice run.

963
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,410
You're setting it up in a wash?
That's dumb.

964
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,131
They're rain clouds.

965
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:34,850
If you're so concerned
about being spotted,

966
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:36,851
why the hell do you have
a bright orange tent?

967
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,770
- I'm starving.
- Frieda's right there. She's full of milk.

968
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:44,051
I'm looking for my power bars
and I find your sandwich, cheater.

969
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:46,890
What about Javier's golden rule
of goat trekking?

970
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,891
- Goat milk only.
- Hey! Put that back!

971
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,490
Jesus.

972
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:57,411
This wasn't my idea.

973
01:03:58,212 --> 01:04:00,370
Not everyone is as
fortunate as you, Ellis.

974
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:03,572
Wendy and Bennet might kick me out,
and I don't have any money!

975
01:04:07,813 --> 01:04:10,331
There never was a refugee, was there?

976
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:13,852
I swear, you don't know what it's like
having to ask Wendy for money.

977
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:15,812
Then get a job like a normal person!

978
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:18,211
I'm not a normal person.

979
01:04:19,852 --> 01:04:21,293
Come on, let's go. Pack up the tent.

980
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,772
We'll camp somewhere else.

981
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:25,052
Let's go.

982
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:26,933
Would you just give me a second?

983
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:28,453
- Come on. Get up.
- Get your hands off me.

984
01:04:33,094 --> 01:04:35,173
Damn it! Lance!

985
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:40,774
Lance!

986
01:04:43,573 --> 01:04:44,693
Goat Man.

987
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:01,013
Goat Man!

988
01:05:04,454 --> 01:05:05,653
Goat Man.

989
01:05:59,617 --> 01:06:00,776
Goat Man's going to be okay.

990
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,977
- Ellis, sweetie!
- That goat's not riding in my Jeep.

991
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:13,576
Are you okay?

992
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,616
Did Goat Man call?

993
01:06:19,898 --> 01:06:22,977
The healing workshops were great.
Thanks for asking.

994
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:26,057
Aren't you even the slightest bit
worried about him?

995
01:06:26,657 --> 01:06:30,298
The Hopi shaman at the workshop
said that I worry too much.

996
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:32,537
Yeah, about yourself!

997
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:36,778
Okay, I can't leak my energy right now
worrying about Goat Man.

998
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:40,538
I have been advised to let it pool inward.

999
01:06:41,659 --> 01:06:43,737
Frank and Judy are married
and they're having a baby.

1000
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,138
He's lying, hon. He's trying to hurt you.

1001
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,619
Let's go.

1002
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,979
Okay, I know you're at Gates.

1003
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:27,499
I know you're smart.

1004
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:30,301
You make pretty good decisions.

1005
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:33,700
But I do worry about you.

1006
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,099
All the time.

1007
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:39,581
I'm your mother.

1008
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:44,460
And just so you know,

1009
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:47,901
I was on the phone
with Johanna and the shaman,

1010
01:07:47,983 --> 01:07:51,780
and without me telling anything
about what happened,

1011
01:07:52,141 --> 01:07:56,380
the shaman mentioned
that Goat Man knows the desert

1012
01:07:57,902 --> 01:08:00,622
and knows how to survive.

1013
01:08:02,502 --> 01:08:03,622
Okay?

1014
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:06,181
And notice,

1015
01:08:06,943 --> 01:08:09,341
I haven't said anything about Frank

1016
01:08:10,143 --> 01:08:11,582
or his child bride.

1017
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:50,303
- May I please speak to my mother?
- Who is this?

1018
01:08:50,385 --> 01:08:52,383
How many children does Wendy have?

1019
01:08:52,944 --> 01:08:54,623
- Did he call?
- Who?

1020
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:56,064
Don't be a prick!

1021
01:08:56,225 --> 01:09:00,063
You never even bother to ask
about me or your mother. That is rude.

1022
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:02,185
Did Goat Man call or not?

1023
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:04,463
Well, I have a slight cold,
and your mother...

1024
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:11,904
Maybe you should have Señor Levy
call the police in Mexico and ask

1025
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:13,984
- if they've heard anything...
- I'm sure Goat Man's fine.

1026
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,224
Stop whining about him already.

1027
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:17,024
Line up, girls!

1028
01:09:20,146 --> 01:09:21,584
Eat my shit.

1029
01:09:34,386 --> 01:09:35,426
Quick one.

1030
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,026
Not bad, Whitman.

1031
01:09:48,547 --> 01:09:50,546
Did you have PE today?

1032
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:52,586
Did you get sweaty?

1033
01:09:55,668 --> 01:09:57,707
We should get drunk and go see that,
that'd be awesome.

1034
01:09:57,787 --> 01:09:59,306
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

1035
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:06,306
Nice bike. Is that carbon fiber?

1036
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:07,747
Yeah, I think so.

1037
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:09,826
Give it to me.

1038
01:10:09,908 --> 01:10:10,946
What?

1039
01:10:18,788 --> 01:10:19,867
Ellis!

1040
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:21,507
Ellis.

1041
01:10:21,668 --> 01:10:23,266
Oh, no.

1042
01:10:25,548 --> 01:10:26,947
Come on, sit up.

1043
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,028
Sit up.

1044
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:59,109
I read To Kill a Mockingbird.

1045
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:04,230
And at first I thought
Atticus was sort of self-righteous.

1046
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,270
But by the end...

1047
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,749
You think there are people
like Atticus Finch in real life?

1048
01:11:15,231 --> 01:11:16,431
I hope so.

1049
01:11:38,231 --> 01:11:39,750
Enjoy the Percocets.

1050
01:11:42,232 --> 01:11:43,352
Bye.

1051
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:46,150
Once you have made a cut
around the eyeball,

1052
01:11:46,191 --> 01:11:47,950
separate the eye into two halves.

1053
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:49,911
Let the vitreous humor
and any associated structure...

1054
01:11:49,992 --> 01:11:51,711
Barney, we're already on step six.

1055
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:53,632
Can I finish? This is step seven.

1056
01:11:53,672 --> 01:11:55,671
- Can I finish reading?
- I'm already done.

1057
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:57,551
You may need to tease the vitreous humor

1058
01:11:57,632 --> 01:11:59,512
gently away from the
lining of the eye.

1059
01:11:59,592 --> 01:12:01,750
I think I'm just gonna
cut the retina. Yeah.

1060
01:12:01,832 --> 01:12:03,591
That's definitely not the retina.

1061
01:12:03,913 --> 01:12:05,392
It doesn't look like
you're doing anything right.

1062
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:07,831
- I got it.
- Wait, no, no, that's the cornea.

1063
01:12:07,992 --> 01:12:09,591
No, that's the cornea, you moron.

1064
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:12,312
Careful, you don't want
to blind that cow forever.

1065
01:12:13,153 --> 01:12:14,152
What are you doing here?

1066
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:18,192
I felt like taking a drive, I guess.

1067
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:19,311
What happened to your head?

1068
01:12:20,872 --> 01:12:23,152
He got bike-jacked. Four stitches.

1069
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,512
By a townie.
They hate all Gates students.

1070
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:26,832
What do you mean?

1071
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:28,791
It's fine. It's healing quickly.
Where's the photo?

1072
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:34,313
I'd like to introduce you
to your new brother,

1073
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:36,233
Gabriel.

1074
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:39,592
He looks like Judy.

1075
01:12:39,714 --> 01:12:42,434
Actually, he's a dead ringer for you
when you were a baby.

1076
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:50,233
You know, it's a known fact that all babies
look like old Jewish men.

1077
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,674
Oh, boy, go easy on me.

1078
01:12:57,675 --> 01:12:58,913
Senior year.

1079
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:02,114
It's not as dorky as I thought.

1080
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:06,233
Wait, Latin club? Young Historians?

1081
01:13:07,195 --> 01:13:08,314
I was only in those for my dad,

1082
01:13:08,394 --> 01:13:11,714
who was convinced I was too stupid
to get into college on grades alone.

1083
01:13:12,515 --> 01:13:13,515
- Really?
- Yeah.

1084
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,515
- Eldridge said you were a brain.
- No.

1085
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:18,514
When I was admitted to Princeton,
my father said,

1086
01:13:18,715 --> 01:13:22,275
"Everyone wins the lottery once.
Don't blow this, Frank. "

1087
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:28,635
Ellis, do you like it here?

1088
01:13:30,235 --> 01:13:33,675
I mean, you know you can go back
to Tucson, or you could even come to DC.

1089
01:13:33,716 --> 01:13:35,875
There are a lot of good day schools there.

1090
01:13:37,756 --> 01:13:39,195
- Really?
- Yeah.

1091
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,076
I like it here, though.

1092
01:13:42,676 --> 01:13:43,757
We have our first meet next week.

1093
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:47,915
Coach put me on the varsity team.
I'm actually pretty fast.

1094
01:13:48,236 --> 01:13:49,394
Really?

1095
01:13:50,037 --> 01:13:53,956
Yeah, that was my room
junior and senior years.

1096
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:56,076
- You lived in Stillwell?
- Yeah.

1097
01:13:56,157 --> 01:13:57,515
It's all nerds now.

1098
01:13:57,557 --> 01:14:00,436
It was all nerds then, too.
You saw my yearbook photos.

1099
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,317
You think Goat Man's all right?

1100
01:14:04,677 --> 01:14:07,956
Disappearing for a few months
is a very Goat Man thing to do.

1101
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:11,756
- What about Wendy?
- Why?

1102
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:15,397
I don't know. She seems weird.

1103
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:17,676
She never returns my calls.

1104
01:14:18,157 --> 01:14:21,357
She's really into New Age spirituality
and freaks out a lot.

1105
01:14:21,438 --> 01:14:24,396
Well, when I first met her,
she was really into The Grateful Dead

1106
01:14:24,438 --> 01:14:26,117
and she freaked out a lot.

1107
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,518
Ellis, I've always had a hard time
with your mom,

1108
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,118
but that's not an excuse.

1109
01:14:32,278 --> 01:14:34,598
I'm sorry I've been absent from your life.

1110
01:14:38,038 --> 01:14:39,078
Thanks.

1111
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:44,597
I'm sure you've had your fill
of the Gates food,

1112
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:47,718
so we'll go out for dinner tonight.
Barney, too, if he wants.

1113
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:51,920
Are you sure you want to invite Barney?

1114
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,638
So Yale's application process
is really tough,

1115
01:14:54,678 --> 01:14:57,158
but I've been studying hard,
and Ellis has been helping me out a lot,

1116
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,319
so I think I've got a really good shot
of getting in.

1117
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,039
But if I don't get into Yale,
I'm gonna try for Tufts.

1118
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:05,199
It's a little early to be
worrying about college, isn't it?

1119
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,278
This isn't the right way to the restaurant.

1120
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,759
Yeah, we got a little business
to take care of before dinner.

1121
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,599
I'll talk reasonably to his parents
and if I don't make any progress,

1122
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,959
I'll call the police.

1123
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,680
- Hello.
- Yes?

1124
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,760
I've come to retrieve my son's bicycle.

1125
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,240
I believe you assaulted him and...

1126
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,480
Mr. Whitman,
are you still taking us to dinner?

1127
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:42,960
Thanks for coming.

1128
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:45,840
Thanks for getting my bike back.

1129
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,201
Think about Telluride this summer.

1130
01:15:48,762 --> 01:15:50,321
Judy would love it if you were there.

1131
01:15:50,402 --> 01:15:51,600
I mean, I would, too.

1132
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:56,561
Actually, so would your brother
if he could distinguish shapes.

1133
01:15:57,842 --> 01:15:58,842
I will.

1134
01:15:59,442 --> 01:16:00,801
Oh, I almost forgot.

1135
01:16:02,242 --> 01:16:03,921
It's a prospectus for my new company.

1136
01:16:04,202 --> 01:16:06,522
Solar panel technology for vehicles.

1137
01:16:07,202 --> 01:16:09,922
I assembled a team of geniuses,
aside from myself.

1138
01:16:11,204 --> 01:16:13,001
I didn't want you to think
I wasn't doing anything.

1139
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:15,601
I'll look through it.

1140
01:16:21,884 --> 01:16:23,363
Good luck with the race next week.

1141
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:26,563
I'm really proud of you, Ellis.

1142
01:16:27,244 --> 01:16:28,243
Thanks.

1143
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:30,603
See you soon.

1144
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:41,364
You got a package.

1145
01:16:41,444 --> 01:16:43,442
You're studying history already?

1146
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:44,962
Who's it from?

1147
01:16:54,564 --> 01:16:55,604
Goat Man!

1148
01:16:57,205 --> 01:16:58,564
It's from Goat Man!

1149
01:17:03,525 --> 01:17:04,723
Close the door.

1150
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:10,804
Well, of course!
Look at what's happening!

1151
01:17:10,885 --> 01:17:12,685
Bullshit. You're a liar.

1152
01:17:12,726 --> 01:17:14,924
- You're a liar. You're a big, fat liar.
- It's the only thing.

1153
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:18,365
I can't help but think that if you could
just corral your energy, just redirect it,

1154
01:17:18,446 --> 01:17:20,685
- then you wouldn't be doing this.
- No matter how I redirect my energy,

1155
01:17:20,726 --> 01:17:22,245
you will always be a pig.

1156
01:17:22,326 --> 01:17:23,684
The jig is up. Leave.

1157
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:25,964
- It's disgusting to think...
- But I still have to go through with it.

1158
01:17:26,005 --> 01:17:28,125
- ... that you would put...
- 'Cause I've got to put food in my mouth!

1159
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:33,285
...your slimy penis into me after that.
That's disgusting!

1160
01:17:33,366 --> 01:17:34,524
- Get out of my face!
- All this...

1161
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:35,925
- Get out of my face, you slut.
- ... seems so drastic.

1162
01:17:36,006 --> 01:17:38,007
You're a big fat slut.
Get out of my face.

1163
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:39,326
If that's what you want, I...

1164
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:41,006
I'm done bankrolling you.

1165
01:17:41,046 --> 01:17:42,526
- Leave.
- Yeah, yeah.

1166
01:17:52,087 --> 01:17:53,566
Runners, take your mark.

1167
01:18:58,850 --> 01:18:59,808
Hey.

1168
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:02,288
Hi, there.

1169
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:03,929
What are you doing here so early?

1170
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:06,890
Picking up my pathetic check.

1171
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,808
I got my bike back.

1172
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,010
That's good.

1173
01:19:15,331 --> 01:19:16,450
Good.

1174
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,650
I was thinking,

1175
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:28,610
if you wanted to meet me off campus,
you could.

1176
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:37,570
I don't think so.

1177
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:38,970
Come on, Ellis.

1178
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,770
Why don't you spend
some of that allowance money

1179
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:44,890
your parents send you
for being the perfect boy?

1180
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:53,051
- If you change your mind...
- I won't.

1181
01:20:06,172 --> 01:20:07,851
Grapes of Wrath.

1182
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:11,972
It's my favorite novel.

1183
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:06,934
We gotta get you home.

1184
01:21:06,976 --> 01:21:09,413
I think Wendy wants to take you out
to dinner for your birthday

1185
01:21:09,495 --> 01:21:13,215
and maybe show you your birthday present,
if you're up for it.

1186
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,494
I almost forgot it was my birthday.

1187
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:29,855
You know, when I was little,

1188
01:21:29,936 --> 01:21:32,216
I used to love to hear Wendy
do a primal screaming.

1189
01:21:32,617 --> 01:21:34,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1190
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,615
It meant she'd actually be happy
for the few days afterwards

1191
01:21:36,697 --> 01:21:37,855
and play with me.

1192
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,535
Thank God Bennet's gone.

1193
01:21:40,856 --> 01:21:43,616
- Yeah, she actually kicked him out.
- No?

1194
01:21:43,697 --> 01:21:44,737
It was awesome.

1195
01:21:45,616 --> 01:21:46,695
You know what else?

1196
01:21:47,256 --> 01:21:49,537
She milked Frieda
the whole time I was gone.

1197
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:50,977
Kept her lactating.

1198
01:21:54,298 --> 01:21:55,416
Yeah, exactly.

1199
01:22:02,658 --> 01:22:04,017
Forty acres.

1200
01:22:04,897 --> 01:22:07,536
There'll never be a 7-Eleven
or a Wal-Mart out here.

1201
01:22:08,978 --> 01:22:11,297
I forget how cool Wendy can be, you know.

1202
01:22:11,858 --> 01:22:13,378
I helped pick it out.

1203
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:20,297
That house all the way over there is
owned by a surgeon from Canada, eh.

1204
01:22:21,619 --> 01:22:24,017
The rest is National Forest land.

1205
01:22:25,258 --> 01:22:27,177
It even smells good out here.

1206
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:29,457
This is the coolest birthday present.

1207
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:31,138
Hey.

1208
01:22:31,259 --> 01:22:32,818
Welcome home spliff?

1209
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:34,857
No, thanks.

1210
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,898
I got plenty. Enough for
the whole summer.

1211
01:22:38,419 --> 01:22:40,139
The greenhouse is going strong.

1212
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,698
I was thinking of maybe going
to Telluride with Frank and Judy

1213
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:47,378
and Gabriel for the summer.

1214
01:22:50,021 --> 01:22:51,139
Gabriel?

1215
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,498
That's the baby's name, Gabriel?

1216
01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:54,659
Yeah.

1217
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,219
I think you should go.

1218
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:00,779
I think that would be good for you.

1219
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:03,939
Yeah.

1220
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,019
That'll be good for you.

1221
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,064
