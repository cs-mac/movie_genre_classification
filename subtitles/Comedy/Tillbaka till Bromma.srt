8
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,669
- What do you know?
- Well...

9
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:14,346
it's a hot goddamned day.

10
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,346
I haven't felt it a bit.

11
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,425
I've been inside with the
air-conditioner blastin' all day long.

12
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,187
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

13
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,105
Didn't you break for lunch or nothin'?

14
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:32,463
I'm by myself today.
I ate my lunch out of the microwave.

15
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:37,222
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

16
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,260
When are you gonna learn that microwave
food will kill you faster than a bullet?

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,263
I mean, them damn burritos ain't good
for nothin' but a hippie...

18
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,462
when he's high on weed.

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,821
Pull me out a bottle of that Jack,
will you?

20
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:52,180
Yep.

21
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:55,739
I think I'm gonna get tanked tonight.

22
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:01,416
What's the matter?

23
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:04,819
Ohh, hell.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,379
Been one long goddam hot,
miserable, shit-ass fuckin' day...

25
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,938
every inch of the way.

26
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,615
First off, Nadine over
at the Blue Chip got sort of sick...

27
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:18,573
since she got that goddam Mongoloid boy
of hers workin' the grill.

28
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:22,894
I mean, that fuckin' idiot doesn't know
rat shit from Rice Krispies.

29
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:27,895
I eat breakfast about 9:00,
and I'm pukin' up pigs in a blanket...

30
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,613
like a sick fuckin' dog by 10:30.

31
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:35,411
Isn't there a law or somethin' against
retards servin' food to the public?

32
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,771
Well, if there ain't, there ought to be.

33
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,332
I mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on in the mind
of a goddamned Mongoloid?

34
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:45,491
Nadine should've hit that boy in
the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

35
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,931
You could sue the shit
out of her, you know that?

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,889
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

37
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,808
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,328
What would I do with that grease pit?

39
00:02:57,488 --> 00:03:01,086
Besides, Nadine's got a cross to bear.

40
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,526
I mean, taking care
of that potato head.

41
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:12,446
I guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene. Bank robbery?

42
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,804
It's all that's been on the box all day.

43
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,884
They killed some people, didn't they?

44
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:21,041
Yeah. Killed four Rangers...

45
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,562
three cops...

46
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:27,403
one civilian.

47
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:30,202
Took a lady bank teller
hostage with them.

48
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,801
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Get my hands on them crazy, sick
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

50
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,719
I mean...

51
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,159
Well, we'll get 'em.

52
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,879
- We'll get 'em.
- Well, I don't doubt it.

53
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,118
Well...

54
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,676
I gotta drain my lizard.

55
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,796
Mind if I use your commode?

56
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,834
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:05,154
You're welcome.

58
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:15,794
Do you think I'm fuckin' playing
with you, asshole?

59
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:19,273
Do you want this little girl to die,
or that little girl or yourself?

60
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:22,511
Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, I don't want to do it...

61
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,710
but I will turn this place into
the fucking Wild Bunch if I think
that you are fucking with me.

62
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,753
- What do you want from me?
I did what you said.
- You let him use the bathroom.

63
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:32,633
- No store does that.
- He comes in here every day,
and we bullshit.

64
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,790
He's used my toilet a thousand times.
If I told him "no," he'd know something
was up.

65
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,870
All right. I want him out of here,
in his car and down the road...

66
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,109
or you can change the name of this place
to "Benny's World of Blood."

67
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,826
Were you giving that pig signals?

68
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:56,827
Are you kiddin'?
I didn't do anything!

69
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,144
- He says you were scratching.
- I wasn't scratchin'!

70
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:04,025
- Are you calling him a liar?
- I'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

71
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,823
I'm simply sayin' if I was scratchin',
I don't remember scratchin'.
And if I did scratch...

72
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:09,984
it's not because
I was signalling the cop,
it's 'cause I'm fuckin' scared shitless!

73
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,345
Wait a minute.
The guy's in the bathroom.
Why don't I just go back there...

74
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:16,103
- shoot him in the back of the head,
and we can get the hell out of here?
- Don't do that!

75
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,661
Look, you asked me to act natural,
and I acted natural.

76
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:21,741
In fact, under the circumstances,
I think I oughta get a fuckin'
Academy Award for how natural I acted.

77
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:25,339
You asked me to get rid of him.
I'm doin' my best!

78
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,660
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fucking better,

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,740
or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fucking worse.

80
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,898
Everybody be cool.
You be cool.

81
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:53,777
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

82
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,095
Tonight I'm gonna sit in front of that
box and get higher than a Georgia pine.

83
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:02,613
- How much you want
for that hooch, Pete?
- Oh, 6.50.

84
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,853
Jesus Christ. You buckin'
for early retirement?

85
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,932
Shit, yeah.

86
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:13,054
Hey! Hey! What the fuck is that about?

87
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:16,053
- He signalled the Ranger.
- I didn't! Ya gotta believe me!

88
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:19,252
- I didn't!
- When they were talkin',
he mouthed the words, "Help us."

89
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,129
- You fuckin' liar! I didn't say shit!
- Why don't you shut the hell up?

90
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,368
Hey! Will you stop it! What the fuck
is your problem, goddam it?

91
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,687
Seth, he did it!

92
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,889
You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.

93
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,288
I was by the magazines.
I could see his face!

94
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:37,488
And I saw him mouth the words,
"Help us."

95
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,006
Start the car.

96
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,966
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up.

97
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,965
And start the car, all right?
You start the car.

98
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,645
- You believe me, don't you?
- Start the car. You know that?

99
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:48,645
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

100
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:50,764
- Wait, wait.
- I believe you. Start the car!

101
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,126
You-You're not just sayin' that?
You do believe me?

102
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:54,965
- I believe you! Let's go!
- That means you believe me.

103
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:58,364
- Yes, I believe you!
- You should, 'cause I'm right.

104
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:04,043
- Oh, shit!
- Ohh!

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,321
- Richie?
- Yeah?

106
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,561
You okay?

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,641
He shot me in the fuckin' hand!

108
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:22,278
- Like I told you, he said, "Help us."
- I never said "help us"!

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,439
Well, that doesn't matter now,
'cause you got about
two fuckin' seconds to live!

110
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,117
- Richie?
- Yeah?

111
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,838
When I count to three, you shoot
the bottles out from behind him.

112
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,598
Oh, yeah!

113
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,717
- One.
- Fuck!

114
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,235
Two.

115
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,795
Three.

116
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,106
What did I tell you?
What did I say to you?

117
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,544
- I said, "Buy the road map and leave."
- What the fuck am I supposed
to do, Seth?

118
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,383
- He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

119
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,423
Seth, I'm telling you,
the way he looked at us...

120
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,943
you, especially... I knew he knew.

121
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:51,900
Low profile. Do you understand
the meaning of the words "low profile"?

122
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,421
"Hey, Richie, how's your hand?" "It
hurts like a fuckin' son of a bitch!

123
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,904
- Let me tell you
what "low profile" is not.
- Thanks for askin'!"

124
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,461
It is not taking girls hostage.

125
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,060
It is not shooting police.
It is not setting fire to a building.

126
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,459
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

127
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,618
Hot air hangs like a dead man

128
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,416
From a white oak tree

129
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,615
There's people sittin' on porches

130
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,213
Thinkin' how things used to be

131
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:34,413
Dark night

132
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,736
It's a dark night

133
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,494
Dark night

134
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,693
It's a dark night

135
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,317
My wife left home about a week ago

136
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:13,315
She stole the kids
and she took all my dough

137
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,436
- Move it!
- Goddam you. Goddam you.

138
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,715
- What the hell do you want?
- What do you think I want,
you mean old bastard?

139
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,112
I want a fuckin' room.

140
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,233
Okay. All right.

141
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:35,510
She peed on the carpet
She shot my horse

142
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,991
And now things are goin'
from better to bad to worse

143
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:42,113
Do they have cable?

144
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,112
No.

145
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,831
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
- No.

146
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,829
- Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

147
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,110
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof...

148
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,548
and that's all we need.

149
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,386
All right, pop the trunk.
Let's do this fast.

150
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,782
- Oh.
- Don't say a word.

151
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:26,463
You, plant yourself in that seat.

152
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,423
- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself."

153
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,621
Plants don't talk.
Now, you wanna get on my good side...

154
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:34,861
you sit still
and you don't make a peep.

155
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,303
- All right, how does this feel?
- How do you think?

156
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,420
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

157
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,178
All right. It's wrapped too tight.
Nice and easy now.

158
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:53,498
- Okay.
- All right. Okay, I'm gonna
go get the money.

159
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:16,493
It's 6:00. What time does it get dark
around here?

160
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,374
- About 8:00.
- Good. I'm going to the border,
check things out.

161
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,331
I'm gonna call Carlos, try and arrange
some sort of a rendezvous.

162
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:25,253
- I don't know what yet.
- Could you see if he could arrange
a better deal than 30%?

163
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,572
It's their standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

164
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:29,572
Did you even try
to negotiate with them?

165
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:34,130
Richie, these guys are not spic
firecracker salesmen from Tijuana.

166
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,610
They don't even know the meaning
of the word "barter."

167
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,687
You wanna stay in El Rey,
you give them 30% of your loot.

168
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,728
It's scripture.
So it is written, so shall it be done.

169
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,568
- Look...
- Yeah, I know, listen. Hey, you want
sanctuary, you gotta pay the price.

170
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,848
The price is 30%.

171
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,807
- All I'm sayin', man...
- This conversation's over.

172
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,605
Okay?

173
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,284
We need to have a talk.
What's your name?

174
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,886
- Gloria.
- Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth.
That's my brother, Richie.

175
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,325
Let's cut to the chase.
I'm gonna ask you one question...

176
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:10,843
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

177
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,804
Do you wanna live through this?

178
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:17,882
- Yes.
- Good. Rule number one: No noise.

179
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:21,362
No questions. If you make a noise...

180
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,162
Mr.44 makes a noise.

181
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,961
If you ask a question,
Mr.44 answers it.

182
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:32,680
Now, are you absolutely, positively
clear about rule number one?

183
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,637
- Yes.
- Rule number two.

184
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,316
You do what we say when we say it.
If you don't, see rule number one.

185
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:46,477
Rule number three: Don't you ever try
and fucking run on us...

186
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,597
'cause I got six little friends...

187
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:54,115
and they can all run faster
than you can.

188
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:57,914
Open your eyes.

189
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:01,032
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules...

190
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:04,991
and you don't fuck with us,
and you'll get out of this alive.

191
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:08,554
I give you my word. Okay?

192
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:19,311
I'll be back in a minute.

193
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,469
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

194
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:56,144
- Hail!
- Come on.

195
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,583
Have a seat.

196
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:15,861
Come on.

197
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:19,580
Take off your shoes.

198
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:30,017
Foolish heart

199
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,258
- Foolish heart
- You made me weep

200
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:37,696
We got about two more hours...

201
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,775
till we get in to El Paso...

202
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,416
which is right next to the border.

203
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:46,533
- Then we'll stop at a motel.
- Stop?

204
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:49,497
- We're not actually gonna stop
at a motel, are we?
- Yeah, what for?

205
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:55,013
We have a motorhome. We don't wanna
stay in those roach haven motels, do we?

206
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:58,252
- We're self-contained.
- Okay, okay.

207
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:02,691
Maybe I was a little overzealous.
But give me a break. I just bought it.

208
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,210
How come you wanna stop anyways, Dad?

209
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,008
- I'm exhausted.
- Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.

210
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,850
- I can drive us into Mexico.
- I just bet you would.

211
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,289
Don't even think about it.
Besides, I-I wanna have...

212
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,809
just one night's sleep
in an honest to goodness bed.

213
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,808
The beds in the home are okay, but...

214
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:26,846
they're not like a real bed.

215
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,805
Excuse me.
I have to use the restroom.

216
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:43,484
Oh! Guess what. When I called
the machine to check the messages, um...

217
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:46,522
one of them was from Bethel Baptist.

218
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,922
And Mr Franklin said that...

219
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:52,925
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

220
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,123
- And he said that...
- That's very nice of Ted.

221
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,202
But I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

222
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,119
Daddy, I didn't wanna talk
about this in front of Scott...

223
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:13,439
because he gets upset,
but I just wanna know.

224
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,439
Don't you believe in God any more?

225
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,156
Not enough to be a pastor.

226
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,356
Look, I know this is hard on you kids.

227
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:30,154
After Jenny's death, this is probably
the last thing you need, but...

228
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:34,797
my congregation needs
spiritual leadership.

229
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:37,794
Well, my faith is gone.

230
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:42,832
To answer your question, yes,
I do believe in Jesus.

231
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:46,672
Yes, I do believe in God.

232
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:51,951
But do I love Them? No.

233
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:56,352
Well, it's just that all our lives
you've been a pastor.

234
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:01,070
And then one day, you're just gonna
wake up and say, "Fuck Him"?

235
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:06,628
I didn't say, "Fuck Him."

236
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:10,428
Every person who chooses...

237
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,667
the service of God
as his life's work...

238
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,788
has something in common.

239
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,667
I don't care if you're
a preacher, a priest...

240
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:20,507
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

241
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:24,386
Many, many times during your life,
you'll look at your reflection...

242
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:28,105
in the mirror and ask yourself...

243
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:31,142
"Am I a fool?"

244
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:34,104
I'm not going through a lapse.

245
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,624
What I've experienced is closer
to awakening.

246
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,543
Daddy?

247
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,701
What do you think Mom would say?

248
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:48,021
Mama's got nothing to say.
She's dead.

249
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:54,101
This bloody crime spree started
just a week ago today.

250
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:56,820
The oldest of the two brothers,
Seth Gecko...

251
00:19:56,981 --> 00:20:00,099
was serving time in Rollings, Kansas
State Penitentiary...

252
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,818
for his part in the 1988 Scott City
bank robbery...

253
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,859
in which two law enforcement officers
lost their lives.

254
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:10,896
It was while at the court house
that this man, his younger brother...

255
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:14,496
Richard Gecko, a known armed robber
and sex offender...

256
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,538
pulled off a daring daylight escape...

257
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:20,695
resulting in the death of four
Wichita law enforcement officers...

258
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:25,416
and this woman,
Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos...

259
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:28,132
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.

260
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:32,411
And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs...

261
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:37,373
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw...

262
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,413
and liquor store clerk, Pete Bottoms.

263
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,413
That changes the death toll to 16:

264
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:46,490
Five Texas Rangers, eight
police officers, three civilians...

265
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:50,889
and one hostage: Bank teller
and mother of four, Gloria Hill.

266
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:53,048
For the time being, we're very confident
that we'll apprehend...

267
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:55,649
these fugitives
within the next 48 hours.

268
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,048
The bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers have all joined...

269
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:02,969
in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

270
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,086
Is it safe to assume that because
of the death count involved...

271
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:09,167
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers...

272
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,365
that the bureau, the Rangers
and the police force...

273
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:14,004
are taking this manhunt personally?

274
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,725
I would say that's
a very safe assumption.

275
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,640
Shit, I was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?

276
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,200
- Sightseeing.
- What'd you see?

277
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,722
- The cops.
- Did you see the border?

278
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,441
Yes, I saw the border.
What'd the TV say?

279
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,521
They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

280
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,239
I gotta figure out a way to get us
across this goddam border.

281
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:52,357
The longer we stay here, our lives
ain't worth shit. Here you go.

282
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,238
We gotta get our asses
into Mexico tonight.

283
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,121
Then Carlos is gonna meet us there
at the rendezvous tomorrow morning.

284
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,717
Well, now, he and his boys...
both of them... all of them...

285
00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:04,596
are gonna escort us
into El Rey, and...

286
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,993
- Where's the woman?
- What?

287
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:12,753
What do you mean, what? The woman...
th-the host... the fucking hostage.

288
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,833
Richard, where is she?

289
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:19,274
- She's in there.
- What the fuck is she doing in there?

290
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:23,314
Now, Seth, wait a minute. Seth.

291
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,671
Richard, what's wrong with you?

292
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,947
Before you flip out, okay,
let me just explain what happened.

293
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,110
Yeah, ex-explain to me.

294
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,269
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

295
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,070
There's nothing wrong with me, brother.
That woman tried to escape, and I did
what I had to do.

296
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:51,066
No, that woman wouldn't have said shit
if she had a mouth full of it.

297
00:22:51,227 --> 00:22:53,707
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.
- Yeah.

298
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:58,825
- After you left, she became
a completely different person.
- Yeah.

299
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:04,507
Is it me? My fault?

300
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,786
- It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

301
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:09,903
- No, it's her fault.
It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

302
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:13,382
Do you think that this is what I am?

303
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:17,103
- I don't...
- This is not me.
I am a professional fucking thief.

304
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:21,543
I don't kill people that I don't have
to, and I don't fucking rape women.

305
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,902
What you are doing...
What you are fucking doing...

306
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:28,102
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that?

307
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:30,460
Do you? Just say fucking "yes."

308
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,579
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

309
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,978
- Yes, Seth, I understand.
- Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand."

310
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,458
I understand, Seth.
I fucking understand.

311
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,857
We'll get to Mexico,
and it's gonna be sweet rosemary...

312
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:49,097
and 100 proof liquor...

313
00:23:49,257 --> 00:23:52,576
and rice and beans,
and none of this shit's gonna matter.

314
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:04,814
I can't believe he's stopping here.
This place is totally cruddy.

315
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:13,292
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

316
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:18,050
There's nothing wrong with this place.

317
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,771
It's a flophouse.

318
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,931
It's not a flophouse.

319
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:26,690
It's basic and simple.

320
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,490
That doesn't make it a flophouse.

321
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,649
All right. Well, if it doesn't have
a pool, then we're going someplace else.

322
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,127
It has a bed.

323
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,885
That's all I care about.

324
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:43,327
Well, other places have beds too...

325
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:47,326
and they also have a gym, tennis...

326
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,803
Jeez, what is this guy's problem?

327
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,121
No idea.

328
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,364
Creepy guy.

329
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:25,600
- What?
- Yes, I'm your neighbour
from, uh, room 11...

330
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,477
and I hate to disturb you,
but I'd like to ask a favour.

331
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,235
I hope none of this is disturbing you.

332
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:49,715
Hi. Uh, I'm from room 11, and, uh...

333
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,592
me and my lady friend need some ice,
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

334
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,833
If it's not too much trouble,
could I possibly borrow yours?

335
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:57,432
I'll bring it right back.

336
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,991
- Sure.
- Thank you.

337
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:12,789
What is this?

338
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,870
It's called a punch.

339
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:17,431
Lose the guitar.

340
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,107
- What's your name?
- Jacob.

341
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:26,109
Jacob, get up, get on the bed.
If you make a wrong move,
I will shoot you in the face.

342
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:30,908
Open your mouth. Wide.

343
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:33,348
Let's go. Let's move the Jap
over here too. Let's go.

344
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:45,142
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

345
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:47,145
- This is my son.
- How does that happen?

346
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:52,863
- You don't look Japanese.
- Neither does he. He looks Chinese.

347
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:57,220
Oh, ooh, well,
excuse me all to hell.

348
00:26:57,381 --> 00:27:00,381
- What's this about? Money?
- It's about money, all right,
but not yours.

349
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,380
My brother and I, we're in a little
hot water. Now, I need your assistance.

350
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,420
- Stop!
- Wh-What's, um, goin' on?

351
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:13,819
We're havin' a bikini contest,
and you just won.

352
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,218
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

353
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:19,218
You listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

354
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:22,136
You two...
Simon says sit the fuck down.

355
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:24,416
Sit down.

356
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:29,696
Now, where are the keys
to the motorhome?

357
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,136
On the dresser.

358
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:34,254
All right.
Richie, you take these keys.

359
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,656
You start this big bastard up
and drive it up front.

360
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:45,850
Richie, would you do me a favour
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

361
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:49,654
- Uh, sure.
- Richie, hey!

362
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:52,653
Not when you get around to it. Now.

363
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,888
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

364
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,930
You got three minutes. One second
longer, I shoot your father in the face.

365
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,969
- Do you understand what I just said?
- Yes.

366
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:15,487
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

367
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,526
You damn well better. Go.

368
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:36,964
Look, if you want the motorhome,
just take it and get out.

369
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:39,523
It's not gonna be that easy, Pops.

370
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,881
We're gonna go on a little ride.

371
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,360
Not a chance.

372
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,603
- Come again?
- If you're taking people, take me.

373
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:57,600
But my kids aren't going
anywhere with you.

374
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,199
Sorry, Pops. I need everybody.

375
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:03,078
My children are not going
with you, and that's that.

376
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:08,077
That's not fucking that.
This is fucking this.

377
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:10,920
Dad.

378
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,038
You sit down. Sit down.

379
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:16,798
You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there now. Move it.

380
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,515
Sit down.

381
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,195
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

382
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:27,954
You take your kids and you get
in that motorhome...

383
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:31,074
or I will execute all three
of you right now.

384
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:36,472
So, what's it gonna be?

385
00:29:36,632 --> 00:29:38,553
Yes or no answer.

386
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,991
- Yes.
- Hey, your old man's all right.

387
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:46,150
He just saved your life.

388
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:49,989
Time's up, princess. Here we go.

389
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:52,751
Okay, ramblers, let's get rambling.

390
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,345
Excuse me.

391
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,786
What?

392
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:12,947
Where are you takin' us?

393
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:17,386
- Mexico.
- What's in Mexico?

394
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:20,783
Mexicans.

395
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,343
- Richie?
- Yeah?

396
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:27,382
Put in your bit.

397
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,379
- I grind my teeth.
- Dengue woman

398
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,659
- What are their names?
- Scott and Kate.

399
00:30:48,818 --> 00:30:51,938
Scott and Kate. Who's this?

400
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,299
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

401
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:01,257
In heaven.

402
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:03,296
She dead?

403
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,296
- Yes, she is.
- How'd she die?

404
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:09,813
Auto wreck.

405
00:31:11,654 --> 00:31:13,697
Come on, Jacob, give me some
more details. How did it happen?

406
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,893
Some fuckin' drunk kill her?

407
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:20,093
No. It was a rainy night.

408
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:24,852
The brakes on the car weren't great.

409
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,612
She had to stop suddenly.

410
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:31,250
She slid on the road.
She crashed. She died.

411
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:35,370
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

412
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,411
She was trapped in the wreck
for about...

413
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,609
six hours before she passed on.

414
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:47,287
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

415
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,168
Yes, they do.

416
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,445
Is that real?

417
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,446
Yes.

418
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:57,368
I've seen one of these things before.
A friend of mine had himself ordained...

419
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,607
a minister of his own religion.

420
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:02,846
Some way to fuck the IRS.

421
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,925
Is that what you're doing,
or are you the real McCoy?

422
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:09,043
Real McCoy.

423
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,121
You're a preacher?

424
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:13,962
I was a minister.

425
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:16,326
"Was," as in not any more?

426
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:18,364
- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

427
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:22,963
I think I've gotten about as up close
and personal with you as I'm gonna get.

428
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:27,561
Let's just keep this friendly, okay,
Pops? Let's not get too sensitive.

429
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,480
Oh, you're right.

430
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:33,478
Enough with the gettin'-to-know-you
shit. All right.

431
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:36,321
I don't give a rat's ass
about you or your fuckin' family.

432
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:40,240
You can all live forever,
or you can die this second.

433
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,318
And I don't give a shit which.
The only things that I care about...

434
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:46,597
are me, that son of a bitch back there
in the back and our money.

435
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,556
So you help us get across the border
without incident, you stay with us...

436
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:54,676
through the night
without trying anything funny,
without trying to escape...

437
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:57,597
and in the morning,
I'm gonna let you guys go, all of you.

438
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,434
How do I know you'll keep your word?

439
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,395
You have to convince me
you're telling the truth.

440
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:05,233
Look, dick-head, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about...

441
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:09,593
is the fact that you are stuck
in a situation with a couple
of real mean motor scooters...

442
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:12,513
and I don't want to have to worry
about you all fuckin' night.

443
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,791
You know, and I don't think you wanna
be worrying about my brother's...

444
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,634
intentions towards your daughter
all night either.

445
00:33:18,793 --> 00:33:20,631
Did you notice the way
that he was looking at her?

446
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:22,432
- Yes.
- You didn't like it, did you?

447
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:24,151
- No, I didn't.
- I didn't think so.

448
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,269
You get us into Mexico...

449
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,948
and you don't try to escape,
and your daughter will be safe.

450
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,507
And in the morning, I will let you go.
I give you my word, Jacob.

451
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,548
If he touches her, I'll kill him.

452
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:44,108
Fair enough. You break your word,
I'll kill all of ya.

453
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:50,825
You got me all crazy

454
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:54,743
I can't get outta of bed

455
00:33:56,543 --> 00:33:59,304
Bones are achin'

456
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:02,665
Backed up in my head

457
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,023
Dengue woman

458
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:11,659
Stay away from me

459
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:22,300
You got your aches and pains

460
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:27,738
All over me

461
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:39,978
Did you mean what you said
back there in the room?

462
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:44,215
What?

463
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:48,455
In the room.

464
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:51,174
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were you just foolin' around?

465
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:55,053
Because if-if you really want me
to do that for you, I will.

466
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:57,212
I'd be happy to.

467
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:00,373
Do what?

468
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,454
What you said back there in the room.

469
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:05,572
What did I say?

470
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,051
- You asked me if I would eat out...
- Richie.

471
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,849
- What?
- I told you to watch those kids,
not to talk to them.

472
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,169
You don't have nothin' to say to one
another, so let's just cut the chatter.

473
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,569
We'll talk later, okay?

474
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:34,286
- Just stand back there.
- Move it up. Move it up.

475
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:48,043
All right, everybody. It's show time.
Richie, you take Kate into the bathroom.

476
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:50,284
Scott, get up here with your dad.
Let's go. Let's go!

477
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:56,681
Now, what are you gonna say?

478
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:58,762
I don't have the slightest idea.

479
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,880
Just keep thinking about that gun
next to Kate's head.

480
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,602
Get in.

481
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:14,718
- Another one up. Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

482
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:18,396
- This isn't gonna work, Seth.
- Shut up. It's gonna work just fine.

483
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:23,079
Dad, what are you gonna do?

484
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,558
I'm gonna try and get us
across the border.

485
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,517
Dad, you have to tell them
that they're back there.

486
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:33,834
- Have you forgotten about your sister?
- I want to go on record right now as
saying that this is a very bad idea.

487
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:36,874
Duly noted. Now shut up.

488
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,273
Step right over there.
That's okay.

489
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,994
They're gonna kill us, Dad. They're
gonna get us across the border...

490
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:47,274
take us out in the desert somewhere,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

491
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,793
If they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

492
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:53,472
They won't. Dad, come on.
I watch those reality shows.

493
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:56,230
They never let anybody go.
Any cop will tell you...

494
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,949
in a situation like this,
you get a chance and you go for it.

495
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,988
I know it may not seem like it,
but I know exactly what I'm doing.

496
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,669
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.
- I can't do that, Dad.

497
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,991
If you don't tell the cops, I will.

498
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,869
Listen to me. You ain't gonna do
a goddamned thing, you hear me?

499
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:15,386
I'm runnin' the show.
I make the decisions.

500
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:17,666
- He is running the show.
- I'm running the show!

501
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:20,505
- Dad!
- I'm runnin' the show!

502
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,346
Shh. I make the plays.

503
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:26,347
You back the plays I make.

504
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,906
I need your cover.

505
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:32,186
Cover me.

506
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:38,264
How many with you?

507
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:41,062
Just my son and I.

508
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:42,781
What's your purpose in Mexico?

509
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:46,982
Vacation. I'm taking him
to see his first bullfight.

510
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:49,222
- They're gonna search the van.
- As long as you don't act...

511
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:51,980
like a fuckin' nut,
we're gonna be just fine.

512
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:56,261
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

513
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,380
- What?
- You just called me a "fuckin' nut."

514
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:00,539
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

515
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:02,897
You said as long as I don't act
"like a fucking nut."

516
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,619
- Implying that I've been acting
like a fucking nut.
- Take a pill, all right?

517
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,780
- I just meant be cool.
- Yeah, you meant that.

518
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:11,338
- But you meant the other too.
- This is not the time, Richie.

519
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:15,856
- Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a "fucking nut."
- Would you just...

520
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:19,376
- Now, where I come from,
that stops the train in its tracks.
- Keep your fucking voice down.

521
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:22,613
Or what?

522
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:25,655
What was that?

523
00:38:25,814 --> 00:38:27,496
Oh. That was, uh...

524
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:30,215
just-just my daughter
in the bathroom.

525
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:34,014
I thought you said
it was just you and your son.

526
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:38,092
Um, I meant me and my son
and my daughter.

527
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:42,452
Open up. I'm comin' aboard.

528
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,251
What was the nuttiest thing
I did, Seth?

529
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,089
- I'm curious. Tell me.
What? What was it?
- This is not the time, Richie.

530
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,689
I know. Was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and I broke it out?

531
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,887
Was that the nuttiest thing?
That was nutty, not to mention stupid.

532
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:06,406
Thanks.

533
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:23,042
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Open up. It's the Border Patrol.

534
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:25,803
It's open.

535
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:33,442
Do you mind?
Shut the fuckin' door, please.

536
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:37,400
Excuse me.

537
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,640
Goddam, that was intense!

538
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:58,318
Oh, baby, we did it.
We're in Mexico.

539
00:39:58,478 --> 00:40:01,996
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

540
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:04,116
Come on! Kate, get out here.
Come on.

541
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:10,556
All right, listen up.
Everybody listen.

542
00:40:10,716 --> 00:40:12,555
Now, I know that I've put
you all through hell...

543
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:15,035
and I know that I have been
one rough pecker.

544
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,872
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

545
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:21,513
Now, Scotty, I want you to help me
with Richie. We're gonna lay him down
on the couch over there.

546
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:23,832
Jacob, you're gonna keep driving
down this street...

547
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:26,031
until you come to another street
called Digallo.

548
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:29,272
When you get to Digallo, you're
gonna turn this big bastard left...

549
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:32,831
and you're gonna go down a couple
of miles until you see a bar
called the Titty Twister.

550
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:35,072
From what I understand,
you cannot miss it.

551
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,911
- Then?
- And then you stop...

552
00:40:37,072 --> 00:40:39,070
because that's where we're goin'.

553
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:55,668
Listen. Don't make a career
out of this, okay? Come on. Hey.

554
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,026
Hey. You okay?

555
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:03,825
Yeah, I think so.
What happened?

556
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:06,465
I don't know.
You just passed out.

557
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:08,822
- I did?
- You said something
about your hand hurtin'...

558
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,744
and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

559
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:14,384
- Really?
- Head hit the toilet.

560
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:19,063
You scared the shit out of me.
You sure you're okay there?

561
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:22,701
Yeah, I-I think so.
I'm just a little fucked up.

562
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:27,260
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

563
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:31,541
- What?
- We are officially Mexicans.

564
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:35,380
- We're in Mexico, buddy.
- We are?

565
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,180
Yeah, we're headin' down
to the rendezvous right now.

566
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:39,659
We're gonna pound booze,
wait for Carlos.

567
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:42,178
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

568
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:46,776
And then you and I, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

569
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,097
How you like them apples?

570
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,695
Far out.

571
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,817
- Where's my glasses?
- Oh, uh, yeah, they, uh...

572
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:59,295
They broke when you fell.

573
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:01,576
- Fuck, Seth!
These are, like, my only pair.
- Well, don't worry about it.

574
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:03,974
- We'll get you another pair.
- What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Of course I'm gonna worry about it.

575
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:06,453
- I can't fuckin' see!
- I'll take care of it when we get
to El Rey.

576
00:42:06,613 --> 00:42:08,812
Yeah, like some Mexican
hole in the wall's gonna
have my fuckin' prescription.

577
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,411
It-lt's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal, Richie.

578
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:16,694
Now, I was in a very good mood, so stop
bringing me down with this bullshit!

579
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:20,652
I can't wear this shit.

580
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,530
Hey, guys. We're here.

581
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,281
All right.
Pussy, pussy, pussy!

582
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:09,602
Come on in, pussy lovers!

583
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:13,000
Here at the Titty Twister,
we're slashing pussy in half.

584
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:17,402
Give us an offer on our best selection
of pussy. This is a pussy blowout!

585
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:21,841
All right, we got white pussy, black
pussy, Spanish pussy, yellow pussy.

586
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,798
We got hot pussy, cold pussy.
We got wet pussy. We got smelly pussy.

587
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:30,397
We got hairy pussy, bloody pussy.
We got snappin' pussy.

588
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:33,516
We got silk pussy, velvet pussy,
Naugahyde pussy.

589
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,840
We even got horse pussy, dog pussy,
chicken pussy.

590
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:39,837
Come on. You want pussy?
Come on in, pussy lovers.

591
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:43,436
If we don't got it, you don't want it.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

592
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:49,713
Come on!

593
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,273
Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.

594
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:55,435
Here's the deal.
This place closes at dawn.

595
00:43:55,596 --> 00:43:57,714
Carlos is gonna meet us here
sometime before dawn.

596
00:43:57,874 --> 00:44:00,033
Now, we are gonna go in there.
We're gonna take a seat.

597
00:44:00,195 --> 00:44:01,993
We're gonna have a drink.
We're gonna have a bunch of drinks.

598
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:05,272
And we're gonna wait for Carlos.
Let me say something.

599
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:07,672
I'm very happy about where we're at.
We got a real, nice...

600
00:44:07,832 --> 00:44:11,150
l-don't-fuck-with-you, you-don't-
fuck-with-me attitude goin' on.

601
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:15,068
So if everybody just
keeps playin' it cool...
and I'm talkin' to you too, Richie...

602
00:44:15,227 --> 00:44:17,350
then everybody's gonna get
what they want.

603
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:24,029
Okay, hard drinkers. Let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'. Come on.

604
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:26,027
Here we go.

605
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:34,385
Out of the stew pot
and into the fire.

606
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:38,788
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

607
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:41,386
If you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price...

608
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:46,262
you'll get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

609
00:44:46,424 --> 00:44:48,583
Try and beat pussy for a penny!

610
00:44:48,743 --> 00:44:53,262
If you can find cheaper pussy anywhere,
fuck it!

611
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:58,183
Hey, what do we have approaching here?

612
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:01,303
A new flavour: Apple pie pussy.

613
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:06,341
- Hey, not so fast, slick.
- Step aside, asshole.

614
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,738
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

615
00:45:13,898 --> 00:45:15,738
Here we go.

616
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,619
Hi. How ya doin'?
Enjoying it? I hope so.

617
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:35,014
Now...

618
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:37,974
this is my kind of place.

619
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,969
I could become a regular.

620
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:24,366
Whisky.

621
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:37,481
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

622
00:46:37,643 --> 00:46:39,923
It's a private bar.
You're not welcome.

623
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:42,963
Are you tellin' me that I'm
not good enough to drink here?

624
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:48,603
This bar is for bikers
and truckers only.

625
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:51,160
You, get out!

626
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,159
- Take your hand off of me.
- I'm gonna count to three.

627
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,878
No, I'm gonna count to three.

628
00:46:58,998 --> 00:47:00,640
- One.
- Two.
- Now, wait a minute.

629
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:06,960
There's no reason to get ugly.
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

630
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,918
You said this bar is
for truckers and bikers?

631
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,797
Well, I'm a truck driver.

632
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:15,636
If you look outside your door
in your parking lot, you'll see...

633
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:17,755
a big recreational vehicle.

634
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,752
That's mine. In order
to drive that legally...

635
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:23,917
you need a Class Two driver's licence.

636
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:28,075
This bar is for truck drivers?
I am a truck driver.

637
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,875
And these are my friends.

638
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:38,631
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

639
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,830
Bottle of whisky and five glasses.

640
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,112
Coming right out.

641
00:48:06,668 --> 00:48:09,226
- They serve food here, Jose?
- The best in Mexico.

642
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:13,066
I kind of doubt that.

643
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:17,185
We're gonna go over here. You send
a waitress over to take our order, okay?

644
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,864
Yeah!

645
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:09,735
Mary had a little lamb

646
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:15,174
His fleece was black as coal, yeah

647
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:19,492
Any time you want a lap dance
with that girl, kid,
just let me know, all right?

648
00:49:19,653 --> 00:49:22,050
It's on me.

649
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:26,173
- He followed her to school
- Pass.

650
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:29,732
- Is it against your religion?
- No, I do drink.

651
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:31,371
I'm just not drinkin' now.

652
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,212
Fair enough. More for me.
Scott, how 'bout you?

653
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,130
- No.
- Kate, how 'bout you?

654
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,409
No, I can't. I'm not 21 yet.

655
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,567
That means yes.
Post time, Kate!

656
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:48,570
Here we go. You slam it down, you knock
the glass down on the table, all right?

657
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:51,088
One, two, three!

658
00:49:55,527 --> 00:49:57,726
Thattagirl, Kate.

659
00:49:57,886 --> 00:49:58,927
Scotty, you ready? Here we go.
You ready for one?

660
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:01,164
- Okay.
- No, you won't.

661
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:05,323
Yes, he will. Yes, he will,
because I'm not drinkin' by myself.

662
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:09,205
- Kate, round two.
You ready? Here we go.
- Yes, I'll have another one. Thank you.

663
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:11,206
On three. One, two, three.

664
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:24,081
Why are you so agitated?

665
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,682
I'm still stewin' about that ape
layin' his hand on me.

666
00:50:27,843 --> 00:50:31,083
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna sit here,
and I'm gonna finish this bottle.

667
00:50:31,242 --> 00:50:33,120
And when I am finished,
I'm gonna take this bottle...

668
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:36,958
and I'm gonna bust it
over his melon fucking head.

669
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:40,799
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.

670
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,797
- So that means you too.
- I never said do what I do.

671
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,398
I said do what I say.

672
00:50:46,558 --> 00:50:50,519
On my way I passed it

673
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:52,797
Express yourself

674
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:07,072
Are you such a fucking loser...

675
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:09,555
you can't tell when you've won?

676
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:11,513
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

677
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:14,792
I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question.

678
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:17,352
Would you like me to ask it again?

679
00:51:17,514 --> 00:51:21,272
Are you such a loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

680
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:27,508
The entire state of Texas,
along with the FBI...

681
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,550
are looking for you.

682
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,711
Did they find you?

683
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,909
No, they couldn't.

684
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:36,389
You've won, Seth.

685
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:39,546
Enjoy it.

686
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:43,507
Jacob...

687
00:51:44,747 --> 00:51:46,707
I want you to have a drink with me.

688
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:48,826
I insist.

689
00:51:52,506 --> 00:51:54,586
To your family.

690
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:56,584
To yours.

691
00:52:04,142 --> 00:52:06,782
And now, for your viewing pleasure...

692
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:09,504
the Mistress of the Macabre...

693
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:14,022
the Epitome of Evil,
the most sinister woman to ever dance
on the face of this Earth...

694
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:16,982
- Bite this!
- Lowly dog.

695
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,302
Bow your head.

696
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:22,340
Kneel and worship at the feet...

697
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:24,819
of Santanico Pandemonium!

698
00:53:17,689 --> 00:53:20,689
Watching her

699
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:23,728
Strolling in the night

700
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:28,847
So right, wondering why

701
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:32,687
It's only after dark

702
00:53:40,527 --> 00:53:43,924
In her eyes

703
00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:46,562
The distant firelight

704
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:51,883
Burns bright, wondering why

705
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:54,965
It's only after dark

706
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,802
Find myself

707
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:08,280
In her room

708
00:54:08,438 --> 00:54:10,399
Feel the fever

709
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,798
Of my doom

710
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:16,800
Falling, falling
through the floor

711
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:21,839
I'm knocking on
the devil's door, yeah

712
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:55,220
Burning, burning

713
00:55:55,379 --> 00:55:57,742
In the flame

714
00:55:57,902 --> 00:56:02,379
Now that I know her secret name

715
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:06,697
You can tell whose heaven will go

716
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:11,376
But she'll be back
and through the gate

717
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:36,492
That's what I call a fuckin' show!

718
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:53,010
Come here!

719
00:56:53,169 --> 00:56:56,168
- That guy. It's the puta over there.
- Richie, get back on the clock.

720
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,488
- How many?
- Three.

721
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:05,408
Which one?

722
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:07,847
This piece of shit here, man...

723
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:10,487
broke my finger and my nose!

724
00:57:10,647 --> 00:57:13,527
And this faggot kicked me in the ribs
while I was down.

725
00:57:13,686 --> 00:57:16,164
- Up!
- Fuck off, bogeyman!

726
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:22,885
Fuck!

727
00:57:37,482 --> 00:57:42,323
All right, everybody be cool, or you'll
be just as dead as these fucks!

728
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:45,041
How's your hand?
Let me see it.

729
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,840
Shit.

730
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:59,479
Do you think that was funny?

731
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:11,355
Sit down!

732
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:37,030
- Richie, look out!
- Motherfuckin' shit!

733
00:58:37,189 --> 00:58:39,109
- Get the fuck off!
- Hey! Hey!

734
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,591
- Get her off me!
- Hey! Hey!

735
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,631
What the fuck are you doing?
Shoot her!

736
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:47,270
I'm comin', buddy!

737
00:58:52,346 --> 00:58:55,626
- Richie. Richie.
- Fuckin' bitch.

738
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:58,426
Richie.

739
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:01,227
Fuckin' bitch.

740
00:59:01,387 --> 00:59:03,707
Richie.

741
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:11,504
Hey. Hey.

742
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:18,142
Hey.

743
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:29,381
What the fuck?

744
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,339
Dinner is served.

745
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,773
Fuck!
Get off me, man!

746
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:17,413
Come on! Come on, you!
Jacob!

747
01:00:21,091 --> 01:00:23,290
No, no, no!
Look out! Look out!

748
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:33,209
You know what everybody
says about me, huh?

749
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,088
I suck!

750
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:14,560
Let's see if you taste
as good as your brother.

751
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,921
Fuck you.

752
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:38,956
Hey, hey, hey!

753
01:01:52,636 --> 01:01:54,514
Oh, shit.

754
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:03,353
Huh?

755
01:02:08,194 --> 01:02:10,072
Give me that!

756
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:29,630
I'm not gonna drain you
completely.

757
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,748
You'll be my slave.

758
01:02:32,907 --> 01:02:34,906
Because I don't think
you're worthy of human blood...

759
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:37,426
you'll feed on the blood
of stray dogs.

760
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:41,064
You'll be my footstool,
and at my command...

761
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:43,903
you'll lick the dog shit
from my boot heel.

762
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:47,181
- Oh.
- Since you'll be my dog...

763
01:02:47,343 --> 01:02:50,505
your new name will be Spot.

764
01:02:52,346 --> 01:02:55,104
Welcome to slavery.

765
01:02:55,263 --> 01:02:58,143
No, thanks.
I already had a wife.

766
01:03:21,979 --> 01:03:24,256
We might be in trouble.

767
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,016
Yo. Monkey man.

768
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:36,176
Anything you got
to say to them...

769
01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:40,696
you can say to me first.

770
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,649
That's enough.

771
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,352
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or somethin'?

772
01:05:40,552 --> 01:05:43,591
Fuck.

773
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:55,111
Now let's kill that fucking band.

774
01:05:55,271 --> 01:05:57,111
I can do that.

775
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,989
Fuck you, everybody!
Good night!

776
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:07,986
Fuckers.

777
01:06:23,503 --> 01:06:26,424
Hey, buddy.

778
01:06:26,584 --> 01:06:30,182
I'm sorry
I fucked things up, Richie.

779
01:06:35,623 --> 01:06:39,543
You would've liked it in El Rey.
You would've...

780
01:06:39,702 --> 01:06:42,262
You would've found peace there.

781
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:47,820
I love you, buddy.

782
01:06:49,058 --> 01:06:51,339
I love you too, Seth.

783
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:05,256
You touch my brother
with that stake, biker...

784
01:07:05,418 --> 01:07:08,414
and vampires aren't gonna have to
suck your blood; they'll be able to
lick it up off the floor.

785
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:12,894
- He's not your brother any more.
- That's a matter of opinion,
and I don't give a fuck about yours.

786
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:16,577
Don't be a fool!
He'll kill us all.

787
01:07:16,736 --> 01:07:18,416
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

788
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,654
Let's go. Move. Move. Move.

789
01:07:36,774 --> 01:07:38,931
Hold him down.

790
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:48,849
Richie, here is the peace in death...

791
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:51,287
that I could not give you
in life.

792
01:08:05,886 --> 01:08:07,805
Fuck.

793
01:08:17,684 --> 01:08:20,405
Seth, are you okay?

794
01:08:20,565 --> 01:08:23,402
I'm peachy. Okay?
The world is my oyster.

795
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:30,921
Except for the fact that I just...

796
01:08:31,081 --> 01:08:34,280
I just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest...

797
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:36,799
because he turned into a vampire...

798
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,041
even though
I don't believe in vampires.

799
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,199
Aside from that
unfortunate business...

800
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,598
everything is hunky-dory.

801
01:08:48,038 --> 01:08:52,356
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

802
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:56,915
If it were to up to you
if you had half a chance,
you would feed us to those fucks.

803
01:08:57,075 --> 01:08:59,316
Then why didn't I?

804
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:05,554
I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.

805
01:09:05,715 --> 01:09:07,675
I'm sorry everybody's dead.

806
01:09:07,835 --> 01:09:11,752
But if we're gonna get out of this we
need you clean and sober and thinking...

807
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:14,152
not drunk.

808
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:19,473
- What is that?
- Don't know.

809
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:22,513
First I thought it was just birds.

810
01:09:25,472 --> 01:09:27,952
It's bats.

811
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:35,549
Give me a hand.

812
01:10:24,342 --> 01:10:26,220
Hey!

813
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:32,738
Whoa.

814
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:41,378
You're dead! Oh!

815
01:10:43,016 --> 01:10:44,856
Come on!

816
01:10:53,694 --> 01:10:57,333
We'll take care of this mess.
Go stake the rest of those ugly fucks.

817
01:10:57,492 --> 01:10:59,933
I'm way ahead of you.

818
01:11:00,091 --> 01:11:02,735
- Watch your step.
What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

819
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:05,774
- Sex Machine.
Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- Me too.

820
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,368
Okay.

821
01:12:26,519 --> 01:12:29,957
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

822
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:38,236
- Does anybody know
what's going on here?
- I know what's going on.

823
01:12:38,394 --> 01:12:42,394
We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires
out there trying to get in here
and suck our fuckin' blood.

824
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:44,393
And that's it.
Plain and simple.

825
01:12:44,553 --> 01:12:47,395
And I don't wanna hear anything about
"I don't believe in vampires"...

826
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:50,114
because I don't fucking believe
in vampires...

827
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:54,632
but I believe in my own two eyes
and what I saw is fucking vampires.

828
01:12:54,793 --> 01:12:58,870
Now, do we all agree that
what we are dealing with is vampires?

829
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:01,390
- Yes.
- You too, Preacher?

830
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:05,870
- I don't believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.
- Good for you.

831
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:10,071
All right, now that we all agree
that we're dealing with vampires,
what do we know about vampires?

832
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:12,550
Crosses hurt vampires.
Do we have a cross?

833
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:15,268
- In the motorhome.
- In other words, no.

834
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:18,427
Wait a second. I mean, just look around.
We got crosses all over the place.

835
01:13:18,586 --> 01:13:20,906
All you gotta do is put two sticks
together and you got a cross.

836
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:23,745
Yeah, he's right.
Peter Cushing does that all the time.

837
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:26,906
Okay, I'll buy that.
So we got crosses covered. What else?

838
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:29,626
Wooden stakes in the heart
been workin' pretty good so far.

839
01:13:29,746 --> 01:13:33,945
And garlic. Sunlight. Holy water.

840
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:36,903
I'm not sure... Eh, doesn't silver
have somethin' to do with vampires?

841
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:39,384
- That's werewolves.
- I know silver bullets
are werewolves...

842
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:41,663
but I'm sure silver has
something to do with vampires.

843
01:13:41,824 --> 01:13:43,862
Well, does anybody have
any silver?

844
01:13:46,462 --> 01:13:49,382
Okay. Then who cares?

845
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:51,783
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires...

846
01:13:51,942 --> 01:13:54,701
or are we just remembering
what some movie said?

847
01:13:54,861 --> 01:13:57,621
- I mean, a real book.
- You me... You mean,
like a Time-Life book?

848
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,701
I take it the answer's no.

849
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,537
Okay, then, what do we know
about these vampires?

850
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,138
Well, we know they got superhuman
strength, but we can hurt 'em.

851
01:14:06,297 --> 01:14:08,058
- Yeah.
- Another thing, though.

852
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:11,699
If you're gonna drive a chair leg
through a human, you'd better be
one strong son of a bitch.

853
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:16,017
I mean, the human body
is one rough, tough machine.

854
01:14:16,178 --> 01:14:18,937
But these vamps... these vamps,
they're, they're, they have soft bodies.

855
01:14:19,098 --> 01:14:23,774
The texture of their skin is softer.
They're mushier.
You can push it right through them.

856
01:14:23,934 --> 01:14:27,855
You see, but if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

857
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:34,614
Actually, our best weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers...

858
01:14:34,774 --> 01:14:37,014
is this man.

859
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:38,852
He's a preacher.

860
01:14:39,011 --> 01:14:41,292
As far as God's concerned, we might
as well all be a piece of shit...

861
01:14:41,453 --> 01:14:43,332
but he is one of the boys.

862
01:14:43,491 --> 01:14:46,690
Only one problem:
His faith isn't what it used to be.

863
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:53,810
I've had enough of your taunts.

864
01:14:53,971 --> 01:14:58,330
I'm not taunting you, Jacob.
We need you.

865
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:02,488
A faithless preacher
doesn't mean shit to us.

866
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:10,327
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

867
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:14,966
A servant of God can bless the tap water
and make it a weapon.

868
01:15:17,126 --> 01:15:21,123
Jacob, I know
why you lost your faith.

869
01:15:24,004 --> 01:15:26,002
How could holiness exist...

870
01:15:26,164 --> 01:15:28,963
if your wife can be taken away
from you and the children?

871
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:33,443
I've always said
that God can kiss my ass...

872
01:15:33,603 --> 01:15:36,922
but I just changed my lifetime tune
about 30 minutes ago...

873
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:40,640
'cause I know that whatever
is out there tryin' to get in...

874
01:15:40,801 --> 01:15:42,680
is pure evil straight from hell.

875
01:15:42,841 --> 01:15:46,320
And if there is a hell
and those sons of bitches are from it...

876
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,358
then there has got to be
a heaven, Jacob, there's gotta be.

877
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,999
So, which are you?

878
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,919
Are you a faithless preacher, or are you
a mean motherfuckin' servant of God?

879
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:13,277
I'm a mean...

880
01:16:15,757 --> 01:16:18,234
servant of God.

881
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:27,992
I don't know if I can take
much more of that noise.

882
01:16:28,153 --> 01:16:31,554
Sure you can.

883
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:35,312
You can take it
because you got no choice.

884
01:16:35,472 --> 01:16:40,271
How'd you like to spend 24 hours of it
lyin' in some muddy ditch...

885
01:16:40,431 --> 01:16:44,350
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

886
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:46,949
What are you talking about?

887
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:54,509
I was in 'Nam back in '72.

888
01:16:56,507 --> 01:17:01,707
I was trapped behind enemy lines
with my entire squad dead.

889
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,106
They thought
they had killed everyone.

890
01:17:06,264 --> 01:17:09,824
Except for me,
they was right.

891
01:17:09,985 --> 01:17:12,544
But it wasn't for
their lack of tryin'.

892
01:17:12,665 --> 01:17:16,865
A grenade blew up right beside me.

893
01:17:18,783 --> 01:17:21,223
That's why I'm so pretty.

894
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:25,302
And they started pushin'
all them bodies in on top of me...

895
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,420
and all I could do was lay there,
play possum...

896
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:32,379
listen to the enemy joke, laugh.

897
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:37,661
Hour after hour after hour
I lay...

898
01:17:37,781 --> 01:17:41,979
- Kill them. Kill them all.
- Kill them.

899
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,418
- Kill them.
- Kill them all.

900
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:48,218
Sex Machine.

901
01:17:48,379 --> 01:17:50,456
- Kill them.
- Kill them.

902
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:53,656
Kill them!

903
01:17:53,819 --> 01:17:57,497
So I finally climbed
out of this hole...

904
01:17:57,657 --> 01:18:00,776
and I sneaked up on the enemy
while he was sleepin'...

905
01:18:00,936 --> 01:18:04,974
and I killed one,
two, three, four, five...

906
01:18:34,891 --> 01:18:38,489
When I came to my senses...

907
01:18:38,651 --> 01:18:45,087
I realized I'd killed
an entire V.C. Squad single-handed.

908
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,927
There was blood...

909
01:18:49,086 --> 01:18:54,123
and chunks of yellow flesh
clinging to my bayonet.

910
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:02,125
To this day, I don't remember...

911
01:19:03,764 --> 01:19:08,482
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
Please! Get it off!

912
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,320
No!

913
01:19:21,521 --> 01:19:23,401
Dad!

914
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:40,237
Fuckin' bit me.
Fuckin' bit me!

915
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,038
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Come on, Sex Machine!

916
01:19:54,033 --> 01:19:57,915
Oh, shit!

917
01:20:07,433 --> 01:20:10,432
Get up. Get up! Up! Come on!

918
01:20:20,951 --> 01:20:24,110
Go! Come on!

919
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:38,427
- Wait. We have to go back
for my father.
- Your dad's dead, Kate.

920
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:24,458
He is the light.

921
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:28,696
The people who walk...

922
01:21:28,857 --> 01:21:31,737
in the darkness...

923
01:21:31,896 --> 01:21:34,454
have seen the light!

924
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:01,012
Open the door!

925
01:22:01,172 --> 01:22:03,131
Open the door!

926
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:09,251
- Go! Go!
- Daddy!

927
01:22:09,409 --> 01:22:11,650
Jacob, are you bit?

928
01:22:13,088 --> 01:22:14,648
Yeah.

929
01:22:14,808 --> 01:22:17,886
Motherfuck.
Motherfucking vampires!

930
01:22:18,046 --> 01:22:21,929
I'm gonna kill every last one
of you godless fuckin' pieces of shit!

931
01:22:22,088 --> 01:22:26,408
You bet you are, and I'm gonna help
you do it. But we ain't got much time.

932
01:22:26,568 --> 01:22:29,647
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

933
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:33,606
I've been bit.
In fact, I'm already dead.

934
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:37,603
Now, I'd say in the next
20 or 30 minutes...

935
01:22:37,763 --> 01:22:39,724
our friends outside
will bust in this door...

936
01:22:39,884 --> 01:22:42,805
and I'll probably turn into a vampire
within the hour.

937
01:22:42,964 --> 01:22:47,403
Now, you have two choices: You can wait
for me to turn, then deal with me,

938
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,603
or we can kick open that door...

939
01:22:49,762 --> 01:22:53,840
and the four of us can go at 'em,
hit 'em with everything we have.

940
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,880
But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now.

941
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:01,720
What's this stuff?

942
01:23:01,879 --> 01:23:07,639
My guess is this little dive
has been feeding on bikers
and truckers for a long time.

943
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,880
This is probably the shipments
that they stole off the trucks.

944
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:11,878
Well, I say let's tear
this place apart for weapons...

945
01:23:12,036 --> 01:23:13,877
so when they burst through the door
we'll make 'em wish they never did.

946
01:23:14,038 --> 01:23:18,756
I don't care about livin' or dyin'
any more. I just wanna send as many
of these devils back to hell as I can.

947
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,076
Amen.

948
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:24,104
Loving God, bless this water and give us
your protection and strength...

949
01:24:24,263 --> 01:24:27,305
- in this, our darkest hour. Amen.
- Amen.

950
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:38,702
Before we go any further I need
you three to promise me something.

951
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:42,581
I'll fight with you to the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them...

952
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,460
I won't be Jacob any more.

953
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:48,183
I'll be a lapdog of Satan.

954
01:24:48,302 --> 01:24:52,019
I want you three to promise you'll take
me down, no different from the rest.

955
01:24:52,179 --> 01:24:54,058
I promise, Jacob.

956
01:24:54,218 --> 01:24:57,178
Kate? Scott?

957
01:24:57,338 --> 01:25:00,457
- I promise.
- Scott.

958
01:25:00,618 --> 01:25:02,856
Yeah, I promise.

959
01:25:04,856 --> 01:25:07,299
Why don't I believe you?

960
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:11,776
I'm gonna ask you two again.

961
01:25:11,896 --> 01:25:17,374
Then I want you to swear to God
that you'll kill me!

962
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:21,574
If you don't, I'm gonna just
kill myself right now.

963
01:25:21,733 --> 01:25:25,812
Now, since you need me
I think you'd better swear!

964
01:25:25,972 --> 01:25:29,494
Kate, do you swear to God...

965
01:25:29,654 --> 01:25:32,974
that when I become one of the undead
you'll kill me?

966
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:39,410
Kate! We don't have much time, so I'm
only giving you to the count of five.

967
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:43,569
One, two, three, four...

968
01:25:43,728 --> 01:25:46,129
Okay! All right!
I promise I'll do it!

969
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,290
Good girl. Now, Scott,
we have even less time...

970
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:53,290
so I'm givin' you
to the count of three.

971
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,528
- One...
- You don't...
You don't believe in suicide.

972
01:25:55,687 --> 01:25:59,807
It's not suicide
if you're already dead. Two!

973
01:25:59,966 --> 01:26:02,888
Okay! Okay.

974
01:26:03,046 --> 01:26:06,284
I'll kill you when you change.
I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

975
01:26:06,444 --> 01:26:07,805
- Thank you, son.
- Okay, vampire killers.

976
01:26:10,646 --> 01:26:13,845
Let's kill some fuckin' vampires.

977
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,760
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

978
01:26:35,919 --> 01:26:39,961
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

979
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,318
From the darkness to light.

980
01:26:43,877 --> 01:26:46,717
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

981
01:27:00,434 --> 01:27:03,675
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

982
01:27:06,192 --> 01:27:08,314
Kill 'em all!

983
01:28:31,096 --> 01:28:32,900
Come on! Come on!

984
01:30:27,077 --> 01:30:29,836
Dad?

985
01:30:38,836 --> 01:30:42,435
Dad, not y... Aah!
Dad! Dad! Dad!

986
01:30:54,353 --> 01:30:56,473
I swear to God
in Jesus Christ's name.

987
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:02,991
- Oh, my God!
- Fight now, cry later!

988
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:12,109
Get the fuck off!
No! Get off! Get off! Off! Get off!

989
01:31:25,309 --> 01:31:27,147
Kill me, Kate.

990
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:30,867
Just kill me, Kate.

991
01:31:32,663 --> 01:31:35,703
I can't.

992
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:55,780
- How many bullets do you have?
- I don't know. Not many.

993
01:31:55,939 --> 01:31:59,703
When you run out, start cold-cockin'
'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.

994
01:32:09,179 --> 01:32:12,538
Seth, should I save
the last bullets for us?

995
01:32:12,698 --> 01:32:16,015
No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.

996
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:27,896
Shoot more holes.
Shoot more holes!

997
01:32:34,172 --> 01:32:36,212
- Perfect.
- Oh, they can't go into the light.

998
01:32:36,374 --> 01:32:40,013
Perfect.
All right, go.

999
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:43,493
Seth, don't leave me.

1000
01:32:43,654 --> 01:32:46,212
Hey! Come on, then. Come on.
Come here. Come on!

1001
01:32:48,012 --> 01:32:52,769
Come on, you! Come on!
Come here, you fucks!

1002
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:57,769
Hello!
I'm looking for my friend Seth!

1003
01:32:57,931 --> 01:33:00,850
Carlos! Kick in the door!

1004
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:14,646
- Go!
- Son of a bitch.

1005
01:33:43,403 --> 01:33:46,243
What the fuck
was goin' on in there?

1006
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:52,320
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

1007
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:55,839
Why, out of all the godforsaken
shitholes in Mexico...

1008
01:33:55,998 --> 01:33:58,837
do we have to meet here?

1009
01:33:58,998 --> 01:34:02,920
One place is just as good
as another.

1010
01:34:03,079 --> 01:34:06,718
- You never been here before?
- No.

1011
01:34:06,877 --> 01:34:09,237
I drove by it a couple times.

1012
01:34:09,396 --> 01:34:12,237
It's a rowdy place. It's out in the
middle of nowhere. There'll be no cops.

1013
01:34:12,395 --> 01:34:15,675
And it's open from dusk till dawn.
Hey, didn't you say you wanted
to meet in the morning? Here we are.

1014
01:34:15,834 --> 01:34:19,114
Well, since you just picked this place
out of a hat, my brother is dead.

1015
01:34:19,273 --> 01:34:22,796
That girl's
entire fucking family is dead.

1016
01:34:26,114 --> 01:34:28,514
- What, were they psychos, or...
- They look like psychos?

1017
01:34:28,673 --> 01:34:30,874
Is that what they looked like?
They were vampires.

1018
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:33,873
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits 'em.

1019
01:34:34,032 --> 01:34:36,793
I don't give a fuck
how crazy they are.

1020
01:34:38,271 --> 01:34:41,350
Seth, how can I make it up to you?

1021
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:44,631
Can't... You can't make it up to me,
Carlos. I tell you, you can't do it.

1022
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:47,031
Can't make it up.

1023
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:52,949
Fifteen percent instead of
thirty percent for my stay in El Rey.

1024
01:34:53,108 --> 01:34:56,666
That's a good start.

1025
01:34:56,827 --> 01:34:59,507
- Twenty-eight.
- My brother's gone.

1026
01:34:59,665 --> 01:35:03,707
You understand that? He's gone, and he's
not coming back, and that is your fault.

1027
01:35:06,706 --> 01:35:09,106
Twenty.

1028
01:35:10,626 --> 01:35:13,866
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

1029
01:35:14,025 --> 01:35:17,224
Kate, go to the RV,
get the suitcase.

1030
01:35:22,141 --> 01:35:24,984
You look like hell.

1031
01:35:25,144 --> 01:35:29,264
You want a cold beer?
I got some in the car.

1032
01:35:29,422 --> 01:35:31,742
Come on. They're cold. Huh?

1033
01:35:31,903 --> 01:35:34,141
I got Mexican and domestic.

1034
01:35:50,378 --> 01:35:54,418
- So, how do you like the car?
- It's all right.

1035
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:57,258
I said "like new."
This is a '90.

1036
01:35:57,417 --> 01:36:01,255
Hey, it is new, cabron. Belonged
to a drug dealer friend of mine.

1037
01:36:01,414 --> 01:36:03,575
Hey, he only drove it, like,
14 times in five years.

1038
01:36:03,734 --> 01:36:06,015
It's like new, I swear to God.

1039
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:11,374
- So, what do I do, follow you?
- Yeah. Follow me.

1040
01:36:11,533 --> 01:36:13,773
All right, let's do it.

1041
01:36:21,212 --> 01:36:24,410
I'm sorry.

1042
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:37,130
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

1043
01:36:44,766 --> 01:36:46,889
- I'll see you.
- Seth.

1044
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:51,688
You need some company?

1045
01:36:54,966 --> 01:36:59,764
Kate, do you know where I'm going?
Do you know what El Rey is?

1046
01:36:59,925 --> 01:37:03,643
- No.
- Hey, Seth.

1047
01:37:03,805 --> 01:37:07,325
It's time to go.

1048
01:37:07,486 --> 01:37:09,684
Go home, Kate.

1049
01:37:12,603 --> 01:37:15,963
I may be a bastard,
but I'm not a fuckin' bastard.
