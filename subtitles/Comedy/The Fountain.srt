1
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,190
Let us finish it.

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,274
- Perhaps it is a trap.
- It is.

3
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,510
Then what do we do?

4
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,516
We break through.

5
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,718
There!

6
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,916
I see him.

7
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,192
Pagans!

8
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,709
- Forward still.
- Retreat!

9
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,473
No! Do not stop.

10
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,670
We are her salvation, and through
her command we shall live forever.

11
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,513
I will not die.
Not here, not now!

12
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,068
Never!

13
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,029
No!

14
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,236
We're almost there.

15
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,229
You'll make it.
I won't let you die.

16
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,195
You're strong enough.

17
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,078
Finish it.

18
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,475
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

19
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,480
I just need to take a little.

20
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,115
Finish it.

21
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,911
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

22
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,911
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

23
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,197
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

24
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,033
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, lzzi.

25
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,317
I'm sorry.

26
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,311
I am.

27
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,030
I'll see you tonight.

28
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,350
Finish it.

29
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,789
Please, leave me alone.

30
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,718
I don't know how it ends.

31
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,477
All right.

32
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,998
I trust you.

33
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,036
Take me.

34
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,431
Show me.

35
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,870
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

36
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,837
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

37
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,593
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

38
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,717
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, lzzi.

39
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,639
I'm sorry.

40
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,995
I am.

41
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,195
I'll see you tonight, OK?

42
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,149
Lzzi.

43
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,676
Hey! Dr Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

44
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,673
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

45
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,309
Dammit.

46
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,153
Come on.

47
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,872
- Did he say if it was working?
- Just said to grab you and meet in Surgery.

48
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,393
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

49
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,550
- Call him.
- OK.

50
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,751
Antonio sent me ahead with the scans.
He's still busy in Chem Lab.

51
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,276
Breeny, it's Manny.
Where's Antonio?

52
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,995
- It's still growing aggressively.
- That much in two days!

53
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,913
What do you mean, you don't know?
Go get him. Find him.

54
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,593
He's been lying open 50 minutes now.

55
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,234
- He's crossing the street.
- The results?

56
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,074
- I didn't ask.
- Meet him at the elevator. Get his ass in here.

57
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,879
Micromanipulators at 42 degrees,
mediolateral, 72.

58
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,632
Yup.

59
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,792
How we doing, Donovan?
You hanging in?

60
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,634
No good.
Great specificity, but no suppression.

61
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,635
- Shall we close?
- No, euthanise.

62
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,794
- Why?
- If we don't treat now, the growth gets him.

63
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,711
Dammit!

64
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,869
- I'll prepare the pentabarbital.
- No, wait.

65
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,474
- What is it?
- That compound we played with last year.

66
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,076
- Which one?
- From that tree from Central America.

67
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,513
- That one.
- "Natul tortuosa. 82-A46."

68
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,034
- From Guatemala.
- The old-growth tree.

69
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,558
We had two samples, but it was sterile.
The graftings and clippings didn't take either.

70
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,835
- That's it.
- What's happening?

71
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,196
Mix it with your compound.
They've got a similar structure.

72
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,114
- Manny, find those samples.
- I don't see it.

73
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,113
Picture them side by side.
Fold them into each other like two lovers,

74
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,589
woman on top.

75
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,910
They have complementary domains.

76
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,355
- If we can get them to stick...
- Is this it?

77
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,433
- Go!
- We have no toxicity reports, not a single...

78
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,513
It doesn't matter. Donovan's on the table.
If we do nothing, he dies.

79
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,750
- Antonio, how long?
- Two hours.

80
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,035
Keep him under.

81
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,039
- I've never seen that adhesion pattern.
- What's it binding to it?

82
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,592
I don't know. But it's definitely
attaching to the high-growth regions.

83
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,591
Let's do it.

84
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,910
.751, 1.25.

85
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,436
- Syringe is loaded.
- Give it.

86
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,197
Manny, give me light.

87
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,831
Lowering.

88
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,633
- Injecting.
- Injection at 23:57.

89
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,508
- 23:57.
- Good boy, Donovan. Good boy.

90
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,278
- What's up?
- My ring.

91
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,679
- What ring?
- My wedding ring.

92
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,594
- Where'd you leave it?
- Right there, where I always put it.

93
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,719
- Someone must've knocked it on the ground.
- Tommy, may I have a word with you?

94
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,189
- One second.
- What are you doing?

95
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,716
- It's my ring. I put it there.
- It's gotta be here.

96
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,998
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't worry about it. We'll find it.

97
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,555
Tommy...

98
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,718
- I'm concerned.
- What?

99
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,794
I saw Betty in the hall. She was hysterical.
You've been running sloppy surgeries.

100
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,316
- Nonsense!
- You injected an untested compound.

101
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,868
He was open.
We were about to put him down.

102
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,350
NIH could shut us down.
I should shut you down for it.

103
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,035
You're reckless
and you're losing perspective.

104
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,150
Look, why don't you just
take a few days at home.

105
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,870
Spend a little time with lzzi.

106
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,077
I'm here for her.

107
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,391
Izzi.

108
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,997
Izzi?

109
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,712
Lz?

110
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,717
Lzzi?

111
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,512
Lzzi.

112
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,312
Izzi!

113
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,518
Lzzi!

114
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,431
- Tommy?
- Isabel!

115
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,828
That's funny.
Very funny.

116
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,631
What are you doing?

117
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,508
I'm... I'm stargazing.
I found it in the attic.

118
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,912
- Come on in. It's freezing.
- I want you to see something. Come on.

119
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,753
You're an old fart.

120
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,558
OK.

121
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,078
OK.

122
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,199
Go on. Look.

123
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,678
- You see it?
- The gold star?

124
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,118
It's actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star. That's what makes it look gold.

125
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,157
What?

126
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,470
- I took science.
- When?

127
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,269
Junior high.

128
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,630
- The Mayans called it Xibalba.
- Xibalba?

129
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,036
It was their underworld.
The place the dead souls go to be reborn.

130
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,631
What? What are you talking about?

131
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,551
My book.

132
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,677
- I'm writing about it.
- I thought it took place in Spain.

133
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,796
It begins there.

134
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,070
Ends there.

135
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,116
Are you done?

136
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,589
- Almost.
- Good. When do I read it?

137
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,396
Someday soon it will explode, die,
and give birth to new stars.

138
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,429
How amazing that the Mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld.

139
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,592
Of all the healthy points of light in the sky,

140
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,071
how did they find one that was dying?

141
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,789
Where are your shoes?

142
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,550
Lzzi! Come on, come on.
Let's warm you up.

143
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,230
Whoa, whoa. Careful.

144
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,231
OK. I'll get it.

145
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,436
Careful. Iz?

146
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,112
Stop. No!

147
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,997
Get inside.

148
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,036
Serves you right.

149
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,630
Is she a redhead?

150
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,557
What?

151
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,115
I left it in Surgery.

152
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,078
If you can't wait, you can't wait.

153
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,348
I'm joking.

154
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,035
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait. The sponge.

155
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,150
I want you to heat it.

156
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,357
Outside, before,
you couldn't feel the cold.

157
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,078
Tommy.

158
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,710
- I'm calling Dr Lipper.
- No! I'm afraid.

159
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,470
Jesus, I'm sorry.

160
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,629
- It's been happening for a while.
- What?

161
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,951
- I'm losing sensitivity to hot and cold.
- Why didn't you tell me?

162
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,873
Because I feel different inside.

163
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,520
I feel different.

164
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,676
Every moment.

165
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,910
Each one.

166
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,312
Tommy?

167
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,639
Oh, Jesus.

168
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,076
Look, don't worry.
Don't worry. All right? I'm here.

169
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,151
I will always be here.

170
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,431
I know. Yes, I know, lz.

171
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,991
Got you.

172
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,993
- Hello?
- Alan? Tommy.

173
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,878
- Tommy.
- What's the earliest you can make tomorrow?

174
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,636
- Let me check my schedule.
- It's time for you to read it.

175
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,909
- Three? I'm in Surgery till then. Is it urgent?
- No, no. That's fine. Thanks, Alan. Bye.

176
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,276
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- Start it. Tell me what you think.

177
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,238
- But it's not done.
- Not quite.

178
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,071
Don't answer it.

179
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,470
- Hello? Antonio, what's wrong?
- Can you get down here?

180
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,074
- What is it?
- Donovan.

181
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,071
- Is he OK?
- He's perfectly fine.

182
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,310
- What's happening?
- You won't believe me.

183
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,834
You've got to see for yourself.
Come right away.

184
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,750
No, I can't now. I can't.

185
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,957
- To Donovan!
- What's going on?

186
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,508
- Show him.
- I came to check up on Donovan.

187
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,751
- Where is Donovan?
- That's him.

188
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,593
What? It can't be.

189
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,195
He's almost healed.
There's hair growth.

190
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,875
- I didn't believe it either.
- Antonio had me run some tests.

191
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,952
Donovan responded well.
Really well.

192
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,957
I pulled up videos of him pre-op.
He's testing twice as well.

193
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,229
We're seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing.

194
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,954
- And the tumour?
- No change.

195
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,398
The growth patterns are normal.
There's no positive or negative effect.

196
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,359
- We should tell Dr Guzetti right away.
- No! No.

197
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,871
Antonio,

198
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,479
prep a new cocktail.
Stick with the same substance.

199
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,516
What?

200
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,591
- We're moving forward.
- Wait.

201
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,796
But this could be a medical first.

202
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,236
A revelation! We've gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings.

203
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,915
We can monitor synaptic growth,
but our focus is tumours, not ageing.

204
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,949
- I know, but...
- I want the next subject ready for surgery.

205
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,312
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

206
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,630
Everything's all right.

207
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,509
Inquisitor?

208
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,310
Enter.

209
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,076
The heretics.

210
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,153
They have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office.

211
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,708
They await yourjudgment.

212
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,829
Yet another slice of her nation is mine.

213
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,434
Soon she will be powerless against me.

214
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,073
Queen of nothing but her sins.

215
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,036
What will you do with her?

216
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,635
She too will confess,
and then

217
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,710
she too will die.

218
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,793
Captain. 'Tis the queen.

219
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,871
She is surrounded.

220
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,554
The inquisitor demands blood.

221
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,555
Then there is no more time.

222
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,149
What is our response?

223
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,959
Go now.
Warn the queen.

224
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,237
- And you? Where are you going?
- He must be cut out.

225
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,788
- She has forbidden it.
- There is no other choice.

226
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,916
This is our only hope.

227
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,074
Stay. Stay.

228
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,830
Our bodies are prisons for our souls.

229
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,673
Our skin and blood,
the iron bars of confinement.

230
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,840
But fear not.

231
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,956
All flesh decays.

232
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,992
Death turns all to ash,

233
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
and, thus,

234
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,068
death frees every soul.

235
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,595
You, the condemned,

236
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,353
you have confessed.

237
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,911
You admit to protecting a queen

238
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
who twists the word of God

239
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,510
and drowns all Spain in sin.

240
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,716
Your queen seeks immortality on Earth -
a false paradise.

241
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,439
This is heresy.

242
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,988
She leads you towards vanity,

243
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,878
away from the spirit.

244
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,235
But this is foolishness,

245
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,749
for death exists.

246
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,070
The Day of Judgment is irrefutable.

247
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,429
All life must be judged.

248
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,911
- Why are you here?
- Come quickly.

249
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,710
- Leave. Protect the queen.
- She sent me. She demands your return.

250
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,475
- Not before he dies.
- No, Tomas. Leave him.

251
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,313
She desires a private audience.

252
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,713
But fear not.
She will not be in hell alone.

253
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,270
I will make sure
her servants are waiting for her.

254
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,872
Faithful servant, why do you cry?

255
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,350
To see Spain brought so low,

256
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,036
with an enemy thriving within her borders,
feasting on her strength.

257
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,759
The shame is too much.
I've failed her.

258
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,115
Dare not pity Spain.

259
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,880
These times are dark,

260
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,034
but every shadow, no matter how deep,
is threatened by morning light.

261
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,236
Of course.

262
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,629
This loyalty of yours

263
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,110
inspires you to protect Spain at any cost,

264
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,478
but killing the inquisitor is suicide.

265
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,835
Europe would have my head.

266
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,913
I, for one, am not ready to die yet.
Are you?

267
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,468
I will die for Spain.

268
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,875
I know, Conquistador.

269
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,473
I know.

270
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,439
And this bravery of yours,
it may save us yet.

271
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,757
For Spain has a plan.

272
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,832
There is hope.

273
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,354
- There's hope?
- Father.

274
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,989
I am Father Avila
of her royal Franciscan order.

275
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,548
Our allegiance remains with Spain.

276
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,473
Father.

277
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,074
Guards, leave us.

278
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,998
Conquistador,

279
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,837
I am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown.

280
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,960
One year ago, Father Avila returned
from the jungles of New Spain

281
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,031
with a secret so great,

282
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,556
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny.

283
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,474
Spain desired this treasure
above all things,

284
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,711
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure.

285
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,394
When I refused to give up my quest for it,

286
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,235
he responded with this violent coup
to bring Spain to her knees.

287
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,039
But we have not yielded,

288
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,873
and now we will defeat him.

289
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,757
This is our hope.

290
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,628
- A dagger?
- Used in religious rituals.

291
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,393
I took it from a dead Mayan priest.

292
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,310
The marking on the hilt...

293
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,873
Do you see it?

294
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,631
It is a map.

295
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,756
A map to the Mayans' greatest secret.

296
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,994
Greater than Chichen ltzá, greater than
Yaxchilán, greater even than Tikal.

297
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,870
Here, in the centre, in the core
of the once-great Mayan civilisation,

298
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,112
we will find a lost pyramid.

299
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,429
No.

300
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,238
Not lost.

301
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,553
Hidden.
The hidden pyramid of the Mayan myths.

302
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,076
The myths tell us of a holy pyramid,

303
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,799
built upon the navel of the Earth,

304
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,713
the birthplace of life.

305
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,234
A special tree sprouts there.

306
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,393
They say whoever drinks of its sap

307
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,392
will live forever.

308
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,990
Eternal life?

309
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,471
Spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns?

310
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,949
They are not yarns.

311
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,235
Remember,

312
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,515
our own Bible confirms it.

313
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,354
In Genesis, there are two trees
in the Garden of Eden -

314
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,149
the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life.

315
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,357
When Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge,

316
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,149
the Lord banned them from the garden
and hid the Tree of Life.

317
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,911
Could it be?

318
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,398
Could it be?

319
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,149
Kneel, Conquistador.

320
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,913
Let in the morning light.

321
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,830
The beast runs amok in my kingdom.

322
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,598
He has isolated me,

323
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,549
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push.

324
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,434
But salvation lies
in the jungles of New Spain.

325
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,632
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

326
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,518
Upon my honour and my life.

327
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,996
Then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise.

328
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,111
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

329
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,509
and when you return,

330
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,750
I shall be your Eve.

331
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,678
Together, we will live forever.

332
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,511
Iz?

333
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,872
Lzzi?

334
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,998
- There you are.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

335
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,756
- Babe, we have Lipper at three.
- This is an actual Mayan book.

336
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,960
Look. It explains their creation myth. You see,
that's First Father. He's the very first human.

337
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,235
Is he dead?

338
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,756
He sacrificed himself to make the world.

339
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,238
- The Tree of Life's bursting out of his belly.
- Come on.

340
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,997
Listen. His body became the tree's roots.
They spread and formed the Earth.

341
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,709
His soul became the branches,
rising up, forming the sky.

342
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,234
All that remained
was First Father's head.

343
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,074
His children hung it in the heavens,
creating Xibalba.

344
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,469
Xibalba? The star.

345
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,630
Nebula.

346
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,154
- So what do you think?
- About?

347
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,117
That idea.

348
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,078
Death as an act of creation.

349
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,876
Stay together, guys.

350
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,355
I'll pull out the car
and meet you in front.

351
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,156
Iz. Iz!

352
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,435
- Tommy.
- Hey.

353
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,712
Tommy.

354
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,674
You're all right.

355
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,789
- I'm close.
- No.

356
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,552
There are options.

357
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,315
- We'll have to make some choices.
- Alan?

358
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,235
You had a minor seizure. The growth in
your brainstem's back and it's growing faster.

359
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,470
- The next time...
- No!

360
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,998
No.

361
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,036
We had a breakthrough.

362
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,873
I know I can translate it to help you.

363
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,235
I just need a little more time, OK?

364
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,471
There's hope.
There's real hope.

365
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,552
- Tommy.
- What? What, baby?

366
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,638
- I wasn't afraid.
- I know.

367
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,234
You're very strong.

368
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,072
No.

369
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,158
- No.
- What?

370
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,549
When I fell

371
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,709
I was full.

372
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,951
Held.

373
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,673
I know.
I caught you. I held you.

374
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,033
It's OK, lz.
Everything's gonna be all right.

375
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,036
There's time.
We have time.

376
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,514
We need to examine
the hippocampal region.

377
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,479
- What the hell's going on?
- I brought in Dean Katari and Dr...

378
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,357
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

379
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,078
- Antonio and Betty were just showing me...
- Donovan's synaptic growth increased.

380
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,311
His brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago, when he was six.

381
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,195
And the tumour?

382
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,590
- Exactly. Please?
- Tommy...

383
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,989
Please!

384
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,790
Perhaps you should wait for me in my office.
Manny. I'll be right there.

385
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,509
- Thomas, I'd like a word with you in private.
- After surgery.

386
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,072
First cut.

387
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,672
Tommy.
Dr Lipperjust called.

388
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,517
He said lzzi's doing better and they're gonna
move her to a regular floor in the morning.

389
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,875
When we're done here,
I want you to prep Cain.

390
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,552
I'll get her.
She'll take care of it.

391
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,238
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,677
You don't abandon results like that.
You repeat the procedure, get a confirmation.

393
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,039
Confirmation that the tumour's unaffected?
She'll be dead by then.

394
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,031
Tommy.

395
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,232
She had a seizure.

396
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,669
I'm so sorry.

397
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,750
- How's she doing?
- She's stable.

398
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,031
Who's with her?

399
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,794
- She's alone?
- She needs to rest.

400
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,590
No one invents new drugs overnight. No one!
You're not being rational.

401
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,513
- You can't fix everything!
- Don't tell me what I can do.

402
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:27,550
- Your wife needs you. Why are you here?
- Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

403
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,831
Shit.

404
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,596
I'll leave you two alone.

405
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,038
Lilly, I'm sorry about before.

406
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,871
She's amazing.

407
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,471
Lillian,

408
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,120
could...

409
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,034
could you have Henry
re-scan the animals for me?

410
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,270
- OK.
- Thanks.

411
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,031
- Hey.
- Hey.

412
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,759
I brought your manuscript
in case you want to work.

413
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,996
How are you feeling?

414
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,718
Good.

415
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,751
I'm sorry.

416
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,716
What about?

417
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,350
There's been progress at work.

418
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,353
My conquistador.
Always conquering.

419
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,797
- No. Something amazing. We tested...
- That's for you.

420
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,274
It's for me? What is it?

421
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,316
Open it.

422
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,268
Pen and ink. For writing.

423
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,390
It's all done except the last chapter.

424
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,151
I want you to help me.

425
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,310
How?

426
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,516
Finish it.

427
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,997
Finish it.

428
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,640
- I don't know how it ends.
- You do.

429
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,755
You will.

430
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,751
Stop.

431
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,476
- Remember Moses Morales?
- Who?

432
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,151
- The Mayan guide I told you about.
- From your trip?

433
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,353
The last night I was with him,
he told me about his father who had died.

434
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,396
- But Moses wouldn't believe it.
- Izzi!

435
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,870
No, no. Listen. Listen.

436
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,430
He said if they dug his father's body up,

437
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,551
he would be gone.

438
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,917
They'd planted a seed over his grave.

439
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,911
The seed became a tree.

440
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,513
Moses said his father became part of that tree.

441
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,752
He grew into the wood, into the bloom.

442
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,791
And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit,

443
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,154
his father flew with the birds.

444
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,911
He said

445
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,793
death was his father's road to awe.

446
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,351
That's what he called it.

447
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,397
The road to awe.

448
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,515
Now,

449
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,957
I've been trying to write the last chapter and
I haven't been able to get that out of my head.

450
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,315
Why are you telling me this?

451
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,714
I'm not afraid any more, Tommy.

452
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,396
I asked Lilly if I could be buried at her farm.

453
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,789
No, stop it!

454
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,113
- I want you to be with me.
- I am with you. Look.

455
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,475
I'll always be with you.

456
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,518
I promise.

457
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,198
Will you stay with me tonight?

458
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,229
Yeah. I'll stay.

459
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,591
I'll stay.

460
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,118
Don't worry,

461
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,791
we're almost there.

462
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,430
Through that last dark cloud is a dying star.

463
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,992
And soon enough, Xibalba will die.

464
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,717
And when it explodes,
you will be reborn.

465
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,911
You will bloom.

466
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,951
And I will live.

467
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,713
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

468
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,035
Thank you, Lord! We are here!

469
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,751
Circles.

470
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,990
He leads us in circles.

471
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,030
Only we are left.
All of your countrymen are dead.

472
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,795
He killed them all with this blind quest.

473
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,558
It's time. Time to stop him.

474
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,992
Captain, we are lost.

475
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,834
The Franciscan and his tales are false.

476
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,070
There is no hope for us here.

477
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,511
There's only death.

478
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,752
- I've mapped us a course back to the ships.
- Coward.

479
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,317
Damn the maps!

480
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,275
We're close and I will find it.

481
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,318
Captain! Captain! Captain!

482
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,153
Father. What is it, Franciscan?

483
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,071
In the jungle...

484
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,310
The marking on the hilt.

485
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,279
- On the dagger?
- It is the same. The same as on the stone.

486
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,357
Your choice - die now
or, by my side, fight and live.

487
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,270
- You fool.
- Captain!

488
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,351
Father.

489
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,635
Take it.

490
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,392
We are here.

491
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,675
- Where?
- The temple is there.

492
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,231
Sorry, Father.

493
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,868
For you, there is only death.

494
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,998
But our destiny is life.

495
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,471
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

496
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,838
and when you return,
I shall be your Eve.

497
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,751
Iz! Lz!

498
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,630
Come on, come on, come on!

499
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,836
Oh, no. Please! Please!

500
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,789
- Step aside.
- She's in V-fib. Pulse thready.

501
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,916
- I'm bagging. Sir! Sir!
- Izzi! Lzzi!

502
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,798
- Get the family out. Get him out!
- Sir, please!

503
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,199
- Pads.
- Charging.

504
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,235
- Pulse?
- Thready.

505
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,514
Pressure?

506
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,511
Oh, God.

507
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,638
Tommy.

508
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,476
I know. I know.

509
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,199
I've never seen anything like it.

510
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,510
- Antonio didn't reach you?
- What?

511
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,797
It's Donovan.
The growth is shrinking.

512
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,269
It's like the disease is cured.

513
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,035
Izzi.

514
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,031
Izzi!

515
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,030
Lzzi!

516
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,989
- No, no, no, no!
- Sir. Please, sir.

517
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,274
Sir!

518
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,148
Sir, it's too late.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

519
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,879
- Sir, it's too late.
- You killed my wife!

520
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,679
- Get off him! Let go!
- Let go!

521
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,993
No.

522
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,835
No.

523
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,194
No!

524
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,555
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

525
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,200
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die!

526
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,077
No! No!

527
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,116
No!

528
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:06,228
It seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole.

529
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,434
Complete enough when we die

530
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,749
to achieve a measure of grace.

531
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,397
Few of us ever do.

532
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,837
Most of us end up going out
the way we came in, kicking and screaming.

533
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,471
But somehow lzzi, young as she was,

534
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,680
she achieved that grace.

535
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,797
In her last days she became whole.

536
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,551
She saw her...

537
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,278
Tommy!

538
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,268
- Tommy...
- Just stop it!

539
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,034
Death is a disease.
It's like any other.

540
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,714
And there's a cure.

541
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,028
A cure.

542
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,634
And I will find it.

543
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,548
No!

544
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,231
All these years.

545
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,069
All these memories.

546
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,636
There's been you.

547
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,989
You...

548
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,355
You pulled me through time.

549
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,358
Dr Creo?

550
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,951
Dr Creo, we heard you were back.

551
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,199
Update me on everything we know
about that tree. Every detail.

552
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,668
I'm OK. Everything's fine.

553
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,789
The Donovan breakthrough's
our starting point. It's a starting point.

554
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,030
Right, let's build on it.

555
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,429
Stop ageing, stop dying.

556
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,670
Stop dying, that's our goal.

557
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,275
Scans. Cultures. Charts.
Let's get to work.

558
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,669
Come on, let's get to work.

559
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,351
Xibalba.

560
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,919
We're here.

561
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,471
We almost made it.

562
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,151
I'm sorry.

563
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,311
I'm sorry.

564
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,073
Finish it.

565
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,957
Stop it. Stop it!

566
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,836
What do you want?

567
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,271
Leave me! Leave me alone!

568
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,237
Please, please. I'm afraid.

569
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,633
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

570
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,311
I don't know.

571
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,595
I'm trying. I don't know how.

572
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,671
You do.

573
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,796
You will.

574
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,911
You do.

575
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,432
You will.

576
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,470
I'm not afraid any more, Tommy.

577
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,916
I'm gonna die.

578
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,835
I'm going to die.

579
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,912
Together we will live forever.

580
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,271
Forever.

581
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,430
Forever.

582
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,751
Forever.

583
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,314
We will live forever.

584
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,549
Finish it.

585
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,196
OK.

586
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,916
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

587
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,798
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow. We always...

588
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,394
They're waiting on me.

589
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,438
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, lzzi.

590
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,558
I'm sorry. I am.

591
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,831
I'll see you tonight, OK?

592
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:05,954
Lzzi.

593
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,759
Hey! Dr Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

594
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,433
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

595
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,269
Come on. Let's go.

596
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,316
Dr Creo, where are you going?

597
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,837
Lzzi!

598
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,989
Lzzi.

599
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,671
No!

600
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,234
Finish it.

601
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,958
Behold.

602
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,151
My queen.

603
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,151
Now and forever.

604
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,872
We shall be together.

605
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,351
Bye, lz.

606
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,113
I finished it.

607
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,589
Is everything all right?

608
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,716
Yes.

609
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,756
Everything's all right.

610
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:49,871
