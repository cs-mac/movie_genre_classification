1
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,477
Follow me.

2
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,123
- Hi.
- Hey.

3
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,393
I am so sorry.
I don't speak any Japanese.

4
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,479
The interpreter couldn't make it,

5
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,815
but I'm sure you're going to love it.

6
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,526
Getting a table on the last night
is almost impossible.

7
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,554
Yes, doctor, I understand.

8
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:53,015
It's just all so unexpected that--

9
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,768
Yes, of course.
Fine. She's fine.

10
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:01,607
Sure. Does that mean
that she can go to this dinner?

11
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:05,069
That is if she wants to, obviously.

12
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,239
Very well then. Thank you, doctor.

13
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,116
Goodbye then.
Goodbye.

14
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,826
- That's it. I'm going.

15
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,496
I see, madam.
Shall I prepare the car?

16
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,374
Yes, but first fetch the ladder.

17
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,087
We're taking him along.

18
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,131
Yes, madam.

19
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,843
Well, do get a move on, Burton.

20
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,971
I mean, you've got
to get me ready too

21
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:36,350
and do my hair and all that.

22
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,895
Honestly, I don't know
why I pay you.

23
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,980
Yes, madam.

24
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,305
- Mmm!

25
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,401
Good evening.

26
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,447
Hello.

27
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,867
Yoshio Takamura,

28
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:25,037
- Isao Kamikama--
- Kamiyama.

29
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:28,165
Kamiyama, sorry...
are both very excited

30
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,961
to come here to dinner tonight.

31
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,712
Thank you so much for coming.

32
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,589
We're so pleased to have you
here and we're so honored

33
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:38,217
that you've come all the way
from Tokyo to enjoy our meal.

34
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,644
Ah.

35
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,777
The presents.
The presents.

36
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,124
Um... and now we'll start you off
with a cocktail.

37
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,527
- Matilda.
- Darling.

38
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,905
I can't believe it. You came.

39
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,868
No, now don't go all mushy on me
or I'm leaving.

40
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,370
- Max.
- Countess.

41
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,164
Are you okay?
What happened?

42
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,125
Oh, this?
Oh, no, no, it's nothing.

43
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,420
Well, they went crazy doing tests.

44
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,923
So I'm a little anemic.
What do they expect?

45
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,385
- Doctors.
- Is that what I think it is?

46
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,556
He wouldn't want to miss this.

47
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,100
You know, he never changed his plans.

48
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,770
Stubborn as a mule.

49
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,938
Matilda, thanks so much for coming.

50
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,067
You don't know what it means to me
to have you here tonight.

51
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,653
They should've closed
this place down years ago,

52
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,821
- seeing how you cook.
- Sure, sure.

53
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,949
Anyhow, what was I to do?
Stay home?

54
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,369
Frankly, I'd rather
make a fool of myself,

55
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:36,121
come here alone and dine alone.

56
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,875
At least that way it gives them all
something to gossip about.

57
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,961
- Matilda, I have to go.
- It's paid for, yes?

58
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,588
Yes, of course.

59
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,548
Oh, good.

60
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,592
The first to arrive,
the last to be greeted.

61
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,011
My apologies.
Max Barney, director of Chakula.

62
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,430
- Walter Reilly.
- Of course. Mr. Reilly.

63
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,517
Well, welcome.
I hope you have a wonderful evening.

64
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,768
Thank you.

65
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,271
I've been looking forward
to this moment for a very long time.

66
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,815
Well, we're very glad
to have you with us.

67
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,526
Please, if you need anything, don't
hesitate to ask a member of our staff.

68
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,237
Don't worry about me.
If I get bored, I'll let you know.

69
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,944
Ah!

70
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,203
- Do you need help?
- No, no, no. No, thank you.

71
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:27,042
Well, yes. Would you mind
holding this for a moment?

72
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,877
Sure, of course.

73
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,546
- Thank you.
- Okay.

74
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,633
Ah, careful now.
That's my husband.

75
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,302
Oh. Lovely.

76
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,055
Not to worry, dear.
He's already dead.

77
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,350
- I hope so.

78
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:47,312
Alive, he would've given you
something to worry about.

79
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,649
Thank you. I'll...
I'll take that as a compliment.

80
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,403
- Are you married?
- Um... was.

81
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:59,783
- Oh, he died too?
- No. No, we're, um... divorced.

82
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,368
Oh, divorced.

83
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,747
Well... make the most of it, dear.

84
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,708
Life is short.

85
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,342
Mmm!

86
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,954
Hello.

87
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,671
It's beautiful.

88
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,092
It's ringing,
but nobody's picking up.

89
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,219
- You're killing me.
- Man: Listen, they're not picking up.

90
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,430
Should I just get
in the car and we leave?

91
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,098
Oh, I don't know. Yes!

92
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,308
All right, let's go. Come on.

93
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,228
- Diane, come on.
- Thank you.

94
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,606
Thank you.

95
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,211
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the last time,

96
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,089
welcome and enjoy.

97
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,298
Please.

98
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,083
Hold on now.

99
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,211
I... I don't need this huge table.

100
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,963
It looks like I'm expecting someone.

101
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,050
- Orders from up top.
- This is where you park the old lady

102
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,385
so she doesn't cause any trouble.

103
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,839
And now we will follow up the
cocktail by serving our tasting menu,

104
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,841
what we like to call the second act.

105
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,511
Afterwards,
we will return to the terrace

106
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,513
for desserts and liquors.

107
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,681
And finally, tonight's surprise dish.

108
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,195
Sayonara.

109
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,655
Sayonara.

110
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,783
Please. Enjoy your meal.

111
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,259
Yeah.

112
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,267
- Um...

113
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,777
Go for it, young man.

114
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,613
She's available.

115
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,491
Divorced.

116
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,109
I managed to reach
the restaurant and told them

117
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,654
we're running a little late,
so quit your pouting, Daniel.

118
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,990
Actually, do you want me to text her
and tell her we landed safely?

119
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,952
No. Thank you. You know
what I'd like you to do?

120
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,496
Keep your eyes on the road,
drive a little faster,

121
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,456
So we don't have
to be so damn late.

122
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,500
He's just jealous.
Can't you tell he's dying

123
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,460
to be with a literary star
ten years younger than him?

124
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,003
No, she's 20 years younger than me.

125
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,798
Twenty years. Now can we
get off this now, please?

126
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,466
We've been on it since New York.

127
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,581
So... a toast.
We need to toast.

128
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,499
To a wonderful evening

129
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,543
and to the success
of your business,

130
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,254
your new business.
Chin-chin.

131
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,923
Oh, in Japanese,

132
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,217
we don't use that word
at the dinner table.

133
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,345
- What word?
- Chin-chin.

134
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,263
- Why?
- In Japanese,

135
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,016
it's something we have
but you don't.

136
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,559
What?

137
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,564
Oh, I get it.

138
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,776
You mean a penis.

139
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,321
Chin-chin means penis
in Japanese.

140
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:21,034
I love it. Penis-penis.

141
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,696
Mr. Reilly, the wine list.

142
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,239
Oh, please.

143
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,451
Finca Garbet, 2005.

144
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:47,078
- Finca Garbet.
- I assume you have it.

145
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,746
Absolutely.
Excellent choice.

146
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,040
I know what I like.

147
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,876
Um, is everything all right?
Are you enjoying your food?

148
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,711
Delicious, thank you.

149
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,172
- Would you like to try one?
- Oh, no, no, no.

150
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:59,048
Thank you very much.
Those are for you.

151
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,759
Um...

152
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:05,346
The maître d' has been telling me
that you've been discussing the menu.

153
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,557
He's very impressed
with your knowledge of gastronomy.

154
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,392
I know very little.

155
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:13,229
I have a passion for fine cuisine,
that's all.

156
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:17,066
I'm intrigued by the process.

157
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,152
Well, perhaps you'd like to come
and visit our kitchen later.

158
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,695
That won't be necessary.

159
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,198
Of course.

160
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,575
- Mr. Barney?
- Yes?

161
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,661
Excuse me.

162
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,753
Um...

163
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,493
I knew you'd end up
being demoted to waitress.

164
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,870
- Serves you right.
- Mind if I sit down?

165
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,789
Oh, if you insist.

166
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,874
Thank you.

167
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,544
- Okay.

168
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,838
Don't you like
the table I chose for you?

169
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,134
When you get to my
age you'll know what it feels like.

170
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,304
There's nothing worse
than being pitied.

171
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,932
How's the count doing?

172
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,560
Well, you know, so far
he hasn't sent anything back.

173
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,146
Please don't spread
the ashes around here.

174
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,689
You could use them as an ingredient.

175
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,441
That'd be something new for you.

176
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,863
Don't you have some work to do?
I don't need a babysitter.

177
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,199
Matilda, there is nothing
wrong in missing him.

178
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,743
- I miss him too.
- Go to work.

179
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:34,454
Go boil an egg
or do something useful.

180
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,788
Go on.

181
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,252
Bon appétit.

182
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,934
Yes, yes, yes.

183
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:52,323
Yes.

184
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,419
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,642
Hidalgo, hey, it's Max.

186
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,195
Look,
it's really very busy right now.

187
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,530
I have to go.

188
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,533
I'm liking where this is going.

189
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,493
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

190
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,495
This is a surprise.
Do you like my surprise?

191
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:05,122
- What are you talking about?
- We just sat in a table

192
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,707
in New York and said it was a bummer

193
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,709
we couldn't be here
together at this thing.

194
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,670
Well, here we are,
we're together.

195
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,089
We're not exactly together,
because you gotta deal with him,

196
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,924
- but still--
- I don't understand, okay?

197
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,926
How long have
you had this planned?

198
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,594
I didn't plan this.

199
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,347
Diane had a friend who got
pregnant and she couldn't fly,

200
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,474
so I just took her spot.

201
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,393
I mean...

202
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:28,020
That was a week ago,
but it wasn't a plan.

203
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,981
You're happy to see me, right?

204
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,817
Dan, you can't just show up here
without checking with me.

205
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,779
Wait, so you're saying
you're not happy to see me?

206
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,525
It's true.
It's true.

207
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:17,236
It's called "Costa Brava lifestyle."

208
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,490
It's about the sea,
the landscape, the light,

209
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,451
and with the food. Yeah.

210
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:26,746
Eating out in the sunshine
with a nice wine.

211
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,540
- Mmm. Do you understand?
- Yes.

212
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,502
It's for that that you
need a calm sea.

213
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,881
Here we don't have
earthquakes or tsunamis.

214
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,926
We... we are relaxed people.

215
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,136
Yes.

216
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:47,350
Um, please.
Why don't you have another glass?

217
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:51,020
And then you can tell me
what the food tastes like.

218
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,274
Anyway, we don't have to pay.

219
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,572
'Cause we don't have to pay.

220
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,929
- Who is she with?
- Who?

221
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,933
Oh, uh... Nobody.

222
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,227
Just her ex.
They have some...

223
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,229
Just... I don't know.

224
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,815
- Things to wrap up.

225
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,735
Yes, sir?

226
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:25,406
Give that to the woman
over there in the red dress.

227
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,326
- Thank you.

228
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,954
Daniel's very mysterious
tonight, don't you agree?

229
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,372
He is, isn't he?

230
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:36,000
And he seems so much younger
since he started dating Rachel.

231
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,335
And it even looks
like he's grown more hair.

232
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,629
I have hair plugs.

233
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,825
"My love, I haven't told you
that you look glorious tonight.

234
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:13,287
Why don't we swim naked
under the moonlight?"

235
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:36,180
Hey, uh, forgive the interruption.

236
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:39,099
- It's Marc. You're Marc, right?
- Yeah.

237
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:40,517
- How are you?
- Good.

238
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,853
I just wanted to come by
and take a minute

239
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:45,189
- to talk man to man if you don't mind.
- No, no, not at all.

240
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:47,107
Yeah, Raquel told me you are working
hard on the new book.

241
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:48,359
She didn't tell you, did she?

242
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:51,278
No. What hasn't she told me?

243
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:53,364
Rachel and I are together, Marc.

244
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,574
You mean working together.

245
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,243
I mean we're getting married.

246
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,790
It's a tough way to find out, huh?

247
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:14,171
- Yes?
- I want you to take this

248
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,131
to Rachel Grossman
with her dessert.

249
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,800
- I'm sorry--
- Ah!

250
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,677
Save the small talk for
your boyfriend. This is important.

251
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,726
You're still here.

252
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:30,562
Yes, sir.

253
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,785
It's good.

254
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,425
But it's good or bad?

255
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:10,811
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

256
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,729
I'll bring you another
carrot tangle straight away.

257
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,065
No, that's fine,
Eduardo. Thank you.

258
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:17,693
- They were tangled up to begin with.
- My apologies.

259
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:19,236
You're sure you don't
want a new one?

260
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:22,322
No no, it's fine, really.
Thank you.

261
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:24,783
Tell me...

262
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:28,328
...do people usually
fight like that in here?

263
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:30,497
No. No, not really.

264
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:32,207
But here...

265
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,168
...there's a surprise every minute.

266
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:37,212
- Of course. Thank you.

267
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:53,312
It's a nice spot, huh?

269
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,897
I was thinking maybe
we should buy the place,

270
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:56,773
open a restaurant or something.
What do you think?

271
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,388
- What, they didn't like the food?
- Mmm...

272
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:24,755
No, really, I love to sing.

273
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,548
It's my hobby.

274
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:30,177
Never professionally,
only in the karaoke bar.

275
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,430
But you've got a lot of karaoke bars
in Japan, right?

276
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,015
Yes, we do.

277
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,267
And have you ever sung in a
karaoke bar?

278
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:39,269
Yes, I love singing.

279
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,274
Who's your favorite singer?

280
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:47,819
Lady Gaga.

281
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:40,664
Mmm.

282
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:48,839
- Eduardo.
- Yes?

283
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:51,425
I am very flattered,

284
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:54,511
but you are far too young.

285
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:57,889
And I think you know
where this ring belongs.

286
00:50:57,973 --> 00:51:00,058
- Yes, I do.
- Mmm.

287
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:02,978
I will take care of that.

288
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:07,607
Thank you.

289
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,352
Gentlemen, how is everything?
Is everything all right?

290
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:46,730
Oh, everything is great.
Thank you very much.

291
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,774
- Well, you're really welcome.
- Thank you.

292
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,278
Um, well, if there's anything
you need, just ask, okay?

293
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,652
- Max.
- Yeah?

294
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:54,881
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen,

295
00:52:54,965 --> 00:52:56,341
if I can have your attention please.

296
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:59,511
The night's not over,
but we're gonna change the venue.

297
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,346
If you've got a drink,
bring it with you.

298
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:04,599
If not, please come and join us
for a cocktail en el chiringuito.

299
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:13,316
My husband and I
came here quite often. Mm-hm.

300
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,902
He was really very fond of Mar.

301
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:20,240
I suppose she's, well,
the daughter we never had.

302
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:23,159
Your husband sounds like an
amazing man.

303
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:25,662
Oh, you cannot imagine,
Miss...

304
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:27,664
- Rachel, please.
- Oh, Rachel.

305
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:30,542
Pretty name.

306
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:35,380
My husband was a businessman.

307
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,674
Uh, not a very good one, I'm afraid.

308
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:42,596
He was... an adventurer.

309
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:46,892
One of those men for whom
the world is just too small.

310
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:50,270
I seem to come across men
for whom the world is too big.

311
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:57,944
Fernando ate more than anyone,
drank more than anyone,

312
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:00,530
shouted more than anyone and--

313
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:03,033
- Don't say it. I can already imagine.

314
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,119
No no, that is not what I was going
to say, you cheeky young lady.

315
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,747
I was going to say that everyone
knew him everywhere,

316
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:12,834
and when he spoke,
nobody dared open his mouth.

317
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:14,753
Except for me.

318
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:19,341
You know, I had never
really understood his tastes.

319
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:25,931
But I really rather miss his...
walks on the wild side.

320
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:29,059
I wanted to crawl into a hole and die

321
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,519
at every fresh encounter, but...

322
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:37,609
...truth be told, that's when
he made me laugh the most.

323
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,486
Excuse me.

324
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,372
- Oh, will you excuse me?

325
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:51,581
Yeah.

326
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:54,334
Hello. Thank you.

327
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,629
Yes, I'm still here.

328
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:01,174
Yes, no news.
Everything's still the same.

329
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,219
What can I tell you?
If there's no news, there's no news.

330
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:06,346
I'm sorry. Can't talk now.
I'll call you back.

331
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:11,267
- Sorry about that.
- No problem. Um...

332
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:14,771
This is really kinda silly,
now that dinner's over,

333
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:16,731
it's not gonna matter
one way or another, but--

334
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:18,316
I'm sorry, I just have to ask.
You wouldn't--

335
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,485
- Excuse me.

336
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,414
What?!

337
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,372
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:19,085
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mar?

339
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:38,813
Uh-huh.

340
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:48,782
- Can we talk?
- Daniel, what are you doing here?

341
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:51,451
I just think we should talk
given what's happened, privately.

342
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:53,870
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean--

343
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:55,872
- Listen--
- Am I talking to you, Marc?

344
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,874
'Cause I don't think I am.

345
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:01,419
- Oh!

346
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,965
Are you okay?
Let me see. Let me see.

347
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:09,177
Water. A glass of water, please.

348
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,346
What, me?
Lou, get her a glass of water.

349
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:14,099
It's just my blood pressure.

350
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:18,269
- Can I sit down somewhere?
- Sure.

351
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,943
Well, the pulse is fine and I don't
really see anything wrong.

352
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:27,362
I'm fine, really,
I told you.

353
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,781
- Please leave.
- Well, are you sure that's a good idea?

354
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,908
Go, please.

355
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,326
- Okay.
- Shoo!

356
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:36,162
Uh, she can stay...

357
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:39,582
- ...if she wants to.
- Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,793
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

359
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,589
There's nothing wrong
with you, is there?

360
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:49,259
Do you know what a fright
you gave everyone?

361
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:51,803
Don't you start complaining,
young lady.

362
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:54,264
I saved you from a doozy.

363
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:59,394
Do you realize what was
about to happen out there?

364
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:02,605
Both your men
in the same restaurant?

365
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:11,781
- And they say women are the smart ones.
- You're a real piece of work.

366
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:14,826
So Fernando told me. Many times.

367
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,494
Actually, I'm afraid
you can't smoke in here.

368
00:58:16,578 --> 00:58:18,538
Actually, I'm afraid I can.

369
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:25,712
I, uh...

370
00:58:27,297 --> 00:58:29,841
- I have something of yours.
- Mine?

371
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:35,054
One of your men is expecting
a little something extra tonight.

372
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:44,731
Who... Who gave you this?

373
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:01,706
I don't know.

374
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:18,491
- What did she say?
- I'm not sure.

375
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,037
Um...

376
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,331
The thing is the musicians
that came to play for you tonight

377
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:28,209
and the captain of the ship are--

378
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:30,169
Well, they're in a life raft
somewhere out there

379
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:31,713
and they haven't been found yet.

380
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,381
But we're sure that they're close by.

381
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,799
Um...

382
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:39,804
Look, why don't you just...

383
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:42,890
...take your drinks and
enjoy the beach?

384
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,980
Max. Max!

385
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:56,154
Hey! Hey. Who are you?

386
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:58,406
Because a food critic you are not.

387
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,950
- What are you talking about?

388
01:01:01,034 --> 01:01:02,410
Show me your passport.

389
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:03,870
- Excuse me?
- Ramon: Max.

390
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,122
No, no, no. I would like you
very much to show me your passport.

391
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:08,416
- Is there some kind of problem?
- Just show it to me.

392
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,175
All right, fine. Walter Reilly,
who were you talking to?

393
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:28,770
Max. Hey.

394
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,690
All right. Do not let him leave.

395
01:01:35,777 --> 01:01:37,820
I swear, I don't know
what the problem is.

396
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:39,280
I'm so sorry, sir.

397
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:15,900
Actually, it's a wonderful plan.

398
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:18,236
I think the beauty of it
is it's really simple.

399
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,946
- Folks, please.
- Matilda: Why not?

400
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:21,739
- You know, and I--
- Hey!

401
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:24,450
Perhaps one person
at a time please.

402
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:28,121
Okay, look, all we're saying, right?
We wanna help, okay?

403
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:30,373
We don't think it's right
to be here sitting on our asses,

404
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,084
drinking cocktails,
while there are people lost at sea.

405
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,253
The coast guard is doing
what the coast guard does, okay?

406
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:37,463
It might take them a while,
but they're gonna find them.

407
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,507
Now look, you've all paid to be here.

408
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,717
You have the right to enjoy
the evening.

409
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:45,847
Don't you tell me how
to enjoy my evening, Max Barney.

410
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,223
Look, here's the situation.

411
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:50,852
There are five people
out there who need help.

412
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:53,271
There are 30 people here
who want to help.

413
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:56,315
- Exactly.
- Um...

414
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:59,485
All right, what would the plan be?

415
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:03,156
Okay, the plan is
we form two groups.

416
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:05,241
Okay? So the first group...

417
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,160
- is gonna go up the cliff...
- Mm.

418
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:09,704
...and build a fire
so they can see us, right?

419
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,914
And then the second group
takes that boat

420
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:13,916
- and go look for them.
- That boat?

421
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,210
- Yeah, that boat.
- That boat hasn't been used in years

422
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:18,379
and the engine isn't gonna start.
And even if it does,

423
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:20,923
the last thing we need is another
boatload of people lost at sea.

424
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:23,843
And you can't build a fire
on the cliff, because, well,

425
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:25,178
if the police catch you,
they'll shut us down.

426
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,929
I thought you were
shutting down anyway.

427
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:35,897
What the hell. All right, fine.

428
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,567
- Okay. Okay, everyone.
- Okay.

429
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,738
So... So let's go.
Follow me and bring flashlights.

430
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,781
- And what else do you think we need?
- And firewood.

431
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,618
- Firewood, firewood.
- Come on, people. Come along.

432
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:27,365
Emergency communication are
always on the same frequency.

433
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:29,867
So we should get something
if there's a patrol

434
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,995
using the radio within
a seven-kilometers radius.

435
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,289
Okay.

436
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:48,427
No, no, no, please,
do not... do not put...

437
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:50,137
- Max.
- Yeah?

438
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,022
That's good news?

439
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,461
An hour ago you were
in a wheelchair,

440
01:05:22,545 --> 01:05:24,088
and now you're climbing a mountain.

441
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,009
I know!

442
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:30,928
- But whatever.

443
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:34,890
I haven't felt so alive in...
for years.

444
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:36,684
If you're sitting down, so am I.

445
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,896
No, put the light right over here.

446
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,524
No, it's not the battery.
I don't know what to tell you.

447
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:45,693
The motor looks fine. It's got gas.

448
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:48,029
- It just doesn't wanna start.
- Mind if I take a look?

449
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:07,131
The oil looks fine.

450
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:12,470
Ah.

451
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:16,891
This is not gas. This is rainwater.

452
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,269
Stagnant rainwater.

453
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:22,313
- So you're a mechanic?
- No, I'm a watchmaker.

454
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:23,814
A watchmaker?

455
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:27,151
What's the matter? You've never
seen a watchmaker before?

456
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:28,402
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't.

457
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:30,529
Not that you knew of at the time.

458
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:33,866
- Can you fix this?
- Yes, if you get me some gas.

459
01:06:35,493 --> 01:06:36,702
Gas?

460
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:43,167
One of you must know how
to siphon gas from the tank of a car.

461
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:48,005
- I'll do it myself.
- I'll come with you.

462
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,258
You are in a pickle, aren't you?

463
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:56,847
You wanna hear something funny?

464
01:06:57,765 --> 01:06:59,058
Mm-hm.

465
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:02,687
When I was doing research
for my book...

466
01:07:04,397 --> 01:07:07,024
...I lived with the Lakota Sioux
for a long time.

467
01:07:07,483 --> 01:07:09,777
You know, I practically
became one of them.

468
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,570
They taught me...

469
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:14,240
They taught me
about their cooking and their...

470
01:07:14,782 --> 01:07:16,742
...rituals and ceremonies.

471
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:18,577
It was incredible.

472
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,207
I have never felt so connected
in my life.

473
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:28,379
It's... It's like
I learned nothing from it.

474
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:31,841
- Hmm.
- I mean...

475
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,678
...I'm alone now.

476
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,264
I'm alone and I still...

477
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:40,725
I still don't feel in control
of my life.

478
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:48,607
Well, you could always go back
and settle on the reservation.

479
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:52,820
Yeah, that's actually not a bad idea,

480
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:55,781
because, you know,
right now I'd love to be

481
01:07:55,865 --> 01:07:59,118
a million miles away
from Dan and Marc.

482
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:04,248
Although it's not like
I do so good on my own.

483
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:05,750
I'm a disaster.

484
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,211
How did you do it?

485
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,175
- Oh, well...
- I mean really.

486
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,595
Welcome to the human race.

487
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:20,639
We're all contradictory.

488
01:08:20,723 --> 01:08:22,558
There's no way around it.

489
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:28,814
You know, there's nothing
more precious than freedom.

490
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:30,232
Mmm.

491
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:34,695
But you can be free
with somebody by your side.

492
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,159
I learned that from Fernando.

493
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:43,704
You're just fearful.

494
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:45,831
That's normal.

495
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:48,292
Just follow your heart.

496
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:02,681
- It's okay?
- Not yet.

497
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:06,435
Okay, this is great. Let's go!

498
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:08,395
Arriba! Cut us loose!

499
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,064
Wait, wait, wait, um...

500
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:13,234
- We can't all fit.
- You need me out there.

501
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:14,527
Maximum of four.

502
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,695
We gotta leave room for the others
when we come back.

503
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:18,697
- I'm going too.
- Yeah, big surprise.

504
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:21,242
- Is that because I'm going?
- I'm a doctor, you moron.

505
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,244
All right, look, I'll go.

506
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,287
You know how
to steer this thing, right?

507
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:27,706
Yes, of course.
We'll use the flame as a beacon.

508
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,416
- You should go.
- All right.

509
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:32,127
Here we go.

510
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:34,922
- All right. Here we go, push!
- Let's go.

511
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:41,303
Good luck.

512
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,060
At least you got the fire going.

513
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,145
- We could have toast.
- Yes!

514
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,772
Ooh, yes.

515
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:56,610
- Mina: Is... Is that a...
- What? What do you see?

516
01:09:56,694 --> 01:10:00,155
- What is that?
- Matilda: It's a flare.

517
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,575
They must've lit it
when they saw our bonfire.

518
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:05,578
It's them! It's the lifeboat!

519
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,247
- Hello!
- Yoo-hoo!

520
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,999
- Yoo-hoo! Over here!
- Over here!

521
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:11,542
- Over here!
- Over here!

522
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:20,134
Is that the coast guard?

523
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,052
No, it's a friend who's got
a friend at the coast guard.

524
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:24,638
Max. Max, Max!

525
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:26,181
- Yeah?
- We saw a flare.

526
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,350
- Where?
- Yes, quite distinctly. Out there.

527
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:31,228
Okay. Please,
just one second. Look, Gerard...

528
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,553
- Great.
- Okay. Excuse me.

529
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,821
Look what the sand has
done to my stocking.

530
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:33,123
- It's them. Look!

531
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:36,710
- It's the boat!
- Yoo-hoo!

532
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,834
Sorry, sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

533
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:01,420
- Are you recording?
- Man: Yeah.

534
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,505
You are the man
who saved these people?

535
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:04,673
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Right? Yeah.

536
01:13:04,757 --> 01:13:06,091
And what's your name?

537
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:07,843
- My name's Daniel.
- Daniel.

538
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:28,363
You know,
it was a decision point.

539
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:31,075
It was, "I'm gonna risk
my life and save others."

540
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:32,493
- Yeah. Okay.
- And that's what I did.

541
01:13:34,078 --> 01:13:35,496

Thank you.

I owe you an apology.

556
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:52,364
Really, there's no need.

557
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:55,242
No, no,no, I mean it. I'm sorry.

558
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:56,952
I just wanna thank you
for all your help.

559
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:58,537
You're welcome.

560
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,873
It was a cinch fixing it.
The motor, I mean.

561
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,210
Can I ask you a question?

562
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:06,545
Why'd you come here tonight?

563
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:11,216
I'm an admirer of your restaurant.

564
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,802
I've visited restaurants
all over the world,

565
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:17,222
and I've never experienced
anything like this.

566
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:20,100
It's unbearable to think
that you're closing.

567
01:15:24,313 --> 01:15:26,148
So who were you talking to all night?

568
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,318
My mother.

569
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,320
She thinks I'm in the shop.

570
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:36,825
She's a dreadful cook.

571
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,861
Okay.

572
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:26,291
Whatever he's offered,
our offer will be better.

573
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:30,379
Shall we go to my office
and discuss details?

574
01:16:32,547 --> 01:16:35,550
No. After the party.

575
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:40,889
Enjoy.

576
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:11,813
"Thank you very much for everything.
It was a night I will never forget.

577
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:14,149
I'm sorry to leave you this way,

578
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:16,568
but I feel it's the most
honest thing to do.

579
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:18,737
Money corrupts art."

580
01:18:20,614 --> 01:18:22,491
Son of a bitch.

581
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:31,875
- Max.
- Matilda.

582
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,919
Do you mind if
I borrow her for a minute?

583
01:18:41,468 --> 01:18:43,136
We did it.

584
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:20,632
- Thank you.
