1
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,442
- Yeah?
- Mr. Escobar?

2
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:29,603
Hi, it's me, Nadine Hightower.

3
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,819
I really hate to bother you.
I just want to ask a favour of you.

4
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:36,114
- Listen, if it's money, I can't help you.
- No, sir. No, sir.

5
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,658
It's not. Could I come in
and talk to you for just a minute?

6
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,747
I'd love to, but I got an important client
on his way over.

7
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,243
This'll only take a minute.

8
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:48,290
- It's about the photos you took of me.
- Art studies. Those were art studies.

9
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,715
Yes, sir. But to tell you the truth...

10
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,140
they were lots more artistic
than I bargained for.

11
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,429
And the thing is, I'd like to have
those photos back.

12
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:02,391
- Did you get paid?
- Yes, sir, $22.

13
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,650
- Did I touch you? Lay a hand on you?
- Well, no, sir.

14
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:09,194
Then you got no gripe with me.
Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go.

15
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:10,942
Mr. Escobar!

16
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,571
That day at the five-and-dime,
when you come up...

17
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:16,495
and told me you was
a personal friend of Hugh Hefner...

18
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,656
and you asked me
to take those photos...

19
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,160
I mean, art studies...

20
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,170
the only reason I said yes
was because you told me...

21
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,163
that <i>Playboy</i> was bound to pay me.

22
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,373
I'll pay you back
however much you're out.

23
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,376
I'll give your wife free manicures.

24
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,303
How about that? I'll do anything.
I mean, almost anything.

25
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,219
- Will you quit that...?
- I'm not leaving till I get those photos!

26
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,840
Okay, come on in, then!
Come on, damn it!

27
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,267
Lucky for you,
I'm about to become a rich man.

28
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,474
Damn. You wait in the back.
Don't come out till I holler.

29
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:46,060
- Okay?
- In the back?

30
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:49,319
All right, I'm coming! I'm coming.

31
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,508
Lady, I got...

32
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,180
Oh, my God.

33
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,264
Mr. Escobar.

34
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,898
Oh, my God.

35
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,936
Oh, my God.

36
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,439
Mr. Escobar?

37
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:35,689
It's Charley Draper,
photo supply house.

38
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:39,986
I got that carton of developer
you asked for.

39
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,655
I'm real sorry about this.

40
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,127
Mr. Escobar?

41
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,454
- You the janitor?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

42
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,463
I got this package for Mr. Escobar,
and I can't get nobody to answer.

43
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:56,387
Hang on. I got the key.
You can leave it inside.

44
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,067
Hey, hey! Call the police!
There's been a murder up here!

45
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,734
- What's going on?
- Hey! Somebody call the police!

46
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,949
- There's been a murder up here!
- Right up there?

47
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:45,139
Hey! He's upstairs!

48
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:07,782
<i>And now,</i> Search for Tomorrow.

49
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,960
I think Roger's gonna have
an affair with Vanessa.

50
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,249
Are you crazy?
Vanessa's got the hots for Brett.

51
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:16,464
You're late, Nadine.

52
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:20,552
You got about umpteen calls
from Vernon.

53
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:36,643
- Well?
- Well what?

54
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,070
Are you gonna tell Vernon
you're pregnant?

55
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:46,361
Vera, I don't want
to talk about this right now.

56
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,246
He is the daddy.

57
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,460
That just happens to be
a biological accident, that's all.

58
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,714
- Hon, that man is your husband.
- Ex-husband.

59
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:59,498
That's just as much your fault
as it is his.

60
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:01,006
Vernon loves you.

61
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:05,640
Vernon don't love nothing but himself
and that damn Blue Bonnet Bar of his.

62
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,344
That man is irresponsible, and I do not
intend on letting Doris Isabelle...

63
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,644
Doris Isabelle?

64
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:15,231
I'm naming her after Mama's
favourite sisters. What do you think?

65
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:19,564
Nadine, I love you like you was
my own flesh and blood.

66
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,689
But I do not intend to stand around and
see that baby get born without a daddy.

67
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:25,908
You better rustle up somebody
real fast...

68
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,495
on account it ain't gonna be
Vernon Hightower.

69
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,245
- You won't forget about the garbage?
- Of course not.

70
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,341
- You sure you don't mind closing?
- Get out. Have a good time.

71
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,254
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

72

I knew sooner or later
you'd have to come out of there.

84
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,306
- What do you want?
- Did you or did you not...

85
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,811
sign them divorce papers?

86
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:41,644
- You gotta be kidding.
- If not, I'll strangle you on the spot.

87
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,197
Don't provoke me, Vernon.

88
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:46,360
Damn it, woman, I'm trying to get
the Blue Bonnet refinanced.

89
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:49,654
- If you ask me, the Blue Bonnet's...
- I didn't ask.

90
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,451
There is no way they're gonna
let me have that money...

91
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,830
unless you agree to the divorce...

92
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,160
and promise to make no claim
on the Bonnet.

93
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:01,420
Do you see the keys to a new Buick
convertible with white sidewall tires...

94
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,133
a radio and air conditioner?

95
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,259
When you see the keys in my hand...

96
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,421
you'll see my name on those papers.

97
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,091
Now you got that, slick?

98
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:10,802
- Come here.
- Don't mess with me.

99
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:13,052
- Come here for a minute.
- I'm warning you!

100
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:16,846
- I'm much stronger than you are!
- You see that Chevy?

101
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,143
You see that busted headlight?
You see that baling wire?

102
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:23,485
You think I'd be driving in that
if I could afford a new Buick?

103
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,111
And who might that be?

104
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,782
That happens to be Renee Lomax.

105
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:35,699
She's the Uvalde High School
Pecan Queen of 1947.

106
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,457
Vernon, darling?

107
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,912
I'm not in the "Vernon, darling"
business anymore.

108
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,291
- Remember?
- Vernon, darling...

109
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,377
what if I was to sign those papers?

110
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:50,131
I told you before, I'm not paying
for any brand-new Buick.

111
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:53,054
What if I was to forget
about the Buick altogether?

112
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,639
All right, what's the deal?

113
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:01,017
I'd just like you to run
a little errand with me, that's all.

114
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:02,984
What kind of little errand?

115
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,438
Well, a couple of weeks ago,
Vera asked me to pick up this stuff...

116
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,940
that she keeps in a storeroom
on 6th Street...

117
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:10,576
and I keep forgetting...

118
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:14,444
and if it ain't there by morning,
she's gonna have a real shit fit.

119
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:19,083
And, well, you know what
a fraidy-cat I am of the dark.

120
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,536
Nadine, it's me, Vernon. Remember?

121
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,374
Your almost ex-husband?

122
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,040
I know how you are
when you get set on something.

123
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:30,801
You're not gonna give up on that Buick
out of the goodness of your heart.

124
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:32,348
Vernon, be honest with me.

125
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,592
Are you ever truly
gonna give me that Buick?

126
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,346
Hell, no!

127
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,769
Then what am I losing?

128
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:54,618
Sug, I'm pretty sure that I got her
convinced to sign that paper.

129
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,827
The thing is, though...

130
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,872
Sug, the problem is...

131
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:03,879
that she's got some kind of deal
going here.

132
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,422
I'm gonna have to help her.

133
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,383
So I want you to take the pickup,
go to your place, and I'll call you later.

134
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,214
Vernon, just think.

135
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,339
As soon as she signs those papers,
we can get married.

136
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,560
Yeah.

137
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,558
Honey, go on now.

138
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,975
Vernon's gotta go.

139
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,074
Nighty-night.

140
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,165
Goddamn it, woman.

141
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,828
What, are you trying to get me killed?

142
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,805
When was the last time you cleaned
the sparks in this thing?

143
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,552
You know me, Vernon.
Live and let live.

144
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:03,979
They don't bother me,
I don't bother them.

145
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,934
Hey, slow down.

146
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,854
Slow down.

147
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,738
- What?
- Look at that.

148
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:16,072
What's that son of a bitch doing
in there? Giving away free beer?

149
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,077
How's the old Blue Bonnet
getting along anyway?

150
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:22,324
Fine. It's doing just fine.

151
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,789
- I heard you was about to go bust.
- Heard wrong.

152
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,788
Blue Bonnet's about
to turn the corner.

153
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:30,498
It's just gonna take a little longer
than I expected, that's all.

154
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:32,585
That jukebox you bought
with my money...

155
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:35,596
just ain't doing the trick for you,
is it?

156
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:42,180
I told you before, that was a loan.
I'll pay you back.

157
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,190
I've got big plans for the Blue Bonnet.
It's gonna be the showplace of Austin.

158
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,066
The first thing I'm gonna do
is get me a new sign.

159
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,523
I'm gonna get the dance floor fixed up,
get me a name band.

160
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,155
Not those low-rent bands.
I'm talking bigtime.

161
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,818
The Blue Bonnet Lounge
ain't ever gonna be anything.

162
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,487
First, it's in the worst location
in all of Austin.

163
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,331
- I told you many times...
- I know. You was wrong.

164
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:09,255
- I told you...
- Wrong. I don't want to talk about it.

165
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,047
- But I...
- Period!

166
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:15,044
Fine.

167
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,011
- We'll talk about something else.
- Fine.

168
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:19,841
Okay.

169
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:22,510
Ain't she a little on the cheap side?

170
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,974
- Who?
- Miss Low-Rent Lust back there.

171
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,682
Renee? Are you kidding?

172
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,478
She's got a good job
with the Lone Star Beer Company.

173
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,068
She don't look that smart to me.

174
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,281
Well, she's smart enough to work
in Accounts Receivable.

175
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,946
I don't know, Vernon.

176
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,157
She looks a little on the chubby side
to be a pecan queen.

177
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
Well, at least she doesn't spend
all her time finding fault with me.

178
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,333
Here we are.

179
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,083
- Why are we going in the back door?
- It's lots quicker this way.

180
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,477
I can't believe this.

181
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,781
I left the keys at the shop.

182
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:03,151
We're gonna have to go back
and get them.

183
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:06,993
We came all the way out here, and you
don't even have the keys with you?

184
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,083
If you hadn't been so obnoxious,
I might've remembered.

185
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:13,585
Hold on, hold on. I'm not ruining
mine and Renee's evening...

186
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:16,875
because you ain't
completely put together.

187
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,719
Now, did you bring a nail file?

188
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:25,302
I don't have the time to play games
with you.

189
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:27,966
It's gonna take half the night as it is.
Let's go.

190
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,310
You forgot the night we was in Tulsa...

191
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
we locked ourselves
out of the motel room.

192
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:35,105
Remember, I did that little trick
with the lock?

193
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:39,697
Vernon, aren't you the smart one?

194
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,383
There's no need to do that.

195
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:07,506
You know, Nadine,
I'm way ahead of you on this deal.

196
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,309
You always have been, Vernon.

197
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:14,230
There ain't no beauty supplies
in here, is there?

198
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,641
Not exactly.

199
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:21,442
And this place don't belong
to Vera, does it?

200
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,108
You know what kind of trouble
that we can get in...?

201
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,038
You wanna wake up everybody
between here and El Paso?

202
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:32,166
Do you have the least idea
what could happen to us...

203
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,789
if the owner walked in
and found us like this?

204
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,626
I'm talking breaking and entering.
I'm talking three to seven in Huntsville.

205
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,672
Not to mention losing
my liquor license.

206
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:42,751
That ain't gonna happen. I swear.

207
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,217
You want to explain
why you're so sure?

208
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:50,801
Well, if you have to know, he's dead.

209
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,518
Dead?

210
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:55,432
You mean, "dead" dead?

211
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,688
Hey, hold on.

212
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:02,652
I... I don't know what's going on here,
but I'm not getting mixed up.

213
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,695
Nadine, we're getting out of here right
now, and that's an order. You coming?

214
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,205
Okay.

215
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,421
Well, I'll visit you in the jailhouse.

216
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,553
You know what'd go down
real good right now?

217
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,894
A nice cold bottle of beer.

218
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:39,314
You planning on us driving up
to a 7-Eleven in a police car...

219
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,687
and asking the cashier
for a six-pack?

220
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:48,616
It so happens I hid a couple of Lone
Stars up there in that stiff's icebox.

221
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,117
You hold down the fort.
I'll be right back.

222
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:55,992
Hell, Cecil, you're not as dumb
as the captain said.

223
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:11,884
Nadine? I mean it now.
This is your last chance.

224
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,061
Forgive me.

225
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,153
That woman is dumb as a post.

226
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:27,445
I swear, if she thinks
I'm going to prison...

227
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:31,613
on account of some dimwit idea of
hers, she's got another thing coming.

228
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,103
Being around, get her out of trouble,
there's no telling.

229
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,776
Of course.

230
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,605
Nadine?

231
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,068
Damn it all, will you let me in?

232
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,203
Nadine?

233
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:16,830
Nadine, I mean it now.

234
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,489
I know you're in there.
I can hear you moving around.

235
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:23,454
She don't have the sense
that God gave a goose.

236
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,461
Wait a minute.

237
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,421
We break into the place
in the middle of the night...

238
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:34,466
the poor son of a bitch who owns it
turns out to be dead.

239
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:38,807
For all I know,
she probably killed him herself.

240
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,224
Lord knows, she's mean enough.

241
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,724
Officer, am I glad to see you.

242
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:47,564
There's a suspicious-looking character
running around.

243
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:50,270
I was on my way to tell my wife
to call the police.

244
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:52,441
I must have gone
into the wrong place.

245
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,533
Honey, don't do that.

246
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:58,281
- Run for it.
- Now why did you have to do that?

247
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,622
I was doing just...

248
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:06,705
Give me the keys!

249
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,199
- Step on it, Vernon. Step on it!
- Watch out.

250
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,583
You picked a hell of a time to stop!

251
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,260
Hang on, darling.

252
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:28,013
You mind telling me what the hell
was going on back there?

253
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:31,566
Well, it's sort of like this.

254
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:34,350
One of the girls down at the shop...

255
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,364
And don't ask who it is,
because I ain't gonna tell you.

256
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:41,744
Anyway, this guy Escobar
took some pic...

257
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:45,197
I mean, some art studies of her.

258
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:48,451
What you mean is this old boy
talked her into posing bare-ass...

259
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:51,960
for a bunch of pictures.
And I'll bet you that's not all he done.

260
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,289
Vernon Hightower,
you got a dirty mind.

261
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:57,171
Mr. Escobar was in the Army
with Hugh Hefner...

262
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:59,004
of <i>Playboy</i> fame. How about that?

263
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:01,385
- He pulled that one?
- He didn't pull nothing.

264
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,632
I knew those gals
wasn't the smartest...

265
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,845
but I did give them
more credit than that.

266
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:12,525
I'll bet you that she's got a husband
that's even dumber than she is.

267
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,150
You're telling me we nearly
got ourselves killed...

268
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:21,534
I swear, I never saw anything like the
way you drove that car tonight. Never.

269
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,030
Mostly luck.

270
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:26,370
You went 90 miles an hour backwards
without getting us killed.

271
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,031
Then you stopped the damn car.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,202
"Goddamn, what a hell
of a time to stop!"

273
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:34,165
- I didn't say it like that.
- Yeah, you did.

274
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:36,213
I did not.

275
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:48,804
Here I am, sitting around
like we was still...

276
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:53,513
Listen, you can't drive a Ford
on account of...

277
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,768
the police will be looking for it.

278
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,447
Oh, no, okay, I won't.

279
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:05,443
I know this old boy
who owes me a favour.

280
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,290
I'll take it over and have him paint it.

281
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,415
That'd be real nice.

282
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:17,038
I guess I'd better go on.

283
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,002
You're looking real good.

284
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:27,849
No, I mean, you know,
it looks like you're eating real good.

285
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:32,348
- Not too much or anything.
- No, I know...

286
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:36,935
What I mean is that...
That you look real good.

287
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:41,357
You look... You look real good too.

288
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:44,363
Real good.

289
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:50,570
Well, I better get on my horse.
Renee's gonna be starting to worry.

290
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,997
Well, here.
Let me get you some ice, okay?

291
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:56,458
I'll be right back.

292
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,246
Oh, boy.

293
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:59,306
It don't do no good to cry whatsoever,
so you might as well quit.

294
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,220
Don't do no good
to talk to yourself either.

295
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:37,678
Reverend, I told you the last time you
were in this place that I would not...

296
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:42,429
I repeat, not tolerate any handling
of snakes on this premises.

297
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,014
What the holy hell is this?

298
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:50,064
Sir, we'd surely be grateful
if you wasn't to make them mad.

299
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:53,405
What I mean is, that way they ain't
gonna be no use to anybody.

300
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:55,069
Listen to me, you pinhead.

301
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,162
I'm gonna keep this box right here
under lock and key...

302
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,458
until you pissants are out of town.
Now get outta here!

303
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:14,084
Mrs. Hightower, I'm Buford Pope.

304
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:15,591
Won't you please come in?

305
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:26,477
I want to apologise for bringing you
here in this crude and vulgar way.

306
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:30,353
How come a girl like you would let
a lowlife like Ray Escobar...

307
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:32,355
take some indecent pictures of her?

308
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,404
Believe me, I'm starting to regret it.

309
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,570
Nadine...

310
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:40,449
You don't mind if I call you Nadine,
do you?

311
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:44,287
Nadine, I've got reason to believe
that you were at Ray Escobar's today...

312
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,831
looking for these photographs.

313
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:48,747
I've also got reason to believe...

314
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:52,089
that you've come across
something else while you were there.

315
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,836
And I'm just about positive...

316
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,090
that whatever it was that you found,
it belongs to me.

317
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:00,885
Now, is it possible...

318
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,353
that you have that something else
we're talking about on you?

319
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:08,976
Well, I might.

320
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:11,060
Floyd?

321
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,286
Nadine, we've got ourselves
a little problem.

322
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:03,904
Why, you miserable
son of a bitch.

323
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,954
You got some nerve
showing up here.

324
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:07,784
If I wasn't otherwise occupied...

325
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,118
I'd come out there
and I'd whip your butt.

326
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:12,207
I swear, Dwight...

327
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,168
I don't see why you're so hot
under the collar there.

328
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:19,589
You owe me $450, not counting
legal fees of $370 and change.

329
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:22,005
You're lucky I don't
get the sheriff on you.

330
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:24,135
Yeah, Dwight?

331
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:27,096
I'm your own family.
Don't that count for something?

332
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,726
We are third cousins
once removed, period.

333
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:33,101
My mother does not remember
ever laying eyes on your daddy.

334
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:37,021
I just thought I'd come by
to tell you...

335
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,818
that your third cousin
is gonna be a "jillionaire."

336
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,901
I thought you might want to know that.

337
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:44,698
Vernon, you don't have diddlysquat.

338
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,658
You owe me $820 plus interest...

339
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,537
the bank is about to foreclose
on that bar of yours...

340
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,201
and now you're talking about
being a jillionaire.

341
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:11,725
- Where'd you get this thing?
- You have a cold beer in the icebox?

342
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:19,484
You didn't get ahold of this by
legal means. I ought to call the police.

343
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,576
- You do that, pard.
- Sweetheart?

344
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,493
Hey. Good for you, cousin.

345
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:39,584
How much you figure land
along that highway's gonna be worth?

346
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:43,795
- A lot.
- That sounds reasonable.

347
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:50,768
I figure, right now it can't be worth
more than $600 an acre.

348
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:54,812
A few thousand dollars in the right
place, I might have enough money...

349
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:58,269
to get the Blue Bonnet on her feet.
Then watch my dust.

350
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:01,313
Can I have my picture back, please?

351
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:08,159
That isn't gonna do you good
unless you can afford to buy the land.

352
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,114
- You don't have a pot to piss in.
- Well, that's why I've come to see you.

353
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,581
I figured with you being
a fancy lawyer...

354
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:17,588
you might have some designs
in that direction.

355
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:20,877
Tell you what. You let me
have the rest of those maps...

356
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,711
I'll see how much I can raise...

357
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:26,670
and whatever profit I make,
I'll cut you in for sure. How about that?

358
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:35,266
No.

359
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:39,272
No, I don't think so.

360
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,730
Let's try this on for size.

361
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:44,530
You're a lawyer.

362
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:50,951
You call up some of your rich friends
and raise, let's say, $50,000.

363
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:53,199
Then I'll let you have these photos.

364
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:57,000
- Dwight, hon.
- I'll be right in, darling.

365
00:33:57,254 --> 00:33:59,293
This better not be one
of your swindles.

366
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:04,959
Dwight, I swear, this time
everything's strictly on the up and up.

367
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:15,430
No, sir. I ain't telling you
where Vernon is.

368
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:19,983
You can break my arms, my legs.
Won't do a bit of good.

369
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,021
The only Hightower I know...

370
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:25,362
runs a dump out on South Lamar
called the Blue Bonnet Lounge.

371
00:34:25,574 --> 00:34:27,068
- He ain't the one.
- You boys...

372
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:29,400
go out there and pick him up.

373
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:39,165
Don't shoot him...
unless you have to.

375
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:16,456
Good evening there, Boyd.
Sorry I'm late. How's business?

376
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,167
Not so hot, Mr. Hightower.

377
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:22,379
We only took in $6 and change
so far tonight.

378
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:25,217
Well, that's all right.

379
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:29,254
Got a feeling we're about to turn
a financial corner any minute.

380
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:31,089
You want a beer?

381
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:33,091
Sure.

382
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,180
I've been thinking.

383
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:38,429
You know what we need
around this place?

384
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,930
A new sign.

385
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,724
Something in neon:

386
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:53,442
"Vernon Hightower's
Famous Blue Bonnet Bar and Lounge."

387
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,494
- Then...
- Mr. High... Mr. Hightower, sir?

388
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:58,534
I ought to tell you,
the Lone Star people called.

389
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,199
They said if you don't pay them
what you owe them...

390
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:03,951
they're gonna stop
any more deliveries.

391
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:11,293
Why is nothing ever easy?

392
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,388
Give me a nickel.

393
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,742
Renee? It's me, Vernon.

394
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:40,619
Way it works out, I'm not
able to see you tonight, hon.

395
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:44,493
No, nothing's the matter.
It's... It's just that...

396
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:47,209
I'm in the middle
of a big financial transaction...

397
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:50,881
and I got these details
I gotta take care of.

398
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:54,759
You know how it is. Listen, I'll tell you,
you could do me a little favour.

399
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:56,800
Remember how you said that...

400
00:36:56,975 --> 00:37:00,142
you could get your boss
to do just about anything you wanted?

401
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:01,972
If you could get him to fix it...

402
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:06,192
so the Lone Star people don't pester
me for a few weeks, I'd appreciate it.

403
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,396
I mean, I'm good for it
and everything.

404
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:12,691
It's just that
all my money's tied up in...

405
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,905
you know, assets, that kind of stuff.

406
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:19,490
Yeah?

407
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:23,165
Sug, I knew I could count on you.

408
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:28,333
Yeah. Sug? Sug, I gotta go now.

409
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,666
I miss you too.

410
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:34,920
Me too.

411
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:37,511
Toodle-oo now.

412
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:44,102
Tell me something, Boyd. When
was the last time you had a raise?

413
00:37:45,023 --> 00:37:46,932
A raise?

414
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,685
Mr. Hightower, I ain't even been paid
in the last two months.

415
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:54,319
Oh, hell, boy.

416
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:57,024
I'm sorry about that.

417
00:37:57,828 --> 00:38:01,197
Hey, I'll tell you what,
starting next week...

418
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:03,116
I'm gonna double your salary.

419
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,744
Evening, friends.
Came to the right place.

420
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,630
First drink's on Vernon Hightower...

421
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:13,800
soon to be one of the richest
sons of bitches you ever saw.

422
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:16,673
Vernon!

423
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:18,886
What did you do to him?

424
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:21,299
Don't worry, hon.
I fought like a tiger.

425
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:23,261
Mr. Hightower...

426
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:25,062
my name is Pope.

427
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,638
I've good reason to believe
you possess...

428
00:38:27,816 --> 00:38:29,773
something I want a whole lot.

429
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:33,061
I might have, I might not.

430
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:36,571
Do yourself a favour, son.
Don't get smart with me.

431
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:39,618
Listen to the man.
He's real serious about this.

432
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:42,486
I paid a bunch of money
for some information...

433
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:46,614
and the son of a bitch I was dealing
with tried to double-cross me.

434
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:50,786
And the short of it is that you've
got something belongs to me.

435
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,588
Now then...

436
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:58,303
I'm asking you nicely...
hand it over.

438
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:01,342
I can't do that.
I'll tell you what I will do...

439
00:39:01,558 --> 00:39:05,686
Mr. Hightower, if you think
you can deal yourself into this...

440
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:07,977
forget it.
You're a two-bit loser, son...

441
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,817
and you haven't got the brains
or balls for this.

442
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:13,896
First, I won't have you
talk like that in front of my wife.

443
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,565
Stop. Stop it!

444
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,945
Look, can I talk
to my husband in private?

445
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:21,699
Floyd, the woman wants to talk
to her husband.

446
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:30,450
Now, hon, this is not the time
to start one of your stubborn streaks.

447
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:34,211
Don't worry, darling.
I'm on a roll.

448
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,293
Now then...

449
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:40,138
whenever you're ready
to get serious...

450
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:42,630
I'm ready to do business.
You want serious?

451
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,515
All right, I'll get serious.

452
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:48,729
Unless you hand over the goddamn
map, I'll kill the both of you.

453
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:54,855
Well, if you was to kill us...

454
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:57,566
I expect you'd never get your hands
on that map.

455
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,864
That's a fact.

456
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:04,201
But I think I can fix it
so you'll be real anxious to talk...

457
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:07,407
unless, of course, you've got
a fondness for rattlesnakes.

458
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,199
Hon, he's not kidding around.

459
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:12,501
Where do you get
a bunch of rattlesnakes?

460
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,914
Well, by a strange coincidence...

461
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,497
I happen to have
about five or six rattlers...

462
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:19,170
right inside this box here.

463
00:40:19,386 --> 00:40:21,425
He's telling the truth. I swear.

464
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:26,388
You gonna hand over that map?

465
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,809
No. No, sir, I'm afraid not.

466
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:34,978
Well, you sure you're not
gonna change your mind?

467
00:40:39,614 --> 00:40:41,488
Mountain?

468
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,825
- Oh, God! I'm snake bit!
- All right, let me see.

469
00:40:47,038 --> 00:40:49,280
All right! Let's see.

470
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:50,993
- Let me see.
- It's right there.

471
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:54,003
Oh, hell, you ain't snake bit.
That's a splinter.

472
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:56,412
Hold that box right there. Floyd?

473
00:40:56,965 --> 00:41:00,049
Put something over these
sons of bitches so they don't get out.

474
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:03,424
First one comes close gets
a face full of rattlesnake.

475
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:06,260
Oh, goddamn it, man.
You lost your mind?

476
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:10,383
You let them snakes out of there,
they'll go after you as well as us.

477
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:13,974
All right, you. Get your car keys out,
put them on the desk.

478
00:41:14,149 --> 00:41:15,691
Get against the wall.

479
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:20,397
You do that, boy, you'll be wrestling
duck shit come Thursday night.

480
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:22,820
Floyd, you don't
get those car keys out here...

481
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:27,155
you're gonna be wrestling
a diamondback in about one minute.

482
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:33,536
You're gonna pay for this.

483
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:38,578
Darling, find the car, start the motor
and honk the horn. I'll be right along.

484
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,584
Okay.

485
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:51,344
Well, Mr. Hightower, let's us have
a little talk here.

486
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:54,640
I know you're in what they call
financial straits.

487
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:57,981
So why don't you let my boys here
set fire to that dump of yours?

488
00:41:58,151 --> 00:42:00,821
That way, at least you'll collect
on the fire insurance.

489
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:02,980
All you have to do
is hand over the map.

490
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:05,689
I appreciate that,
but that won't do me no good now.

491
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:09,616
See, I let the insurance lapse
about a month ago.

492
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:14,747
All right, boys, if I was you,
I'd head for high ground.

493
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:19,536
Let me out of here!

494
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:22,675
- Get away!
- They're all over me!

495
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:33,769
Do you know what my problem
has been all this time?

496
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:36,808
I've been undercapitalised,
that's all.

497
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:41,062
You wait and see. We pull this deal off,
I'm home free.

498
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:43,770
Yeah, I don't know.

499
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:46,562
Buford Pope seems like
the real determined type to me.

500
00:42:46,741 --> 00:42:50,953
Don't you worry about Pope now.
I'm on top of that whole situation.

501
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:53,779
Hey, wait a minute.

502
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:56,662
You don't believe what that
son of a bitch said, do you?

503
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:00,795
You don't think I'm some sort
of two-bit loser, do you?

504
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:04,748
No, hon. I've known you
a real long time.

505
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:09,173
You can pretty much do anything
you want once you set your mind on it.

506
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:13,640
You mean that?

507
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,693
You know, it's funny
how you forget things.

508
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:27,691
Like what?

509
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:30,405
Oh, like sitting in the kitchen...

510
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:34,409
drinking beer, shooting the shit
with you. Forgot how much I loved that.

511
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:43,916
Vernon, I think there's
something you should know.

512
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,715
Sure.

513
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:48,337
- I'm...
- With your looks...

514
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:50,884
you could have married
just about anybody.

515
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:56,560
That's why I've been busting my butt
at the Blue Bonnet...

516
00:43:56,728 --> 00:44:00,975
so you wouldn't feel
you made a mistake.

517
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:07,485
You know, so you'd feel that
you had something to be proud about.

518
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:14,153
People like you and me,
we never get the breaks.

519
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:17,663
This time, it'll be different.
This is the one chance I'll ever get...

520
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,952
and I swear, I'm letting
nothing get in my way.

521
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,585
Anyway, I was running off at the mouth
again. What was it you was gonna say?

522
00:44:27,425 --> 00:44:30,592
Nothing. Wasn't important.

523
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:35,851
You fixing your hair
different these days?

524
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:41,559
Yeah, I copied it from a picture
in <i>Modern Screen.</i>

525
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,391
You like it?

526
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:46,984
Yeah, it looks real nice.

527
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:51,778
What's that perfume you're wearing?

528
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:55,492
Evening in Paris. Why?

529
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:58,490
No reason.

530
00:45:06,381 --> 00:45:09,631
I remember the first time
I set eyes on you.

531
00:45:12,637 --> 00:45:15,093
It was a Friday night...

532
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:17,554
over at the Dairy Queen.

533
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:20,639
You was wearing a pink sweater.

534
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:23,262
Vernon, don't do this to me.

535
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:25,391
I saw you standing there...

536
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:31,192
and I said to myself,
"Vernon Hightower, you are a goner."

537
00:46:26,878 --> 00:46:28,835
Vernon.

538
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:32,959
Vernon.

539
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,711
Sug, it's me, Renee Lomax.

540
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:39,011
Soon to be Mrs. Vernon Hightower.

541
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:40,807
What the hell...?

542
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:42,636
What are you doing here
this early?

543
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:46,144
- I got a surprise for you.
- All right. I'll be right there.

544
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:49,149
- I talked to my boss.
- Damn it.

545
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,230
- Is something the matter, honey?
- No, no, everything's fine.

546
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:55,737
Well, hurry up, sug.
I got to be to the office by 9:00.

547
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,491
- Vernon Hightower.
- Don't worry.

548
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:00,364
I'm on top of this whole situation.

549
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:11,460
- Morning, morning.
- Good morning.

550
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:13,375
Oh, darling, what happened?

551
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,958
Oh, it's a long story.
So, what'd your boss say?

552
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:18,923
Oh, Mr. Schmidt? He said no.

553
00:47:19,097 --> 00:47:22,347
He says, as far as he was concerned,
you were no-good white trash...

554
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:24,557
and you were getting
what you deserved.

555
00:47:24,728 --> 00:47:27,764
So this morning,
I went to his office real early...

556
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:31,189
and I snuck this bill
that shows all what you owe...

557
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,775
out of his filing cabinet.
I think I'll keep it.

558
00:47:34,946 --> 00:47:38,066
Just to be sure you behave yourself.

559
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:42,276
Unless, of course,
you want to come looking for it.

560
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:46,539
Honey, now, come on.
You got to be at work by 9:00, now.

561
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,784
I guess you're right.

562
00:47:56,259 --> 00:47:59,046
Hold on now.
I can explain everything.

563
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:02,885
It's from Scarborough's.

564
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:06,593
I swear, this has to be
the most beautiful thing...

565
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,177
I've ever set my eyes on.

566
00:48:09,356 --> 00:48:11,977
- I'm gonna try it on right now.
- No, no.

567
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,353
Honey, you don't wanna
be late for work, do you?

568
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:18,982
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we leave this here?

569
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:22,111
- Come back later and try it on.
- I wanna take this with me.

570
00:48:22,285 --> 00:48:24,990
I'm not gonna let this
out of my sight.

571
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:28,248
- Baby, wait out in the pickup...
- All right.

572
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:30,824
While I get my jacket.

573
00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:34,540
Vernon Hightower,
I'm standing back here buck-naked.

574
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:37,419
If you let that dimwit take
my favourite nightgown...

575
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:40,759
Trust me. I got a plan.

576
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:40,433
Dwight? Yeah, it's me.
You got the money?

577
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:45,354
Great. I got this little errand to run,
then I'll get the map and be right there.

578
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,445
Oh, Dwight?
I swear, you won't regret this.

579
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:56,286
For the first time in your life, Vernon,
you're probably right.

580
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,914
He's on his way.
Shouldn't be long now.

581
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:04,707
Vera, I gotta ask a favour of you.

582
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:09,461
But you gotta promise me one thing.
No questions, okay?

583
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:11,008
Okay. I know payday...

584
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:14,680
ain't until tomorrow and everything,
but I gotta get out of town fast.

585
00:52:14,851 --> 00:52:18,303
So can I have my money today?
Please?

586
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:31,148
Five, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18.

587
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:33,200
This have anything
to do with Vernon?

588
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:36,205
- As a matter of speaking.
- Did you tell him about the baby?

589
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:41,331
- Oh, Vera, please.
- All right. All right. Nineteen, 20, 21...

590
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:43,163
Nadine?

591
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:47,257
Where have you been?
I been looking all over town for you.

592
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,501
Inform Mr. Hightower
that how he spent...

593
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:52,595
his morning is no concern of mine.
That wasn't my fault.

594
00:52:52,764 --> 00:52:54,342
Please tell my ex-husband...

595
00:52:54,516 --> 00:52:56,722
I could care less.
He's trying to explain.

596
00:52:56,893 --> 00:52:59,645
- If you'd just let him speak.
- "Trust me," he said.

597
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:02,730
- "I have a plan," he said.
- Hey, I said I'm sorry.

598
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:04,393
Sorry just don't get it done.

599
00:53:04,568 --> 00:53:07,023
Damn it, that was nothing
but business back there.

600
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:08,689
No business I ever saw.

601
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:12,279
Well, whatever it was, I'm sure the man
has a perfectly good reason.

602
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,443
You hit the nail on the head.
Listen to...

603
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:17,620
- Where's my damn nightgown?
- This poor man's been traipsing...

604
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:22,202
all around town looking for you so he
can settle this little misunderstanding.

605
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:25,711
- It ain't no little misunderstanding.
- Nadine...

606
00:53:25,881 --> 00:53:29,546
now, the least you can do is listen.

607
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:32,710
- All right, Vernon.
- Thank you, Vera.

608
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:37,348
Now, darling, I swear,
that woman don't mean a thing to me.

609
00:53:37,517 --> 00:53:39,344
- What woman?
- His fiancée.

610
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,895
She is not my fiancée.

611
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:43,684
Vernon Hightower,
you got a hell of a lot of nerve.

612
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:45,850
Chasing around this town
with some floozy.

613
00:53:46,026 --> 00:53:48,695
- You got a wife here that's pregnant.
- Vera!

614
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:53,571
- How come?
- I ain't ever talking to you again.

615
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:57,075
How come everyone in the world knows
I'm gonna be a daddy except me?

616
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:59,653
If you hadn't been so busy
with that nymphomaniac...

617
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:01,491
Damn it, I keep telling you...

618
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,992
Let me give you some advice,
purely as a friend.

619
00:54:04,169 --> 00:54:06,208
When you do tie the knot with Renee...

620
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:09,962
don't spend your anniversary
at the bar. She won't appreciate it.

621
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,748
I keep on trying to tell you,
I am not gonna marry...

622
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:15,004
I am not the least interested
in your plans.

623
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,587
- Doris Isabelle and me are gonna...
- Doris Isabelle?

624
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:19,177
My daughter.

625
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:21,557
Don't I get a say in the matter?
I'm the daddy.

626
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:23,057
It's not the same.

627
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,433
Listen, you don't know
any more about being...

628
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:53,342
Go around back.
See if you can get in.

629
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:58,180
Come on, you little rat shit.
I want my car!

630
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:14,691
They didn't come out the back,
so they must be in here someplace.

631
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:26,199
All right, Hightower.

632
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:28,161
Might as well come on out.

633
00:55:28,336 --> 00:55:31,006
Sooner or later,
we're gonna find you.

634
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:51,062
Ain't no sign of them down here.

635
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:54,728
Come on.

636
00:55:54,988 --> 00:55:58,238
This is gonna be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

637
00:56:13,048 --> 00:56:14,376
Come on.

638
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:19,379
- I'll be right back.
- Where you going?

639
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:21,962
I'm gonna find us a way out.

640
00:56:44,704 --> 00:56:46,744
You coming?

641
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,541
Mountain, in here.

642
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:08,555
Watch out, now.

643
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:16,646
We can't go down that way.
It won't reach that far.

644
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:20,528
We ain't going down.

645
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:22,691
Then where?

646
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:29,278
I ain't getting on that thing. No.

647
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:32,708
No way. No way, Jose.

648
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:37,040
Vern, I can't. I'm afraid of heights.

649
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:39,338
- You know that?
- That'll do the trick.

650
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:42,000
I'd as soon you shot me
and be done with it...

651
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:47,173
than set foot on that thing.
You've got a baby to think about.

652
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:50,176
Now haul ass.

653
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:06,993
Doris Isabelle, this whole mother deal
ain't working out like I expected.

654
00:58:12,626 --> 00:58:14,665
I got an idea.

655
00:58:16,087 --> 00:58:19,421
Whatever you do, don't look down.

656
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:24,966
Oh, God, Vernon. Vernon!

657
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:30,222
You go first.

658
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:51,907
Come on. It was easy.

659
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,327
Doris Isabelle...

660
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:59,583
if we get out of this thing alive...

661
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:05,084
hon, whatever you do,
don't you ever fall in love...

662
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:08,216
with a man on account of his looks.

663
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:10,720
You learn from
your mama's mistakes.

664
00:59:57,355 --> 00:59:59,562
Oh, my God.

665
01:00:03,153 --> 01:00:05,062
My God.

666
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,235
Oh, God.

667
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:54,324
Darling, if I don't make it...

668
01:00:54,663 --> 01:00:57,070
- Don't talk like that.
- If anything should happen...

669
01:00:57,249 --> 01:00:59,288
Please don't talk like that.

670
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:05,045
I love you.

671
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:08,166
I always have, always will.

672
01:01:10,095 --> 01:01:14,342
Damn it. If I'd known you was gonna
quit on me like this...

673
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:18,099
I wouldn't have fell in love with you
to start with.

674
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:21,433
If this is your idea
of getting out of this marriage...

675
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:23,148
you got another thing coming.

676
01:01:27,487 --> 01:01:30,274
I ain't done with you yet,
Vernon Hightower.

677
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,068
We started off together...

678
01:01:32,284 --> 01:01:35,487
and as long as I'm breathing,
you're gonna have me to deal with.

679
01:01:35,662 --> 01:01:37,405
Now, you got that?

680
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:40,870
Okay.

681
01:01:44,671 --> 01:01:46,829
Let me do it.

682
01:01:57,684 --> 01:01:59,926
Well, lookie here.

683
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:05,188
All right, Hightower.
Now where's my car keys?

684
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:09,191
In my pocket.
Why don't you come and get them?

685
01:02:09,613 --> 01:02:11,155
No.

686
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:13,944
I got a better idea.

687
01:02:16,912 --> 01:02:20,031
- No!
- Now, you wanna keep on...

688
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:21,617
being a smartass...

689
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:26,453
you'll be picking your teeth with
wrought iron in about one minute.

690
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:28,582
Vernon!

691
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:38,881
Vernon! Vernon!

692
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,399
Vernon.

693
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:52,439
Are you okay?

694
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:54,737
Come on, darling.
We ain't got all day.

695
01:02:54,908 --> 01:02:57,446
If you think I'm through
being mad about Renee...

696
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:00,449
All right, you first. Go on.

697
01:03:07,629 --> 01:03:10,334
- What's she doing here?
- Thrilled to see you too, Dwight.

698
01:03:10,507 --> 01:03:13,045
Come on, Dwight, we got business.

699
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,092
I swear, you two are living testimony
to the fact...

700
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,934
that it's better to be lucky
than smart.

701
01:03:21,476 --> 01:03:25,177
Mr. Estes here has seen fit
to throw in with me.

702
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:28,481
He figures it's better to have
a small piece of a sure thing...

703
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,604
than half interest
in a cemetery plot.

704
01:03:31,778 --> 01:03:33,522
That's right.

705
01:03:33,738 --> 01:03:36,942
Me and Mr. Pope are partners now.
No hard feelings, Vernon...

706
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:39,323
but you'd have just
screwed this up somehow.

707
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:42,157
- I'll remember that.
- I don't suppose you happen...

708
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,074
to have that map on you?

709
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:49,159
- I didn't think you would.
- I'll make you a deal, all right?

710
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:52,457
You let my wife go, I'll see to it
you get that map back.

711
01:03:52,757 --> 01:03:54,631
What about this?

712
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:57,464
You get me the map,
then I'll let your wife go.

713
01:04:01,224 --> 01:04:03,798
You don't have a choice, Vernon.

714
01:04:04,394 --> 01:04:05,723
All right.

715
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:08,980
- You go with him, Estes.
- Me? Why me?

716
01:04:09,149 --> 01:04:11,391
Because I said so, that's why.

717
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:15,234
South of town, old Highway 91, there's
a salvage yard that belongs to me.

718
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:17,065
I'll leave the gate open.

719
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:19,275
Try not to be late.

720
01:04:37,469 --> 01:04:39,461
You know what your problem is,
Vernon?

721
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,802
You don't ever look
at the big picture.

722
01:04:41,973 --> 01:04:44,132
Now that map's
gotta be worth 5, $10 million.

723
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:46,467
That means raising
a lot of money fast.

724
01:04:46,645 --> 01:04:49,811
So I went to Mr. Pope. I mean,
everybody knows he's a high roller.

725
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:52,104
You tell me, how much
do you expect to get?

726
01:04:52,275 --> 01:04:55,062
Well, we haven't worked out
the exact figures yet.

727
01:04:55,237 --> 01:04:57,028
I imagine about 500,000.

728
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:59,695
What makes you think Pope
will give you that?

729
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:02,025
Because we have an agreement.
Why wouldn't he?

730
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,693
Well, I guess half a million bucks
is reason enough.

731
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:07,243
I mean, once he's got
his hands on those photos...

732
01:05:07,415 --> 01:05:10,416
what the hell's he need you for?
Vernon, Vernon.

733
01:05:10,585 --> 01:05:12,494
Where is the map?

734
01:05:15,924 --> 01:05:19,174
Suit yourself, pal. It's right here.

735
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:21,302
Yeah.

736
01:05:23,974 --> 01:05:26,429
I saw that same TV show.

737
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:28,226
Now hand it over.

738
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:40,489
I'm warning you,
anything happens to Nadine...

739
01:05:40,657 --> 01:05:42,650
you're as good as dead.

740
01:05:43,827 --> 01:05:45,701
You got that?

741
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,158
Do you mind if I have a beer?

742
01:05:53,336 --> 01:05:56,503
I usually don't drink this early,
but this is an exception.

743
01:05:56,673 --> 01:05:58,500
Be my guest.

744
01:06:05,557 --> 01:06:10,266
Vernon Hightower,
I'm so mad at you I could bust.

745
01:06:11,146 --> 01:06:13,103
Renee, Dwight. Dwight, Renee.

746
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:15,806
I hope you are not in business
with Mr. Hightower...

747
01:06:15,984 --> 01:06:18,142
because he is nothing
but a low-down skunk.

748
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,941
- Don't I know it.
- Do you see this? This is a size six.

749
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:24,732
I wear an eight. You'd think somebody
that's supposed to be my fiancée...

750
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,160
would know a thing like that.
But I'm such a trusting person.

751
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,038
I thought it was an honest mistake.

752
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:33,373
So, what do I do? I go down
to the store and try to exchange it.

753
01:06:33,543 --> 01:06:35,999
What do they tell me?
They can't take it back...

754
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:38,626
because it is a used garment.

755
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:42,917
Used. Furthermore, they hadn't had
this particular style...

756
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:46,677
in the store in six months. I didn't
even know Vernon six months ago.

757
01:06:46,848 --> 01:06:50,051
Oh, if you're trying to scare me
with that thing, it won't work.

758
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:52,676
You told me a dozen times
how you keep that gun...

759
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:57,896
in the chest for show. How the firing
pin's jammed, and it won't shoot. Here.

760
01:06:58,068 --> 01:07:01,852
As far as I'm concerned,
we are no longer engaged.

761
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:03,857
It was nice to have met you.

762
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:16,667
I don't know, Vernon.

763
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:19,506
This just doesn't seem
to be your day.

764
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:34,844
Floyd? Any sign of them yet?

765
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,604
Not yet.

766
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,526
I gotta be frank with you.

767
01:07:44,698 --> 01:07:46,607
I don't see you
getting away with this.

768
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:49,357
That's gonna be
the easiest part of it.

769
01:07:49,536 --> 01:07:53,581
The hard part, the part
I'm not looking forward to...

770
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,699
Let me have that bottle.

771
01:08:02,757 --> 01:08:06,672
The fact of the matter is
I've never killed a woman before.

772
01:08:08,763 --> 01:08:10,673
Here they come.

773
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:37,745
- You got that map?
- It's right here.

774
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:39,495
- Now, I was wondering...
- Floyd?

775
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:42,036
- If we...
- Mountain.

776
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:46,337
Where's my damn car, huh?

777
01:08:46,843 --> 01:08:49,678
And my pistol, goddamn it.

778
01:08:50,555 --> 01:08:53,342
You and me are gonna have a talk
later on, you hear?

779
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:57,301
Now then, Mr. Pope, there's a couple
things that we never did work out.

780
01:08:57,562 --> 01:08:59,436
Not that there's gonna be
any problem...

781
01:08:59,606 --> 01:09:04,434
but I was wondering if we could get
it on paper. An informal agreement...

782
01:09:04,653 --> 01:09:07,191
- Hey.
- I lived up to my end of the bargain.

783
01:09:07,364 --> 01:09:09,024
Let her go.

784
01:09:09,491 --> 01:09:12,824
This place looks like pure-D dog shit,
don't it?

785
01:09:13,036 --> 01:09:15,871
You may not think it, but
there's enough explosives here...

786
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:20,203
if you put a little gasoline in the right
place, light a match at the wrong time...

787
01:09:20,377 --> 01:09:24,209
this dump would go up
like a Roman candle.

788
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:27,547
There'd be no way
they'd ever find your bodies.

789
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:32,086
Take them on in and shoot them.

790
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:34,470
Hey, hey.
Now, he wasn't talking about me.

791
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,301
I was especially talking about you.

792
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,385
We had an agreement.
You can't back out...

793
01:09:40,188 --> 01:09:42,940
Dwight. Dwight.

794
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:46,269
I guess this just ain't your day,
is it, cousin?

795
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,613
Son of a bitch.

796
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:03,209
Come on, move it. Come on.

797
01:10:03,879 --> 01:10:05,456
Get in there.

798
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:09,756
Come on, go.

799
01:10:10,886 --> 01:10:12,759
Move it.

800
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:16,719
Now go on over there
against that wall. Go on.

801
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:20,886
Well, I guess this is it for us.
And I gotta get this said.

802
01:10:21,062 --> 01:10:24,016
Now, I know I ain't been
the easiest person to get along with.

803
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:27,026
- I know I'm stubborn and selfish...
- That's far enough.

804
01:10:28,153 --> 01:10:31,604
- Which one of y'all wants to go first?
- Hold on, Mountain.

805
01:10:31,781 --> 01:10:33,988
I wanna talk
to that son of a bitch over there.

806
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,195
- But Mr. Pope told me...
- I don't give a shit what Mr. Pope says.

807
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,989
You finish up outside.
I'll take care of these two.

808
01:10:48,715 --> 01:10:51,384
Now then, where's my damn car?

809
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:55,011
You got about as much chance
of getting that junk heap back...

810
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,639
Now, you look here, shit-face.

811
01:10:56,807 --> 01:10:59,807
You don't tell me where that car is,
in about one second...

812
01:11:00,393 --> 01:11:02,433
You even think about
trying anything...

813
01:11:02,604 --> 01:11:04,762
you can wave goodbye
to your private parts.

814
01:11:10,111 --> 01:11:11,985
All right.

815
01:11:12,197 --> 01:11:14,770
We're going out that door...

816
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:17,488
and you tell your friends
to put down them guns...

817
01:11:17,661 --> 01:11:20,615
you got that straight?
Yes, sir.

818
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,001
You mean to say to me
you had that thing all along...

819
01:11:26,211 --> 01:11:29,794
and you didn't tell me about it?
We'll talk about this another time.

820
01:11:29,965 --> 01:11:33,665
All the time I was just thinking
this is the end. I'd never see you again.

821
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:35,759
Here we go.

822
01:11:43,228 --> 01:11:45,019
Mr. Pope?

823
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:49,815
- We got us a small problem.
- Floyd, goddamn it.

824
01:12:03,373 --> 01:12:04,701
Come on.

825
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,085
Look at it this way. Your share
just got a whole lot bigger.

826
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:10,127
Get on out there.

827
01:13:42,973 --> 01:13:48,560
Hon, if you wasn't to yell so much,
I'd sure appreciate it. Understand?

828
01:13:54,025 --> 01:13:55,899
Here.

829
01:14:00,282 --> 01:14:02,073
Come on.

830
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:21,009
He's over there
by that rusted-out Chevy.

831
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:26,297
This ought to keep them busy
long enough for us to get out of here.

832
01:14:27,684 --> 01:14:32,061
- You got a match?
- Do I look like I have a match?

833
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,314
You know...

834
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:39,607
you could be a hell of a lot
more help sometimes.

835
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:43,152
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna start shooting.

836
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:45,994
You're gonna throw this
as close as you can to that car.

837
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:49,446
I'm gonna set it off from here.
You ready?

838
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:51,366
- Vernon, is this gonna work?
- No.

839
01:15:01,384 --> 01:15:05,548
- You missed.
- Hell, I know that much.

840
01:15:13,772 --> 01:15:17,722
Listen, this is not
the easiest thing in the world.

841
01:15:26,743 --> 01:15:29,448
You didn't think I could do it,
did you?

842
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:38,952
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.

843
01:15:50,308 --> 01:15:52,182
All right.

844
01:15:52,978 --> 01:15:55,647
Wait here. I'm gonna get the pickup.
I'll be right back.

845
01:15:55,814 --> 01:15:59,147
Vernon, don't you leave me
all alone here...

846
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:39,851
Mr. Hightower, you're beginning
to get on my nerves.

847
01:16:42,277 --> 01:16:44,020
Nadine?

848
01:16:44,196 --> 01:16:46,484
That's right.

849
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:52,443
Why is it you work your butt off
all your life just to get ahead...

850
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:55,372
and it takes a couple of nitwits
about 10 minutes...

851
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,829
to screw the whole thing up?

852
01:17:06,259 --> 01:17:09,711
Once I get that shuffleboard in,
I can enlarge the dance floor...

853
01:17:09,888 --> 01:17:12,379
get a bandstand,
a crystal chandelier.

854
01:17:12,557 --> 01:17:15,475
Aren't you counting your chickens
just a little early, sport?

855
01:17:15,644 --> 01:17:18,680
Trust me, hon.
Now then, about the new sign.

856
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:24,565
- What new sign?
- You think 40 foot across is too small?

857
01:17:25,445 --> 01:17:27,568
Forty foot across?
Have you lost your mind?

858
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:30,901
I guess you're right. Anything bigger
than that would look gaudy.

859
01:17:31,076 --> 01:17:33,649
- If you think you'll throw away money...
- Trust me.

860
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:36,862
Vernon Hightower,
let's get one thing straight now.

861
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,539
The Blue Bonnet will never do squat,
I don't care how much you put in it.

862
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:44,376
I was thinking something in neon
that sort of revolves...

863
01:17:44,589 --> 01:17:47,590
The sound of my voice don't seem
to be reaching your ears.

864
01:17:47,759 --> 01:17:50,926
Hon, we gonna have us a baby.
And you know what that means?

865
01:17:51,096 --> 01:17:53,302
That means we have to start
acting responsibly.

866
01:17:53,473 --> 01:17:55,964
- And you know what that means?
- We'll put it high up.

867
01:17:56,184 --> 01:17:58,093
So people can see it
for miles around.

868
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:02,481
"Nadine Hightower's World-Famous
Blue Bonnet Bar and Lounge."

869
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,605
- What colour neon?
- Royal blue.

870
01:18:11,324 --> 01:18:14,029
Pink. Pink's my lucky colour.

871
01:18:14,494 --> 01:18:16,036
Well, we'll talk about it.

872
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:21,368
Maybe we could paint
the outside a little.

873
01:18:21,585 --> 01:18:24,158
Put up a big picture window,
something like that.

874
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:26,959
I could hire waitresses
with those short uniforms on...

875
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:29,670
you know,
with the bows in the back and...

876
01:18:36,099 --> 01:18:38,721
Mr. Hightower, we've listened
to Mr. Dwight Estes...

877
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:41,563
and Ed "Mountain" Hayes.
They corroborate your story.

878
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,349
Furthermore, the prints found on the
weapon used to kill Floyd Simmons...

879
01:18:45,525 --> 01:18:48,195
belong to Buford Pope.
We're formally charging him...

880
01:18:48,361 --> 01:18:51,066
with the murders of Raymond
Escobar and Floyd Simmons.

881
01:18:51,281 --> 01:18:54,816
If you'd listened to me in the first
place, we'd have saved lots of time.

882
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:59,743
Mr. Hightower, just about the only thing
you're not guilty of is murder.

883
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:02,584
First we have resisting arrest.

884
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:06,001
Then we have breaking and entering.
Then some more resisting arrest.

885
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:10,547
And we have something here we
haven't figured out what to call it yet.

886
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:12,965
And then, according to Mr. Hayes...

887
01:19:13,136 --> 01:19:16,256
you entered into a conspiracy
to defraud the state of Texas...

888
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:19,765
by stealing a map from the Highway
Department for commercial gain.

889
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,894
Well, that is about the damnedest thing
that I've ever heard of.

890
01:19:24,064 --> 01:19:26,815
Isn't that about the damnedest thing
you ever heard of?

891
01:19:27,025 --> 01:19:29,314
Then you deny having said map
on your person?

892
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:33,479
You're damn well right we deny it.
Don't we, hon?

893
01:19:33,657 --> 01:19:36,574
Then you won't mind
if we search you.

894
01:19:36,993 --> 01:19:41,988
- Oh, hold on. I didn't say that.
- Good. Sam, Gerald.

895
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:46,534
Hey, now. Hey, wait a minute, now.
Hey, I know my rights.

896
01:19:46,711 --> 01:19:50,246
I'm supposed to be able
to call my lawyer.

897
01:19:52,843 --> 01:19:55,512
All right. You can do
what you want with me.

898
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,671
My wife didn't know anything
about this.

899
01:19:57,889 --> 01:20:00,594
Do you know what the penalty is
for something like this?

900
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,594
Six to 12 in Huntsville.

901
01:20:10,443 --> 01:20:13,361
Vernon, trust me.
