1
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:39,077
# Oh, give me a home

2
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:43,296
# Where the buffalo roam

3
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:51,590
# Where the deer and the antelope play

4
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:55,929
# Where seldom is heard

5
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:00,064
# A discouraging word

6
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:07,528
# And the skies are not cloudy all day

7
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:15,821
# Home, home on the range

8
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:24,131
# Where the deer and the antelope play

9
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,722
# Where seldom is heard

10
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:33,852
# A discouraging word

11
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:41,268
# And the skies are not cloudy all day

12
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:50,490
# No, the skies are not cloudy all day... #

13
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,205
Stop it!

14
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,583
Go away!

15
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:20,093
Get a grip, Thompson.

16
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:25,055
Come on. It's just a deadline.
You got two hours till the presses roll.

17
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:31,065
Shut up! You'll get words
when I want to give them to you.

18
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,822
No need to panic, huh?

19
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,996
Just another deadline.

20
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:56,129
I'll just lash together a few raw facts,

21
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,386
little bit of old negro wisdom,

22
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,973
and this nightmare is over.

23
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,071
Nixon.

24
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:22,162
Come on, easy boy. You never liked this.

25
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:25,498
Bronco, come on. Bronco, come on.
Fun is fun.

26
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:28,076
Lie on your side. Down!

27
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,997
Lie on your side.

28
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,129
Fun is fun.

29
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,219
Good boy, Bronco.

30
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:42,766
Savage bastards.

31
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:54,322
There, chew on that gibberish for a while,
you heartless scum.

32
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,755
You've pushed me too far.

33
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,796
Down, Bronco, he's mine!

34
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,200
# A thrill a minute, an invention a day

35
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:49,257
# It's the American way

36
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:53,593
# A thrill a minute, an invention a day

37
00:05:55,267 --> 00:06:00,262
# It's the American way... #

38
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,314
I was deciding to write off this weird town,
makes you sleep forever.

39
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:24,339
'This wouldn't be the first time I got sucked
into writing about Lazlo, Karl Lazlo esquire,

40
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:26,962
'attorney at law, my attorney.

41
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,220
'This was the man I counted on
to keep me out of jail in those years.

42
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,470
'Those weird years between
the '60s and the '70s,

43
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,388
'the age of Nixon.

44
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,936
'It was a time to keep your head down.

45
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,814
'I was a working journalist, a hired geek
of sorts, and Lazlo was great company

46
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,945
'and sometimes a good lawyer.

47
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:51,695
'It was a fast, strange time,
and we worked in fast, strange ways.'

48
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:55,287
He claimed he was being chased
by Mr Nixon

49
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,246
when his car was attacked
by a swarm of bats.

50
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:59,747
Bats?

51
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:03,338
It's obvious he was having
a paranoid drug reaction.

52
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:08,800
Every 20 minutes, he calls down to the desk,
demands to see his lawyer and hangs up.

53
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,428
He claims he's being held a prisoner.

54
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,937
Uh-oh.

55
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,062
Er, I'm rambling.

56
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,858
Er...

57
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:28,285
I think I'd better tell my readers that I'm
no longer responsible for anything I write.

58
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:36,745
Er, I've been without sleep for 80 hours
so I'm beyond simple fatigue.

59
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:40,373
The hallucinations have stopped,
finally, thank God,

60
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,218
but my adrenaline reserves are burning out

61
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:46,470
and I'm staring into the face
of a psychotic freak-out.

62
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:49,511
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing.

63
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,681
Writing?

64
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,479
Yeah. And my deadline page, too.
I'm pouring it on now. Right on the edge.

65
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:58,770
But I made a smart move
checking into this place

66
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:02,527
because, you know, in case I lose it totally,

67
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,317
I know I'll be safe in the arms
of the sisters of mercy.

68
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,452
What are you writing?

69
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,161
My Attorney Versus American Justice.

70
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,916
Cute title, and, er...

71
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:17,502
hopefully I'll be able to finish it.

72
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,900
Morning.

73
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:45,369
Ahhh. Hmm.

74
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:48,955
Er... let me recommend... Try a blue one.

75
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,368
A blue one? Really?

76
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,633
Wow!

77
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:05,346
Little bugger gets right on top of you.

78
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,978
Shit. Shit!

79
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:13,107
'Dr Roberts, call Dr Bretherton
in administration.

80
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:15,566
'Dr Roberts, call Dr Bretherton.'

81
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:26,321
- No! No more, please!
- Sorry.

82
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,039
# I've been feeling so wild

83
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,501
# There's been a change in your style

84
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,089
# You probably thought
that I would never see the light

85
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:39,424
# But now I know
I can feel it in my bones... #

86
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,389
Hmm.

87
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:44,227
# Your love is gone without a dime

88
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:48,648
# I'd like to know
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

89
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,975
# Why you're letting me go

90
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,560
# I got a love so right... #

91
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,066
Shh.

92
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,782
Just relax.

93
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,703
Everything's gonna be just fine.

94
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:01,946
I'll be gone in a second.

95
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:08,581
# Loving you is dangerous
# Loving you is dangerous... #

96
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:10,499
Nice day.

97
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:16,757
# Loving you is dangerous
# Loving you is dangerous... #

98
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,974
Take it easy.

99
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,553
#... a change in your style

100
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:33,358
# Girl, I can see it
in the way that you smile... #

101
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,320
Five more minutes then we're out of here.

102
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:40,531
We could just make it away with you along,
you know.

103
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,581
Student nurse, you know.

104
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:46,536
Clear-headed.
Used to thinking in terms of crisis.

105
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,918
Bat!

106
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:59,638
Lazlo. What took you so long?
It's been a nightmare here.

107
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:03,148
- Bat.
- Ooh. What have you done?

108
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:05,902
Jeez, she was just fine a minute ago.

109
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:10,114
Oh, I'm eating her cookie.
Cook, the bat here is Karl Lazlo.

110
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:14,825
As your attorney,
I advise you to leave this room at once.

111
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:16,110
Right.

112
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,623
Oh, shit. Good thinking, we may need this.

113
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,916
- Come on, get your things, let's go, Cook.
- No, she should stay.

114
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:29,591
We can't leave her in this snake pit,
they'll pick her bones clean.

115
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:34,056
- Thompson, trust my judgment.
- Not in this instance. She's harmless.

116
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:37,807
She's good with her hands too,
she made these for me.

117
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,935
Come on!

118
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:42,479
Oh, jeez.

119
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,607
You'll probably be safer here.

120
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,067
Mr Thompson!

121
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,694
- Yeah!
- Mr Thompson, open the door.

122
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:52,322
Mr Thompson.

123
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:56,279
- Watch out for this fucker.
- You have one of our nurses in there.

124
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:00,328
All right, er... Vaya con dios.

125
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:03,090
Shit. Shit!

126
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:05,250
Shit. Shit!

127
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:24,067
Ah, shit.

128
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,510
You gotta get this because it's important.

129
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,806
- Can you drive and...?
- No problem.

130
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:55,098
The key aspects
are all in the Fourth Amendment...

131
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:57,811
Great, a basis in reality, that's good.

132
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:02,029
...including the need for probable cause...
- Probable cause? All right.

133
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:07,701
...and the right for people to be secure
in their homes free from illegal search.

134
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,954
That's the big one.
It's the fucking Constitution.

135
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,542
I mean...
Hey, you're getting all of this too.

136
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,750
- I'm a total professional.
- Good.

137
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:24,136
Cos this is important stuff, a whole
generation of kids are being screwed.

138
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,970
Their rights are being violated
every day by the police.

139
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,013
They take the kids, rough 'em up,
throw 'em in jail...

140
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:33,477
- Gestapo tactics.
- Exactly.

141
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,475
All right, spread 'em, hit the wall.

142
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:39,190
Come on, shut up and get your head down.

143
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,067
- Come on, will you...?
- Spread 'em!

144
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:44,649
The judges are cold,

145
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:50,119
they throw the kids in jail, give them
ridiculous sentences, all for headlines.

146
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,248
- You getting this?
- Yep.

147
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,958
Good. Stay with me.

148
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:59,052
Hey! Goddamn... Hey!

149
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,009
Come back here!

150
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,053
How many people are gonna read this?

151
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,818
About 800,000, a million maybe.

152
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,476
Huh.

153
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:19,027
- When is this gonna come out?
- Well...

154
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:23,066
it was supposed to be in the last issue
but maybe this one.

155
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:56,361
- When did these come in?
- An hour ago.

156
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:59,782
I want to see everything.
Page, get up here!

157
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,961
Well?

158
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,922
Nobody's seen him
since he left the hospital.

159
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:21,011
- Get on the phone.
- You know him, he could be anywhere.

160
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:25,051
I don't give a shit. You find him.

161
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,472
He owes me a cover story and I want it.

162
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:31,516
- OK, I'm going, I'm doing, I'm looking.
- Check the bars.

163
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,198
No.

164
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,784
No.

165
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,371
Yes.

166
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,123
- No.
- Yes.

167
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:53,130
- Mr Lazlo!
- Well... look who's here.

168
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,509
- The master barrister.
- That's right.

169
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:57,804
Give me the Colts, the Steelers, the Jets...

170
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,427
- Jasper Russell meet Dr Thompson.
- Hello, Doctor.

171
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,727
I'm taking the Bears, I can't quit on them.

172
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:08,524
Excellent bone man.
He specialises in gunshot wounds.

173
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:10,688
Well, I can give you a cheque.

174
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:13,106
I know, but...

175
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,323
Well, you know where you can find me.

176
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,451
He's a weirdo, Lazlo.

177
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:21,076
Lazlo, how are you doing?

178
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,709
Never better.

179
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:25,001
You know, I really admire you.

180
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:28,089
- Really?
- Yeah. But you could do a lot better.

181
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:31,260
- No shit.
- You're strong, you're tough,

182
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,717
you're good, the clients like you.

183
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:37,389
But it's the wrong rules,
and you're playing the wrong game.

184
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:41,475
Let me send you some real clients -
divorce, real estate.

185
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,308
That's business, Lazlo.

186
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,485
You can do the cases,
we'll split it down the middle.

187
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,943
We'll make a deal, we'll make money.

188
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,190
- The guy said...
- Money?

189
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:53,526
...that it wasn't so bad to make money.

190
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,537
- Remember that.
- You mean I'd, er...

191
00:16:56,623 --> 00:17:01,700
make some money and maybe be like your
field representative, handle the overflow?

192
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:07,003
You're not making any money representing
these jack-offs, and you know it.

193
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,928
- Jack-offs?
- Now you've done it.

194
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:13,347
You call the people I defend jack-offs?

195
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,434
- Hear ye, hear ye, everybody!
- Calm down!

196
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,058
Look at a man who defends evil people!

197
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:22,897
Will you guys just knock it off?

198
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,859
Lazlo, God damn it, get down.

199
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,484
Repent! There's still time!

200
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:31,358
Bless you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
We hear you, Jesus.

201
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:36,744
Whosoever's name is not written in the book
of life shall be cast into a lake of fire!

202
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,207
Amen! Amen!

203
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:01,017
Mr Lazlo.
Hey, Lazlo.

204
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,646
Hey, Lazlo!

205
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,445
OK, OK, settle down, settle down.

206
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,156
OK, 223 Coal Street, where are you?

207
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:15,407
We're gonna go inside and make a motion
to suppress the search and seizure.

208
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:19,120
We're gonna say the cops
didn't have probable cause.

209
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,338
Got it? OK. Livingstone.

210
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:23,465
You got your old lady?

211
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,838
Good. Billy, we're gonna
get to you this afternoon.

212
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,758
OK, now.

213
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,141
I want you to remember one thing.

214
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:35,016
Once we get inside, no grab-ass.

215
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:39,022
No fooling around, no yelling, no booing,
none of that stuff.

216
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:41,733
Just keep cool and let's do it.

217
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:45,026
- OK? Come on.
- All right.

218
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:48,950
...on behalf of the coming defence...

219
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,246
...sheer domestic tranquillity...

220
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:59,005
Would you be
interested in donating blood, sir?

221
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,250
- Donate? My blood?
- Mmm.

222
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:06,552
As a matter of fact, I'm here to pick up
some blood. Hope you're my type of girl.

223
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:12,727
Roll up your sleeve.
This'll prick for just a second.

224
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:16,896
I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor.

225
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:19,608
Jesus, I missed. Sorry.

226
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:23,281
You're moving now,
you gotta hold still.

227
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:27,746
- Here we go. That's a beautiful colour.
- No!

228
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,038
You got a lot of it too. All right!

229
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,000
All right.

230
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,293
OK, hold on, hold on.

231
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,124
All right.

232
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,335
I'm a little cowgirl.
Dabba-dabba-dabba-dabba.

233
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,967
Kiss and make better.

234
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,097
Yeah, all right.

235
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,646
You should do that all the time.
Several times a month, at least.

236
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,817
Lazlo, Lazlo, Lazlo.

237
00:19:56,906 --> 00:20:01,652
The whole calendar is Lazlo. Will I ever get
to ply my trade against anyone else?

238
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:04,236
Yeah, asshole,
when you stop busting kids.

239
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:08,792
Remember thou, keep holy the Lord's day.
Honour thy father and mother.

240
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:12,163
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

241
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:16,717
Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not be
a false witness against thy neighbour.

242
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,842
So this is it. Nice place.

243
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:23,763
Jeez, you can almost smell the narcs.

244
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:28,349
There's a certain kind of a stink.
You know that stink? Jesus.

245
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:33,809
- Where's the chamber of horrors?
- Room six. Grab a seat.

246
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,945
First come, first served.

247
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:40,653
Get smart, Lazlo.

248
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:44,495
Look, could you just hold this for a second?

249
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,122
Just a second.

250
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:50,210
I'll see you in court.

251
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,992
Everyone rise.

252
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,544
Be seated.

253
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,843
Jesus, it's happening already.

254
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,642
Kind of close quarters in here, isn't it?

255
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,894
Let's go.

256
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:51,944
Let's get this thing moving.
Clerk, where are the files?

257
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:54,073
Come on, we're backed up.

258
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:58,866
Let's see.

259
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:04,584
State versus Occupants 223 Coal Street.

260
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:08,884
Possession, sales marijuana.

261
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:12,135
623 Paige Street, marijuana.

262
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:15,508
People versus Kramer, marijuana.

263
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,640
These all yours, Lazlo?

264
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,521
Yes, your honour!

265
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:31,031
We'll set a hearing
on the Coal Street matter.

266
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:33,787
How about the 13th?

267
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:37,739
- What about the motions?
- Motions? What motions?

268
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,586
A motion to suppress
the search and seizure.

269
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,921
- There's a probable cause question...
- Wait.

270
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,839
Have you conferred
with the district attorney?

271
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,968
- Yes.
- And?

272
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:52,428
I and my clients are going to trial.

273
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:55,222
You tell him!

274
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:59,690
How long will these motions take?

275
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:05,979
An hour, maybe two, maybe more,
I don't know. I have a lot of questions.

276
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:08,611
For instance, in the Coal Street matter...

277
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:13,245
Mr Lazlo, Mr Willins,
would you please approach the bench?

278
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:25,166
Here, I'll be right back.
Would you mind?

279
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:29,548
Gentlemen, let's be reasonable.

280
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,556
For 16 crummy joints, are you kidding me?

281
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:37,972
I'm gonna take every case to trial,
every one, if I have to.

282
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:41,021
I can back this place up for six years.

283
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,486
You're making a mistake, Lazlo.

284
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,613
Four, five,

285
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,946
six, seven,

286
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,124
eight, nine, ten...

287
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,333
Marty. Where the hell you been?

288
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,460
Been looking all over for you.

289
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,795
You are not registered at your hotel.

290
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:05,180
Your rental car is reported stolen.

291
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:09,309
Personally, I couldn't give a shit,
but you owe me a story.

292
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,433
Is it due? Am I late?

293
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:16,056
You've got a deadline in 19 hours.
Now where's my story?

294
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:20,101
It's right in there.

295
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:23,898
Great too, incredible story,
it's developing fast.

296
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:27,113
I think it could be
the best thing I've ever done.

297
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,328
All I gotta do now is write it up.

298
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:32,122
Write it up?

299
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,250
You've got 19 hours.

300
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:38,588
You move like a cat, Marty.

301
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:42,836
37, 38, 39...

302
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,465
Entered? How could you enter?
The door was locked.

303
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,560
You broke down the door without a warrant.

304
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:52,813
- I heard a scream.
- You heard a scream.

305
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,025
Are you sure it wasn't laughter? Kids having
a good time, innocent merriment?

306
00:24:58,114 --> 00:24:59,941
No, it sounded like a scream.

307
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:03,781
Hit him with the Fourth Amendment, Laz.

308
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:08,329
That's not really appropriate,
the Fourth Amendment.

309
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,457
- You're a law student?
- Yeah.

310
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:12,584
Don't come on so heavy.

311
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:14,878
- Why would I ever hire you?
- I'm sorry.

312
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:18,002
OK, so you went inside.
Then what happened?

313
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:22,179
I saw one of the defendants make
a furtive movement.

314
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:25,053
- Like what?
- Shall I demonstrate?

315
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:28,311
- Please.
- It was like this.

316
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,853
- That's a furtive movement?
- Down into here.

317
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:35,070
I'd like to demonstrate
that movement just like this.

318
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:38,939
That's a furtive move
and you were scared and, er...

319
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:42,486
- then what did you do?
- So I searched him.

320
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,572
And what, in fact, did you find?

321
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:50,373
- Pack of Mariboros.
- A pack of Mariboro cigarettes.

322
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:58,465
So instead of just realising you had made
a human error and returning the cigarettes,

323
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,308
you decided to peek inside. Why?

324
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:05,521
Because I thought that defendant
may have been concealing

325
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,855
a small plastic exploding device
of some kind.

326
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,027
So I opened up the cigarettes, that's why.

327
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,363
You were looking for a bomb
in a packet of cigarettes?

328
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,952
Take your seat.

329
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,610
I'm sorry.

330
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,372
I'm in control.
Not sure about these people, though.

331
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,998
Is this man an associate of yours?

332
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,128
No, just a...

333
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:32,837
just a good American like yourself.

334
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:34,967
May we proceed?

335
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,179
And although, in all fairness,

336
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:43,396
I must say your legal rights
might have been better protected,

337
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,229
given my willingness and the willingness
of the district attorney.

338
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:52,194
I feel compelled to sentence you each
to six months in the county jail.

339
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:58,578
Six months? Why?
You could've cut off their feet.

340
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,535
Once more and you're out of the courtroom.

341
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:05,963
Clerk, best get moving. Next case.

342
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:14,259
Nice going, Lazlo.

343
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:18,757
The People versus William Kramer.

344
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,143
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

345
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:25,186
Looks like you got a good thing going there.

346
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,356
- So you gave the cop the bag?
- Yeah.

347
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,856
Why? Why didn't you say no?

348
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,990
I don't know.

349
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:38,697
I guess I thought maybe
nothing would happen to me.

350
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,208
Because, in your mind,
that bag didn't belong to you.

351
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:44,003
It didn't.

352
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:49,084
Nevertheless, you were arrested for
possession of one pound of marijuana.

353
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:51,503
This is your second arrest for possession.

354
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:54,302
- Yeah.
- How much did you have the first time?

355
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:56,136
One joint.

356
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:59,516
One joint. And for this you did time in jail.

357
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,314
- Yeah.
- How long?

358
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,650
18 months.

359
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:07,442
18 months for one joint.

360
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:09,655
OK, look, er...

361
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,278
who was it?

362
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,320
What was the name of the guy
who gave you the bag of grass?

363
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,250
I don't think he's gonna tell him.

364
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:22,377
- He's not.
- The kid's tough.

365
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:24,920
He is tough, and he's not gonna talk.

366
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:28,085
Do you know his name, Mr Kramer?

367
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,889
You wanna tell him?

368
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,396
OK.

369
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,110
I'm sorry, Judge, the kid's not a squealer.

370
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,990
Take your seat, Mr Kramer.

371
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:53,486
The court is still in session.

372
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,622
The defence rests.

373
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:02,880
Will the defendant please rise?

374
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:11,299
Any person who transports into this state,
sells, furnishes or gives away any marijuana

375
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,719
- shall be punished...
- What's he doing?

376
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:17,265
- He's reading the fucking law.
...five years to life...

377
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,772
I think you guys should listen.
His honour is reading the sentence.

378
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:25,114
Fuck off.

379
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,155
- He's your client.
...not less than three years.

380
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:31,413
Do you understand your sentence,
Mr Kramer?

381
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:32,910
No.

382
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:38,286
Five years to life.

383
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,678
- Five years?
- Easy, Lazlo.

384
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:45,886
Did you say five years?

385
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:48,595
- That's ridiculous. I protest!
- Contempt!

386
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:52,434
Five fucking years?

387
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:55,974
It's a travesty of justice. I will not stand for it.

388
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:59,272
I will not give you any names.

389
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:02,530
Smile for the camera.

390
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:10,040
What does this mean, Lazlo?

391
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,952
Write about it!

392
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,871
Tell the worid!

393
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:17,130
Tell them the truth!

394
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:30,637
- Here's the story.
- Great, let's have it.

395
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:34,860
- It's incredible, kid raped by the court...
- Come on, we got two hours.

396
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,436
...and Lazlo's arrested, he's in jail.

397
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:41,992
- I told him that you'd pay for his bail.
- I can't afford it.

398
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:44,995
- Doesn't matter, he doesn't want it.
- Good.

399
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:50,372
He said, "Forget the money, but if Marty
could say some sort of personal prayer

400
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:52,501
"it'd make a big difference."

401
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,163
No, no, no, don't do this to me, please.

402
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,298
Hell, I'll pray with you.

403
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:04,428
I can't do this. I can't pray.

404
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:08,977
Sure you can. Dig deep.
Come on, it's like riding a bicycle.

405
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:11,687
- I can't pray.
- Come on, come on, come on.

406
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:13,817
Anybody can.

407
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:25,662
"Dear God". That'd probably be
a good way to start, something like that.

408
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,000
Dear God, thank you for everything.

409
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:32,872
- Get Lazlo in there.
- Dear God, thank you for everything,

410
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:36,668
- and God bless Lazlo too.
- And all the people of the worid.

411
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:39,717
And all the people of the worid too.
Let's have it.

412
00:31:39,808 --> 00:31:43,177
- Please, let's have it.
- Do you have the cheque?

413
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:55,652
You didn't sign this. You gotta sign this.
They won't cash that without your signature.

414
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:02,241
Glad I caught that.
It's not legal without the signature.

415
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:12,878
Thanks.

416
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,465
Thank Lazlo.

417
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:27,104
'Well, that finished him
as a lawyer, at least as a working lawyer.

418
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:29,732
'And some of it may have been my fault.

419
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:33,405
'Perhaps I was not the kind of friend in court
Lazlo needed.

420

'But the humour had gone,
there was nothing to be laughed at.

it was too late for both of us.

Hey, sir. Hey, sir!

00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,674
Hey!

435
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,752
Agh! God!

436
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:31,419
Is anything wrong?

437
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:36,802
- Sir, what's wrong?
- My head.

438
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:41,355
- Your head?
- Who sent you?

439
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:45,025
- What are you talking about?
- What government agency?

440
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:48,317
- I think I'd like to find out.
- What are you doing?

441
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:51,160
- Give me answers!
- What? Yeah, OK.

442
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:53,701
What? What? What do you want to know?

443
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:57,245
- Where am I?
- At your hotel, man.

444
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,375
You're at your hotel, honest.

445
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:03,295
I haven't even caught my plane.
What game is being played here?

446
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:05,875
No, no, man, you in Los Ángeles.

447
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:09,469
- You've landed right here in Los Ángeles.
- Liar!

448
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:13,092
Check with the hotel,
there's anybody you can ask.

449
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:15,179
The desk, the bellhop, anybody.

450
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:18,522
- They really will...
- Wait, you're right.

451
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:20,897
- OK.
- It's coming back to me now.

452
00:34:20,986 --> 00:34:23,691
- OK.
- I'm here on an assignment.

453
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,901
- Football. Super Bowl.
- Yeah, they're doing that.

454
00:34:26,993 --> 00:34:30,160
You can see the marquee. It's 1972.

455
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:37,667
The big game, yeah.

456
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:46,722
Well, sports fans,
there is no burrow for one of these teams.

457
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,726
Brownie?

458
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:54,683
Yeah, it's Blackie. What's the line?

459
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:58,065
Nine?

460
00:34:58,152 --> 00:35:00,525
Faffle's got it eight and a half.

461
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:02,820
Fuck it, I'm going the other way.

462
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:05,529
Yeah. And put me down for a dime.

463
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,240
Nickel defence. On the line of scrimmage.

464
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,038
Goes right, fades left...

465
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:13,244
Hey!

466
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,124
Ah!

467
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,753
One man between him and the goal line.

468
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:21,800
Ah!

469
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:26,596
Dr Thompson, Blast magazine.
Is my suite ready? I need supplies sent up.

470
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:31,145
They're coming out of the woodwork
for this game. Später, yeah.

471
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:34,982
I'm gonna need an IBM Selectric,
heavy duty,

472
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:37,275
a Xerox telecopier, the 516.

473
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:40,070
Teleco...

474
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:44,451
I'm also gonna need one of those
Sony cassettes, big mother, 1800.

475
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:47,573
- Big mother.
- Lots of white paper. Heavy bond.

476
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:50,785
- Heavy bond.
- Bic pens, medium point, blue.

477
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:55,673
Bic. Er, sir...

478
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:58,000
- Sir, please.
- Oh...

479
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:00,667
Ow! May as well get the room service order.

480
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:03,515
- How about three crab Louis?
- Three crab Louis.

481
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,016
- Quart of ice, lots of ice.
- Lots of ice.

482
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:13,065
Quart of mescal. And 16 grapefruit.

483
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:15,725
- You getting all this?
- 16 grapefruit.

484
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:19,654
- Sir, I'm going to need your identification.
- Sure.

485
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,901
Shit! Somebody's stolen my wallet.

486
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:30,455
- I know what I'm doing.
- Sir...

487
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:35,425
He must be a doctor.

488
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:52,312
Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.

489
00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:58,156
He's all yours.

490
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,533
Ah! Eureka! Nice work.

491
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,666
Ah, back to business.

492
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:11,123
Two-bedroom suite,
closer to the top the better.

493
00:37:11,216 --> 00:37:16,009
Oh, can you check the electrical outlets?
Gonna need a lot of power.

494
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:18,848
- 440 volts.
- 440 volts?

495
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:23,387
- Any problems, check with the magazine.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:26,937
Thank you.

497
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,065
Front, please?

498
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:31,861
Not too shabby, huh?

499
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,907
Mr Lewis's office.

500
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:39,952
May I ask who's calling, please?

501
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,907
Ah, oh, I see. Could you hold on one sec?

502
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:47,703
It's the hotel manager.
I think it's about Thompson.

503
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,179
Hello.

504
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:57,134
Yes, Mr Thompson is an employee of mine.

505
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:03,182
Why don't you just get to the point
and tell me what he wants?

506
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,060
No problem.

507
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:09,609
What was that last one?

508
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:11,737
A video recorder and a stereo?

509
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:14,901
No. That's out.

510
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:17,616
Tell him I said he doesn't need that.

511
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:22,452
Don't worry, I'll be checking with him
shortly. But I do appreciate the call.

512
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,372
Thank you.

513
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,271
He became a man...

514
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:46,314
the day of the greatest game ever played.

515
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:53,786
Everything he knew about decency and
morality, he learned that day in December

516
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,780
from Alan "the horse" Ameche.

517
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:59,408
Today in the Super Bowl
he would earn his wings.

518
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:04,379
A crowd had assembled,
a crowd of America's elite.

519
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,425
Toyota salesmen from around the country,

520
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,597
orientals and those suspected
of being orientals,

521
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:17,353
stacked on the 30 yard line watching him
sweat and wipe caked blood from his face.

522
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,060
The Gallo brothers, Ernest and Julio,

523
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,523
party guys who'd skinned a few Mexicans

524
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:27,986
and forced them to carry them on their
shoulders to the pregame tailgate parties.

525
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,911
The Pepsi and Coca-Cola
bottlers of America.

526
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:34,199
Coke adds life, it's the real thing.

527
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:39,164
Bombarded by missiles,
flying, flaming matchbook covers.

528
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:43,419
The waterheads from General Motors

529
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,464
in the top seats, getting the worst pollution.

530
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:51,098
All sorts of twisted motherfuckers there.
And who could this be?

531
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:54,470
What?

532
00:39:56,148 --> 00:40:01,274
All right, put him through, but no more
after this. I'm serious, I mean it.

533
00:40:02,697 --> 00:40:06,778
'Marty. I just found out
about an incredible story, a bizarre plot.

534
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:09,574
'Washington is trying influence the game.'

535
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:13,531
- Hunter, please.
- 'This could have far-reaching implications.'

536
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:17,956
- Soviets could be involved.
- 'I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of it.'

537
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:22,211
I don't know, this could take a few months,
I could run out of money fast.

538
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:23,927
Besides, I just got here...

539
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:27,382
- You just got there?
- 'Yeah, minutes ago.'

540
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,345
You left on Tuesday. Today's Saturday.

541
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:33,224
You too? The same mix-up
happened to me.

542
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:37,359
I thought it was Tuesday... Saturday,
everybody was here.

543
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:55,206
Room service!

544
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:57,586
I'll check on it. Hold on.

545
00:40:57,675 --> 00:41:00,510
What?

546
00:41:01,512 --> 00:41:03,754
What?

547
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:09,639
Hold on, somebody's here.

548
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,485
Come on in. Where the hell have you been?

549
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,457
You'll be safe here.

550
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,973
I'm on the phone.

551
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,643
Marty?

552
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:51,187
- 'I'm still here.'
- Yeah.

553
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:56,152
I may need some more money.
I'm entertaining in the room and it runs up.

554
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,113
'OK, OK, enough.'

555
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,738
Er, sit, sit, señor.

556
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:03,070
I got people from the consulate here.

557
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:05,999
'What has that to do with the Super Bowl? '

558
00:42:06,084 --> 00:42:09,168
- What the hell was that noise?
- 'What noise? '

559
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:13,250
Get the goddamn tap off the phone!

560
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:16,462
You think you're playing with children here?

561
00:42:22,226 --> 00:42:25,311
Are you OK now? Good.

562
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:29,940
'I OKed everything you asked for except
the stereo and the video recorder.'

563
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:33,645
- How am I gonna see the game?
- 'Ever heard of a press box? '

564
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:38,366
Shit, then you miss the slow-mos,
the instant replay, all that stuff.

565
00:42:38,453 --> 00:42:40,695
'I don't care about any replay.

566
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:46,032
'Thompson, are you hearing me?
I want 10,000 words by deadline Sunday! '

567
00:42:47,046 --> 00:42:49,122
You don't want any bogus journalism.

568
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,132
Not after your picture was in Newsweek
playing horsey.

569
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:54,923
Go long. El zono finale.

570
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,298
'I want 10,000 words, Thompson.'

571
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:00,598
Head for the sunset! Deeper, deeper!

572
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:03,553
'Do you hear me? '

573
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:09,143
You all right?

574
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:11,230
Oh, good.

575
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,407
Direct pressure is best. I'll get a Band-Aid.

576
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:18,076
We're getting some noise complaints
up on 20.

577
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,868
- We'll check it out, sir.
- Do that.

578
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:27,204
Excuse me. You guys,
come here for a minute, will you?

579
00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:28,709
- What's your name?
- Briggs.

580
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,425
- Danny.
- Blackie.

581
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,129
Tomorrow's Super Sunday,
I gotta get a super rest.

582
00:43:34,223 --> 00:43:38,470
You look like you know what you're doing.
Get down the hallway...

583
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:41,895
...and muzzle that fruitcake.

584
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:44,520
- I'll take care of it.
- This is for you.

585
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:47,231
- You're gonna take care of it?
- Yeah.

586
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:50,108
Fuckin' A, you will. Right over there.

587
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,488
No more calls, God damn it!

588
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:55,032
I want some discipline on that front desk.

589
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:58,288
Does the name Vince Lombardi
mean anything in this town?

590
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:00,866
Hollywood scum. All right.

591
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:04,127
Rose!

592
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:07,500
Rose, you turned it over, sorry. It's our ball.

593
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:09,716
Ángel, let's do it.

594
00:44:11,848 --> 00:44:15,715
Your conversions are gonna tell a story.

595
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,183
Er...

596
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,980
go down... behind the bar.

597
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,109
I'll look for you.

598
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,732
Right, she's in that Dallas flex.

599
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:33,242
Five-three! 58!

600
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,786
- 19 blue!
- Louder. Help him.

601
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,072
Hello?

602
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:39,575
Pork chop! Hut-hut!

603
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:42,502
Forced to scramble!

604
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:47,301
Touchdown!

605
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:49,507
Touchdown.

606
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:53,801
Hold it, come on.
I got a key here someplace.

607
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:57,180
- Just don't let him bullshit you.
- Hey.

608
00:44:57,273 --> 00:44:59,978
Don't worry about a thing. I got it.

609
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:01,977
Watch the linebacker.

610
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,739
Pick him up! Dah!

611
00:45:04,823 --> 00:45:07,658
- Shit.
- Briggs. Oh, Briggs?

612
00:45:08,494 --> 00:45:09,905
Briggs?

613
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:14,112
Brownie? Yeah, it's Blackie.

614
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:16,749
Did the price change?

615
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:20,167
I didn't sleep a wink since I spoke to you.

616
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:26,798
'Super Sunday. Dawn.

617

Still alive, still kicking.

Er, could I have another round?

627

- Of cocktails?
- Everything. Cocktails, food.

628
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,775
Super Sunday, you gotta store up energy.
Could go into sudden death.

629
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,102
Ah. Yeah.

630
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,194
Enjoying myself? I'm in a fucking nuthouse.

631
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:30,118
Sir, you can't come in here looking like that.

632
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:33,376
I'm the President of the United States

633
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:36,168
and I can do anything I want.

634
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:43,219
Hi, guy.

635
00:46:43,307 --> 00:46:46,890
Brownie, this you wouldn't believe.

636
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:49,017
All bets off, I'm coming home.

637
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,765
Hi. Sock it to me!

638
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:55,066
Fellow Americans. Ha-ha-ha.

639
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:59,282
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- There's one of them.

640
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:04,320
Oh, boy, Thompson,
you always knew this could happen.

641
00:47:09,513 --> 00:47:11,921
- Well?
- You look good.

642
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:17,226
Sock it to me.

643
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:22,732
- Does he want a menu?
- Cottage cheese and ketchup?

644
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:26,364
No, thanks, we're in... sort of a rush.

645
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:29,531
Thank God for that.

646
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:36,412
Lazlo. What happened to you?

647
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:39,751
Hey, man, I brought you a present, man.

648
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:41,878
Go ahead, try it on.

649
00:47:45,302 --> 00:47:48,138
Come on, hurry up. We gotta get moving.

650
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:50,974
- Moving?
- We got a lot of ground to cover.

651
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,345
- Let's get out of here.
- I can't get out of here.

652
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,144
- I can't go.
- Thompson, this is me. Lazlo.

653
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:03,102
I know. I saw you in the mask,
I said, "Hey, that's Lazlo."

654
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:07,776
- I'm here in the flesh.
- I'm sure there's a reason for that too.

655
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:10,989
- I've got a deadline to meet.
- Deadline?

656
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:16,324
- I gotta do this story.
- What? You're not a fucking sportswriter.

657
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,370
- Oh, that hurts.
- I don't see you for three fucking years

658
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:24,714
and you have the nerve to sit there
and tell me you got a deadline.

659
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:27,474
Now come on before I get pissed off.

660
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:33,975
Get your souvenir pennants here.
Dallas, Miami, we got 'em here.

661
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:36,603
Nothing good can come from this.

662
00:48:36,693 --> 00:48:38,935
- Relax.
- Relax?

663
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:42,030
You grabbed me
off an important assignment

664
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:44,785
to go on who knows what kind of freakout.

665
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:46,695
Excuse me.

666
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:49,494
There we go.

667
00:48:49,582 --> 00:48:52,868
Get your programmes.
I got programmes.

668
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,416
Get your pennants here.

669
00:48:58,383 --> 00:49:00,423
It's good weed.

670
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:03,927
I got caps,
I got Dallas Cowboy caps...

671
00:49:20,116 --> 00:49:23,817
Say, do you fellas like football?

672
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:25,322
Say what?

673
00:49:25,413 --> 00:49:28,331
I got a couple Super Bowl tickets here.

674
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:30,243
Let me see.

675
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,957
These look good. How much you want?

676
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,964
Who's talking sell? Let's talk trade.

677
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:40,463
- Trade?
- Yeah, say, er... that ticket for...

678
00:49:41,347 --> 00:49:43,139
that bottle of wine.

679
00:49:43,224 --> 00:49:46,095
That ticket... for that wine?

680
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:50,806
Good.

681
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,939
- Nice hat.
- That is a beauty.

682
00:49:53,027 --> 00:49:55,779
- I like the hat
- The hat for the ticket?

683
00:49:55,863 --> 00:49:58,651
- That's great.
- Seems fair.

684
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,153
Great.

685
00:50:00,243 --> 00:50:02,283
Here. You'll need these.

686
00:50:02,371 --> 00:50:05,574
- What are they?
- These'll get you into the press box.

687
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:09,035
- Press passes.
- Room keys.

688
00:50:09,128 --> 00:50:11,251
Good thinking.

689
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,708
Here. Go on up,
have a drink before the game.

690
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:17,209
- This your room?
- Yeah, all paid for.

691
00:50:17,304 --> 00:50:19,131
Thank you.

692
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:23,885
Have a nice Super Bowl Sunday.

693
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:25,805
You too.

694
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:33,318
Tickets, and passes, and a key?

695
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:43,248
- Some shit going down somewhere.
- Tough.

696
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,498
# Keep on chooglin', chooglin'

697
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,128
# Chooglin'... #

698
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,258
I tried to call you a few times.

699
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:59,388
Yeah, well, I moved out of town.

700
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:02,181
Yeah, consolidate your winnings, huh?

701
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,678
Yeah, be proud, man.

702
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:08,225
You're becoming a famous writer.
The famous Dr Gonzo.

703
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,937
I can't account for
how people deal with it, you know.

704
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:14,320
I've done OK. Shit...

705
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:16,947
You know what I really liked, though?

706
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:20,121
That column where you tried to find out
where I was.

707
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:23,790
You were missed, Lazlo, by a lot of people.

708
00:51:23,877 --> 00:51:26,416
Not by me, of course, but...

709
00:51:28,174 --> 00:51:30,582
I got a new approach now, a new plan.

710
00:51:31,344 --> 00:51:34,049
I wish you luck in your new endeavour.

711
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:38,765
# Keep on chooglin'

712
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:41,679
# Keep on chooglin'

713
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,563
# Keep on chooglin'

714
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:46,690
# Chooglin'... #

715
00:51:46,778 --> 00:51:48,817
# Chooglin', chooglin' #

716
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,709
- Come on.
- I got it.

717
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:08,004
Mm.

718
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:11,342
Come closer, man. Closer.

719
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,553
OK, there you go. Ah...

720
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,265
Phew!

721
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:18,021
You know, I'm an endangered species.

722
00:52:19,147 --> 00:52:22,397
Kind of like the buffalo.

723
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,524
Like, a lot of people thought I was dead,

724
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:33,198
but you don't write any postcards
when you're on the road to self-discovery.

725
00:52:33,287 --> 00:52:37,416
I mean, the journey to enlightenment
is a long trip

726
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,743
and that's the way it is, you know?

727
00:52:39,836 --> 00:52:43,917
You just keep going further and further
and deeper and deeper

728
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:47,424
into higher and higher realms
of consciousness.

729
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:51,719
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir, I think so.

730
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:54,595
You've been there too, huh?

731
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:58,471
- I think so, sir.
- Course he has. Look at his eyes.

732
00:52:58,565 --> 00:53:03,062
- I just don't pick up anybody hitchhiking.
- Yeah, yeah.

733
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:08,360
I have been completely reborn.

734
00:53:09,327 --> 00:53:11,486
I am a new man.

735
00:53:12,998 --> 00:53:15,869
- Nyuh!
- I've been to outer regions.

736
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:20,413
And I've walked with the king. You dig it?

737
00:53:20,506 --> 00:53:22,748
I have walked with the king!

738
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:26,710
I've stood on the mountain,
I saw all the earth, man!

739
00:53:26,805 --> 00:53:30,221
- It's all over myself here.
- And he talked back.

740
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:35,102
He talked back.
He said, "It's all right, man. It's all right."

741
00:53:35,189 --> 00:53:37,229
We were all right.

742
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:41,736
Well, this is all good news. Very comforting.

743
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:43,233
This is empty.

744
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:46,111
I think I'd like to get out pretty soon.

745
00:53:46,702 --> 00:53:48,362
Oh.

746
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:50,910
You don't wanna get out around here.

747
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:53,572
No, hey, we're your friends. Relax.

748
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,037
Lazlo...

749
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:00,342
you may have been wrong about him.

750
00:54:01,468 --> 00:54:04,007
He may not... fit in.

751
00:54:04,722 --> 00:54:07,213
How much do you think he knows?

752
00:54:07,308 --> 00:54:09,846
Enough to put us in personal danger.

753
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:18,899
Boy. That kid was sick.

754
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:22,737
- Why did you pick him up?
- He needed help.

755
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:28,330
He was out of his mind. What is with you,
picking up weirdos? I knew right away.

756
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:31,535
He could've done serious damage.

757
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:35,078
- I like to help people.
- He had a wooden hand.

758
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:39,423
I thought he was just tense.

759
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:48,477
'Mr Lewis? '

760
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:51,267
I'm sorry, there's no answer, Mr Lewis.

761
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:55,984
That's impossible. Just keep ringing.
I'm certain he's up there.

762
00:55:23,434 --> 00:55:25,759
Hello? Hello?

763
00:55:26,729 --> 00:55:29,399
Hunter? Hunter what?

764
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:33,317
'Ain't nobody doin' no huntin' up here, fool! '

765
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:37,354
'This is a party, not a safari! '

766

Is this the old Baby Face Nelson place?

779

You guys know American gangsters?

Homeboy to T1. Homeboy to T1.

781

You remember Billy?

782
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,925
He got paroled after three years.
He's joined our cause.

- Glad you could make it, man.
- I couldn't miss this,

when the old gang gets back for a hoot.

785
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:24,853
- I don't know how long I'm gonna stay.
- Don't worry, man.

786
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:28,562
As your ex-attorney,
I advise you not to worry.

787
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:32,606
Homeboy to T1. Homeboy to T1.

788
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:36,621
She's terrific. I met her in Vegas.

789
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:44,712
- Lazlo, it's Rojas, he's coming.
- Perfect.

790
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,919
- Right on schedule.
- Rojas?

791
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,095
Yeah, Rojas. Come on, everybody, let's go.

792
00:58:15,082 --> 00:58:16,826
Lazlo!

793
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:18,957
Compañero.

794
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:24,090
¿Como estás? Esto es Lazlo.

795
00:58:24,175 --> 00:58:28,589
Nos tiene los rifles, las pistolas,
las granadas, las bombas.

796
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,507
¡Todo lo que necesitamos!

797
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:35,433
Is this your new A party list?

798
00:58:35,521 --> 00:58:39,187
Odd-looking group.
Then you always did have strange friends.

799
00:58:39,275 --> 00:58:41,849
Associates. You are my friend.

800
00:58:41,945 --> 00:58:44,318
Oh, that's good to know.

801
00:58:44,406 --> 00:58:48,654
- Puedo?
- Whoa, whoa. Un momentito.

802
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:58,665
Para ti.

803
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:03,803
¡Mira lo que veo!

804
00:59:04,762 --> 00:59:07,336
¡Mira que belleza!

805
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:12,010
Pero yo nunca había visto
un ametralladora así!

806
00:59:12,103 --> 00:59:13,930
Mira!

807
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,110
You gave this man a gun?

808
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:22,771
Perfecto. Sí.

809
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:24,823
No.

810
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:27,447
Es como una mujer!

811
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:37,251
Playful little puppy, isn't he?

812
00:59:55,568 --> 00:59:58,439
Muy buenos rifle.

813
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,614
Muy fast.

814
01:00:10,918 --> 01:00:13,326
¡Pendejo!

815
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:17,289
Quite a staff you got here.

816
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:21,596
Cara tan linda, coño, ven acá.

817
01:00:23,265 --> 01:00:26,386
Un tequilita, un tequilita.

818
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:29,479
Lazlo, what kind of weirdness is that?

819
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:33,563
Look, man...

820
01:00:33,652 --> 01:00:39,157
We need you to write about our movement.
There's an airplane coming in later.

821
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:42,278
- Airplane?
- These people are our brothers.

822
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:45,573
They got a struggle and I wanna help 'em.

823
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:49,035
- You should be part of it.
- These are your brothers?

824
01:00:49,127 --> 01:00:52,045
This cheap imitation General Patton
out here?

825
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:57,292
I oughtta Mace the fucker for that cheap
trouncing he gave his buddy. Fuck you!

826
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:06,768
It's history, man.

827
01:01:06,855 --> 01:01:10,272
Guns, dope, armed insurrection.

828
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:13,232
Peasant land seizure.

829
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:14,732
Dig it.

830
01:01:14,822 --> 01:01:17,278
Ghost riders, anarchist prophets,

831
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:19,574
fire, blood...

832
01:01:19,661 --> 01:01:21,571
revolution!

833
01:01:22,331 --> 01:01:25,166
Oh, it's a grand, grand tale, Laz.

834
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:28,501
It's right up there with Gone With The Wind.

835
01:01:28,588 --> 01:01:31,624
I'm all for dope and goats, nobody's bigger,

836
01:01:31,716 --> 01:01:36,295
but, you know, crazed dope lawyer
turns gun-running revolutionary,

837
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:38,428
I'm pounding it up in my head

838
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:42,810
and I think you should take me back
to the hotel and I'll finish the story.

839
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:45,932
Don't give me this shit,
I'm counting on you.

840
01:01:46,024 --> 01:01:48,396
You gotta write a story. I need your help.

841
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:52,565
Lazlo, look out there,
these guys are piranhas with guns.

842
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:54,483
They stop their own.

843
01:01:54,575 --> 01:01:58,407
Hey, guns don't scare me, buddy.
I'm a weapons expert.

844
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:04,281
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

845
01:02:04,377 --> 01:02:06,417
Oh, no.

846
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:09,126
Oh, gee, what a mix-up. Sorry.

847
01:02:09,216 --> 01:02:10,841
Oh, my God. Jeez.

848
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:13,596
Billy, you wanna turn on the game?

849
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,052
See if there's a score, Bill, yeah.

850
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:22,436
'Half-time here at Super Bowl VI
with Dallas leading Miami only 10 to 3.

851
01:02:22,522 --> 01:02:28,478
'I say only because the seven-point margin
doesn't tell the dominance of the Cowboys

852
01:02:28,571 --> 01:02:30,979
'through the first 30 minutes.'

853
01:02:31,073 --> 01:02:34,609
'Dallas led by their brilliant quarterback,

854
01:02:34,702 --> 01:02:37,988
'by the brilliant running
of halfback Duane Thomas.'

855
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:41,332
- 'Hi, Momma! '
- 'Get him outta here! '

856
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:43,625
'I wanna say hi to Big Bertha... '

857
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:48,624
- 'Sir, you'll have to leave.'
- 'Do you see this fat fucker? '

858
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:23,918
Hey, man, I'm glad you're here.

859
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,932
Who's your favourite group?
The Stones or the Beatles?

860
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,692
'This is T1 to Homeboy. Over.'

861
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:49,649
- This is Homeboy.
- 'I am six miles east at 900 feet.'

862
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:55,785
Over there. Yeah, on that ridge.

863
01:03:55,876 --> 01:03:57,915
We see you, you're dead ahead.

864
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,710
Billy, light the runway.

865
01:04:37,296 --> 01:04:39,966
Truthfully now, have you done this before?

866
01:04:40,049 --> 01:04:42,837
Many, many times.

867
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,891
OK, everybody, let's go.

868
01:04:53,981 --> 01:04:58,276
Please! You can't leave your car here.
Give me your keys, I'll run it back.

869
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,401
Come on, come on.

870
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:03,985
It's your car, somebody's gonna steal it.

871
01:05:04,076 --> 01:05:06,947
¡Ándale, ándale!
Move it!

872
01:05:07,038 --> 01:05:10,621
Move it, pronto!
Get it in there, get it in there.

873
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,333
Put it in there.

874
01:05:12,418 --> 01:05:14,411
Partner.

875
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,380
Move it, come on! Move it!

876
01:05:19,468 --> 01:05:22,422
Vamos, muchachos. Let's go.

877
01:05:26,768 --> 01:05:28,511
Holy shit.

878
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:40,738
Come on!

879
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:44,904
- This guy a friend of yours?
- Grab the fuckin' box!

880
01:05:44,996 --> 01:05:47,036
Can I carry something?

881
01:05:47,124 --> 01:05:48,951
Yeah.

882
01:05:52,504 --> 01:05:54,544
Hey... whoa!

883
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:02,346
Come on! Hunter!

884
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:08,096
- Come on, man!
- Fascisti swine!

885
01:06:08,188 --> 01:06:10,858
Bastards! Playground strafers!

886
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,319
- This car is a classic!
- ¡Ándale!

887
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,654
Hey! Hey! Thompson!

888
01:06:20,035 --> 01:06:23,369
Red alert! Red alert!

889
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,513
I don't think we'll be doing this again, Lazlo.

890
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:04,451
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

891
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:15,053
Dr Thompson, where've you been?
We've been waiting for you.

892
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:17,676
- Come on. Are you OK?
- Quit whining.

893
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:20,435
- I... I was just...
- You've upset me already,

894
01:07:20,518 --> 01:07:23,092
calling me first thing...

895
01:07:23,188 --> 01:07:26,273
- Holy Jesus.
- No, we're going out there now.

896
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:29,609
I don't think so.
You've whipped them into a frenzy.

897
01:07:29,695 --> 01:07:33,396
- Only a fool would go in there.
- They really want to see you.

898
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:36,327
They probably mean business.
This isn't right.

899
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:39,745
Come on. I think it's gonna be all right.

900
01:07:39,831 --> 01:07:42,749
- You look just fine.
- I know I look great

901
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:45,919
- but I don't feel too confident.
- Stay right there.

902
01:07:46,005 --> 01:07:49,291
- I'll be right back. Stay right there.
- Well, er...

903
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:51,211
Gonzo! Gonzo!

904
01:07:51,302 --> 01:07:53,046
OK!

905
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:57,922
They got the real woodpeckers here today.

906
01:07:58,018 --> 01:08:01,886
I know you've been waiting a long time

907
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:05,185
but he's here, so you'll get him.

908
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:21,993
OK, quiet down, everybody.

909
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:24,956
OK, great.

910
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:29,796
OK, as you all know, Dr Thompson
is working on the campaign.

911
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:34,929
He's on a very tight schedule, so keep
the questions brief and one at a time.

912
01:08:35,017 --> 01:08:37,473
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Thompson.

913
01:08:51,452 --> 01:08:53,077
Me, me, me!

914
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,452
Let's start here.

915
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:58,992
- Er, Dr Thompson...
- Any questions? What?

916
01:08:59,086 --> 01:09:02,751
In your recent pieces about the candidate,

917
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,375
you're having difficulty
getting to see him. Why is that?

918
01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:09,091
Well, I think we keep different hours.

919
01:09:11,725 --> 01:09:17,099
Probably most of it, he calls me, I'm not in.
I return his call, he's out.

920
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:19,312
He calls back, gets my machine.

921
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,149
I call him back, he's under sedation.
It goes on.

922
01:09:23,237 --> 01:09:26,654
Cos I thought it had
something to do with this article

923
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:32,365
where you called him a treacherous hack
and a vermin-filled ex-wart healer

924
01:09:32,456 --> 01:09:37,533
who should be castrated so that his genes
aren't passed on to future generations.

925
01:09:43,343 --> 01:09:45,834
Did I say that?

926
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:49,595
Well, I must have meant it if I said it. So...

927
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:52,257
I owe him an apology or nothing at all.

928
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:55,390
If you get to see him,
what are you gonna say?

929
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:57,724
Well, er...

930
01:09:57,817 --> 01:10:02,029
I'm gonna tell him to wear brighter colours.

931
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,739
He, er...

932
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,570
Shut up. I'll talk.

933
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:12,155
Why do you think they gave me this?

934
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,085
Dr Thompson,
for those of us who are writers...

935
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,664
Oh.

936
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:20,967
Yeah? Those of us? Shall we raise
our hands so we know who we are?

937
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:25,844
Could you tell me if you thought drugs
and alcohol would make me a better writer?

938
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:28,803
That's a good question.

939
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:30,933
Let me see.

940
01:10:53,921 --> 01:11:01,087
In my case, I hate to advocate drugs
or liquor, violence, insanity, to anyone,

941
01:11:01,179 --> 01:11:03,468
but in my case it's worked.

942
01:11:03,557 --> 01:11:06,760
We have another question
right here.

943
01:11:06,852 --> 01:11:11,146
Dr Thompson, er, are you gonna write
any more articles about Lazlo?

944
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,440
Lazlo, my attorney?

945
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,445
No.

946
01:11:17,531 --> 01:11:20,567
- No, he's dead.
- How's that?

947
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:24,823
He hasn't been heard from for some time
and he's believed dead.

948
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:29,825
Well, it always seemed to me
that, er, he really didn't exist,

949
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,959
that he was a figment of your writing.

950
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:38,758
You couldn't invent someone like
Karl Lazlo. He was one of a kind, a mutant.

951
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:44,429
A real heavyweight water buffalo type.

952
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,556
Who could, er, chew his way through
a concrete wall

953
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:53,434
and spit out the other side
covered with lime and chalk

954
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:56,020
and look good in doing it.

955
01:11:56,115 --> 01:11:58,653
He, er, he was one of a kind, and, er...

956
01:12:20,559 --> 01:12:24,509
# Well, I'm here
Well, I'm ready

957
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:28,555
# For all these people to take this flight

958
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:32,601
# I wrote my song
and I brought my money

959
01:12:32,697 --> 01:12:36,362
# But I'm still on this plane tonight

960
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:48,663
# The people on the highways

961
01:12:48,756 --> 01:12:52,671
# All these strangers go with you too

962
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:56,629
# Are we free and are we ready?

963
01:12:56,724 --> 01:13:00,804
# We're always wrong... #

964
01:13:04,232 --> 01:13:08,526
- Hey, Dooley! When do I get the interview?
- I'll take care of you.

965
01:13:08,612 --> 01:13:11,185
You've been saying that for days, Dooley.

966
01:13:11,281 --> 01:13:13,903
I would appreciate it because I have to file.

967
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:18,655
The candidate is very interested in you,
he reads your clippings every day,

968
01:13:18,748 --> 01:13:20,788
I make sure he sees them.

969
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,500
- Dooley...
- Yeah?

970
01:13:29,134 --> 01:13:32,089
Excuse me.

971
01:13:32,179 --> 01:13:34,006
Ah!

972
01:13:36,309 --> 01:13:38,765
Thank you. Oh, hi.

973
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,680
Oh, excuse me.

974
01:13:41,898 --> 01:13:43,642
Excuse me.

975
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,025
- Somebody sitting there?
- Er, no.

976
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:52,531
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

977
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:13,884
They never search me. Honest face.

978
01:14:17,855 --> 01:14:20,393
Fortunate it's me and not some maniac.

979
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:22,772
You could raise some real hell with this.

980
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,989
Torture a stewardess, hold the pilot at bay,
slash all the wiring.

981
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:40,209
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

982
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:42,752
Lot of C in there, vitamin C.

983
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:48,261
Well, I get very greedy with my supplies
once we're airborne.

984
01:14:55,396 --> 01:14:57,852
Back on board the campaign special.

985
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:04,196
Just made the plane after a flock
of poisoned ravens dive-bombed my car.

986
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:08,279
The candidate is probably under sedation
in his compartment.

987
01:15:08,369 --> 01:15:13,197
Last night he was at the hotel pool
doing stunt dives for two cocktail waiters

988
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,533
who were skinny-dipping in the pool.

989
01:15:16,503 --> 01:15:19,919
Screamed, "Watch my cannonball,"
went high into the air,

990
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:22,047
landed right on his testicles.

991
01:15:22,134 --> 01:15:26,382
Be tough to watch his speech today knowing
his balls are the colours of the rainbow.

992
01:15:26,472 --> 01:15:29,260
OK, Thompson, up.

993
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:33,847
Special session with the candidate, I guess.
Watch my stuff and I'll share my notes.

994
01:15:33,939 --> 01:15:36,726
Bring your stuff, you're off the plane.

995
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:39,024
You can't throw me off.
I have the proper credentials.

996
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:41,188
I decide who goes on what plane.

997
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,326
From now on, you're on the zoo plane
with the technicians.

998
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:49,622
Dooley, let him stay. He's got
as much right to be here as any of us.

999
01:15:49,706 --> 01:15:52,376
Don't push your luck, Lisogor.

1000
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:56,789
This is a cruel and bitter defeat,
and one that I probably won't forget.

1001
01:15:57,715 --> 01:15:59,755
I'm not gonna worry about it.

1002
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:21,823
Would you like a beer?

1003
01:16:21,909 --> 01:16:25,954
# Oh, give me a home

1004
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:30,167
# Where the buffalo roam

1005
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:38,461
# Where the deer and the antelope play

1006
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:42,764
# Where seldom is heard

1007
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:46,977
# A discouraging word

1008
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:52,982
# And the skies are not cloudy all day... #

1009
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:58,656
In the event of sudden loss of cabin
pressure, oxygen masks will be released.

1010
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:03,157
- Hi.
- Wouldn't let you up there?

1011
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:05,572
A minor setback, that's all.

1012
01:17:05,665 --> 01:17:09,877
- Thank you, you're very sweet.
- Hut-hut! Hut!

1013
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:11,373
Ooh!

1014
01:17:34,698 --> 01:17:37,782
- You're Harris from the Post, aren't you?
- Right.

1015
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:40,739
That was nice stuff on the Florida primary.

1016
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:44,993
You were the only one who had
the blue collar vote on the button.

1017
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:47,871
- Incomplete.
- Is it always like this here?

1018
01:17:47,962 --> 01:17:50,584
It's usually worse. Everyone's getting up.

1019
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:55,716
Thank God I'm only on for one stop. I don't
know how my backup man can stand it.

1020
01:17:55,804 --> 01:18:00,016
It gets real ugly late in the day
when they start cooking.

1021
01:18:19,372 --> 01:18:22,492
Jesus, why do they have to make
so much noise?

1022
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:26,119
Hey, how about shutting up?
A little charity, huh?

1023
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,630
Hey, you don't look too good.

1024
01:18:31,135 --> 01:18:36,011
- My head feels like it's caving in.
- I had the same thing this morning.

1025
01:18:36,099 --> 01:18:38,305
You got some aspirin there?

1026
01:18:38,393 --> 01:18:42,391
These are prescription
but they'll take care of your headache.

1027
01:18:42,481 --> 01:18:44,639
They won't put me to sleep?

1028
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:46,228
Oh, no.

1029
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:48,857
They'll relax you, though, quite a bit.

1030
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,327
- Whoa!
- Jesus, who's flying this thing?

1031
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,911
Oh, one of the gang.

1032
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,212
One of these people?

1033
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:12,093
Several of us are qualified
but this guy hasn't had much experience.

1034
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:16,599
Listen, I think I'd like one of those,
if that's OK.

1035
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,141
Don't tell anybody where you got 'em.

1036
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:21,982
- I'll take two.
- Good, that's what I took.

1037
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:28,944
- Here.
- Ah, thanks.

1038
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:34,569
I never had any complaints
about the blue ones.

1039
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:37,408
Mmm.

1040
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,999
Listen to what Thompson's written.

1041
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:48,964
"The candidate,
and his crew of shameless enforcers,

1042
01:19:49,054 --> 01:19:51,628
"brought their weird act to Wisconsin,

1043
01:19:51,724 --> 01:19:56,517
"passing out free hits of black acid
to anyone who could stick out his tongue."

1044
01:19:56,604 --> 01:19:59,096
- Acid?
- "A truly remarkable way

1045
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:01,230
"of getting votes."

1046
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:13,361
Make way! Make way!

1047
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:17,992
Harris from the Post!

1048
01:20:18,587 --> 01:20:21,422
Is coming through!

1049
01:20:22,049 --> 01:20:25,882
Where is he?
Where is my friend Thompson?

1050
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:28,177
Thompson?

1051
01:20:32,144 --> 01:20:34,469
Thompson! Thompson!

1052
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:36,686
It's Harris from the Post!

1053
01:20:36,774 --> 01:20:41,520
# Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes

1054
01:20:41,613 --> 01:20:43,689
# And she's gone

1055
01:20:45,992 --> 01:20:50,904
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds!

1056
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:57,000
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds! #

1057
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:03,257
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds! #

1058
01:21:05,597 --> 01:21:07,424
Who's this?

1059
01:21:08,142 --> 01:21:10,764
Harris from the Post!

1060
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:15,097
It's my turn to fly!

1061
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:17,647
- Oh, jeez.
- Does he have a licence?

1062
01:21:17,736 --> 01:21:21,271
He's not instrument rated though.
I don't think he should.

1063
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:23,571
I feel... wonferdul.

1064
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:26,446
You're looking good. OK.

1065
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:30,998
All right, let's go have a cocktail.

1066
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:33,622
All right. Yeah, I told her about you.

1067
01:21:37,508 --> 01:21:40,794
We got an emergency here!
Swine, open the door!

1068
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:43,093
I'll be out in a second.

1069
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:54,523
All right, let me have your attention, please.

1070
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,148
Keep moving, just listen to me.

1071
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:02,446
The candidate will be speaking at the Loving
Care senior citizens centre at 12:45.

1072
01:22:02,535 --> 01:22:07,494
We will reassemble here at 2:30,
takeoff's at three o'clock. Don't get lost.

1073
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:10,703
Once again, the candidate...

1074
01:22:10,794 --> 01:22:14,709
...will be speaking at the Loving... Care
senior citi... zens centre...

1075
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:18,168
Excuse me, have you seen Mr Harris
from the Post?

1076
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:26,720
# Lucy in the sky with diamonds #

1077
01:22:26,812 --> 01:22:28,604
Mr Harris, what happened?

1078
01:22:28,689 --> 01:22:35,653
# Ah, Lu-u-u-u-u-ucy in the sky
with di-i-i-amonds #

1079
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:48,539
What's all this?

1080
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:50,668
Harris from the Post.

1081
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:54,259
How you doing, boys? Good to see you.

1082
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,645
Hiya, sir. Harris from the Post.

1083
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,406
Good to see you again.

1084
01:23:21,331 --> 01:23:23,371
Can I get anything for you, sir?

1085
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,534
How's the family, Harris?

1086
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:28,878
The family? Oh, that's bad news.

1087
01:23:29,882 --> 01:23:33,583
The screwheads finally came
and took my daughter away.

1088
01:23:33,678 --> 01:23:35,718
Let me ask you a question, sir.

1089
01:23:35,805 --> 01:23:38,806
What is this country doing for the doomed?

1090
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:44,682
There are two kinds of people
in this country.

1091
01:23:44,773 --> 01:23:46,398
The doomed...

1092
01:23:46,484 --> 01:23:48,192
and the screwheads,

1093
01:23:48,277 --> 01:23:53,734
savage tribal thugs who live off
illegal incomes, burrowed deep out there.

1094
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:56,862
No respect for human dignity.

1095
01:23:56,954 --> 01:24:00,370
They don't know what you and I understand.

1096
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,534
You ever play football, Harris?

1097
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:04,619
Yes, sir.

1098
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:07,797
Thank you, sir. I played in college.

1099
01:24:07,882 --> 01:24:11,750
They're gonna get your daughter too.
I've heard their rallies.

1100
01:24:11,845 --> 01:24:14,087
They like Julie, but Tricia...

1101
01:24:15,724 --> 01:24:18,679
And they really hate you, sir.

1102
01:24:21,481 --> 01:24:24,684
You know that one half
of the state senate...

1103
01:24:24,776 --> 01:24:28,228
of Utah... are screwheads?

1104
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:34,327
You know, I was never really
frightened by the...

1105
01:24:34,412 --> 01:24:35,906
bop-heads.

1106
01:24:36,664 --> 01:24:41,373
And the potheads with their silliness
never frightened me either.

1107
01:24:43,088 --> 01:24:45,377
But these goddamn screwheads...

1108
01:24:47,259 --> 01:24:49,003
they terrify me.

1109
01:24:58,897 --> 01:25:00,937
And the poor doomed,

1110
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:05,566
the young and the silly and the honest,

1111
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:09,440
and weak,

1112
01:25:09,534 --> 01:25:11,574
and Italians,

1113
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:15,077
they're doomed.

1114
01:25:15,165 --> 01:25:18,332
They're lost, they're helpless,

1115
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:21,455
they're somebody else's meal.

1116
01:25:21,547 --> 01:25:24,085
They're like pigs in the wilderness.

1117
01:25:26,761 --> 01:25:28,801
Come here, Harris.

1118
01:25:30,015 --> 01:25:31,842
Come here.

1119
01:25:32,768 --> 01:25:34,761
Fuck the doomed.

1120
01:25:43,154 --> 01:25:46,109
Move it along, no need to run.

1121
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:49,366
- Just get on the plane.
- Wait for me.

1122
01:25:49,453 --> 01:25:54,530
This is it, right up here. Take your
seats, we take off in a few moments.

1123
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,163
Hey, Dooley...

1124
01:25:58,797 --> 01:26:01,632
You wanna pick that up, take it with you?

1125
01:26:01,716 --> 01:26:03,626
Pick that up, take it with you!

1126
01:26:11,519 --> 01:26:14,306
Would you like a cocktail?

1127
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:18,686
Do you happen to have
two aspirin?

1128
01:26:25,409 --> 01:26:26,952
Holy shit.

1129
01:26:27,036 --> 01:26:29,076
Not here.

1130
01:26:41,594 --> 01:26:45,046
- Is this seat taken?
- No, sit down.

1131
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:49,926
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

1132
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,060
No, nothing is wrong.

1133
01:26:52,147 --> 01:26:55,517
I just thought maybe I'd forgotten
my medicine.

1134
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:58,397
Here it is. Everything's in order now.

1135
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:12,750
Say, uh... if anyone asks...

1136
01:27:13,796 --> 01:27:16,169
this seat right here is taken.

1137
01:27:16,257 --> 01:27:21,928
It's highly unlikely but I may have to flop
around in case I have one of my seizures.

1138
01:27:22,014 --> 01:27:24,719
Seizures?

1139
01:27:29,355 --> 01:27:31,182
Excuse me.

1140
01:27:34,694 --> 01:27:37,102
Oh, I'm sorry, this seat is taken.

1141
01:27:38,949 --> 01:27:41,108
- No, it isn't.
- But this man is...

1142
01:27:41,201 --> 01:27:43,693
- He's capable of seizures.
- Shh.

1143
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:47,412
That's better.

1144
01:27:48,918 --> 01:27:50,958
No, no, just relax.

1145
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:54,375
Good.

1146
01:27:56,385 --> 01:27:57,796
This is terrific.

1147
01:27:59,847 --> 01:28:03,133
No question,
you got something going here, Hunter.

1148
01:28:03,226 --> 01:28:06,346
Harris. My name is Harris.

1149
01:28:06,438 --> 01:28:09,190
Ooh, Harris, right, I got it.

1150
01:28:09,274 --> 01:28:11,232
Undercover, right?

1151
01:28:11,318 --> 01:28:15,612
- Maybe I should sit somewhere else.
- No, no, no, you're fine.

1152
01:28:15,698 --> 01:28:17,905
But... I don't wanna sit here.

1153
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:21,278
Trust me.

1154
01:28:21,371 --> 01:28:22,782
OK?

1155
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:27,785
So, man...

1156
01:28:27,878 --> 01:28:30,204
you surprised to see me?

1157
01:28:30,297 --> 01:28:32,124
You bet.

1158
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:36,380
You have no idea how much trouble
I had tracking you down,

1159
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:41,513
- all the zipping around you do.
- I got a nutty, nutty schedule, Laz.

1160
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:44,600
Yeah, well, anyway...

1161
01:28:44,688 --> 01:28:46,728
we got some business to do.

1162
01:28:48,025 --> 01:28:51,525
- We have business?
- Oh, yeah. Big business.

1163
01:28:53,114 --> 01:28:57,326
Now... Jesus, I got so much stuff here,
I don't know where to start.

1164
01:28:59,538 --> 01:29:01,864
This is it.

1165
01:29:01,957 --> 01:29:05,742
Land. Our land.

1166
01:29:05,837 --> 01:29:08,043
Acres and acres of it, man.

1167
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:10,171
Square miles of land.

1168
01:29:11,176 --> 01:29:13,465
- Well?
- Sounds good.

1169
01:29:14,388 --> 01:29:18,303
I'm gonna be in San Francisco Tuesday.
We should get together.

1170
01:29:18,392 --> 01:29:23,019
Hey, man, that's no good.
We gotta move on this now.

1171
01:29:23,106 --> 01:29:24,648
Look at this.

1172
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:29,609
- These guys you can trust, I trained 'em.
- Honest... honest faces, all of 'em.

1173
01:29:30,864 --> 01:29:33,782
Here. Look at this. Look at the body.

1174
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,658
She's down there waiting for you.

1175
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,411
I picked her out myself.

1176
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,417
Hey.

1177
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:48,665
This is Harris of the Post,

1178
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:53,089
er, experiencing extreme turbulence,
and we're still on the ground.

1179
01:29:53,181 --> 01:29:54,841
Holy Jesus.

1180
01:29:54,933 --> 01:29:58,183
Er, the forecast is for bad greasiness.

1181
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:00,678
Don't you understand, man?

1182
01:30:00,772 --> 01:30:04,272
This'll be like having our own country,
the two of us.

1183
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,610
It'll be like paradise, man,
like a fucking paradise!

1184
01:30:07,697 --> 01:30:12,240
You wise-ass son of a bitch. You're off
this campaign. Give me your credentials.

1185
01:30:12,327 --> 01:30:14,783
- Hold on.
- Give them to me right now.

1186
01:30:14,871 --> 01:30:17,197
Hey, calm down.

1187
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:21,205
Calm down? Who are you? Who is he?
Who is this fat clown?

1188
01:30:21,295 --> 01:30:23,584
- Fat clown?
- Oh...

1189
01:30:23,673 --> 01:30:27,374
Yeah, fat clown.
Do I have to repeat myself all the time?

1190
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:32,008
You psychotic, you've done it to me again.

1191
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:35,266
It's for your own good.
You don't belong here.

1192
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:37,060
Ooh, look out.

1193
01:30:38,523 --> 01:30:41,061
It's just a drill, just a drill. Stay down.

1194
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:44,271
- Dooley, are you all right?
- Thank you.

1195
01:30:44,362 --> 01:30:46,106
Dooley, heads up.

1196
01:30:48,784 --> 01:30:50,611
Stay back!

1197
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,456
How do you stop this thing?

1198
01:31:01,423 --> 01:31:04,128
It's stuck. What the hell?

1199
01:31:04,218 --> 01:31:07,836
Agh! It wasn't, you swine!
You know it wasn't stuck.

1200
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,302
Oh, my God.

1201
01:31:10,391 --> 01:31:12,218
Back there, whoo!

1202
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:29,117
Oh, that was great, man.
Just like the old times.

1203
01:31:29,204 --> 01:31:32,988
- Jesus.
- Don't worry, we'll write a new story.

1204
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:36,250
You are a menace to yourself
and those around you.

1205
01:31:36,336 --> 01:31:41,248
You can't stay on that plane, you'll dry up.
You're a creative man, a writer.

1206
01:31:41,926 --> 01:31:44,049
It did take a while to rile them up.

1207
01:31:44,137 --> 01:31:47,423
They're not your people.
I'm your people, man.

1208
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:50,682
We're right on schedule. Truck's over here.

1209
01:31:50,769 --> 01:31:53,973
- I'm not coming.
- You're not coming?

1210
01:31:54,064 --> 01:31:56,556
I can't, you're insane, you're a maniac.

1211
01:31:56,651 --> 01:31:58,857
You're fortunate I haven't turned you in.

1212
01:31:58,945 --> 01:32:01,401
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

1213
01:32:01,489 --> 01:32:06,615
- I got this organised. Look at it.
- There's nothing there. It's rocks and dirt.

1214
01:32:06,703 --> 01:32:09,621
- That's the idea. We'll build.
- Build what?

1215
01:32:09,707 --> 01:32:12,827
You already live in the land of the weird.

1216
01:32:12,919 --> 01:32:15,955
Fuck, man, you're a writer.
Use your imagination.

1217
01:32:16,047 --> 01:32:21,172
- All right. Oh, there's buildings there.
- We'll build a goddamn paradise!

1218
01:32:21,261 --> 01:32:23,799
Our own place, you and me.

1219
01:32:23,889 --> 01:32:26,594
We got land, we got dope, we got women.

1220
01:32:26,684 --> 01:32:29,056
What kind of women would go there?

1221
01:32:29,145 --> 01:32:31,683
- That's not it, man.
- I'm not coming.

1222
01:32:31,773 --> 01:32:35,059
You gotta be my partner,
like it's always been, man.

1223
01:32:35,151 --> 01:32:37,191
Fifty-fifty.

1224
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:39,319
Yeah, but I'm not coming.

1225
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,784
It's blowing away!

1226
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:47,540
Hey, come on, help me.

1227
01:32:47,624 --> 01:32:49,451
Hunter, come on.

1228
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:54,882
You're my friend. Help me. It's gonna be
great, man. It's gonna be paradise.

1229
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:28,035
Hot damn.

1230
01:33:28,919 --> 01:33:31,161
So much for the facts.

1231
01:33:31,255 --> 01:33:34,459
Bronco, listen to this, tell me what you think.

1232
01:33:37,429 --> 01:33:42,008
"Well, I guess if I had to swear
one way or another,

1233
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,852
"I'd say Lazlo wasn't insane.

1234
01:33:44,937 --> 01:33:47,309
"He just had very strange rhythms.

1235
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:51,476
"But he stomped on the terror.

1236
01:33:51,569 --> 01:33:53,609
"Lord Buckley said that.

1237
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:59,280
"It's hard to say he got what he deserved...

1238
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:03,989
"because he never really got anything."

1239
01:34:10,549 --> 01:34:14,167
"At least, not in this story,

1240
01:34:14,261 --> 01:34:17,927
"and right now this story is all we have."

1241
01:34:25,565 --> 01:34:28,685
Come on, Bronco, we're celebrating.

1242
01:34:31,447 --> 01:34:35,741
Come on, the story is finished, man,
don't get weird on me now.

1243
01:34:43,502 --> 01:34:45,541
To better days, huh?

1244
01:34:59,686 --> 01:35:02,059
A close second, Bronco.

1245
01:35:07,612 --> 01:35:09,439
"It's sad.

1246
01:35:10,907 --> 01:35:13,363
"But what's really sad is...

1247
01:35:13,451 --> 01:35:15,907
"it never got weird enough for me.

1248
01:35:17,581 --> 01:35:21,449
"I moved to the country
when the boat got too crowded.

1249
01:35:21,544 --> 01:35:24,296
"Then I learned that President Nixon

01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:29,422
"had been eaten by white cannibals
on an island near Tijuana

01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:31,551
"for no good reason at all.
