1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,111
Oh, baby! Yes!
I give you sex day.

2
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,990
But you do not deserve it.
I'm so naughty.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,618
When should I fuck you harder.

4
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:29,998
Be as good! Taste my thunder!
Yes!

5
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:35,254
Do you like it?
Yes! Give it to me, Derek!

6
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:40,218
More!
Like my rock hard cock?

7
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:47,100
I like to have your
baby creates inside me. Yeah, baby.

8
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:53,482
I'll do the ovaries so tender.
I do not respect you, bitch.

9
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:57,319
But there! How filthy am I?
So dirty.

10
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:01,615
So unclean that dad must punish you.
Go to it, baby!

11
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:10,583
Excuse me.
No, it's perfect, you little bitch!

12
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,795
Excuse?
Do not you like to be my bitch?

13
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,172
Do something about it, then.
Okay.

14
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,135
Rice me.
What the hell is this?

15
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:23,597
Derek. I'm so ugly mouth.
Okay.

16
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,856
Like what?
Samantha.

17
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:36,361
Like it, Samantha?
Insert it into.

18
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:40,824
Where? It is physically impossible.
Run Luther up my ass, Derek.

19
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:45,954
You call the Luther?
Please, Derek. I'm so close!

20
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:48,874
Bible studies, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,214
What the hell, Derek?
What the hell? Yeah, what the hell?

22
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:58,801
I was so close and you know
how long ago it was the last.

23
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:03,014
We can run again for a while.
You said that the border went on the ass.

24
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:07,435
There are so vanilla.
Vanilla is a classic taste.

25
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,190
I mean seriously, Derek.
I still love you.

26
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:16,695
If I can not satisfy you,
then there is a big problem.

27
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:23,119
I give you free cards for tomorrow.
Exemption card? There is nothing like that.

28
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,496
Jo.

29
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:31,336
It does. Let loose and
let things get crazy and strange.

30
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,673
It's the bachelor party is for.
Crazy and strange?

31
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:38,051
You've never tried.

32
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:47,520
Come on, I know you'll love it.
Ever since we met, I visst-

33
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:53,484
That you were incapacitated solved bomb of
sexual energy ready to explode.

34
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:57,447
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

35
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:01,702
You must let loose, for our sake.

36
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:07,416
Be mad, use drugs, get drunk,
fuck bitches. It is your mission.

37
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:12,755
Oh fuck bitches?
Yes. For my sake, please.

38
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,633
Okay.

39
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:19,721
I will.

40
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,634
Hello, Amanda! Hey, Derek. Derek?

41
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:03,392
What is it with Derek?
We have a deal.

42
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,563
And that man will I
you must ensure that it works.

43
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:11,985
Ok ...
Make sure he has fun.

44
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,988
That he has a lot of company.

45
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,408
I give Derek exemption card.

46
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,829
Is this a trap?
No.

47
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,873
Wait in the car, Derek!

48
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:29,086
Adrian, how long
have you been Junior Partner?

49
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,840
Three years, five months and 22 days
without including weekends and overtime.

50
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:39,014
Obtain Derek sex, then you will

51
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:45,187
Promoted me?
Do you know when I got an orgasm last?

52
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,073
Is this okay for Derek?
Derek is Derek.

53
00:04:56,407 --> 00:05:00,328
This can save our relationship.
I can not force him.

54
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,541
I certainly will not fuck him.
You do not.

55
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:10,005
Please. I know that you take
of him. Take care of me too.

56
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,301
All right, I do it.
Good boy.

57
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,929
Turn about.

58
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:22,518
Who's the boss?
You're the boss.

59
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:26,856
You must mean it.
You're the boss!

60
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:30,527
boys,

61
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,337
I know what you talked about.
I will not do it.

62
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,051
Doing what?
You know.

63
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,563
What? It does not happen.

64
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:10,319
Do you really implement this?
Yes, with the bachelor party.

65
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:15,867
Absolutely.
Yes ... bachelor party.

66
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,128
Are you sure about this, Mitchell?

67
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:30,215
Sue, you can trust me
for I do.

68
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:34,678
Remember
that if you know a desire, so ...

69
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,348
Go down on your knees and pray?

70
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:45,732
It's them.
They make you well not gay again?

71
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:51,947
I do not know.
You must be strong for my sake.

72
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:58,913
You are of my eye.
My little pumpkin.

73
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:04,794
My little pumpkin pie.
Will I be your pumpkin latte?

74
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,214
Medium.

75
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,198
Lord, watch over him.

76
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,124
Mitch, what the hell are you wearing?
Not one word from you, bitch.

77
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,711
Was it Sue?
Yes, you know how many girls ...

78
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:48,007
... who will fuck gay out of you?

79
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,567
Relax, hussy.

80
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:15,369
Mitch has brought cosmos!

81
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,169
So wet it was here.
Mitch, I've always loved you.

82
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:28,007
Sue, so nice.

83
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:52,534
It's bullshit and you know it.
Alright.

84
00:08:54,911 --> 00:09:00,918

86
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:09,009
Yes.
What the hell is wrong with you?

87
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:12,054
What do you mean?
You've got a gift.

88
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:16,225
Fun that you say it, girl.
I have to call Frank.

89
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,645
Frank?

90
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:28,739
Yes, he comes and pays for everything.
Why Frank?

91
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:35,246
Do not stop, girl. Wait a little.

92
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:41,252
Adrian! How is the drive?

93
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:44,589
Good, it is about two hours left.
You should have flown.

94
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:49,177
Nothing is better than flying.
Do not do it.

95
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:55,517
When do you think you are in the hotel?
Wait. When we land?

96
00:09:56,977 --> 00:10:00,189
About half an hour.
Do not stop without me.

97
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,359
Plane lands in half an hour.

98
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:08,823
Okay, top.
I'll call back.

99
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:12,035
Get it back.

100
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:19,001
Sorry, but what can I say? I am
a rebel, I do not follow the rules.

101
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:25,841
God, I should ... Now there
Time for your flyunderholdning.

102
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,391
OMG ...

Captain has turned on belt sign. we
begins the approach to Las Vegas ...

104
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,200

105
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,038
You are shaved, I love you.
... And locked.

106
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:57,333
OMG ...

107
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:03,006
We in staff will thank you
chose to fly with us ... God!

108
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:07,260
Why, Frank?
Amanda invited him, they are friends.

109
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:11,724
Yes, they are friends. "They dated".
Who is Frank?

110
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:15,561
For he sounds cute out.

111
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,742
Focus, this being the best
weekend ever. Vegas, baby!

112
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,620
Yes, damn.

113
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,819
Look at the place, it took hours
to find it. Blackjack, poker ...

114
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:07,658
Gentlemen, welcome to Vegas.
As if we had never been here before.

115
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:12,538
I've never been here before.
Quiet, it's what you say here.

116
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:18,253
It is a kind tradition.
Armed bandits!

117
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,801
Is he gay?
It's complicated.

118
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:28,097
It need not be.

119
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,268
There he is!
What is it? Come, kjekking.

120
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,940
Do not hug me.
Looks good. Pilates? Yes, it is.

121
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:42,111
So how did Amanda it?
Still as crazy in bed?

122
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:45,115
Has he told?
Amanda and I used to fuck.

123
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,120
Please, Frank.
The wound I know you? I'm kidding only.

124
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:54,583
Put your hands up.
Now I take you. Come, boys.

125
00:12:55,584 --> 00:13:00,589
Tonight is savage and wrong.

126
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:03,092
Nicely!

127
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:36,336
Thousand dollars ... no problems.

128
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:44,803
Gentlemen. Welcome to the suite.
God, look at the view!

129
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:49,767
Should he do it everywhere?
Take it easy. What is his problem?

130
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:55,940
Guys, save it for later.
Shots, we gotcha shots. Mitchell!

131
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:00,612
Now we started. Listen, motherfuckers.

132
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:08,245
Tonight there is not the word no
in vocabulary.

133
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:13,417
This is starting to be too much for me.
Derek, just because you marry ...

134
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:17,088
... You do not get your balls cut off.
What the hell do you mean by that?

135
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:20,842
That night takes us where it wants!

136
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:29,851
Ok, for one night we all
probability forget. Cheers.

137
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:49,455
Frank, are you ready for tonight?
I have a surprise for Derek.

138
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:53,668
Really?
Yes.

139
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,631
Want to see?

140
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:09,894
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's just ecstacy. Good shit.

141
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:15,400
Amanda said that he probably was tense.
And I heard about you little plan.

142
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:19,863
He should get one as soon as evening
get started, what it will do.

143
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,616
In more than one way.
What?

144
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:28,122
Go to hell!
Measure eleven.

145
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,590
What?
Damn, two o'clock I meant.

146
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,166
Okay, collection. We need to get them here.

147
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,005
Let them have their bachelor party.
No, no way.

148
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:19,885
This I do. I go there
with someone like having shaken it.

149
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:25,099
Mitch, no.
Take it easy, do not you trust me?

150
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:31,105
It's not about trust. we let
them chilling bit before we turn to.

151
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:36,778
Wrong. This I do. I bid
them drinks, then it is resolved.

152
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:41,074
How do you know that they will be checked?
All girls want it.

153
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,370
There are four girls in a bathing hut.
Where is your testicles, man?

154
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,458
I think that there is some sleskt.
Listen. A wise man once said:

155
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,963
Can not they handle us as bad,
they deserve us not as the best.

156
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:58,510
Was not that Marilyn Monroe?
Fun that you noticed it.

157
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:06,977
Too late. No chance tonight.
That is what happens when you lose focus.

158
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:11,941
Calm down, Frank.
That's how it works.

159
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:18,698
Hello, boys.
We've been looking for you everywhere.

160
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,662
We thought that we would meet here.
No, idiot. Come on.

161
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:36,216
Thank you saved us.Thanx By Nikul pipariya
They were real idiots.

162
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:39,011
No problems, girl.
I'm Amber.

163
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:45,101
This is Casey to marry.
Sienna, bridesmaid and Tatiana.

164
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:50,565
I called Adrian, this is Mitchell.
Frank and groom Derek.

165
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,235
Hello, nice to meet you.

166
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,283
Shots?
Kind, but it's not necessary.

167
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:03,454
Nothing stops him,
then let him bid you on drinks.

168
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:07,416
Speaking of drinks, refills?

169
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:13,298
So what are you doing tonight?
Wish I knew.

170
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,510
Adrian and Frank keeps it secret.
It sounds mysterious.

171
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:23,183
Yes, and it scares me.
I'm back.

172
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,524
Where do you come from?

173
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:36,322
LA.
Cult.

174
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,994
Cult.

175
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,542
Shit.
Well done, idiot.

176
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,463
Do not blame me.
It's okay. We are here, what?

177
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,842
Just go there and say something.
What should I ...

178
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,386
Amateurs.

179
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:04,352
Ladies. Tonight .... let me guess.
Dinner and Thunder Dicks?

180
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:10,609
How did you know?
It is a common stag parties.

181
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,363
Australian hunker.
Not that I blame you.

182
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:18,784
Okay, what would you have done instead?
Velvet Atheneum.

183
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,453
There is a strip club.
And?

184
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:26,959
You get much more fun with us
there than at Thunder dicks.

185
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:33,341
You see, Velvet Atheneum
is ... wild. Unanticipated.

186
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:38,180
You may also receive look sausage.
Sausage?

187
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:43,602
Yes, underlivsvesler,
shells clubs, taco clamps.

188
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:47,940
Thunder Dicks has wrapped meat.
Frank, how do you know?

189
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:53,780
Velvet Atheneum is special.
Up there, only ladies.

190
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:57,200
So much sausage.

191
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:02,122
Sausage sounds pretty fun out.
Wait a little.

192
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:06,001
We have them.
We have everything plans.

193
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,838
Let them have their own evening.
What are you doing, Frank?

194
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,424
Dinner and Thunder Dicks? So common.

195
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:15,428
You say it just because he said it.
Was not such a fucking wimp!

196
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:19,932
We go to the strip club anyway,
what makes it that they are with us?

197
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,478
Two stag parties.
How sweet is that?

198
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:26,273
It sounds a bit wild.
Maybe you're right.

199
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:29,609
It does not affect our night.
Clear that I am right, kukkhode.

200
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,739
We do not know them even.
See, they look so harmless out.

201
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,575
I'm on it.
Even Mitch the Bitch is on.

202
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:39,662
You have no idea.
They are so gracious.

203
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:44,542
Look how hard they try.
And it would keep idiots gone.

204
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,552
Why are they like that?
Derek, are you sure about this?

205
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,847
Is this what you want to do?

206
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,061
Why not? It suffers a bit dangerous.
Yes!

207
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,856
Tatiana?
Sure.

208
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:14,282
So, boys. We are with.
Good, we thought that you should say no.

209
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,952
I'm so excited!

210
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:23,458
Come over for drinks afterwards.
What a wonderful night out!

211
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:36,097
Guys, I know we said yes and that,
but we should do it here?

212
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:40,643
What?
This with them. We need us.

213
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:45,357
Who cares, they invited us.
They ask literal about it.

214
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,985
Are you afraid
to fuck someone tonight?

215
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:52,031
Hey.
Hello, boys.

216
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:54,825
Come in.

217
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,500
Hello, boys.
For a nice suite.

218
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:10,383
You must wait. Amber and Tatiana
is not clear, then turn you down.

219
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:14,972
Come, Mitchie. Choose our dresses.
We need a gays smaksråd.

220
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:17,516
What is that accent?
Russian.

221
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,188
Delightful. This will be fun.

222
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:41,333
OMG, Tatiana.
The dress fits you excellent.

223
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:46,088
Do you think?
Yes, your breasts are great in it.

224
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:52,095
OMG, I'm so envious of
tits yours. Mitchie, they are not nice?

225
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:55,557
It's not my thing, cutie.
Interest objectively.

226
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,727
Not something one real push-up bra
would not do even better.

227
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,605
Good point. Know them.
Excuse?

228
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,487
Fine.
Please ...

229
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,663
That yes. Good boy.
Soft and robust.

230
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:22,252
Fine breasts.
Come on, they're perfect.

231
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:29,885
Amber, then. You are much more beautiful than I am.
You've flawless skin.

232
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:35,224
It is not true.
Jo.

233
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,352
You are perfect.
No.

234
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,563
What is happening?

235
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:53,034
Sienna? Thank you.
Why?

236
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:56,872
For that you went with this.
You were clearly against it ...

237
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:00,793
... But we have to have fun.
I just want Casey to have fun.

238
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:03,671
We can also have fun.

239
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:11,679
There we signal our.

240
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:40,835
Here it is.
Velvet Atheneum.

241
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,674
This place has something for everyone.

242
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:48,010
I'm so hard now.

243
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:51,639
Here we are.

244
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,601
Gentlemen come.
Ladies, this road.

245
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:03,568
Where do you think you should?
Yeah, Mitch. Have fun up there instead.

246
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,822
Yes, fun with your girlfriends,
your damn rævpirat.

247
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,328
Hell!

248
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,835
OMG ...

249
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:26,281
Hi, I'm Providence.
Hey, Derek.

250
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:32,413
Nice to meet you, Derek. will
go to Champagne room with me?

251
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:38,210
It is not.
Yes, he would like to go there and have fun.

252
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:42,090
He's just a little shy.
Providence, give my friend ...

253
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,927
... one of everything. I'll pay.

254
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:54,937
When he comes back,
has metamorphosis his begun.

255
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:02,319
I wonder how it goes
Mitch up there with the ladies.

256
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,911
Too much dick there.

257
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:19,755
Enjoy it.
I have so much fun!

258
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:27,346
So what do you want me to do?

259
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:31,559
What you normally do?

260
00:28:04,094 --> 00:28:09,015
Like my body?
You are fighting beautiful, yes.

261
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:23,072
I can not do this.

262
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:28,786
Let me guess, a stag?
Excuse me.

263
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:34,709
You are an alright kid.
She must be awesome.

264
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:42,301
Here, purchase a drink and make
to give your friends a thumbs up, okay?

265
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,348
Thank you.

266
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:57,359
OMG ... That there is too much dick.

267
00:28:58,276 --> 00:29:00,904
I want a drink.
I'm going with.

268
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:06,952
Thank you.

269
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:10,831
We go and look at her.
She has huge breasts.

270
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:20,842
I'm here, but thanks anyway.
Come on, Casey. Let's have fun.

271
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,932
I have,
but I need a little sausage break.

272
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,435
Can we stop calling it that?

273
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:36,150
Come on, it's your big night.
Yeah, that's it.

274
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,407
See, that's Derek. Derek!

275
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:49,915
Perfect, I'm sitting here and talking with
him while having fun so we'll see next.

276
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,210
Okay.
Cheers.

277
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,263
Shit.
Damn cardboard call.

278
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,017
You are angry because
Thunder dicks, what?

279
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:12,439
Let me buy you a drink.
No thanks, you've done enough.

280
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:17,402
Or not.

281
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:38,174
Seaman, you can fix a drink?
Yes, Captain.

282
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:43,346
Vodka with tranebærsjus.
Can you be more stereotypical?

283
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,851
Excuse?
A gay ordering vodka cranberry?

284
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:52,398
But ... I'm not gay.
That's the point.

285
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,694
I do not understand.
I do it to approach girls.

286
00:30:56,986 --> 00:31:00,865
So they use me
as a kind of sexually project.

287
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:05,745
A sexprosjekt? Wow.
You are a real idiot.

288
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:12,127
Yes, one can question it.
A gray area, but layers drink now.

289
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:17,383
For your information, I like
whiskey with water, and I'm gay.

290
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,888
No, I'm sorry. I did not mean ...
No, of course not.

291
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,475
I'm not homophobic or anything.
Why I got that impression?

292
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,603
I have many friends gays
hanging in my home.

293
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:33,024
Is that true?
Good, then I make your drink, okay?

294
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:54,422
Be careful, they are properly strong.
I like them strong.

295
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:58,426
Can you keep up with this?
Excuse me.

296
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:00,929
Thank you.

297
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:05,267
It's wet my pants now.
Morn, buddy.

298
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:11,816
Who are the lucky type?
Derek.

299
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:17,405
There are rumors that he is busy.
You can not get him.

300
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:20,867
What is it? Vodka cranberry? Cult.

301
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:30,919
So it was Mitchell, what?
Yes, we met earlier.

302
00:32:31,795 --> 00:32:35,841
Exactly. What the two of ...

303
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:41,472
... goes out, pull some fresh air
and talk a little.

304
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:45,977
Yeah ... no.

305
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:49,856
Another time?
Maybe, I guess.

306
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:54,903
You are a bit close.
I can get closer.

307
00:32:55,237 --> 00:33:00,034
I do, baby. Where should he?
Okay, this does not feel so good.

308
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:04,121
Good, another time then.
Another time ...

309
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,876
Bartender! Give me a whiskey with water.

310
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:13,840
I've never been on a
strip club before. Dad was against it.

311
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:18,553
Here's a wedding present for you.
And where is mine?

312
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:21,807
It seems as if
I bet all the ladies on drinks?

313
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,393
It's ok, we can share.

314
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:30,024
No, I am pure from sexual
transmitted diseases and stuff.

315
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:34,237
I'll go up and look at men
with real balls.

316
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:40,494
Sexually transmitted diseases?
Not that it matters.

317
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:45,999
We are engaged.
No, we are not engaged.

318
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,795
I know it,
I just think that you are safe.

319
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:57,011
One can not be too sure.
Cheers to that.

320
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:04,769
So tell your husband.
Boslov?

321
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:08,648
He's a really good guy
when getting to know him.

322
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:12,611
What does he do?
He is an entrepreneur.

323
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:16,991
He has some clubs and travel a lot.

324
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:19,910
He does not like to talk about it.

325
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,008
How did you meet?
On his club a few months ago.

326
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,596
He asked if we wanted to dance
and refused to hear an answer.

327
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:45,730
You get him next time.

328
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:49,692
He knows what he wants.
Yes, he takes good care of me.

329
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:53,780
The best bachelor party ever.

330
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:03,165
Allows that you met a good guy.
Exactly. He's a good guy.

331
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:07,753
One must keep on the good.
Yeah, cheers for that.

332
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:10,214
Cheers.

333
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,601
So how is your prospective bride?
Amanda.

334
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,979
There are American.

335
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:33,113
Yeah, she's amazing. As Boslov.
She knows exactly what she wants.

336
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:44,209
I knew I wanted to marry me then
I was 30 and Amanda are good for it.

337
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,421
She fits into the plan.
Absolutely.

338
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:55,929
As you said, one must stick to something
good. One does not just younger.

339
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:04,564
I feel completely.

340
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:27,546
Yes, do so it rains on me.
Who is your father?

341
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:35,764
Was not that sexy, Mitchie?
Yes, so much sausage in the face.

342
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:38,308
Kill me now, girl.

343
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:43,438
Now I will have a lapdance.
Sure you will.

344
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:47,693
Your hussy.
What I give you one?

345
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:52,031
Rain on me, girl.

346
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:54,617
I have a better idea.

347
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:10,008
Tell me, man. Are they a good couple?
Excuse?

348
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,720
Come on, you can tell me.

349
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:16,015
Derek is happy,
and it is the most important.

350
00:37:16,265 --> 00:37:21,229
Tull. You know that the answer is no.
And?

351
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:26,317
He's your best friend.
Yes, but I do not decide.

352
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:30,447
I support him no matter
what I think. You then?

353
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:34,743
No way. Casey commits
a big mistake. She knows him hardly.

354
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:38,580
And yet here we are.
Yes, we do.

355
00:37:39,915 --> 00:37:42,918
Thank you for talking with me.

356
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,298
Come on, there's more to do in Vegas
than mope at a strip club.

357
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:51,553
Shall we grab the other and pull?
Very happy.

358
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:56,057
What about strippers, coke and hookers?
If it makes you happy then.

359
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:00,520
This money is to you.
Money for you.

360
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:05,025
OMG ... I think
that we met before.

361
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,738
Frank, we're leaving.
Go to hell!

362
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:12,575
I mean, seriously, come on.
Getting Providence join?

363
00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:16,246
Hello.

364
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:22,043
No, Providence must work, what?
I can come after my second job.

365
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:26,715
She is an angel, Adrian.
A fucking angel, god ...

366
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:31,220
Have you seen Mitch?
Yeah, he's over there.

367
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:42,398
How the hell ...

368
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:50,657
I really like him. He is wild.
What do you think, Providence?

369
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:55,245
I think he has some dark secrets
that can give him major problems.

370
00:38:56,914 --> 00:39:01,335
As I said, she is an angel!
Hands.

371
00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:04,464
Excuse
but I can not help it.

372
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:09,677
All together. Mitch, we go.

373
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:15,726
Frank, I mean seriously. Come on.
I can not find Casey and Derek.

374
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,228
What?

375
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:23,818
Sorry, we miss one prospective bride
and grooms. He is 1.90 and slim.

376
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:27,905
She is 1.80, has short brown hair
and looks like a budding bride.

377
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:33,203
I saw their friends. They were away
and fucked almost at my bar.

378
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:35,747
Casey would never ...
Derek would not ...

379
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:39,751
Whatever the chattering about to marry,
so I sent them supply

380
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,338
Little Whites to solve it
and get them out of here.

381
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,509
Little Whites?
Yes, wedding chapel down the street.

382
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:50,304
Hell!
We must go.

383
00:39:55,351 --> 00:40:00,148
What is love?
It is patient, kind and soft.

384
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:06,279
Love is joy, peace and happiness.
It knows no hatred or anger.

385
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,907
Stop!

386
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,121
Damn.

387
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,249
Excuse me.

388
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:26,342
No, Tatiana, they are real.
Mitchell, they are real.

389
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,763
We walked right into a wedding
which was not theirs.

390
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:34,351
I do not know what we should do.
So embarrassing.

391
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:43,069
We are truly sorry.
Believe it or not, but it is common.

392
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:48,241
We lack a prospective bride
and grooms. They came certain here tonight.

393
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:54,205
Many passes here every night.
Sounds Derek and Casey known?

394
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:57,668
Was you with them?
So when do you remember them?

395
00:40:57,751 --> 00:41:02,673
Do you think that this place is a joke?
This is God's household

396
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,718
And we believe in
love true power.

397
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:09,680
I would think that I remember all
who come here and marry -

398
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:12,141
-but it had been a lie.

399
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:17,480
They came here a while ago.

400
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:23,987
I forget them never. Keep it as
a souvenir and if you excuse me.

401
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:28,909
I have a photo booth to wash.
Look at this.

402
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:34,332
Where is Casey? OMG ...
OMG!

403
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,337
She sucks him.
OMG.

404
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:43,717
We find them, it resolves itself.
No, do not dissolve.

405
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:47,554
Boslov going to kill me.
Who the hell is Boslov?

406
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:51,600
Casey fiance.
And my cousin.

407
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:57,731
Boslov said it happened Casey something should
he take me in the desert and kill me.

408
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:04,155
Come on, it's like you just saying.
No, he does really.

409
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,575
Probably you and Derek too.

410
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:10,870
Pardon?

411
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:17,669
So Derek went with one that is going to marry
with a Russian mafia boss?

412
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:21,590
He is the mafia boss and my family
does not allow it.

413
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,761
Who cares? Hell.
I did not know either about it.

414
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:31,517
Casey talking never about him.
Should not we learned that before?

415
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,604
I do not know you.
Hell.

416
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:39,568
What does it matter?
She could handle him and he is crazy!

417
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:44,073
It's best that they do not marry.
Will someone someone to marry?

418
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:48,118
You have at least that choice.
Shut up, Mitchell!

419
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:54,459
Okay, if everyone just calm down themselves.
We just have to find them, okay?

420
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:59,964
How do we do it?
You're right, we follow the tracks again.

421
00:43:00,966 --> 00:43:04,594
They are perhaps back at the hotel.
Well thought.

422
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:07,848
They can be in one of the suites.
Yeah, ok ...

423
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:11,477
You girls go back there now,
then we go if they stray.

424
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:16,023
We meet their room, okay?
What is it with you, Mitchell? Cease!

425
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:18,693
We meet.

426
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:23,740
What the hell is wrong with him?
He is a little away only.

427
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,992
Come on now.

428
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,690
Hell! Damn!

429
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:59,486
Okay, I'll drop say it,
but someone must call Amanda.

430
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:04,408
And I mean man
and I mean you. Do it.

431
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:18,256
<i> Hi, this is Casey. Sorry that you
miss me, but have a great day. </i>

432
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:20,884
<i> Leave a message. </i>

433
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:27,015
Casey, answer or returned to
room! I will not die, Casey!

434
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:33,481
Do not reply. Do not reply.

435
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:38,486
Hello?
Hey, Amanda. It is Adrian.

436
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:43,575
I know, Adrian. I see it
just like any other with mobiles.

437
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:47,871
Is it fixed?
I ... what?

438
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:50,457
Got Derek be?

439
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:56,714
Fantastic news.
You are a great asset to the company.

440
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,675
You're a hussy.

441
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:07,600
Good job, fag.
There you solved nicely.

442
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:11,897
We should go back to the hotel.
Mitch starts to get thirsty.

443
00:45:15,692 --> 00:45:19,697
Relax, Sienna.
It's not your fault.

444
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:23,159
I can solve the problem.
How it?

445
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,915
I send pictures to my brother,
Dimitri. He finds missing people.

446
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:33,795
Dimitri? Boslovs honor?
Da.

447
00:45:34,587 --> 00:45:37,758
Hell. Boslov get to know it.

448
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:41,178
Relax, I asked him
do not tell it to anyone.

449
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:57,487
What is it?
Nothing. There is nothing, Boslov.

450
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:00,532
Are you sure?

451
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:07,664
Boslov, I'm sorry.

452
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:13,170
Where is Casey? Come on.

453
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,721
The party's over for Boslov.

454
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:46,915
Some progress?
What is the opposite of progress?

455
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:49,876
I do not think that there is something like that.

456
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,424
Tatiana sent a photo to his brother
that is with Boslov, so ...

457
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:59,386
... Everything feels top.
Hell.

458
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:05,267
So this does not seem to me?
Do not you think he kills me first?

459
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:10,606
He does not care about anyone.
My whole family is terrified him.

460
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:20,409
I tried to call Casey, but she
did not answer. You got Derek?

461
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:32,046
Have not you tried calling him?

462
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:36,843
What kind of friends are you?
I see, okay?

463
00:47:42,974 --> 00:47:45,519
Derek?
Who is this?

464
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:48,564
Who are you? Where is Derek?
And how would I know?

465
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:52,860
You have his phone.
Your friend left it on my place.

466
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:56,072
When they went?
Recently.

467
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:59,826
They said where they were going?
Give me your address there.

468
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:06,124
I'll pay you, please.
Sure. Just do not nap me.

469
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,543
Alright.

470
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:14,675
58 East Balm. It called Darcade.
Okay, thanks. See you soon.

471
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:21,515
Okay. Derek was last seen in a place
called Darcade. We begin there.

472
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:30,775
What the hell are we waiting for?

473
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:35,989
What the hell.
Much energy there.

474
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,370
She fears for life, Mitch.
It's a bad time, Adrian ...

475
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:46,876
... But she is heltent you.
Not now, guys.

476
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:49,754
And thanks for your help!

477
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:53,341
Best Friends.

478
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:58,388
Where are you going?
Helping.

479
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:00,891
I was just curious.

480
00:49:10,442 --> 00:49:13,237
So fucking stupid. I should
not released her sight.

481
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,365
You're not stupid.
Do not touch me.

482
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:19,160
So clearly you say it.
What the hell do you mean by that?

483
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,998
You let it happen.
Had we just followed my plan ...

484
00:49:24,332 --> 00:49:28,754
Do not blame everything on us!
I find her, I die.

485
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:33,008
Do not you think that I will find Derek?
You do not care a shit about him.

486
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,387
What the hell do you know about it?
If you were his true friend ...

487
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:41,767
... Had you stopped their wedding!
So now you're guarding honesty?

488
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:45,480
Now all up!
Do not touch me.

489
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:50,110
Now jump all into the cab.
Now, come on.

490
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,993
Do you feel good?
No.

491
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:08,379
Okay, time for the next gift ... my.

492
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:15,637
What have we here? A gag!
The suits a hussy you.

493
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:22,060
Shut up, it's you who is hussy.
I know.

494
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,521
Can not we try it?

495
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,112
Now.

496
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,825
OMG ...

497
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:49,298
You know how it works?

498
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,010
Amanda Bryce. There she is.

499
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,100
Well done, my friend.

500
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:02,729
Eye for an eye, you bastard.

501
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:21,791
You will get
another surprise immediately.

502
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,752
But now ...

503
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,714
Okay.

504
00:51:30,884 --> 00:51:33,094
Okay, girls ...

505
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:45,691
I'm looking for Amanda.

506
00:51:53,658 --> 00:51:55,910
Amanda?

507
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:05,462
Hello.

508
00:52:05,546 --> 00:52:08,632
She has been properly naughty.

509
00:52:11,886 --> 00:52:17,308
Yes ... bind and punishment her.
Really?

510
00:52:17,683 --> 00:52:19,894
I will punish her.

511
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:24,941
I've been so naughty.
You get punish me as you will.

512
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,319
Shut up.

513
00:52:37,997 --> 00:52:40,041
Nicely.

514
00:52:42,502 --> 00:52:45,338
Thank you.
You're going to love it.

515
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:51,469
Your little hussy. You know that you are there.

516
00:52:51,803 --> 00:52:56,225
Your little hussy.
Do not pick too much dick.

517
00:52:58,185 --> 00:53:01,272
OMG. Cheers! Cheers!

518
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:06,819
Reis! Reis! Bye, Amanda.

519
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:15,954
It was intended
that to happen?

520
00:53:33,473 --> 00:53:36,851
Here it is.
It looks closed.

521
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:39,896
All great places to do so.

522
00:53:44,693 --> 00:53:46,820
Here it is.

523
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:26,487
Excuse me, I spoke with
a woman on the phone about ...

524
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,658
What do you want?
We talked earlier.

525
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:33,912
I'd grab the phone.
You said nothing about a bankruptcy.

526
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:36,915
Come with me, alone.
Wait!

527
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:40,586
I have money.

528
00:54:41,128 --> 00:54:43,505
Anyone else?
No.

529
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:45,800
Come on.

530
00:54:56,227 --> 00:55:00,565
What kind of place is this?
A place where fantasies become true.

531
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:05,279
First romm, ordinary stuff.
Girls. Sometimes two, three.

532
00:55:07,406 --> 00:55:13,371
And this is a little more specialized.
Was it a goat?

533
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,832
I do not judge.

534
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:18,960
It is private, purse.
I apologize.

535
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,964
If you do, bust you out. Do you understand?
Yeah.

536
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:27,844
How many rooms there are?
This is the last.

537
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:33,517
OMG! No, get them to stop!
What happens there?

538
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:37,980
Listen, I fill a void strippers
do not do. People want certain things.

539
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:42,860
Such things they can not find elsewhere.
Please!

540
00:55:43,152 --> 00:55:46,114
And I give them a safe place.

541
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:48,992
And you ask too much.

542
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:54,873
Hell! Dennis! Not again.

543
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:59,169
Stop sucking on anal plugs.
That is why one has kuleknebel.

544
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:09,055
May I come in there?

545
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:17,731
Go ahead. I come afterwards.

546
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:26,156
What the hell!

547
00:56:26,991 --> 00:56:29,577
Tell me about your friend.

548
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:36,543
He is tall, around 1.90. Styled hair,
slim. Most often a kind and quiet boy.

549
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:43,300
Kind or quiet?
There they are for about an hour ago.

550
00:56:44,343 --> 00:56:46,845
I often get couples here.

551
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:53,394
OMG ...

552
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:57,648
It's them.

553
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:03,613
People always come here and fucking
but they left without paying.

554
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:09,119
Said where they were going?
Many places in Vegas is free ...

555
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:12,998
... but not this. We have rules.
One must pay to play.

556
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:17,211
Kind boy? What?

557
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:21,883
I took some money for cleaning
and a little more like penalty.

558
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:26,095
Let he left his wallet too?
Idiot would leave the pants here.

559
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:28,848
No reason. Get out now.

560
00:57:37,941 --> 00:57:39,943
Are you ready?

561
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:46,158
Frank?
Yes.

562
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:51,789
Do you feel good?

563
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:59,631
It is the best night of my life.
Best night of my life ...

564
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,181
I saw God in there.

565
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:14,313
He had blue eyes
and short, dark hair.

566
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:21,196
He was definitely higher than 1.80.
Everything went so quickly.

567
00:58:21,571 --> 00:58:27,286
She was right there and he ...
Everything was so wrong.

568
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:30,414
They will probably not that we should strip.

569
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:42,635
What do you think happens back there?
Amber, be still.

570
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,431
Are not you curious?
No.

571
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:50,018
When the woman opened the door
smelled tramp dick.

572
00:58:53,105 --> 00:58:56,483
So where are they? She said something?
They are not here.

573
00:58:56,775 --> 00:58:59,987
They have benefited.

574
00:59:02,365 --> 00:59:04,700
I'm sorry.

575
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:12,083
There is no danger, it dissolves.
Let Uncle Mitchell say anything.

576
00:59:13,043 --> 00:59:15,962
We just might distinguish storage

577
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:22,094
And keep jobs, what?
Let them come to us.

578
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:29,685
It's actually a really good idea.
Yeah, that's it.

579
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:35,608
Okay, Frank.
Go back to Velvet Atheneum.

580
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,947
You three go back to the hotel.
It's going to work, it's not true?

581
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:47,705
Why is he like that?

582
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:51,333
Who the hell cares?

583
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:54,003
Because he has taken ecstasy.

584
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:00,677
Frank? What did you just say?
I fixed his drink earlier.

585
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,722
Derek too.
Derek too.

586
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:11,230
What is wrong with you?
Stop! I'm tired of you, kjekking.

587
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:17,486
So Derek and Casey
quite high and helpless?

588
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,531
Somehow.
No, it's good.

589
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:24,786
Everyone goes to their records.
Sienna and I are here, there, -

590
01:00:25,078 --> 01:00:28,707
And so they become abstinent småningom
and find their way back.

591
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:32,210
We do it, come on.

592
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:52,106
It's my fault. This had never
happened if we went to Thunder dicks.

593
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,735
We're going to find them, okay?
We still have time.

594
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,618
Hell.

595
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,456
Hello?
Sienna?

596
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,584
I'm coming after you.
Boslov, let me explain.

597
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:15,673
It's not necessary. Greet Derek
I have a gift for him too.

598
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:20,095
Derek, help! He is crazy!
I am bound and gagged!

599
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:30,898
Well done.

600
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:35,277
You might live.

601
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:44,454
What the ...

602
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:49,167
OMG ...

603
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:56,050
Wow.

604
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:13,443
Do not touch me. I'm so tired.
Do not give up.

605
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:19,825
I need you.
I'm an idiot.

606
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:26,040
He kills both me and you.
Request a miracle, because we need it.

607
01:02:36,176 --> 01:02:38,345
God?

608
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:45,561
Even better, baby. this is
Jackrabbit Rabbit Ranch.

609
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:48,814
brothel,
family restaurant and warehouses.

610
01:02:49,064 --> 01:02:51,776
Jack Rabbit?
Yes, exactly.

611
01:02:52,026 --> 01:02:58,074
Listen, I have a problem with
your friends Derek and Casey with me.

612
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:03,121
Is Derek and Casey there?
Yes, I think so.

613
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:07,542
I lyrics address.
Okay, we're coming. Thank you, Mr. Rabbit.

614
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,003
OMG!

615
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:14,550
Come on.

616
01:03:28,898 --> 01:03:30,942
You are a freak.

617
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,033
Hello?
Found them. Sending coordinates.

618
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:42,079
Okay. I am there within an hour.

619
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:51,214
If it does not work with Derek ...

620
01:03:52,507 --> 01:03:54,759
... I can marry you.

621
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:04,478
Brilliant news, yes ... No,
I have it much better. It spans.

622
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:08,941
I know, I never looked away.

623
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:18,493
No,
let me tell them that, ok? Yes.

624
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:24,416
Adrian, I'm sorry tonight.
I'm really sorry.

625
01:04:26,501 --> 01:04:29,463
Yes, I love you too.

626
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:38,014
Good news, ladies.
They have found the missing pair.

627
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:46,022
So delicious.

628
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:49,776
Okay, what the hell?

629
01:04:52,613 --> 01:04:55,741
What are you doing?
Excuse me.

630
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:59,036
Not meaning to offend you.
It is not true.

631
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:03,416
Pretty girls that you go not only
around and massaging each other naked.

632
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,752
It is absurd.

633
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:10,674
No, do not hide you.
There's something I must tell.

634
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:14,511
I'm not gay. never
been there, I'm sorry.

635
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:19,808
I just wanted to get to know you
and it is correct diseased.

636
01:05:20,434 --> 01:05:25,398
That's right sick.
But I did not expect me this.

637
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:36,409
But honestly, do you think
we did this for our sakes?

638
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:41,164
What?
We just wanted to fuck around with you.

639
01:05:41,498 --> 01:05:46,378
What?
You are so cute, but trying too hard.

640
01:05:46,712 --> 01:05:50,091
did you
that I was not gay all the time?

641
01:05:51,008 --> 01:05:53,094
Okay, how?

642
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,147
So what do you say?

643
01:06:07,818 --> 01:06:12,239
Sheets are cold.
Make room for me, ladies!

644
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:27,297
Has not been a long day?
Yes, it really has.

645
01:06:30,008 --> 01:06:35,556
You were drugged and everything. Poor Mischka.

646
01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:40,603
Relax.
Tatiana and I'll take care of you.

647
01:06:40,895 --> 01:06:45,316
This is ...
Not yet. Drinks first.

648
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:55,118
For an exceptional experience.
Cheers to that.

649
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,920
What is in it?

650
01:07:20,145 --> 01:07:24,232
It is the ugliest shoes
I have seen. Is the Italian?

651
01:07:26,902 --> 01:07:30,072
It was time.
Damn, you feel good?

652
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:32,783
No, I do not feel good.
They drugged us.

653
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:35,244
Quiet!

654
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:41,543
I do not care about who drugged
whom. They owe me $ 5,000.

655
01:07:41,876 --> 01:07:44,713
$ 5,000?
You heard me.

656
01:07:44,796 --> 01:07:48,633
They requested services
from my finest kegs.

657
01:07:48,925 --> 01:07:53,097
Cans?
An internal expression meaning whore.

658
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:57,268
I counted it.
And they used my best whore.

659
01:07:57,518 --> 01:08:01,647
Tax! Come in.
Hey.

660
01:08:02,815 --> 01:08:05,109
Providence?

661
01:08:05,193 --> 01:08:10,532
Gee, Providence!
Is there anyone who does not know you?

662
01:08:10,865 --> 01:08:12,951
No.

663
01:08:13,618 --> 01:08:19,041
Excuse me. sometimes surprises
her horniness even Jackrabbit.

664
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:22,628
She is such a whore that they
second whores call her whore.

665
01:08:22,878 --> 01:08:27,300
It can swear.
Whatever came idiots in here ...

666
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:32,055
... recognize Providence who took
them and said that they pay later.

667
01:08:32,347 --> 01:08:37,644
I take it not so easy,
for when they had finished, -

668
01:08:37,978 --> 01:08:42,065
They began to cry.
"I can not find your wallet!"

669
01:08:42,357 --> 01:08:46,904
"Boslov going to kill me."
So I chained them fixed -

670
01:08:47,238 --> 01:08:50,825
For they do not go from here
without paying $ 5,000.

671
01:08:51,867 --> 01:08:57,916
He says you should pay.
Can you pay him, Adrian ...

672
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,836
... Before he kills us?
He's not going to kill you.

673
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:04,673
It's not over yet.

674
01:09:05,507 --> 01:09:07,801
You're not going to kill them.

675
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,889
No, I'm not going to kill them.

676
01:09:13,807 --> 01:09:18,396
And no, I have not 5000 ...
Who the hell walks around with $ 5,000?

677
01:09:21,566 --> 01:09:26,529
Frank, old friend. What do you do?
Do not, what happens? Did you find them?

678
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:30,534
Yes, we did.
Listen, I have a little problem.

679
01:09:30,784 --> 01:09:34,454
You must bring $ 5,000
to a place I lyrics.

680
01:09:34,746 --> 01:09:38,918
No, it does not.
I'm a little busy right now.

681
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:43,381
Frank, we need money, your monkey.
I can not hear you, Adrian.

682
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:47,135
It is correct noisy here!
The storm is on the way!

683
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:52,974
Hell! Is the storm on the way?
With 90% chance of rain.

684
01:09:59,648 --> 01:10:02,359
Can anybody beat me in the face?

685
01:10:03,152 --> 01:10:07,990
For some tits! We need shots!

686
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:14,956
Come back. Ouch, my back.

687
01:10:18,793 --> 01:10:23,256
Frank, hell ...
Whoa, baby.

688
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:29,930
I know how you can pay
debt. You and your friend setpoint

689
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:35,436
Be in one of Jackrabbits known
amateur porn movies. What say you?

690
01:10:35,812 --> 01:10:39,482
Absolutely not.
I do not think you have much choice.

691
01:10:39,732 --> 01:10:45,155
There must be another way.
You receive $ 5,000 in cash ...

692
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:49,076
... which you give back to me
to pay their friends of Charges

693
01:10:49,368 --> 01:10:53,747
And since you can go home.
There is a good deal, believe me.

694
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:57,126
It is.
What?

695
01:10:57,209 --> 01:11:01,672
In college I played in one like that,
but got only $ 500.

696
01:11:01,964 --> 01:11:06,845
What?
Exactly. Listen to the sexy lady.

697
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:11,391
We have no time to discuss,
so let's just do it.

698
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:14,227
Are you sure about this?
Yes.

699
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:18,774
Relax.
I promise it will be elegant.

700
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:24,113
Okay, all down to the studio.

701
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,534
We solve this, okay?
I hate him.

702
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:47,054
You do not do this.

703
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:51,392
Okay, are you ready?
Yes.

704
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:57,732
That's what they always say.
Okay, silence! Light.

705
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,903
Sienna.
Just do it.

706
01:12:02,612 --> 01:12:04,698
Be so good.

707
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:43,948
Look at me.

708
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,496
Come on, show tits.

709
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:53,959
Let me do it.

710
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:05,513
Nicely.

711
01:13:11,936 --> 01:13:14,439
Have you seen?

712
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,282
This is gold.

713
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,669
Oh yes.

714
01:13:37,964 --> 01:13:41,801
Movie Magic.
This is so fucking weird.

715
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:44,304
Quietly, I said!

716
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:15,212
Cut!
Boslov?

717
01:14:15,504 --> 01:14:17,840
Derek?
Amanda?

718
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:21,427
What is going on here?
Okay, everybody. We begin again.

719
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:24,055
Go to them.

720
01:14:28,643 --> 01:14:30,895
What are you doing here?

721
01:14:31,146 --> 01:14:35,066
Now you should talk.
Boslov.

722
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:38,612
Adrian and I ...
I do not care Adrian.

723
01:14:38,862 --> 01:14:42,866
What did you do with my fiance?
She has not done anything.

724
01:14:43,158 --> 01:14:46,704
Do you speak again, it becomes
last time, I promise.

725
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:51,751
Boslov, she was drugged.
Both became. Ecstasy or something.

726
01:14:52,043 --> 01:14:56,589
The thrust and we found them here.
Really?

727
01:14:56,881 --> 01:15:01,636
And what is it here? A celebration?
No, they ended up here ...

728
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:06,475
... And we pay a debt.
Who the hell is he?

729
01:15:06,809 --> 01:15:11,814
Wait a little. I was the director here.
She speaks true.

730
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:14,400
Just put down the weapon.

731
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:23,368
Stop, Boslov! I'm glad I have
Set the coward you really are.

732
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:28,165
It is over.
You.

733
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:35,798
You betrayed me.
I took meh you and you cheated on me!

734
01:15:37,758 --> 01:15:40,303
Is this over?

735
01:15:41,929 --> 01:15:44,057
Well.

736
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,644
And now you will all get to pay.

737
01:15:48,561 --> 01:15:52,566
So who will die first?

738
01:15:58,447 --> 01:16:00,616
Some?

739
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:06,581
Not? Come on.
All may well not be wimps?

740
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:12,712
Ole dole ...

741
01:16:14,714 --> 01:16:17,050
... duh ...

742
01:16:19,553 --> 01:16:21,972
Same it, I'll start with you.
No!

743
01:16:26,268 --> 01:16:30,314
Providence? Frank was right,
you are a true angel.

744
01:16:30,606 --> 01:16:33,401
I'm no angel, but a whore.
Who the hell is this?

745
01:16:33,484 --> 01:16:37,071
My former fiance.
Good answer.

746
01:16:38,698 --> 01:16:42,786
Okay, I think we're done here.
The debt then?

747
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:47,082
Relax.

748
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:50,711
I can make money in other ways.

749
01:16:54,799 --> 01:16:58,761
It was quite a night.
It's probably a bit of an operation.

750
01:17:05,643 --> 01:17:10,065
Adrian.
Wait a little.

751
01:17:11,024 --> 01:17:14,862
Listen, it did not
as planned last night.

752
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:18,574
You still did what I asked for.

753
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:22,161
It must have been difficult.
Difficult?

754
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:26,999
We almost died together.
That's why I promotes you.

755
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,336
Congratulations.
Was that all?

756
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:35,091
Yes, that was all.
There is something right sick with this.

757
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:41,640
Do I get a minute?
Of course.

758
01:17:44,518 --> 01:17:48,981
It was interesting.
Yes, I would say.

759
01:17:51,984 --> 01:17:56,489
So did you do it?
If I was drunk, geezer ...

760
01:17:56,823 --> 01:18:02,371
... and fucked hussy? I think so,
but it is not correct my thing.

761
01:18:02,746 --> 01:18:07,376
Derek, I think that ...
I know. You and Boslov?

762
01:18:08,544 --> 01:18:11,839
Yes, it's crazy.
It's your thing.

763
01:18:12,089 --> 01:18:16,427
Derek, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

764
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,055
What do you think he said to her?

765
01:18:19,847 --> 01:18:24,394
I think we're ready here, huh?
I think so.

766
01:18:26,354 --> 01:18:30,734
You're a great guy and I'm sorry
I pushed you too much.

767
01:18:31,819 --> 01:18:33,946
It's ok.

768
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:37,533
Ok ...

769
01:18:37,616 --> 01:18:42,538
I must call her girlfriends
and say that I'm not dead.

770
01:18:42,872 --> 01:18:48,920
Ok, so you are not with us?
No, I'm calling a cab.

771
01:18:50,714 --> 01:18:55,761
I'll never use fabric again.
Was it that bad?

772
01:18:57,221 --> 01:18:59,431
Well ...

773
01:18:59,515 --> 01:19:01,809
I canceled it.

774
01:19:01,892 --> 01:19:06,147
Do you know how much I
not remember of last night?

775
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:10,068
Derek, I'm sorry
I did not support you anymore.

776
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:15,365
No, it's ok. This was nevertheless
something I had to do yourself.

777
01:19:17,367 --> 01:19:21,622
I'll talk to her.
Yes.

778
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,335
Come, we go.

779
01:19:34,427 --> 01:19:37,514
Hey.
Thank you.

780
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:47,065
So it was your fiance?
Yes, that was it.

781
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:51,195
Boslov seemed nice.

782
01:19:52,112 --> 01:19:55,741
Excuse me. I found
you said that he was a contractor.

783
01:19:56,742 --> 01:20:02,206
Yes ... I did not realize
that it was code language first.

784
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,754
Then I realized it was me
too scared to leave him.

785
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:12,175
Afraid of him? Come on.

786
01:20:15,345 --> 01:20:17,932
Had we ...

787
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:25,231
One forgets certainly not everything.
No.

788
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:34,324
So do you think that we could try?
Endeavour ...

789
01:20:36,535 --> 01:20:39,496
Are you asking me really like?

790
01:20:40,956 --> 01:20:45,294
Yes, damn. I do.

791
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,882
Will you?
That's what she said.

792
01:20:52,593 --> 01:20:54,929
I mean seriously. Jump into the car.

793
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:28,757
You want a drink? Water or something?
What the hell happened last night?

794
01:21:30,008 --> 01:21:32,678
I can think of a few things.

795
01:21:40,019 --> 01:21:43,648
What happened at Jack Rabbit's ...
What about it?

796
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:52,699
It was weird. Proper strange.

797
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:59,915
But only at the beginning and the
is not something I usually do.

798
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,964
Porn ie. I do not,
but I really like you, sex.

799
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:11,511
Having sex with you, or love.
Or, heck too.

800
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,434
Thank you.

801
01:22:20,354 --> 01:22:25,776
You are an alright guy, Adrian. Thank you.

802
01:22:27,486 --> 01:22:31,949
And it's not something I
would otherwise have done either.

803
01:22:35,578 --> 01:22:37,622
Okay?

804
01:22:50,177 --> 01:22:53,806
We blowing in cameras this time.
Agreement.

805
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:01,378
Hey.
What are you doing here?

806
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:09,428
For an exceptional experience.

807
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,044
Awake.

808
01:24:41,796 --> 01:24:46,551
No, it's not polite to talk
before has been presented.

809
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:53,433
I will introduce you
for my friend, Luther.

810
01:24:54,893 --> 01:24:57,980
Will you meet him?

811
01:25:09,784 --> 01:25:11,953
I love this job.

812
01:25:11,977 --> 01:25:15,977
