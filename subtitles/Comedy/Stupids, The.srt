1
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,382
I've got a feeling
something special's...

2
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,012
going to happen today.

3
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,629
Things to do today:

4
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,996
make checkmark on paper...

5
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,797
cross item out...

6
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,395
no time for that, I'm afraid.

7
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,065
And finally, say...

8
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,098
"that seems pretty senseless,
but, whatever."

9
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,980
That seems pretty senseless,
but...

10
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,345
whatever.

11
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,043
That's odd.

12
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,990
Joan, honey...

13
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,686
did you put
these trashcans on the curb?

14
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:52,130
Oh, I left the trash out
overnight.

15
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,028
Oh, dear.

16
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,528
Oh, no. Someone's stolen
our garbage again.

17
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,910
Oh, I just feel
so awful about this.

18
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,610
Darling, please,
it's not your fault.

19
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,619
It's the world we live in today.

20
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,622
There are people out there
for whom nothing is sacred...

21
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,453
people who will steal
a man's garbage...

22
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,959
week after week after week.

23
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,461
We can get through it, honey.

24
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,621
We'll borrow some garbage...

25
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,891
till we're back on our feet.

26
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,455
Don't you see, Joan?

27
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,467
That's exactly
what they're counting on.

28
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,469
Whoever keeps doing this
knows that people like us...

29
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,800
will just sit back and take it.

30
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,398
Darn it.
I'm not gonna take it anymore.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,499
Oh, Stanley, please,
don't get involved.

32
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,477
I already am involved, Joan.

33
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,309
Someone has stolen
from my family...

34
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,679
and I will not rest until
I bring them to justice.

35
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,735
Huh?

36
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,239
What in the world?

37
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,348
They're getting away.

38
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,287
I've got to follow them,
but how?

39
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,158
2 wheels.

40
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,753
4 wheels.

41
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,555
8 wheels.

42
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,261
All right, crooks...

43
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,736
now you've got Stanley Stupid
on your trail.

44
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,114
Morning, Petunia.

45
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,521
Morning, Buster.

46
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,185
Hey, sis, have you seen dad?

47
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,488
Isn't he sleeping?

48
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,961
No. And he's
not outside, either.

49
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,964
I got up early
to walk my fish...

50
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,431
and he was already gone.

51
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,298
Do you think maybe...

52
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,563
he's been kidnapped?

53
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,969
Oh, my God! We must go
to the police station.

54
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,067
Just as soon as we've
left a note for mom.

55
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,987
Take this down.

56
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,936
We have gone to the police.

57
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,202
Police...

58
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,141
Daddy's been kidnapped.

59
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,906
Kidnapped...

60
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,108
Don't worry. We'll be back soon.

61
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,378
Signed, your children.

62
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,682
Your children...

63
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,552
Let's move.

64
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,324
Sta n ley?

65
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,464
Buster?

66
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,094
Petunia?

67
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:04,567
Stanley? Buster? Petunia?

68
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,601
Where is everybody?

69
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,747
It's impossible.
That can't be true.

70
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,593
Hello? Hello.

71
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,061
Yes. Is this Mrs. Stupid?

72
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,564
I'm calling from
the police station, Mrs. Stupid.

73
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,931
We, uh, have
your children here, ma'am.

74
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,603
Oh, my God! It's true!

75
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,869
The police
have kidnapped my children!

76
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,226
You two just sit tight.

77
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,994
We'll have you home in a minute.

78
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,042
Bye!

79
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,566
Bye!

80
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,707
Mum?

81
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,377
Mum?

82
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,213
Mum?

83
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
Mum?

84
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,721
It's no use.

85
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,628
Mom's gone, too.

86
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,633
And we seem to be caught
in a deadly game...

87
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,134
of cat and mouse.

88
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,445
He left without even
ringing the bell.

89
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,181
Apparently, he only
wanted us to find this.

90
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,688
What's the Jade Palace?

91
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,990
And what does this have
to do with dad and mom?

92
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,996
I don't know, Petunia,
but I think it's time...

93
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,520
we went there and found out.

94
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,841
Friday, June 4.

95
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,503
Today, my world
turned upside-down.

96
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,173
First, I discovered
my husband missing.

97
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,841
Then, I learned my children...

98
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,850
had been kidnapped
by the police.

99
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,149
Now, the fate of my family
rests in my hands.

100
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,459
Note to self:

101
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,291
I must buy
a hand-held tape recorder.

102
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,796
Then I will no longer
be speaking...

103
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,231
into the garage door opener.

104
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,940
Some people
can be so inconsiderate.

105
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,651
Just the two of you?

106
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,661
Why, yes.

107
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,222
So they have been expecting us.

108
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,525
And what can I get for you?

109
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,034
Oh, I think you've got
a pretty good idea...

110
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,366
of what we're looking for.

111
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,201
May I recommend
the cashew chicken?

112
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,866
You'll get your cash
when we get...

113
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,205
our parents back.

114
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,937
And don't call us chicken.

115
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,598
Oh, no. The truck.

116
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,337
It's gone. I've lost it.

117
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,368
Now it could be anywhere.

118
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,305
Finding it now will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

119
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,996
It's always the last place
you think of looking.

120
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,978
I'll never get the hang
of these things.

121
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,185
Still no sign of mom or dad.

122
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,522
I don't get it, Buster.

123
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,858
Don't worry, Petunia.
Whoever brought us here...

124
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,693
will contact us
when the time is right.

125
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,307
Buster, it's a message.

126
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,377
"Time flies
when you're having fun."

127
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,905
"Time flies
when you're having fun"?

128
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,443
Wait a minute!
Isn't the "Daily Times"...

129
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,284
published just a few blocks
away from here?

130
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,949
Yes!

131
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,959
At the corner
of Fun Street and Fly.

132
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,585
No, it's Maple and Fifth.

133
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,960
Close enough. Let's move.

134
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,970
OK, camouflage lesson number 1:

135
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,669
to look like a bush,
you have to think like a bush.

136
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,975
OK, here I am just being a bush.

137
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,143
Just growing and hanging out.

138
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,982
Yes, this is the life for me.

139
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,820
Sure is a lot of soil
around here.

140
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,484
A lot of sunshine, too.

141
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,926
As a bush,
I notice these things.

142
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,429
Wait a minute. What's this?

143
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,599
I have arms.

144
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,602
I am a bush with arms.

145
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,263
And legs.

146
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,296
I am the first bush in history
with legs.

147
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,833
I can walk!

148
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,109
Oh, gaze, ye unbelievers,
upon this miracle!

149
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,122
This walking bush...
Half man, half plant.

150
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,954
He dwells in 2 worlds
but is the master of both!

151
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,396
Oh, man-bush, you are nature's
greatest wonder!

152
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,203
Poor fools thought I was a bush.

153
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,004
I'll lock up the bikes,
you keep a lookout.

154
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,456
Let's move.

155
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,494
My children!

156
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,955
Police.

157
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,962
If they recognize me,
they're sure to kidnap me, too.

158
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,987
What to do?

159
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,974
My gosh.

160
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,572
There must thousands
of people's garbage here.

161
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,582
Tens of thousands, even.

162
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,413
Why, the sheer organization
necessary...

163
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,910
to pull off a heist like this...

164
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,515
I've uncovered the crime
of the century.

165
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,627
Good day, officers.

166
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,969
Yes.

167
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,946
Is that everyone?

168
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,076
Affirmative, sir.

169
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,449
It's showtime.

170
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,722
Welcome, gentlemen.

171
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,097
I apologize
for the unpleasantness...

172
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,432
of our surroundings.

173
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,268
The setting was chosen
for its seclusion...

174
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,671
not its beauty.

175
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,303
The weapons
you are about to see...

176
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,778
are American made...

177
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:45,306
and, I humbly submit,
the world's best.

178
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,461
International law...

179
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,122
has long kept you
from acquiring them.

180
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,289
But as of now...

181
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,232
I hope to help you
overcome that.

182
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,996
Lieutenant...

183
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,805
First piece of equipment
we'd like to demonstrate...

184
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,138
is the Dragon anti-tank missile.

185
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,304
Whether you want
to foment revolution...

186
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,973
or suppress it...

187
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,506
this hardware
will help you get it done.

188
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,315
Strange, indeed,
are the workings of fate.

189
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,354
How could I have known
that today I would wander...

190
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,018
into the jaws of some kind
of super crime?

191
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,986
Pardon me.

192
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,657
Chances are, my life is
already in danger.

193
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,497
Yet, I feel strangely,
intensely alive.

194
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,661
Every nerve is alert...

195
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,330
every sense working overtime.

196
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,362
Nothing escapes my eye.

197
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,373
Excuse me.

198
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,677
One journey has come to an end.

199
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,842
But I've got a feeling...

200
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,874
the real adventure
has just begun.

201
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
Buster! Petunia!

202
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,065
It's some kind of ape woman!

203
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,802
Oh, no. It's me. Your mother.

204
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,276
Your mother's
some kind of ape woman?

205
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,678
No, no.
Children, it's a disguise.

206
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,575
They're wigs.

207
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,816
Next up is an updated version...

208
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,691
of the .45 caliber
personal sidearm.

209
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,165
I think you'll appreciate...

210
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,829
the increase in stopping power.

211
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,461
Here we have the traditional
M-16 assault weapon...

212
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,130
with extra new capabilities.

213
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,299
Not only will it fire
an 84 millimeter...

214
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,400
Excuse me.
Got a pen I can borrow?

215
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,315
Thank you very much.

216
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,318
So, what's going on around here?

217
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,649
Some kind of company picnic?

218
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,687
Why, that's
a very festive name for it.

219
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,983
Notice all that garbage
out there?

220
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,323
It's all stolen.

221
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,328
There's something fishy
going on.

222
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,161
Frankly, our lives
may already be in danger.

223
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,992
I hear you, pal.

224
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,900
At first, I was
pretty tongue-tied myself.

225
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,843
Oh, Jerry, help.
I need a new headline...

226
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,242
for the Entertainment section.

227
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,237
"HBO has given the order
for a pair of original...

228
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,773
"outer-space themed shows
for the new season."

229
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,446
Let's see. What about...

230
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,792
2 alien pilots
picked up by network.

231
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,626
Perfect. I'm sending it.

232
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,126
Hey, you guys...

233
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,488
give me a hand in Metro,
will you?

234
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,303
We were supposed to be
in print 5 minutes ago.

235
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,838
Sis, over here.
I found a computer.

236
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,815
What've you
got in mind, Petunia?

237
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,149
A little ride...

238
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,246
on the information
superhighway, mom.

239
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,154
In this age
of microtechnology...

240
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,658
the computer's our gateway...

241
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,159
to information.

242
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,491
Now, all we've got to do...

243
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,690
is figure out the password.

244
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,002
How about nose?

245
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,634
It's worth a try.

246
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,439
All right, computer...

247
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,277
now tell us everything
we need to know...

248
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:16,811
about Stanley Stupid.

249
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,287
Relax, soldier.
In a week from now...

250
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,293
we'll both be wealthy men.

251
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,954
I suppose so, sir.

252
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,622
But I can't help wondering...

253
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,655
what our country would think
of what we're doing.

254
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,299
This year our country...

255
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,464
refused my promotion,
Lieutenant.

256
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,997
They've only themselves
to blame now.

257
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,674
You really think
we can pull this off?

258
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,983
I gave my life to the military.

259
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,647
Nothing's going to stop me...

260
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,055
from getting something back.

261
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,821
Sir, I think we have...

262
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,454
a potential situation
on our hands.

263
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,930
What is it, soldier?

264
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,432
An individual, sir.

265
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,933
He appears to have
infiltrated the proceedings.

266
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,265
As far as we can tell...

267
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:05,860
he's not affiliated
with any of the buyers.

268
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,098
It's the C.I.A.

269
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,799
We're probably
already surrounded.

270
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,280
Negative, sir.
We scouted the area...

271
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,832
and he appears to be alone.

272
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,208
Alone?

273
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,271
Hmm. Just what kind
of cowboy agent...

274
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,645
is this guy?

275
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,955
No one is to disturb him...

276
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,465
without my order.

277
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,296
The buyers must not know...

278
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,699
anything is amiss.

279
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,761
Understood, sir.

280
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,142
If I know my business...

281
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,112
the operative will contact us.

282
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,249
To walk into
a situation like this...

283
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,263
without support...

284
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,265
this guy must be fearless.

285
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,699
Yes.

286
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,800
And very, very smart.

287
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,109
Business, weather, sports.

288
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,119
What is it trying to tell us?

289
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,121
It's computer jargon, mom.

290
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,783
It's like
a whole different language.

291
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,451
Now, hand me a photo of dad...

292
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,982
and let's see
what we can find out.

293
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,392
It's processing the data.

294
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,906
What does it say?

295
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,899
Fatal error, drive

296
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,308
Oh, my God!

297
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,345
What does it mean?

298
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,346
I don't know!

299
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,837
We've got to warn your father!

300
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,681
Watch out!

301
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,089
Let's go! Out!

302
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,125
Aah!

303
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,591
We'd better get out of here.

304
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,789
Let's go!

305
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,107
Our bikes are gone!

306
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,508
And the cops
have surrounded my car!

307
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,645
Run for your lives!

308
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,080
Cool runnings, my brother.

309
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,884
Later, man.

310
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,480
Bye. Thank you.

311
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,732
Hi. Stanley Stupid.

312
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,610
Oh. Honored to make
your acquaintance...

313
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,273
Mr. Stupid.

314
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,942
You must be a highly skilled
investigator...

315
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,747
to have discovered all of this.

316
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,276
Well, actually,
I knew I was on the trail...

317
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
of some pretty crafty thieves,
but I had no idea...

318
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,847
there was going to be
this much garbage out here.

319
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:58,420
You are clearly an agent
of enormous talents.

320
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,624
Shame the government
will never reward you...

321
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,633
as richly as you deserve.

322
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,999
No. The government
doesn't even know I'm here.

323
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,971
Aha. And that's why you've
approached me, isn't it?

324
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,304
To come and get your share?

325
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,865
One way or another?

326
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,639
Actually, mister...

327
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,771
I've approached you
because I need a car.

328
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,145
Oh. Lieutenant...

329
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,480
give our friend
the keys to my car.

330
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,511
A gift to the gifted.

331
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,786
Well, thank you very much.
That's incredibly generous!

332
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,190
Thanks a lot!

333
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,561
And to think I just wanted
a ride back to town.

334
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,698
Thanks, everybody.
I'll see ya!

335
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,336
Talk about nerves of steel.

336
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,008
Completely surrounded,
and he didn't even blink.

337
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,018
We bought him off for now, sir.

338
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,384
But what's to stop him
from turning us in, anyway?

339
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,683
You are, soldier.

340
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,036
Without disturbing
our clients...

341
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,117
follow, then terminate
the target...

342
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,718
with extreme prejudice.

343
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,989
Yes, sir.

344
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,961
Meaning?

345
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,299
Kill him.

346
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,668
Right.

347
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,107
Oh. Boy.

348
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,635
You never realized...

349
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,477
how many policeman there are...

350
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,847
until the day
they turn against you.

351
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,479
This is the biggest emergency
of our lives.

352
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,579
And we can't even call 911.

353
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,319
A crisis like this calls
for even higher authority.

354
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,419
Mom, dial 1011.

355
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,488
I'm afraid that's not
good enough, children.

356
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,965
Your father's life
is on the line.

357
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,867
I'm calling 75,496-11.

358
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,109
Yeah?

359
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,344
Hello. My name is Joan Stupid.

360
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,283
I'm a housewife...

361
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,877
and I desperately
need your help.

362
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,945
Yeah. Let me guess, lady.

363
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,285
You've had a hectic day
running around...

364
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,449
trying to take care
of the kids...

365
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,617
and now you're panicked...

366
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,785
because your husband's due home.

367
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,657
That's right.

368
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,663
And you haven't had time
to cook dinner, right?

369
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,063
That's right, too.

370
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,125
Yeah. I hear it
every day of the week.

371
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,636
What you need
is our family special.

372
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,831
What's your address?

373
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,601
55 Maple street.

374
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,130
Uh-huh.

375
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,642
And does your family
like cole slaw?

376
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,770
Yes.

377
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,143
That's all
the information I need.

378
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,477
You can relax, dear.
We'll have you...

379
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,107
taken care of
in less than an hour.

380
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,983
Oh, bless you!

381
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,816
No need to worry, kids.

382
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,152
The most sophisticated
emergency response team...

383
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,090
in the world
is working with us now.

384
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,487
Interestingly enough...

385
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,088
their strategy
involves cole slaw.

386
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,425
Hello.

387
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,765
Hi, honey. It's me.

388
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,295
Oh, Stanley!

389
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,638
Darling, are you all right?

390
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,336
I'm fine,
but you won't believe...

391
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,605
the things I've uncovered.

392
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,772
Stanley, listen to me closely.

393
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,375
You must beware of the drive

394
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,647
What's the drive bee?

395
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,779
We don't know...

396
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,290
but any error you make
with it could be fatal.

397
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,621
Just as I suspected.

398
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,593
My life may already
be in jeopardy.

399
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,639
What are you saying, Stanley?

400
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,577
There must be some kind
of interference.

401
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,011
Hold on.
I'll turn down the radio.

402
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,683
Oops.

403
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,349
Aah!

404
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,986
<i>Ooh'. Hot'. Whoa'.!</i>

405
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:54,825
Hot hot hot hot hot hot.

406
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,595
Oh-Oh! Unh!

407
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,397
<i>Ohh, he“ Whoa'.!</i>

408
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,600
Is there something about dad...

409
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,613
that you're not telling us?

410
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,774
Something about his past...

411
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,841
that would help explain
what's going on?

412
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,956
Children, I suppose
you're old enough

413
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,458
to know the truth.

414
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,960
And the truth is...

415
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,261
your father once worked
inside the system.

416
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,357
You mean...

417
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,129
That's right, Petunia.

418
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,797
Stanley Stupid was a courier...

419
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,328
for the U.S. government.

420
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,405
At first it seemed like
the perfect job.

421
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,976
Every day brought new...

422
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,811
and fascinating challenges.

423
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,339
Oh! Great!

424
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,687
There you go.

425
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,688
537.

426
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,456
537.

427
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,333
<i>Whoa'.!</i>

428
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:51,842
Then one day, your father
discovered something.

429
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,844
Thank you.

430
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,301
That's odd.

431
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,664
Come in.

432
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,679
What is it now, Stanley?

433
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,275
Something very strange, sir.

434
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,445
It seems like...

435
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,613
an incredible amount
of letters...

436
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,655
are being delivered...

437
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,817
to somebody named Sender.

438
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,621
Who is this Sender?

439
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
And what is he doing...

440
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,629
with other people's mail?

441
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,290
I believe that this calls

442
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,562
for a full-scale investigation.

443
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,967
The next day, he was fired.

444
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,031
They never told him why.

445
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,134
But, of course!

446
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,872
He knew too much.

447
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,142
And my instinct tells me...

448
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,810
we haven't seen the last
of Mr. Sender.

449
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,553
Is the target neutralized?

450
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,759
I'm afraid not, sir.
It seems the enemy...

451
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:15,925
repelled our assault team...

452
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,594
with extreme
defensive aggression...

453
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,537
in a "blowing up
their car" manner, sir.

454
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,770
So, he has some combat skills
to back up his bravado.

455
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,301
Who do we have from special ops?

456
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,712
McClelland trained
with the S.O.F., sir.

457
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,113
Give him the assignment.

458
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,913
Let's see how our friend
handles a veteran assassin.

459
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,413
Ready?

460
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,575
Ready.

461
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,586
It's high time I got myself
another tattoo.

462
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,249
Just make sure you do it clean.

463
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,759
We can't afford to leave
a trail of clues.

464
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,284
He'll never know what hit him.

465
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,422
Did you know you have
a hole in your gas tank?

466
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,432
Actually, that's how
you get the gas in it.

467
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,786
Listen, why don't you
top her off.

468
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,132
I'm going to go freshen up.

469
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,746
Thank you for
the excellent service...

470
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,118
old timer. Yep.

471
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,715
Well?

472
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,484
I'm afraid it's bad news.

473
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,718
Don't tell me
he took out McClelland, too.

474
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,954
It's uncanny, sir.
I've watched him...

475
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,461
dispatch assailants
effortlessly...

476
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,626
with techniques
that defy description.

477
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,793
Who's our explosives expert?

478
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,359
That would be Martinez, sir.

479
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,803
Give him the assignment...

480
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,305
and everything he needs
to pull it off.

481
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,637
I want it done surgical...

482
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,801
and I want it done now!

483
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:16,472
For God's sake,
we're military men.

484
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,540
Killing people
is supposed to be our job.

485
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,784
Go on!

486
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,158
Please, leave me alone!

487
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,469
What're you trying to do,
you darn bee?

488
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,099
Can't you see
I'm trying to drive?

489
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,838
Oh, my God! The drive bee!

490
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,345
Fight, Stanley!
Fight for your life!

491
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,855
The tables have turned.

492
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,996
The hunter becomes the hunted.

493
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,207
Mission accomplished.

494
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,374
No one could've survived
that blast.

495
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,644
Now, that's a well-made shoe.

496
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:14,957
Here's your fare...

497
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,864
and a little extra for yourself.

498
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:17,959
Thank you, sir.

499
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,162
What's the occasion?

500
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,262
It's just good to be home.

501
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,340
Home.

502
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,313
You never know
how much it means to you...

503
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,250
until you go away.

504
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,752
What are you doing to my grass?

505
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,156
Buster?

506
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,716
Is that you?

507
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,754
Have I been away so long?

508
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,389
You live next door, Stanley.

509
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,127
Please, call me dad.

510
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,862
Dad!

511
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,530
This day keeps getting
stranger and stranger.

512
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,837
We find ourselves today...

513
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,571
at the center of a puzzle.

514
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,603
At first, all is confusing.

515
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,444
But as the pieces come together,

516
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,450
patterns emerge.

517
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,781
And before long, we can see...

518
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,481
the sinister face of conspiracy.

519
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,824
And it all begins
with a man named...

520
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,665
Mr. Sender.

521
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,324
Letters...

522
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,691
easier to open than pistachios.

523
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:56,189
What's inside is more delicious.

524
00:43:56,233 --> 00:44:00,169
"If you still love me, Sally...

525
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,605
"tie a ribbon 'round
the old oak tree."

526
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,438
I'm afraid the only thing...

527
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,445
that's going to be hanging
from that tree is you...

528
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,276
Bob.

529
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,887
Poor Jenny Miller.

530
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,293
Nobody coming to her wedding.

531
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,792
This postal ploy of yours...

532
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,133
is the most evil caper
of our age...

533
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,297
Mr. Sender.

534
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,704
How will you ever top yourself?

535
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,970
With a crime so unthinkable...

536
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,978
that no one has ever dared
to attempt it.

537
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:46,381
To rob an entire nation
of its garbage.

538
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,215
The one resource no one
ever thinks to protect.

539
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,312
Yet, without it...

540
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,983
every Hefty bag,
every trash compactor...

541
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,992
every rubbish bin in America...

542
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,653
will be useless.

543
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,822
Desperate men
will roam the streets...

544
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,093
with empty wastebaskets.

545
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,760
Panic and chaos
will rule the land.

546
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,100
The precious balance
of civilization...

547
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,105
will be destroyed...

548
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,940
and then, the world
will come begging for mercy...

549
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,036
to me.

550
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,445
Your job is to kidnap anyone...

551
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,147
who discovers
my diabolical plan.

552
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,314
Including children.

553
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,861
This fiendishness
must be stopped!

554
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,641
It's not our battle
to fight, Johnson.

555
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,976
We've got enough trouble...

556
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,379
getting soy sauce
into these tiny packets.

557
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,974
Maybe we can't stop Sender...

558
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,484
but I know someone who can.

559
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,645
A bright fellow I worked with...

560
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,052
in the postal service.

561
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,419
Are the guards posted out front?

562
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:02,948
Only the best.

563
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,895
Well?

564
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,300
No one suspects a thing,
Mr. Sender.

565
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,101
Unless that bush has ears.

566
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,439
The joke's on you, my friends.

567
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,781
Bad news, sir.

568
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,287
Stanley Stupid
has discovered our secret.

569
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,321
At last...

570
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,291
a foe worthy
of matching wits with.

571
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:39,318
Release the drive bee.

572
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,788
So you see,
it all begins with Mister...

573
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,164
Sender.

574
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,934
The police are against us...

575
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,305
and obviously, we can't
go to the press.

576
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,072
What are we
going to do, Stanley?

577
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,579
We've got to take on Sender
ourselves.

578
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,947
Oh, it won't be easy
finding him.

579
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,611
Scouring the countryside...

580
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,449
for microscopic clues...

581
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,115
following trails that
are long since cold...

582
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,954
sensing him always nearby...

583
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,291
yet somehow,
maddeningly beyond our grasp.

584
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,127
Hey! There's a Charles Sender...

585
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,599
listed right here
in this phone book.

586
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,568
The manhunt begins!

587
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,345
The car won't start!

588
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,181
Maybe the battery is dead.

589
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,653
It was perfectly healthy
this afternoon.

590
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,383
Well, then maybe it's got
some life left in it.

591
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,254
I better give it mouth-to-mouth.

592
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:25,801
Not now, Kitty.

593
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,827
I've got a battery to revive.

594
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,478
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

595
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,847
I've cooked up
some insane conspiracy theory...

596
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,977
and put myself in the middle
of an illegal weapons deal...

597
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,988
with some of the world's
most dangerous men.

598
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,616
I've risked my life
and the lives of my family...

599
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,991
in a scheme that makes
absolutely no sense at all.

600
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,363
Insight fading...

601
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,994
I must remember
not to go forward with this.

602
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,697
What is it, Stanley?

603
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,329
What are you supposed
to remember?

604
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,930
Um...

605
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,336
I don't know.

606
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,450
Let's go, everybody.
We got a job to do.

607
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,932
Hey! What about the delivery?

608
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,034
You can't just order food
and run off like that!

609
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:46,508
You have insulted the dignity
of Floyd's Delicatessen.

610
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,618
You're sure this is the place?

611
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,788
Oh, yes.

612
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,491
When I called sender's home...

613
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,523
his wife said
that he works here.

614
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,230
A likely story.

615
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,669
Heh.

616
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,773
OK, Joan.

617
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,840
You and Buster
search that end of the building.

618
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,715
Petunia and I
will take this end.

619
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,984
And remember, everybody.
Use your heads.

620
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,152
I found his headquarters!

621
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,147
And I've stumbled upon
his fiendish laboratory!

622
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,264
Careful, Petunia.

623
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,461
One false move
and we could end up dead.

624
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,268
Dad?

625
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,071
Petunia?

626
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,670
Everything has gone dark.

627
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,236
I can't see a thing.

628
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,443
Oh, my God, it's happened!

629
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,146
We're dead.

630
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,984
I knew it!

631
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,259
So this is heaven.

632
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,964
It's quite lovely, really.

633
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,873
Funny, isn't it?

634
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,399
One minute
you're tracking down...

635
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,105
the head
of a global conspiracy...

636
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,841
and the next minute, poof!

637
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,645
It's all over.

638
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,878
Sure puts things in perspective.

639
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,410
You know who I miss the most?

640
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,049
Mom and Buster.

641
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,752
Don't worry, honey.

642
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,384
They'll be joining us
soon enough...

643
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,826
the way your mom drives.

644
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,460
Hello?

645
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,864
Somebody in here?

646
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,994
Dad, someone's coming.

647
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,032
You think?

648
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,206
Yes, Petunia.

649
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:02,370
It's time to meet Our Creator.

650
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,180
Hail to Thee, o Lord.

651
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,587
Actually, it's pronounced Lloyd.

652
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,455
All these years,
we've been saying it wrong.

653
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,703
So...

654
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:31,434
this is the face of evil.

655
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:50,792
And this is the diary
of his twisted schemes.

656
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,860
Dates... numbers...

657
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,702
years?

658
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,433
What in the world?

659
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,945
Buster, come on!

660
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,971
I found out
where sender's going next.

661
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,243
Just a minute, mom.

662
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,047
I've discovered
a mysterious room here.

663
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,782
There's a strange-looking clock
over the top of it.

664
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,820
And a control panel
with a bunch of numbers.

665
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,421
One would almost think
it's some kind of...

666
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,432
Time machine!

667
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,901
Mom, he“?!

668
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,635
Buster, no!

669
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,877
What buttons did you press?

670
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:50,919
I don't know.

671
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,217
Just a bunch
of random numbers...

672
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,086
and the letters "B C".

673
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,422
Oh, my God.

674
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,622
We've traveled back
to the age of the dinosaurs.

675
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,233
It's just so amazing
to meet you at last.

676
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,666
Well, thank you.

677
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,863
It's nice to meet
someone who appreciates...

678
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,132
the work I do.

679
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,537
Appreciates it?

680
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,064
Why, you're the one that takes
care of the entire universe.

681
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,633
But you'd be surprised
how little thanks...

682
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,677
I get for it.

683
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,646
Most people
don't even know I exist.

684
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:56,379
This is the single
most fantastic journey...

685
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,649
in the history of the world.

686
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,817
Keep your voice down, son.

687
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,181
If one of these things
wakes up...

688
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,027
we're in real trouble.

689
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,658
They look absolutely starved.

690
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,072
Hey, look, mom!

691
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,480
The cave
of some prehistoric peoples.

692
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,758
Their tools seem to be...

693
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,953
fashioned of
a primitive Styrofoam.

694
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,655
We've got to be careful, Buster.

695
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,062
The slightest disturbance
to this ancient world...

696
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,532
could affect
the entire course of history.

697
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,058
Yes...

698
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:51,096
the entire course of history.

699
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,580
What are you doing?

700
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,150
Just think.

701
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,883
My name is now
the first word ever written.

702
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,450
This rock will be the most
sacred mystery on Earth.

703
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,791
Buster, snap out of it.

704
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,888
When mankind learns to read...

705
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,421
I will be worshipped.

706
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,031
Nations will rise
and fall in my name.

707
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,504
Life on Earth...

708
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:26,305
will be nothing
but a footnote to Buster.

709
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,833
We've gotta get out of here.

710
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,542
Not to be disrespectful...

711
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,072
but I feel that perhaps
we've come here too early.

712
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,550
The truth is, the two of you...

713
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,416
shouldn't be here at all.

714
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,854
You mean, you're sending us
back into the world?

715
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,551
I'm afraid so.
But don't get me wrong.

716
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,321
It's been a pleasure
talking to you...

717
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,453
but there's work to be done.

718
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,363
So, our crusade against the
world's injustice is important!

719
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:52,334
Just head through
that door marked "exit."

720
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,928
Take you back to where
your car is parked.

721
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,199
Did you hear that, Petunia?

722
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,439
We're getting a second chance!

723
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,964
Hurray!

724
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,370
Do you have any final words
for us before we go?

725
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,110
Well, if you want to
make my job easier...

726
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,618
remember, throw your gum
in the trash...

727
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,210
when you're done chewing it.

728
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:13,085
I spend a huge amount
of my time...

729
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,384
cleaning up gum.

730
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,518
So long as we live,
we shall fight that wrong.

731
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,997
Sorry, mom.

732
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:31,336
I sort of went mad
with power back there.

733
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:35,037
Well, the most important thing
is we made it.

734
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,073
Mom! Buster!

735
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,446
Joan! Buster!

736
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,419
Dad! Petunia!

737
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,150
Stanley! Petunia!

738
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,753
You made it!

739
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,858
Are you all right?
How did it go in there?

740
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,923
Well, Joan, we had
a remarkable 20 minutes.

741
00:58:56,966 --> 00:59:00,060
We died,
went to heaven, met God...

742
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,263
and got brought back to life.

743
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,871
But still no sign of Sender.

744
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,033
Oh.

745
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,200
What happened to you guys?

746
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,608
We traveled through time
to the age of dinosaurs...

747
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,203
and Buster
established himself...

748
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,077
as the most important
and mysterious figure...

749
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,115
in history.

750
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,344
Buster?

751
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,715
Sorry, dad.

752
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,553
And even more importantly...

753
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,748
we found this.

754
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:25,486
Names, places, dates, times.

755
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,462
Wait a minute.

756
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,158
There's an entry
in here for today.

757
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,723
Channel 3 News at 1:00.

758
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,066
We passed the Channel 3
News station...

759
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,263
on the way over here!

760
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,772
And it's almost one now!

761
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,205
The trail is still fresh!

762
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,401
Let's go.

763
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,931
We're here!

764
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,534
Somewhere in this building...

765
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,171
is the man we're looking for.

766
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,910
Let's find him
before he finds us.

767
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,693
Good news today
for culture buffs.

768
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,790
The new exhibit arrives today at
the Museum of Natural History...

769
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,425
and here to tell us
about the highlights...

770
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,663
is museum director
Charles Sender.

771
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:41,703
Welcome.

772
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:42,796
Thank you, thank you.

773
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,672
You know, if you love
pre-Columbian sculpture...

774
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,369
as much as I do...

775
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,435
you are in for
a real surprise...

776
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,276
because in less than an hour...

777
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,613
I will be picking up
a stunning collection...

778
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,814
of Olmec heads
on loan from museums...

779
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:58,878
all over the world.

780
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,752
Now, I understand
it's exhibits like this...

781
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,486
that have given our museum
its most profitable year ever.

782
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,393
You must be
a very sought-after curator.

783
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:10,889
Yes. Sometimes I feel
like a hunted man.

784
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,637
Try your best
to blend in, Petunia.

785
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,402
Remember, we can't
afford to get caught.

786
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:19,931
Oh, excuse me.

787
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,375
I'm looking for the set
of "The Late At Night Show."

788
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,242
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the set...

789
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,303
of "The Late At Night Show."

790
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,678
I'm supposed to be making
a delivery there.

791
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,683
I'm supposed to be
making a delivery there!

792
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,241
Could you give this
to Doug the stage hand?

793
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,285
I'd be so grateful.

794
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,685
He's a big fat guy.
You can't miss him.

795
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,188
Here.

796
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,156
This will get you backstage.

797
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,716
I really appreciate this.

798
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,025
I'm sorry.
They're taping a TV show.

799
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,331
No one gets in
without proper authorization.

800
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,332
Oh, ma'am, this way, please.

801
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,102
Keep your eyes peeled
for anything unusual, son.

802
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,705
Mr. Sender can't be far away.

803
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,443
Just watch
for the slightest sign...

804
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,007
of strange behavior.

805
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,518
Dad?

806
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,613
They're putting make-up
on men in there.

807
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,556
Bull's-eye.

808
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,732
Are they ready?

809
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,733
Ready when you are.

810
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,065
Then let's go, everyone.

811
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,296
We're on.

812
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,335
OK, let's go.

813
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:35,140
Yeah, but Sly
is a lot taller now.

814
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:36,184
You know, people think...

815
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,550
it's really easy
being a celebrity...

816
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,317
but when they canceled my series
"Malibu Beach Detective"...

817
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,381
I was just
absolutely devastated.

818
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,495
Well, I'm sure everyone
is very sympathetic for you.

819
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,265
You put so much work
into such a fine series...

820
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,737
to have it taken off the air.

821
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,264
As an artist,
I was truly crushed.

822
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,776
It was the most awful,
heartbreaking, shocking thing...

823
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:07,908
that's ever happened to me.

824
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:21,322
Mom, I can't get
this light switch to work.

825
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,093
Just a moment, dear.

826
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,662
OK. Now. Let's take a look.

827
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:40,879
Well, maybe you'd
all be happier...

828
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,817
if there was
no prime time television.

829
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,718
What's going on?

830
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,026
You could spend every night
reading books together.

831
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,479
Well...

832
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,485
My next guest is
a world-class French chef...

833
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,821
Give it to the fat guy!

834
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:25,422
Fat? Fat! Moi, fat?

835
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,581
OK, let's settle, everybody.

836
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:51,246
We're on in 5, 4, 3...

837
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,858
Have you ever thought you
came from an unusual family?

838
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,053
Well, after you meet
my guests today...

839
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:01,552
you may want to adjust
your standards.

840
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,030
I divorced my wife...

841
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,932
in order to date her daughter.

842
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,606
I married a Siamese twin...

843
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,199
and had an affair
with her sister.

844
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,707
I have been engaged
to 3 of my cousins.

845
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,781
L...

846
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,412
Well, to tell you the truth...

847
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,253
I'm...

848
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,659
I'm my own grandpa.

849
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,788
You're your own grandpa?

850
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,127
That's right.

851
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:39,032
Well, for those of us who've
never heard of such a thing...

852
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,467
maybe you could explain.

853
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,300
Of course. It's quite
simple, really.

854
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,796
Many, many years ago
when I was 23

855
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,402
I was married to a widow
who was pretty as could be

856
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,675
This widow had
a grown-up daughter

857
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,409
Who had hair of red

858
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,280
My father fell in love with her

859
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,751
And soon they, too, were wed

860
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,084
This made my dad my son-in-law

861
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,452
And changed my very life

862
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,423
For my daughter was my mother

863
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,392
'Cause she was my father's wife

864
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,156
To complicate the matter

865
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:08,220
Even though it brought me joy

866
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:11,825
I soon became the father
of a bouncing baby boy

867
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:15,359
My little baby then became
a brother-in-law to dad

868
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:19,101
And so became my uncle
though it made me very sad

869
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,904
For if he was my uncle

870
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:22,774
Then that also made him brother

871
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,677
To the widow's grown-up daughter

872
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,614
Who, of course,
was my stepmother

873
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,612
That was our banker in Bern.

874
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,813
Payments will be transferred
to our account...

875
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:35,221
when we deliver the hardware
in approximately 2 hours.

876
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,885
Nothing left to do
but relax, Lieutenant.

877
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,886
No power on Earth
can stop us now.

878
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:45,128
I'm my own grandpa

879
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,965
I'm my own grandpa

880
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,733
It's impossible.

881
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,205
We killed that man.

882
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,175
Well, for God's sake,
kill him again.

883
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,371
Our future is in his hands.

884
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,209
My father's wife then had a son

885
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,010
Who kept them on the run

886
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,641
And he became my grandchild

887
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,845
'Cause he was my daughter's son

888
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,786
My wife is now
my mother's mother

889
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,413
And it makes me blue

890
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,321
Because although she is my wife

891
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,121
She's my grandmother, too

892
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,755
if my wife is my grandmother,
then I am her grandchild

893
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,765
And every time I think of it

894
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,596
It nearly drives me wild

895
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,896
This has got to be

896
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,130
The strangest thing I ever saw

897
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,572
As husband of my grandmother,
lam my own grandpa

898
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,702
I'm my own grandpa

899
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,109
Everybody!

900
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,876
I'm my own grandpa

901
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:36,749
It sounds funny, I know,
but it really is so

902
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:40,654
Hey, I'm my own grandpa

903
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:41,815
Stay tuned, everybody.

904
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,825
We'll be right back
after this break.

905
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,566
Thanks again for coming
to the station, Mr. Sender.

906
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,363
It was a pleasure, I assure you.

907
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,835
Bye-bye.

908
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,400
Sender.

909
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,409
We meet at last.

910
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,035
No time to chat, I'm afraid.

911
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,602
I'm taking over the heads...

912
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,308
of a dozen foreign countries.

913
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,614
My God!

914
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,974
His plans for world domination
are already coming together.

915
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,388
You know what's strange, dad?

916
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,125
I would have thought a man
as powerful as Sender...

917
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,463
would be surrounded
by bodyguards.

918
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,662
You can't see them, Buster,
but they're here...

919
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,638
ready to pounce on anyone who
so much as utters the words...

920
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:31,970
<i>"I'll</i> get you yet, Sender."

921
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,007
Whoa!

922
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,272
Hey! Let go of my dad!

923
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,144
Buster!

924
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,116
What happened?

925
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,717
It's sender's men.
They've captured dad.

926
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,491
So, where are we going, fellas?

927
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,077
Fasten your seatbelts.

928
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,330
You're a clever man,
Mr. Stupid...

929
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:38,306
if that really is your name.

930
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,672
Too clever for your own good.

931
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:46,010
And you play the innocent
most convincingly.

932
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:49,484
You thought you'd fool me
into thinking you were dead...

933
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,958
and then you'd catch me
red-handed...

934
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,011
when I went to make the sale.

935
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,183
A masterful bit of strategy...

936
01:09:56,225 --> 01:10:00,161
and you came dangerously close
to pulling it off.

937
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,096
We better get going, sir.

938
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:05,066
We're due at Warehouse 21
in less than an hour.

939
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,761
Warehouse 21?

940
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,669
No use gathering intelligence
now, my friend.

941
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,299
Our little chess game is over.

942
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,837
I hope you
won't find the endgame...

943
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,746
too unpleasant.

944
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:22,012
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's nothing I can do.

945
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,161
It's no use.

946
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,930
They won't let anyone
onto that army base...

947
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,198
unless they're in the army.

948
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,105
This is serious.
Dad's in danger.

949
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,573
We gotta think of something.

950
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,476
What if we form our own army?

951
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,139
To do that, we'd have
to form our own country.

952
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:54,376
We could call it Stupidia...

953
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,316
a sovereign nation,
with its own laws...

954
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,944
its own customs,
its own government!

955
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,285
Mom...
mother of this household...

956
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,483
your leadership
has stood the test of time.

957
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,284
I'd like to nominate you
as president.

958
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,659
To the polls, everyone.

959
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,493
Get this over with already,
would you?

960
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,556
This guy has already
taken out 3 of our best.

961
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,227
Relax.

962
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,971
His hands are tied.
He's unarmed.

963
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:21,841
We've got 2 guards
posted outside.

964
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,811
And I've got a gun on him.

965
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,905
There's no way
he's leaving here alive.

966
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,643
Isn't that right, Mr. Stupid?

967
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:34,121
Remember, throw your gum
in the trash...

968
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:35,589
when you're done chewing it.

969
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,558
I spend a huge amount
of my time...

970
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,493
cleaning up gum.

971
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,587
In the name of the Lloyd!

972
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,635
Oh, jeez!

973
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,670
All right, get your hands up.

974
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,985
Thank you, dear Lloyd!

975
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,317
The polls are dead even,
give or take a vote.

976
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,695
If only we knew
who dad was voting for.

977
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,860
Joan! Joan!

978
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,460
Congratulations, mom!

979
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,403
Thank you, everyone.

980
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,236
And as your president...

981
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,469
I appoint Stanley Stupid...

982
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,374
head of the army!

983
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,778
Your first duty
is to go onto that army base...

984
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,214
and rescue my husband!

985
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:35,739
And get our dad
while you're at it.

986
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,581
I'm afraid those two
will just have to wait.

987
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:40,144
We've got to get to a place
called Warehouse 21.

988
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,352
Joan, give me the keys.

989
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,226
The car won't start!

990
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,862
Dad, you and mom...

991
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,201
switch places.

992
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:13,584
Mom, hand the keys to dad.

993
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,022
Good work, everybody!

994
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,613
This must be the place.

995
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,870
Well, what have we here?

996
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,616
50H'!!-

997
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,779
EXCUSE me, everyone.

998
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,683
May I have your attention,
please?

999
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:31,958
Impossible.

1000
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:34,019
He's amazing.

1001
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,620
Before you unleash strife...

1002
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,791
and warfare upon this planet...

1003
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,733
please, look into your hearts.

1004
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,303
No guns.

1005
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:45,306
Inside you're still
human beings.

1006
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,173
You can change your ways.

1007
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:52,206
You all could come back
from the dark side.

1008
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,472
You! Send a squad of men...

1009
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,644
towards the eastern flank
of the warehouse.

1010
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,654
You! Organize
a counter to the left.

1011
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,918
Your men will back
the first 2 squads...

1012
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:04,721
while my men rove on point.

1013
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,092
But... he's only one man.

1014
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,255
Trust me.

1015
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,959
You don't want
to underestimate him.

1016
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,429
So turn yourselves in, everyone.

1017
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:17,768
My family and I
do not wish to fight you...

1018
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,273
but if you do not give up...

1019
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,969
you will leave us no choice.

1020
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,069
Are they giving up?

1021
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,442
No. As a matter of fact...

1022
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,312
they seem to be organizing
some sort of massive attack.

1023
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,445
I guess they want
to do things the hard way.

1024
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,883
They seem
pretty well armed, dad.

1025
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,893
Yes, Buster, but so are we.

1026
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,451
Oh, they may have
knives and guns...

1027
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,962
and missiles and bombs...

1028
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,294
but we're armed with the fact...

1029
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,799
that what we're doing is right.

1030
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,461
Sometimes you have
to trust in that.

1031
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,607
Let the final showdown begin.

1032
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:05,183
Don't!

1033
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,437
Get him!

1034
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:32,246
Move to the right! Right!

1035
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,247
Left! Move!

1036
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,949
Left! Right!

1037
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,045
Right!

1038
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,160
Left! Go right!

1039
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,287
Right! Left! Left!

1040
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,334
Left! Right! The other left!

1041
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,804
I sot him!

1042
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:00,965
Left! No, no!

1043
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,009
Right!

1044
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,249
Gentlemen!

1045
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,250
All right!

1046
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,251
Move it!

1047
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,248
Take your time, men.

1048
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,552
He's unarmed.

1049
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:18,456
Or am I?

1050
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:24,959
Aha!

1051
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,433
Aha!

1052
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,347
I'm stuck. I'm caught.
I'm trapped.

1053
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,854
Somebody help me out here!

1054
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,185
I'm cornered!

1055
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,123
Yes! That's the word
I'm looking for!

1056
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:51,182
I'm cornered!

1057
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,818
I'll save you, dad!

1058
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,257
Must...

1059
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:31,595
concentrate.

1060
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:35,262
Focus power of mind...

1061
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,294
over matter.

1062
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:45,411
Channel every ounce
of willpower!

1063
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,039
It's working!

1064
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,276
I've done it!

1065
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:52,184
Behold the super-human strength
of Buster!

1066
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,744
Huh?

1067
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,625
Buster!

1068
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:25,876
Buster.

1069
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:28,151
Sorry, dad.

1070
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,982
What the hell was that?

1071
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,492
Sounds to me like it came...

1072
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:32,823
from the warehouse district.

1073
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,512
Buster! Stanley?

1074
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:02,455
Please be careful out there.

1075
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,458
There are lots
of little fires...

1076
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,187
burning all over the place now.

1077
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:31,212
This is the worst fire
extinguisher I've ever seen.

1078
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,519
How lovely.

1079
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,626
Car 15 requests backup.

1080
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,724
Send squad cars immediately
to Warehouse 21.

1081
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,463
Car 15, we are on our way.

1082
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,970
Oh, great.

1083
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,268
Fine. Just great.

1084
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:52,989
We got to get out of here.

1085
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,331
Not to worry, Lieutenant.

1086
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,996
The police are on my side...

1087
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,028
as far as they know.

1088
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,205
How do I look?

1089
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:04,268
Quite convincing, sir...

1090
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,177
but what about me?

1091
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:10,207
You, my friend...

1092
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,718
are on the wrong side
of the law.

1093
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:12,753
Sir?

1094
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,623
Get some cuffs over here.

1095
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,955
I got the ringleader.

1096
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,133
Shoot to kill, boys.

1097
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,136
Those are evil men in there.

1098
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,478
You've got to let me through,
officer.

1099
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,810
The cargo I'm transporting...

1100
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,247
is extremely cultural.

1101
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,476
I'm sorry, sir, but no one's...

1102
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,916
getting through here
at the moment.

1103
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:46,648
Oh, my.
I guess I'll have to find...

1104
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,178
another route home.

1105
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:49,656
In the meantime,
could you please just pull...

1106
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,658
your vehicle over there...

1107
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,681
with the rest of the cars?

1108
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:52,988
Yes, sir.

1109
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,725
Oh, Stanley,
you were so brave in there.

1110
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,025
Hey, look! The police
are on our side again.

1111
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:02,696
Come on! Keep moving.

1112
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:03,737
Let's go.

1113
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,796
Stay in line!

1114
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,775
You go, mister.
Come on, come on.

1115
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:09,003
Move it! Move it!

1116
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,773
Yes, our work here is done...

1117
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:11,938
but before we go...

1118
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,106
there's a certain
arch villain...

1119
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:14,445
I'd like to speak to.

1120
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:15,949
I have a feeling he learned...

1121
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,281
a pretty important lesson today.

1122
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,953
Well, my friend...

1123
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,515
it seems you lost.

1124
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:26,857
I certainly am.

1125
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,294
The problem is
you took the wrong road...

1126
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:29,387
right from the start.

1127
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,730
Can you help get me
back on the right path?

1128
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:33,961
Yes, I can...

1129
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,970
but it won't be easy.

1130
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,472
You've got
to turn yourself around.

1131
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,031
You've got to straighten out...

1132
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,976
but as long
as you can remember...

1133
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,979
to head towards the light...

1134
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,207
you'll never go wrong.

1135
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,475
Thanks.

1136
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:49,540
You've really saved me.

1137
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,348
Until we meet again.

1138
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,698
It's been quite a day.

1139
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,431
And I have to say...

1140
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:09,460
that I'm glad it's finally over.

1141
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:14,104
I'm afraid it's not over yet.

1142
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:20,107
You must think you have some
kind of guardian angel, Stanley.

1143
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:22,116
You thought
you could take me on...

1144
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,276
and pay no price...

1145
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,218
destroy my future...

1146
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,949
and then slip through
my fingers again and again.

1147
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:33,790
<i>We“, not this time, bucks'.!</i>

1148
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:36,956
This time I'm going
to take care of you myself.

1149
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:40,832
Where's your guardian angel now?

1150
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,063
<i>“Hm!</i>

1151
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,333
Bet you're surprised to see me.

1152
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:45,464
We certainly are.

1153
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:47,441
And very impressed, I might add.

1154
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,466
Well, let this
be a lesson to you.

1155
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:50,978
Nobody gets away from me.

1156
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:53,310
I've been on the job too long.

1157
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:54,508
Here's your bill.

1158
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,420
I would've thought
guardian angels...

1159
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:03,924
worked for free.

1160
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,926
Oh, Joan.

1161
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,951
You're so wonderfully naive.

1162
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,157
I assume you work for the Lloyd.

1163
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,259
Me?

1164
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:16,463
No, my boss' name is Floyd.

1165
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:17,766
No.

1166
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:20,638
It's pronounced Lloyd.

1167
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:29,908
Hey, neighbor!

1168
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:30,951
Hey, Stanley!

1169
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:32,452
I didn't see you around much
this weekend.

1170
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:33,545
What you been doing?

1171
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:34,885
Aw, this and that.

1172
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,015
Had breakfast...

1173
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,048
read the paper, saved the world.

1174
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:39,252
Oh, is that right?

1175
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:40,625
Say, today
I thought we'd have...

1176
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,959
a little barbecue.
Why don't you stop by?

1177
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:43,116
There's plenty for everyone.

1178
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:44,131
Well, thanks, Stanley...

1179
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:47,396
but I left the water
running in my bathtub.

1180
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,627
This is gonna be great, dad.

1181
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,327
Say, how can I help?

1182
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:54,960
You can flip the burgers, son...

1183
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,732
but I better handle
the lighter fluid.

1184
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,399
See? "Keep out
of reach of children."

1185
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,340
Right there.
You got to be careful.

1186
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,247
What is it, boy?

1187
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,854
What is it, Kitty?

1188
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:34,207
Are you hungry?

1189
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,208
Do you want a biscuit?

1190
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,847
That poor dog doesn't know
what he wants sometimes.

1191
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:47,446
Many, many years ago
when I was 23

1192
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:51,282
I was married to a widow
who was pretty as could be

1193
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,617
This widow
had a grown-up daughter

1194
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,281
Who had hair of red

1195
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:57,120
My father fell in love with her

1196
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,955
And soon they, too, were wed

1197
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,790
This made my dad my son-in-law

1198
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,295
And changed my very life

1199
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:04,298
For my daughter was my mother

1200
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:06,300
'Cause she was my father's wife

1201
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,631
To complicate the matter

1202
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:09,966
Even though it brought me joy

1203
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:13,462
I soon became the father
of a bouncing baby boy

1204
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:17,308
My little baby then became
a brother-in-law to dad

1205
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:20,974
And so became my uncle
though it made me very sad

1206
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:22,642
For if he was my uncle

1207
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,480
Then that also made him brother

1208
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:26,316
To the widow's grown-up daughter

1209
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,481
Who, of course,
was my stepmother

1210
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:32,482
I'm my own grandpa

1211
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:35,496
I'm my own grandpa

1212
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:39,330
It sounds funny, I know,
but it really is so

1213
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:42,825
Oh, I'm my own grandpa

1214
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,168
My father's wife then had a son

1215
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,174
Who kept them on the run

1216
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,835
And he became my grandchild

1217
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,673
'Cause he was my daughter's son

1218
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:52,679
My wife
is now my mother's mother

1219
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,340
And it makes me blue

1220
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:56,350
Because although she is my wife

1221
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,851
She's my grandmother, too

1222
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:01,787
if my wife is my grandmother,
then I am her grandchild

1223
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,450
And every time I think of it

1224
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:05,459
It nearly drives me wild

1225
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:06,960
This has got to be

1226
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,121
The strangest thing I ever saw

1227
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:12,963
As husband of my grandmother,
lam my own grandpa

1228
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,628
I'm my own grandpa

1229
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:16,670
Everybody!

1230
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:19,799
I'm my own grandpa

1231
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:23,641
It sounds funny, I know,
but it really is so

1232
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:27,478
Hey, I'm my own grandpa
