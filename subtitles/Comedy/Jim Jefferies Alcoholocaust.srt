know you're a civilian."
I'm like, "does the enemy give

250
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,258
Know you're a civilian."
I'm like, "does the enemy give
a shit?

251
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,893
I'm like, "does the enemy give
a shit?
That's my main concern, because

252
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,327
A shit?
That's my main concern, because
i've never been a sniper."

253
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,829
That's my main concern, because
i've never been a sniper."
But every time i got off the

254
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,497
I've never been a sniper."
But every time i got off the
helicopter, i was surrounded by

255
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,798
But every time i got off the
helicopter, i was surrounded by
soldiers protecting me.

256
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,467
Helicopter, i was surrounded by
soldiers protecting me.
If i was a sniper, i'd be like,

257
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,768
Soldiers protecting me.
If i was a sniper, i'd be like,
"the cunt in blue looks

258
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,502
If i was a sniper, i'd be like,
"the cunt in blue looks
important."

259
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:57,969
"The cunt in blue looks
important."
Right?

260
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:02,240
Important."
Right?
So...we got in this helicopter.

261
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,543
Right?
So...we got in this helicopter.
[ Laughs ]

262
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,011
So...we got in this helicopter.
[ Laughs ]
and we're sitting in this

263
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:06,645
[ Laughs ]
and we're sitting in this
chopper.

264
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,346
And we're sitting in this
chopper.
That's what we call them in the

265
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,414
Chopper.
That's what we call them in the
biz -- "Chopper."

266
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,315
That's what we call them in the
biz -- "Chopper."
And i'm sitting here.

267
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,516
Biz -- "Chopper."
And i'm sitting here.
And i got two soldiers sitting

268
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,651
And i'm sitting here.
And i got two soldiers sitting
next to me there, my manager,

269
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,552
And i got two soldiers sitting
next to me there, my manager,
brett, sitting there.

270
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,619
Next to me there, my manager,
brett, sitting there.
He's got two soldiers sitting

271
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,186
Brett, sitting there.
He's got two soldiers sitting
next to him.

272
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,187
He's got two soldiers sitting
next to him.
There's two soldiers in the

273
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:16,755
Next to him.
There's two soldiers in the
cockpit.

274
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,290
There's two soldiers in the
cockpit.
There's a great big door open

275
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,791
Cockpit.
There's a great big door open
next to me there, and there's

276
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,393
There's a great big door open
next to me there, and there's
another door open there, and at

277
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,894
Next to me there, and there's
another door open there, and at
that door is a soldier with a

278
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,797
Another door open there, and at
that door is a soldier with a
great big gun on a hinge, with

279
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,198
That door is a soldier with a
great big gun on a hinge, with
bullets coming out of it like

280
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,700
Great big gun on a hinge, with
bullets coming out of it like
that thing that chewbacca wears.

281
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:32,837
Bullets coming out of it like
that thing that chewbacca wears.
And we take off, and off we go

282
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,738
That thing that chewbacca wears.
And we take off, and off we go
to baghdad.

283
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,707
And we take off, and off we go
to baghdad.
And as we hit the border of the

284
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,776
To baghdad.
And as we hit the border of the
city, i hear a great big "bang!"

285
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,444
And as we hit the border of the
city, i hear a great big "bang!"
And these two small flares shoot

286
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,046
City, i hear a great big "bang!"
And these two small flares shoot
out from the small wings of the

287
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,647
And these two small flares shoot
out from the small wings of the
helicopter, followed by a trail

288
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,281
Out from the small wings of the
helicopter, followed by a trail
of smoke.

289
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,516
Helicopter, followed by a trail
of smoke.
And the helicopter goes,

290
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,985
Of smoke.
And the helicopter goes,
"fwwhhh! Fwwhhh! Fwwhhh!"

291
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,453
And the helicopter goes,
"fwwhhh! Fwwhhh! Fwwhhh!"
Now, the reason they do this is,

292
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,788
"Fwwhhh! Fwwhhh! Fwwhhh!"
Now, the reason they do this is,
when they get over the danger

293
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,222
Now, the reason they do this is,
when they get over the danger
area, if there's a heat-Seeking

294
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,657
When they get over the danger
area, if there's a heat-Seeking
missile, it'll be distracted by

295
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,758
Area, if there's a heat-Seeking
missile, it'll be distracted by
the flares, and then the

296
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,026
Missile, it'll be distracted by
the flares, and then the
helicopter will fly out of

297
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,861
The flares, and then the
helicopter will fly out of
range -- Very clever.

298
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,197
Helicopter will fly out of
range -- Very clever.
Now...

299
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,834
Range -- Very clever.
Now...
they never told me this was

300
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,335
Now...
they never told me this was
happening.

301
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,070
They never told me this was
happening.
As far as i'm concerned, the

302
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,406
Happening.
As far as i'm concerned, the
wings have just exploded and

303
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,975
As far as i'm concerned, the
wings have just exploded and
we're now plummeting to our

304
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,210
Wings have just exploded and
we're now plummeting to our
death, but it's nice to know how

305
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,179
We're now plummeting to our
death, but it's nice to know how
you react under pressure,

306
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,448
Death, but it's nice to know how
you react under pressure,
because i reacted thusly -- By

307
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,383
You react under pressure,
because i reacted thusly -- By
vomiting over my lovely blue

308
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,552
Because i reacted thusly -- By
vomiting over my lovely blue
vest, ironically making it more

309
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:24,322
Vomiting over my lovely blue
vest, ironically making it more
camouflage than it was before,

310
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,991
Vest, ironically making it more
camouflage than it was before,
and yelling out, "we're going

311
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,792
Camouflage than it was before,
and yelling out, "we're going
down!"

312
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,661
And yelling out, "we're going
down!"
The two pilots, the sergeants,

313
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,429
Down!"
The two pilots, the sergeants,
the gunner -- They all start

314
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,231
The two pilots, the sergeants,
the gunner -- They all start
pissing themselves, laughing.

315
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,833
The gunner -- They all start
pissing themselves, laughing.
They're reaching through.

316
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,768
Pissing themselves, laughing.
They're reaching through.
They're high-Fiving each other.

317
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,136
They're reaching through.
They're high-Fiving each other.
They're tearing it down.

318
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,738
They're high-Fiving each other.
They're tearing it down.
They've been waiting for this

319
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,739
They're tearing it down.
They've been waiting for this
joke for months.

320
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,374
They've been waiting for this
joke for months.
I'm cleaning vomit off myself,

321
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,009
Joke for months.
I'm cleaning vomit off myself,
going, "oh, you, that was a good

322
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:44,476
I'm cleaning vomit off myself,
going, "oh, you, that was a good
one.

323
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,877
Going, "oh, you, that was a good
one.
Thank you for defending my

00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,511

Thank you for defending my
freedom."

325
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,881
Thank you for defending my
freedom."
Right?

326
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,516
Freedom."
Right?
So, i sit back down, covered in

327
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,884
Right?
So, i sit back down, covered in
vomit in the helicopter --

328
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:53,385
So, i sit back down, covered in
vomit in the helicopter --
"Ugh."

329
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,919

"Ugh."
And so i'm trying to look out

330
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,388
"Ugh."
And so i'm trying to look out
the door to try to un-Quease

331
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,955
And so i'm trying to look out
the door to try to un-Quease
myself.

332
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,423
The door to try to un-Quease
myself.
And i'm looking out over the

333
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,025
Myself.
And i'm looking out over the
ground, over baghdad -- By the

334
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,526
And i'm looking out over the
ground, over baghdad -- By the

336
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,932

untouched -- And i look out on
the ground, and i see a little

00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,701
Untouched -- And i look out on
the ground, and i see a little
arab fellow with a handgun

338
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,636
The ground, and i see a little
arab fellow with a handgun
shooting up at the helicopter,

339
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,371
Arab fellow with a handgun
shooting up at the helicopter,
just -- [ Imitates gunshots ]

"We're being fired on!"

342
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,210
Once again, i freak out.
"We're being fired on!"
The gunner now is laughing so

343
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,011
"We're being fired on!"
The gunner now is laughing so

The gunner now is laughing so

He's laughing even harder than

He's laughing so hard, he's

The gun's just dangling out in

The gun's just dangling out in

We're in a military helicopter

00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,499
We're in a military helicopter

That's a handgun.

That's a handgun.

isn't that a fun story about a

373
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,584
[ Laughs ]
isn't that a fun story about a
man dying?

374
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,885
Isn't that a fun story about a
man dying?
It's funny, though.

375
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:37,889
Man dying?
It's funny, though.
My limited time in a war zone,

376
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,524
It's funny, though.
My limited time in a war zone,
i really, you know, didn't see

377
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,959
My limited time in a war zone,
i really, you know, didn't see
what all the bad stuff was.

378
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,628
I really, you know, didn't see
what all the bad stuff was.
They were very nice to me.

379
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,130
What all the bad stuff was.
They were very nice to me.
But this was kind of crazy to

380
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,331
They were very nice to me.
But this was kind of crazy to
me 'cause i don't know,

381
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,799
But this was kind of crazy to
me 'cause i don't know,
historically, how we're gonna

382
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,600
Me 'cause i don't know,
historically, how we're gonna
talk about it.

383
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,702
Historically, how we're gonna
talk about it.
See, like, my grandfather --

384
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,771
Talk about it.
See, like, my grandfather --
He fought during the second

385
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,140
See, like, my grandfather --
He fought during the second
world war, for the japs, weirdly

386
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,908
He fought during the second
world war, for the japs, weirdly
enough.

387
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,443
World war, for the japs, weirdly
enough.
No, no, for the australians.

388
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,711
Enough.
No, no, for the australians.
He killed a lot of japanese --

389
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,980
No, no, for the australians.
He killed a lot of japanese --
Hated them till he died.

390
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,348
He killed a lot of japanese --
Hated them till he died.
"Love the food, hate the

391
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,316
Hated them till he died.
"Love the food, hate the
people," he used to say.

392
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,085
"Love the food, hate the
people," he used to say.
What a complex man.

393
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,622
People," he used to say.
What a complex man.
And...

394
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,191
What a complex man.
And...
i used to love listening -- When

395
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,059
And...
i used to love listening -- When
i was a kid, listening to him

396
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,728
I used to love listening -- When
i was a kid, listening to him
tell stories about killing

397
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,362
I was a kid, listening to him
tell stories about killing
nazis.

398
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,063
Tell stories about killing
nazis.
There was always something

399
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,832
Nazis.
There was always something
exciting about it, you know?

400
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,834
There was always something
exciting about it, you know?
I just don't know what i would

401
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,736
Exciting about it, you know?
I just don't know what i would
tell my grandson about what's

402
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,437
I just don't know what i would
tell my grandson about what's
happening in history now.

403
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,473
Tell my grandson about what's
happening in history now.
I imagine i'll be 80 years old,

404
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,542
Happening in history now.
I imagine i'll be 80 years old,
i'll be sitting in my chair, and

405
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,277
I imagine i'll be 80 years old,
i'll be sitting in my chair, and
my grandson will be on the

406
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,845
I'll be sitting in my chair, and
my grandson will be on the
floor, looking up at me

407
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,113
My grandson will be on the
floor, looking up at me
adoringly.

408
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:40,885
Floor, looking up at me
adoringly.
And i'll go, "now, there used to

409
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:45,089
Adoringly.
And i'll go, "now, there used to
be these people called arabs.

410
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,024
And i'll go, "now, there used to
be these people called arabs.
And they lived in the

411
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,626
Be these people called arabs.
And they lived in the
middle east, or, as you call it,

412
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:53,531
And they lived in the
middle east, or, as you call it,
the radiation zone.

413
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,933
Middle east, or, as you call it,
the radiation zone.
In 2020,

414
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:59,070
The radiation zone.
In 2020,
president macaulay culkin got

415
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,705
In 2020,
president macaulay culkin got
really upset with the arabs, and

416
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,440
President macaulay culkin got
really upset with the arabs, and
he nuked them all.

417
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,309
Really upset with the arabs, and
he nuked them all.
But what macaulay culkin and the

418
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,944
He nuked them all.
But what macaulay culkin and the
rest of the americans hadn't

419
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,545
But what macaulay culkin and the
rest of the americans hadn't
realized was that china had

420
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,180
Rest of the americans hadn't
realized was that china had
slowly but surely become the

421
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,648
Realized was that china had
slowly but surely become the
superpower of the world.

422
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,483
Slowly but surely become the
superpower of the world.
So, while the americans were

423
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,385
Superpower of the world.
So, while the americans were
nuking the arabs, the chinese

424
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,421
So, while the americans were
nuking the arabs, the chinese
nuked the americans, and that's

425
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,423
Nuking the arabs, the chinese
nuked the americans, and that's
why we have no americans and no

426
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,158
Nuked the americans, and that's
why we have no americans and no
arabs."

427
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,492
Why we have no americans and no
arabs."
And then my grandson will look

428
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,495
Arabs."
And then my grandson will look
up at me and go...

429
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,764
And then my grandson will look
up at me and go...
"mashaba awa."

430
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:39,444
[ Applause ]
[ laughs ]
you know what i like about that

431
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:39,944
[ Laughs ]
you know what i like about that
joke?

432
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,746
You know what i like about that
joke?
It has the feel of racism, but

433
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:46,284
Joke?
It has the feel of racism, but
you can't pick the exact moment.

434
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,253
It has the feel of racism, but
you can't pick the exact moment.
Like, you know it is.

435
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:51,956
You can't pick the exact moment.
Like, you know it is.
It's definitely racist.

436
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,825
Like, you know it is.
It's definitely racist.
So, let's change the subject

437
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,828
It's definitely racist.
So, let's change the subject
quickly.

438
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,730
So, let's change the subject
quickly.
How do blind people wipe their

439
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,100
Quickly.
How do blind people wipe their
asses?

440
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,701
How do blind people wipe their
asses?
I know you're thinking, "the

441
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,336
Asses?
I know you're thinking, "the
same as us," but you're not

442
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,206
I know you're thinking, "the
same as us," but you're not
thinking outside the box, 'cause

443
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,608
Same as us," but you're not
thinking outside the box, 'cause
wiping your ass is a very visual

444
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,410
Thinking outside the box, 'cause
wiping your ass is a very visual
activity.

445
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,479
Wiping your ass is a very visual
activity.
No one's ever just leant up,

446
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,514
Activity.
No one's ever just leant up,
wiped, then dropped into the

447
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,716
No one's ever just leant up,
wiped, then dropped into the
bowl.

448
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,819
Wiped, then dropped into the
bowl.
You wipe. You check.

449
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,254
Bowl.
You wipe. You check.
"There's a lot of poo there.

450
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,391
You wipe. You check.
"There's a lot of poo there.
I'm gonna wipe again.

451
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,994
"There's a lot of poo there.
I'm gonna wipe again.
There's still a lot of poo.

452
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,729
I'm gonna wipe again.
There's still a lot of poo.
It feels dry, but there's

453
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,632
There's still a lot of poo.
It feels dry, but there's
still poo.

454
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,836
It feels dry, but there's
still poo.
I think i left one up there."

455
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,605
Still poo.
I think i left one up there."
I bet that's where the dog comes

456
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,339
I think i left one up there."
I bet that's where the dog comes
in handy.

457
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,507
I bet that's where the dog comes
in handy.
[ Audience groans ]

458
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,042
In handy.
[ Audience groans ]
ohh!

459
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,276
[ Audience groans ]
ohh!
No!

460
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,879
Ohh!
No!
No, don't --

461
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,714
No!
No, don't --
I'm not saying the dog licks

462
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,817
No, don't --
I'm not saying the dog licks
the blind person's ass!

463
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,185
I'm not saying the dog licks
the blind person's ass!
I'm saying these are very

464
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,120
The blind person's ass!
I'm saying these are very
intelligent dogs.

465
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,889
I'm saying these are very
intelligent dogs.
They would have worked out some

466
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,626
Intelligent dogs.
They would have worked out some
form of barking system.

467
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,961
They would have worked out some
form of barking system.
So, the blind guy would have the

468
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:08,566
Form of barking system.
So, the blind guy would have the
dog, like, sit in front of him.

469
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:13,838
So, the blind guy would have the
dog, like, sit in front of him.
"Woof woof woof."

470
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,308
Dog, like, sit in front of him.
"Woof woof woof."
"Woof woof."

471
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,243
"Woof woof woof."
"Woof woof."
"Woof."

472
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:35,360
And they'd probably work out
some special morse code-Y bark
for when there's blood in the

473
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:41,032
Some special morse code-Y bark
for when there's blood in the
poo.

474
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,533
For when there's blood in the
poo.
No, 'cause they've already been

475
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,601
Poo.
No, 'cause they've already been
through a rough time.

476
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,402
No, 'cause they've already been
through a rough time.
They're blind.

477
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,905
Through a rough time.
They're blind.
No need for ass cancer.

478
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,774
They're blind.
No need for ass cancer.
Not that blood always means

479
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:50,708
No need for ass cancer.
Not that blood always means
ass cancer.

480
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,810
Not that blood always means
ass cancer.
I suffer from hemorrhoids, have

481
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,912
Ass cancer.
I suffer from hemorrhoids, have
done since i was 22 years old.

482
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,314
I suffer from hemorrhoids, have
done since i was 22 years old.
And it's a very young age to get

483
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,648
Done since i was 22 years old.
And it's a very young age to get
hemorrhoids, but there's a lot

484
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,516
And it's a very young age to get
hemorrhoids, but there's a lot
of blood involved.

485
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,984
Hemorrhoids, but there's a lot
of blood involved.
If you've never had one, there's

486
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,352
Of blood involved.
If you've never had one, there's
a lot of blood involved in a bad

487
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:01,953
If you've never had one, there's
a lot of blood involved in a bad
hemorrhoid.

488
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,055
A lot of blood involved in a bad
hemorrhoid.
I've had toilet bowls that look

489
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:07,859
Hemorrhoid.
I've had toilet bowls that look
like abortions.

490
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,094
I've had toilet bowls that look
like abortions.
Now, i'm not -- It's not good.

491
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,629
Like abortions.
Now, i'm not -- It's not good.
And the first time, when you're

492
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,097
Now, i'm not -- It's not good.
And the first time, when you're
22 and you get one, your brain

493
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,098
And the first time, when you're
22 and you get one, your brain
goes to ass cancer.

494
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,500
22 and you get one, your brain
goes to ass cancer.
You're like, "oh, i got ass

495
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,868
Goes to ass cancer.
You're like, "oh, i got ass

the audition today, and i'm
going to give him a lift.

619
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,673

So if you don't hear from me in

We got like a 15-Mile drive.

So i get in.
We got like a 15-Mile drive.
I say fucking nothing for the

630
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,664
I say fucking nothing for the

I just look forward.

00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,033
First 5 miles.
I just look forward.
And eventually i turn to her and

632
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,235
I just look forward.
And eventually i turn to her and
go, "you've just made this rape

633
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,438
And eventually i turn to her and
go, "you've just made this rape
really awkward."

634
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,175
Go, "you've just made this rape
really awkward."
She fucking freaks out!

635
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,610
Really awkward."
She fucking freaks out!
She slams her foot on the

636
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,177
She fucking freaks out!
She slams her foot on the
brakes.

637
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,646
She slams her foot on the
brakes.
She skids off the highway.

638
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,114
Brakes.
She skids off the highway.
She starts slapping at me.

639
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,515
She skids off the highway.
She starts slapping at me.
I'm grabbing her wrists.

640
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,117
She starts slapping at me.
I'm grabbing her wrists.
Now i feel kind of rapey, and

641
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,619
I'm grabbing her wrists.
Now i feel kind of rapey, and
i didn't want to.

642
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,021
Now i feel kind of rapey, and
i didn't want to.
And it's like, "you offered the

643
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,155

And it's like, "you offered the

lift!

646
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,326
I didn't ask for the fucking

but let's go back to the dry

726
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,680
[ Applause ]
but let's go back to the dry
cunt.

727
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,081
But let's go back to the dry
cunt.
There are women in the room who

728
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,449
Cunt.
There are women in the room who
are thinking, "maybe i wouldn't

729
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,684
There are women in the room who
are thinking, "maybe i wouldn't
be dry if there was a bit of

730
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,385
Are thinking, "maybe i wouldn't
be dry if there was a bit of
foreplay."

731
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,454
Be dry if there was a bit of
foreplay."
Let's explain foreplay.

732
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,289
Foreplay."
Let's explain foreplay.
Foreplay is what we do to each

733
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,024
Let's explain foreplay.
Foreplay is what we do to each
other to get each other ready

734
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:54,725
Foreplay is what we do to each
other to get each other ready
for sex.

735
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,195
Other to get each other ready
for sex.
If i have an erection, that

736
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,398
For sex.
If i have an erection, that
means i'm ready for sex and

737
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,301
If i have an erection, that
means i'm ready for sex and
i'm all foreplayed out.

738
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,669
Means i'm ready for sex and
i'm all foreplayed out.
Now, the foreplay that's

739
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,404
I'm all foreplayed out.
Now, the foreplay that's
necessary for a woman goes like

740
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,441
Now, the foreplay that's
necessary for a woman goes like

Dan's asked me to take him to

"Andrew, look, here's the deal.
Dan's asked me to take him to
a prostitute.

991
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,019
Dan's asked me to take him to
a prostitute.
I'm gonna do it whether you like

992
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,387
A prostitute.
I'm gonna do it whether you like

995
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,057
Brother, you should come along
and help out."
And andrew went, "we're not

And i went --
[ Exhales heavily ]

00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,704
[ Exhales heavily ]
"he's gonna die soon anyway.
This is a good way for him to

"He's gonna die soon anyway.
This is a good way for him to
go.

1004
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,073
This is a good way for him to
go.
Like, sure, we'll have to answer

1005
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:07,511
Go.
Like, sure, we'll have to answer
a few questions."

1006
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,845
Like, sure, we'll have to answer
a few questions."
And he said, "we're not doing

1007
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:09,146
A few questions."
And he said, "we're not doing
it."

1008
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,047
And he said, "we're not doing
it."
And i said, "why?"

1009
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,415
It."
And i said, "why?"
And he goes, "'cause mom doesn't

1010
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,517
And i said, "why?"
And he goes, "'cause mom doesn't
like you already!"

1011
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,485
And he goes, "'cause mom doesn't
like you already!"
And i went, "your mom's never

1012
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,620
Like you already!"
And i went, "your mom's never
liked me!

1013
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,155
And i went, "your mom's never
liked me!
That's why i'm the right guy to

1014
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:21,892
Liked me!
That's why i'm the right guy to
kill your brother!"

1015
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,160
That's why i'm the right guy to
kill your brother!"
And he said, "all right, we'll

1016
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,327
Kill your brother!"
And he said, "all right, we'll
do it, but he can't have full

1017
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:24,628
And he said, "all right, we'll
do it, but he can't have full
sex.

1018
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,263
Do it, but he can't have full
sex.
Full sex will kill him.

1019
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:27,998
Sex.
Full sex will kill him.
He can only have a blowjob."

1020
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,499
Full sex will kill him.
He can only have a blowjob."
And i thought that was fairly

1021
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,967
He can only have a blowjob."
And i thought that was fairly
reasonable.

1022
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,170
And i thought that was fairly
reasonable.
So, we went back in and saw dan.

1023
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,638
Reasonable.
So, we went back in and saw dan.
He was where we left him.

1024
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,177
So, we went back in and saw dan.
He was where we left him.
And we said...

1025
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,712
He was where we left him.
And we said...
"dan, here's the deal -- I know

1026

You can only have a blowjob."
And dan went, "i want full sex."
And his brother andrew went,

1036
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,694
And dan went, "i want full sex."
And his brother andrew went,
"dan, you're in no position to

And his brother andrew went,
"dan, you're in no position to

1038
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,799
"Dan, you're in no position to

Then dan reluctantly agreed.

1039
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,869
Argue with anyone, ever."
Then dan reluctantly agreed.
Now, prostitution in australia

1040
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,637
Then dan reluctantly agreed.
Now, prostitution in australia
is legal, so i spent the rest of

Now, prostitution in australia
is legal, so i spent the rest of

the afternoon going through the
phonebook, trying to find a

1043
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,743
The afternoon going through the

brothel with wheelchair access.

1044
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:18,081
Phonebook, trying to find a

[ Scattered applause ]

00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,918
Best afternoon ever!
[ Scattered applause ]
eventually, i found one, the

1047
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,520
[ Scattered applause ]
eventually, i found one, the
biggest brothel in the southern

1048
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,988
Eventually, i found one, the
biggest brothel in the southern
hemisphere, the daily planet,

1049
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,556
Biggest brothel in the southern
hemisphere, the daily planet,
or, as the australians call it,

1050
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,826
Hemisphere, the daily planet,
or, as the australians call it,
"four floors of whores."

1051
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,195
Or, as the australians call it,
"four floors of whores."
It's a 24-Hour brothel because

1052
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:35,098
"Four floors of whores."
It's a 24-Hour brothel because
australia's a go-Ahead country.

1053
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,766
It's a 24-Hour brothel because
australia's a go-Ahead country.
So, we decided we were gonna go

1054
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,201
Australia's a go-Ahead country.
So, we decided we were gonna go
early in the morning, like

1055
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,769
So, we decided we were gonna go
early in the morning, like
really early, like 6:00 a.M.

1056
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,204
Early in the morning, like
really early, like 6:00 a.M.
We wanted to go in when the

1057
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,739
Really early, like 6:00 a.M.
We wanted to go in when the
place was quiet and we weren't

1058
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,574
We wanted to go in when the
place was quiet and we weren't
gonna cause a scene.

1059
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,042
Place was quiet and we weren't
gonna cause a scene.
So, we wake him up at 6:00 in

1060
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:46,810
Gonna cause a scene.
So, we wake him up at 6:00 in
the morning.

1061
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,411
So, we wake him up at 6:00 in
the morning.
It's hard to tell if he's awake.

1062
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:53,049
The morning.
It's hard to tell if he's awake.
And we get him in his chair.

1063
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,417
It's hard to tell if he's awake.
And we get him in his chair.
Now, he hasn't got your

1064
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,219
And we get him in his chair.
Now, he hasn't got your
bog-Standard fucking wheelchair.

1065
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,921
Now, he hasn't got your
bog-Standard fucking wheelchair.
He's got one of those big sort

1066
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,589
Bog-Standard fucking wheelchair.
He's got one of those big sort
of silver-Looking things with

1067
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,591
He's got one of those big sort
of silver-Looking things with
the truck tires on it.

1068
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,959
Of silver-Looking things with
the truck tires on it.
I think the model's called a

1069
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,027
The truck tires on it.
I think the model's called a
hawking.

1070
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:08,965
I think the model's called a
hawking.
And even though his muscles

1071
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,467
Hawking.
And even though his muscles
don't work, they get sore.

1072
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,235
And even though his muscles
don't work, they get sore.
So, this thing can move him from

1073
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,937
Don't work, they get sore.
So, this thing can move him from
side to side and back to front

1074
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,372
So, this thing can move him from
side to side and back to front
and even into a full bed.

1075
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,773
Side to side and back to front
and even into a full bed.
So, we get him in the chair.

1076
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,074
And even into a full bed.
So, we get him in the chair.
Then we order a taxi.

1077
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,476
So, we get him in the chair.
Then we order a taxi.
And then -- It's not like you

1078
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,777
Then we order a taxi.
And then -- It's not like you
have black cabs out there.

1079
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,013
And then -- It's not like you
have black cabs out there.
It's like a normal car, but

1080
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,482
Have black cabs out there.
It's like a normal car, but
they've modified the back to go

1081
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,851
It's like a normal car, but
they've modified the back to go
higher, and they drive him up

1082
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,353
They've modified the back to go
higher, and they drive him up
through the boot and they strap

1083
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,256
Higher, and they drive him up
through the boot and they strap
him in there and he sits up

1084
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:35,125
Through the boot and they strap
him in there and he sits up
high, with windows all around

1085
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,760
Him in there and he sits up
high, with windows all around
him, like a big, retarded

1086
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,196
High, with windows all around
him, like a big, retarded
pope...

1087
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,231
Him, like a big, retarded
pope...
or, as the catholics would say,

1088
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,067
Pope...
or, as the catholics would say,
the pope.

1089
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,703
Or, as the catholics would say,
the pope.
[ Applause ]

1090
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,139
The pope.
[ Applause ]
and we drive up to the brothel.

1091
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,907
[ Applause ]
and we drive up to the brothel.
Now, when we get to the brothel,

1092
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,576
And we drive up to the brothel.
Now, when we get to the brothel,
it takes 10 minutes to get him

1093
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:53,443
Now, when we get to the brothel,
it takes 10 minutes to get him
off the taxi.

1094
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,945
It takes 10 minutes to get him
off the taxi.
I see this as my window of

1095
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,580
Off the taxi.
I see this as my window of
opportunity, so while they're

1096
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,281
I see this as my window of
opportunity, so while they're
getting him off the taxi, i run

1097
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:59,349
Opportunity, so while they're
getting him off the taxi, i run
into the brothel.

1098
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,984
Getting him off the taxi, i run
into the brothel.
Now, there's two ways that

1099
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:01,985
Into the brothel.
Now, there's two ways that
brothels work.

1100
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,687
Now, there's two ways that
brothels work.
Either the prostitutes will

1101
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,622
Brothels work.
Either the prostitutes will
stand in a row in their lingerie

1102
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,457
Either the prostitutes will
stand in a row in their lingerie
and you just pick the one that

1103
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,092
Stand in a row in their lingerie
and you just pick the one that
you want, or they'll stand

1104
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,061
And you just pick the one that
you want, or they'll stand
around in a bar in evening gowns

1105
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,896
You want, or they'll stand
around in a bar in evening gowns
and high heels and you walk up

1106
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,631
Around in a bar in evening gowns
and high heels and you walk up
to the one that you like the

1107
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,533
And high heels and you walk up
to the one that you like the
look of, chat to her for a bit,

1108
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,501
To the one that you like the
look of, chat to her for a bit,
act like you've got some type of

Look of, chat to her for a bit,
act like you've got some type of
connection with an eastern

1110
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,905
Act like you've got some type of
connection with an eastern
european woman, then take her

1111
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,673
Connection with an eastern
european woman, then take her
upstairs and fuck her if you

1112
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,242
European woman, then take her
upstairs and fuck her if you
need your life to be this

1113
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,244
Upstairs and fuck her if you
need your life to be this
delusional.

1114
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,079
Need your life to be this
delusional.
This is one of these situations.

1115
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,747
Delusional.
This is one of these situations.
So, while they're getting dan

1116
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,449
This is one of these situations.
So, while they're getting dan
out of the cab, i run into the

1117
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:33,950
So, while they're getting dan
out of the cab, i run into the
brothel and go, "everyone,

1118
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,654
Out of the cab, i run into the
brothel and go, "everyone,
quickly, gather 'round!

1119
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,690
Brothel and go, "everyone,
quickly, gather 'round!
I haven't got much time!"

1120
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,425
Quickly, gather 'round!
I haven't got much time!"
And these 14 bemused hookers

1121
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,027
I haven't got much time!"
And these 14 bemused hookers
shuffle over, and i went,

1122
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:47,964
And these 14 bemused hookers
shuffle over, and i went,
"look -- Here's the deal.

1123
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,267
Shuffle over, and i went,
"look -- Here's the deal.
I have a severely disabled

1124
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,334
"Look -- Here's the deal.
I have a severely disabled
friend with me.

1125
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,570
I have a severely disabled
friend with me.
If you're not up for it, speak

1126
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:57,173
Friend with me.
If you're not up for it, speak
now or forever hold your peace."

1127
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,009
If you're not up for it, speak
now or forever hold your peace."
And one of them went, "how bad

1128
00:37:59,011 --> 00:37:59,609
Now or forever hold your peace."
And one of them went, "how bad
is he?"

1129
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:05,448
And one of them went, "how bad
is he?"
And i went, "[ chuckles ]

1130
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,051
Is he?"
And i went, "[ chuckles ]
pretty fucking bad."

1131
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,352
And i went, "[ chuckles ]
pretty fucking bad."
And 10 of them said they

1132
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,787
Pretty fucking bad."
And 10 of them said they
wouldn't do it, and i said,

1133
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,356
And 10 of them said they
wouldn't do it, and i said,
"well, i respect that, but can

1134
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,758
Wouldn't do it, and i said,
"well, i respect that, but can
you please go and hide?

1135
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,925
"Well, i respect that, but can
you please go and hide?
Because i don't want him to be

1136
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,095
You please go and hide?
Because i don't want him to be
rejected by hookers."

1137
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,064
Because i don't want him to be
rejected by hookers."
And these 10 girls shuffle away

1138
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,066
Rejected by hookers."
And these 10 girls shuffle away
in their evening gowns and their

1139
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,734
And these 10 girls shuffle away
in their evening gowns and their
high heels, with gonorrhea

1140
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,937
In their evening gowns and their
high heels, with gonorrhea
falling out of them.

1141
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,773
High heels, with gonorrhea
falling out of them.
I am now left with four girls.

1142
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,508
Falling out of them.
I am now left with four girls.
The best-Looking one by a mile

1143
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,208
I am now left with four girls.
The best-Looking one by a mile
stays.

1144
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,943
The best-Looking one by a mile
stays.
Dan wheels in, looking like

1145
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,779
Stays.
Dan wheels in, looking like
jabba the hut, breathing like

1146
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,714
Dan wheels in, looking like
jabba the hut, breathing like
darth vader.

1147
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,249
Jabba the hut, breathing like
darth vader.
Two of the girls run away, and

1148
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,550
Darth vader.
Two of the girls run away, and
i'm like, "are you fucking

1149
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,453
Two of the girls run away, and
i'm like, "are you fucking
kidding, you sluts?

1150
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:46,990
I'm like, "are you fucking
kidding, you sluts?
I just asked you nicely."

1151
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,358
Kidding, you sluts?
I just asked you nicely."
So we're now left with two

1152
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,259
I just asked you nicely."
So we're now left with two
girls.

1153
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,994
So we're now left with two
girls.
The best-Looking one's there.

1154
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,164
Girls.
The best-Looking one's there.
The other one's a fucking troll.

1155
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,266
The best-Looking one's there.
The other one's a fucking troll.
Now, out of respect for the ugly

1156
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:58,902
The other one's a fucking troll.
Now, out of respect for the ugly
one, i go to dan -- I go, "dan,

1157
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:01,438
Now, out of respect for the ugly
one, i go to dan -- I go, "dan,
there's only two girls working

1158
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,175
One, i go to dan -- I go, "dan,
there's only two girls working
today, mate.

1159
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,277
There's only two girls working
today, mate.
Which one do you want?"

1160
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:08,511
Today, mate.
Which one do you want?"
And he said, "the one in the

1161
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,979
Which one do you want?"
And he said, "the one in the
green dress."

1162
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,482
And he said, "the one in the
green dress."
Now, neither of them had a

1163
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,385
Green dress."
Now, neither of them had a
green dress.

1164
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,753
Now, neither of them had a
green dress.
I stand up and look at andrew

1165
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,188
Green dress.
I stand up and look at andrew
and went, "what the fuck is all

1166
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,888
I stand up and look at andrew
and went, "what the fuck is all
this about?"

1167
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,057
And went, "what the fuck is all
this about?"
And andrew went, "oh, yeah, his

1168
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,660
This about?"
And andrew went, "oh, yeah, his
eyes are fucked, as well."

1169
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,095
And andrew went, "oh, yeah, his
eyes are fucked, as well."
Now, it turns out that dan's

1170
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:25,729
Eyes are fucked, as well."
Now, it turns out that dan's
colorblind.

1171
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,263
Now, it turns out that dan's
colorblind.
It's not part of the condition.

1172
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:32,669
Colorblind.
It's not part of the condition.
It's just unfortunate.

1173
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:39,109
It's not part of the condition.
It's just unfortunate.
So...i sat with the hooker.

1174
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:40,543
It's just unfortunate.
So...i sat with the hooker.
Now, i'm gonna pay for

1175
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,180
So...i sat with the hooker.
Now, i'm gonna pay for
everything.

1176
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,448
Now, i'm gonna pay for
everything.
Now, the reason i'm gonna pay

1177
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,117
Everything.
Now, the reason i'm gonna pay
for everything is simple.

1178
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,852
Now, the reason i'm gonna pay
for everything is simple.
I told dan and andrew that i

1179
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,587
For everything is simple.
I told dan and andrew that i
would pay for everything, as

1180
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,522
I told dan and andrew that i
would pay for everything, as
long as i got to tell this story

1181
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,224
Would pay for everything, as
long as i got to tell this story
to hundreds of thousands of

1182
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,292
Long as i got to tell this story
to hundreds of thousands of
people in the future.

1183
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,294
To hundreds of thousands of
people in the future.
And they said, "of course you

1184
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,397
People in the future.
And they said, "of course you
can, jim, but be respectful and

1185
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,565
And they said, "of course you
can, jim, but be respectful and
change our names," which sounds

1186
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,734
Can, jim, but be respectful and
change our names," which sounds
like the right thing to do, now,

1187
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,504
Change our names," which sounds
like the right thing to do, now,
doesn't it?

1188
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:09,139
Like the right thing to do, now,
doesn't it?
Now, i haven't changed their

1189
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,040
Doesn't it?
Now, i haven't changed their
names.

1190
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,109
Now, i haven't changed their
names.
Their names are andrew and

1191
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,311
Names.
Their names are andrew and
daniel connor from st kilda,

1192
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:18,047
Their names are andrew and
daniel connor from st kilda,
melbourne, australia.

1193
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,582
Daniel connor from st kilda,
melbourne, australia.
I would have liked to have

1194
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,784
Melbourne, australia.
I would have liked to have
changed their names.

1195
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,419
I would have liked to have
changed their names.
It is the right thing to do.

1196
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,421
Changed their names.
It is the right thing to do.
But i look at this way -- Even

1197
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,322
It is the right thing to do.
But i look at this way -- Even
if i changed their names and

1198
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,324
But i look at this way -- Even
if i changed their names and
their parents started watching

1199
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,326
If i changed their names and
their parents started watching
my comedy, they'd be like, "my

1200
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,429
Their parents started watching
my comedy, they'd be like, "my
word, doesn't 'randy' and

1201
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:37,500
My comedy, they'd be like, "my
word, doesn't 'randy' and
'steve' sound like our kids?

1202
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,402
Word, doesn't 'randy' and
'steve' sound like our kids?
Didn't jim grow up with a lot of

1203
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:47,477
'Steve' sound like our kids?
Didn't jim grow up with a lot of
people with muscular dystrophy?"

1204
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,012
Didn't jim grow up with a lot of
people with muscular dystrophy?"
So, i sat there with the hooker,

1205
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,413
People with muscular dystrophy?"
So, i sat there with the hooker,
and i said, "how much for the

1206
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,080
So, i sat there with the hooker,
and i said, "how much for the
half-Hour?"

1207
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,148
And i said, "how much for the
half-Hour?"
And she said, "$180."

1208
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,650
Half-Hour?"
And she said, "$180."
And i said, "i'll give you $250

1209
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,318
And she said, "$180."
And i said, "i'll give you $250
'cause i realize this is a

1210
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,520
And i said, "i'll give you $250
'cause i realize this is a
specialty thing you're doing."

1211
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,788
'Cause i realize this is a
specialty thing you're doing."
And she goes, "i got one

1212
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,256
Specialty thing you're doing."
And she goes, "i got one
question for you," and i said,

1213
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,359
And she goes, "i got one
question for you," and i said,
"shoot," and she went...

1214
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,162
Question for you," and i said,
"shoot," and she went...
"is he mentally retarded?"

1215
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:13,870
"Shoot," and she went...
"is he mentally retarded?"
And i went...

1216
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:16,239
"Is he mentally retarded?"
And i went...
"oh, yeah.

1217
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,308
And i went...
"oh, yeah.
That's what i do.

1218
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,344
"Oh, yeah.
That's what i do.
I find mentally retarded people

1219
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:25,982
That's what i do.
I find mentally retarded people
and take them to prostitutes.

1220
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,784
I find mentally retarded people
and take them to prostitutes.
I'll be masturbating in the

1221
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,453
And take them to prostitutes.
I'll be masturbating in the
corner.

1222
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:33,556
I'll be masturbating in the
corner.
He doesn't even know he's here."

1223
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,225
Corner.
He doesn't even know he's here."
And she went, "okay, then, but

1224
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,626
He doesn't even know he's here."
And she went, "okay, then, but
if there's two of you --"

1225
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:40,129
And she went, "okay, then, but
if there's two of you --"
"No, he's not mentally retarded!

1226
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,631
If there's two of you --"
"No, he's not mentally retarded!
It's his choice to come here!

1227
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:42,832
"No, he's not mentally retarded!
It's his choice to come here!
There's a good chance he'll

1228
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,002
It's his choice to come here!
There's a good chance he'll
die!"

1229
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,537
There's a good chance he'll
die!"
And she went, "what am i meant

1230
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,438
Die!"
And she went, "what am i meant
to do with him?"

1231
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,807
And she went, "what am i meant
to do with him?"
And i went, "i don't know.

1232
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:54,577
To do with him?"
And i went, "i don't know.
I've never been a hooker.

1233
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,946
And i went, "i don't know.
I've never been a hooker.
But i'm thinking give him a bit

1234
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:57,914
I've never been a hooker.
But i'm thinking give him a bit
of a show.

1235
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,983
But i'm thinking give him a bit
of a show.
Dance it around a bit.

1236
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:02,185
Of a show.
Dance it around a bit.
Rub your tits in his face.

1237
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,521
Dance it around a bit.
Rub your tits in his face.
Then suck him off.

1238
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,289
Rub your tits in his face.
Then suck him off.
But don't sit on him or fuck

1239
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,790
Then suck him off.
But don't sit on him or fuck
him.

1240
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:14,097
But don't sit on him or fuck
him.
It'll kill him."

1241
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,532
Him.
It'll kill him."
So, we go up to the room, which,

1242
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,799
It'll kill him."
So, we go up to the room, which,
thank god, was on the first

1243
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,703
So, we go up to the room, which,
thank god, was on the first
floor.

1244
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,705
Thank god, was on the first
floor.
And me and andrew look at dan

1245
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,874
Floor.
And me and andrew look at dan
like two proud parents, watching

1246
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,910
And me and andrew look at dan
like two proud parents, watching
our child go to school for the

1247
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:34,083
Like two proud parents, watching
our child go to school for the
first time.

1248
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:34,918
Our child go to school for the
first time.
And then we leave.

1249
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,119
First time.
And then we leave.
And as we proceed to leave, i

1250
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,320
And then we leave.
And as we proceed to leave, i
pat andrew on the back, and i

1251
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,488
And as we proceed to leave, i
pat andrew on the back, and i
said, "andrew, you've been a

1252
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,389
Pat andrew on the back, and i
said, "andrew, you've been a
good brother today."

1253
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,490
Said, "andrew, you've been a
good brother today."
He said, "thanks, mate."

1254
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:41,357
Good brother today."
He said, "thanks, mate."
Then we had a hug.

1255
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,559
He said, "thanks, mate."
Then we had a hug.
And then we had that moment

1256
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:43,826
Then we had a hug.
And then we had that moment
after our hug that australian

1257
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,194
And then we had that moment
after our hug that australian
men have, where we go, "ah, get

1258
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:45,828
After our hug that australian
men have, where we go, "ah, get
out of here.

1259
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,264
Men have, where we go, "ah, get
out of here.
What's wrong with ya?"

1260
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,667
Out of here.
What's wrong with ya?"
And then i said, "hey, andrew,

1261
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,402
What's wrong with ya?"
And then i said, "hey, andrew,
how does dan get his clothes

1262
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,704
And then i said, "hey, andrew,
how does dan get his clothes
off?"

1263
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,240
How does dan get his clothes
off?"
And andrew went...

1264
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,442
Off?"
And andrew went...
"fuck!"

1265
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:02,478
And andrew went...
"fuck!"
And we went back in.

1266
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,746
"Fuck!"
And we went back in.
Andrew looks him up and down,

1267
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,981
And we went back in.
Andrew looks him up and down,
and he turns to me and goes,

1268
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,750
Andrew looks him up and down,
and he turns to me and goes,
"look -- He's very fragile.

1269
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,152
And he turns to me and goes,
"look -- He's very fragile.
I know how he likes to be

1270
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,587
"Look -- He's very fragile.
I know how he likes to be
picked up.

1271
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,654
I know how he likes to be
picked up.
I'll lift him up.

1272
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:13,923
Picked up.
I'll lift him up.
You take his pants off."

1273
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,592
I'll lift him up.
You take his pants off."
Andrew gets behind, lifts him up

1274
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:16,893
You take his pants off."
Andrew gets behind, lifts him up
by his armpits -- Like i

1275
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,461
Andrew gets behind, lifts him up
by his armpits -- Like i
couldn't have figured out their

1276
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:23,366
By his armpits -- Like i
couldn't have figured out their
magical hold.

1277
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,201
Couldn't have figured out their
magical hold.
I'm on my knees taking dan's

1278
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,636
Magical hold.
I'm on my knees taking dan's
track-Suit pants off.

1279
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:28,705
I'm on my knees taking dan's
track-Suit pants off.
He always wore track-Suit pants,

1280
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,273
Track-Suit pants off.
He always wore track-Suit pants,
never got into fashion.

1281
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,642
He always wore track-Suit pants,
never got into fashion.
And as i'm taking his track-Suit

1282
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,978
Never got into fashion.
And as i'm taking his track-Suit
pants off, what many of you are

1283
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,146
And as i'm taking his track-Suit
pants off, what many of you are
wondering is, "can dan get an

1284
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:40,149
Pants off, what many of you are
wondering is, "can dan get an
erection?"

1285
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,019
Wondering is, "can dan get an
erection?"
And the answer is, "yes."

1286
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,287
Erection?"
And the answer is, "yes."
Even though none of the muscles

1287
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,521
And the answer is, "yes."
Even though none of the muscles
in his body work, the cock is

1288
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:46,155
Even though none of the muscles
in his body work, the cock is
not a muscle.

1289
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,323
In his body work, the cock is
not a muscle.
The cock is a bit of skin that

1290
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,191
Not a muscle.
The cock is a bit of skin that
fills with blood.

1291
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:49,959
The cock is a bit of skin that
fills with blood.
If he gets aroused up here,

1292
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,594
Fills with blood.
If he gets aroused up here,
blood will rush to there.

1293
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:55,865
If he gets aroused up here,
blood will rush to there.
Now, what nobody knew about this

1294
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:59,402
Blood will rush to there.
Now, what nobody knew about this
32-Year-Old virgin is that dan's

1295
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,838
Now, what nobody knew about this
32-Year-Old virgin is that dan's
packing heat!

1296
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,307
32-Year-Old virgin is that dan's
packing heat!
I'm talking 9 1/2 inches of

1297
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,843
Packing heat!
I'm talking 9 1/2 inches of
disabled misery.

1298
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,378
I'm talking 9 1/2 inches of
disabled misery.
This cock's so fucking big, i

1299
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,079
Disabled misery.
This cock's so fucking big, i
think that's why the rest of his

1300
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,181
This cock's so fucking big, i
think that's why the rest of his
muscles didn't work.

1301
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,650
Think that's why the rest of his
muscles didn't work.
I take the pants off.

1302
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,585
Muscles didn't work.
I take the pants off.
This thing springs up and hits

1303
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:17,553
I take the pants off.
This thing springs up and hits
me in the mouth.

1304
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:32,502
Then the hooker goes, "let's do
the light."
Let's explain the light.

1305
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,037
The light."
Let's explain the light.
When they legalized prostitution

1306
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,238
Let's explain the light.
When they legalized prostitution
in australia, they didn't

1307
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,506
When they legalized prostitution
in australia, they didn't
legalize it in all forms.

1308
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:37,940
In australia, they didn't
legalize it in all forms.
For instance, you cannot get a

1309
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,042
Legalize it in all forms.
For instance, you cannot get a
street-Walking hooker.

1310
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,510
For instance, you cannot get a
street-Walking hooker.
You cannot get a prostitute to

1311
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:41,377
Street-Walking hooker.
You cannot get a prostitute to
your hotel room.

1312
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,879
You cannot get a prostitute to
your hotel room.
You can only go to a brothel, in

1313
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,313
Your hotel room.
You can only go to a brothel, in
a safe environment, where they

1314
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,782
You can only go to a brothel, in
a safe environment, where they
have security for the girls in

1315
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,116
A safe environment, where they
have security for the girls in
case a man shows up being a

1316
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:49,419
Have security for the girls in
case a man shows up being a
drunken dickhead or whatever.

1317
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,154
Case a man shows up being a
drunken dickhead or whatever.
And also it's safer for the

1318
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:52,855
Drunken dickhead or whatever.
And also it's safer for the
people that go to brothels

1319
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,924
And also it's safer for the
people that go to brothels
because the girls get tested for

1320
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,693
People that go to brothels
because the girls get tested for
stds every month.

1321
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,495
Because the girls get tested for
stds every month.
So, arguably, you're better off

1322
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,531
Stds every month.
So, arguably, you're better off
in australia fucking a

1323
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,133
So, arguably, you're better off
in australia fucking a
prostitute than picking up a

1324
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,601
In australia fucking a
prostitute than picking up a
girl in a bar.

1325
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,503
Prostitute than picking up a
girl in a bar.
But i'm not gonna have that

1326
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:10,239
Girl in a bar.
But i'm not gonna have that
conversation again.

1327
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,975
But i'm not gonna have that
conversation again.
All my -- You try explaining

1328
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:13,976
Conversation again.
All my -- You try explaining
that to a girlfriend.

1329
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:19,215
All my -- You try explaining
that to a girlfriend.
It's a fucking minefield.

1330
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,050
That to a girlfriend.
It's a fucking minefield.
But also they make it safe for

1331
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:21,818
It's a fucking minefield.
But also they make it safe for
the girls.

1332
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,619
But also they make it safe for
the girls.
If you're a guy who goes to a

1333
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,455
The girls.
If you're a guy who goes to a
prostitute, you have to undergo

1334
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:26,255
If you're a guy who goes to a
prostitute, you have to undergo
the light.

1335
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,323
Prostitute, you have to undergo
the light.
Let's explain the light.

1336
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,324
The light.
Let's explain the light.
It's very simple.

1337
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,593
Let's explain the light.
It's very simple.
It sounds like what it is.

1338
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:33,796
It's very simple.
It sounds like what it is.
You put your cock under a very

1339
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:36,165
It sounds like what it is.
You put your cock under a very
bright light, and they look

1340
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,501
You put your cock under a very
bright light, and they look
around the shaft to see if

1341
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,703
Bright light, and they look
around the shaft to see if
there's anything untoward.

1342
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:42,872
Around the shaft to see if
there's anything untoward.
Then they get a magnifying glass

1343
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:44,874
There's anything untoward.
Then they get a magnifying glass
out, go through your pubes to

1344
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,743
Then they get a magnifying glass
out, go through your pubes to
make sure nothing's running

1345
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:50,279
Out, go through your pubes to
make sure nothing's running
around.

1346
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,714
Make sure nothing's running
around.
It's not a big deal.

1347
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:52,982
Around.
It's not a big deal.
I've been rejected heaps of

1348
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:56,285
It's not a big deal.
I've been rejected heaps of
