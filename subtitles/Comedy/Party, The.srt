1
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,840
All right. Cut it.

2
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:20,181
All right. Hold it.

3
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,286
What is that idiot doin'?

4
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:38,700
What's that idiot doing?

5
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,428
-l just asked the same question.
-What's the answer?

6
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:41,741
l don't know.
l didn't tell him to--

7
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,117
Don't know?
Look, you're the director.

8
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,806
lt was your idea to bring him
over here from lndia.

9
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,731
Now, you'd better start
telling him what to do...

10
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,866
or we're gonna be
out of business. Now, go ahead.

11
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,738
Come on.

12
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,351
-Charlie.
-Yeah?

13
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,490
You ready? Action!

14
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,247
Cut, damn it! Cut!

15
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:50,992
-Mr. Bakshi.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,430
Has it occurred to you...

17
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,242
that the period
of our picture is 1878?

18
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:56,934
Yes, indeed, sir.
l am well aware...

19
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,586
that that is the period
of the film. 1878.

20
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:01,378
Mr. Bakshi,
are you also aware...

21
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:05,470
that in 1878 they weren't
wearing underwater watches?

22
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:08,504
Yes, sir. l know that.
They had not even been invented.

23
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:09,972
You got the time?

24
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,794
Yes, it's...oh, my God.

25
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,769
All right.
Lunch everybody.

26
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:17,807
That's forty-two on the crew,
one hour for the cast.

27
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,499
OK, guys.
The cue for the demolition...

28
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,963
is when l lower my hand
like this, OK?

29
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:31,011
-Yes, sir.
-Guys, we got one shot at this.

30
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:32,872
Let's get it right.

31
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:34,017
OK, Kenny. Let's go.

32
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:35,332
All right. Places everybody.

33
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,147
Marty. Look, l just talked
to Clutterbuck on the phone.

34
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,219
He says if we don't wrap this
location today, it's your neck.

35
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,874
No problem. All we have left
is to blow up the fort.

36
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:45,212
OK. Great.

37
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:50,808
OK, Ken. Let's go.

38
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,141
All right. Carol. Earl.

39
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,385
All right. Stand by.

40
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,279
You.

41
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:27,156
Yes, you.

42
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:31,411
You get off of my set
and get out of my picture.

43
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:34,377
Off. Out. You're through.

44
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:36,238
You're washed up.
You're finished.

45
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,084
l'll see to it you never
make another movie again!

46
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:42,437
Does that include
television, sir?

47
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:45,405
l'll kill him !

48
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,961
Mr. Divot calling
from location on six.

49
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,143
All right.

50
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,536
Yeah, Charlie.

51
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,939
What?

52
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,306
The whole damn thing?

53
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,120
Well, how the hell could
a thing like that happen?

54
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,572
What's his name?

55
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:22,718
Spell it!

56
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:25,885
Hrundi V.

57
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:31,765
B-a-k-s-h-i.

58
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:35,631
l'll see to it he never
works again in this town.

59
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:38,038
Your wife called about
the guest list for the party.

60
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:40,371
Yeah, on the desk.
You know where to reach me.

61
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:07,219
l need an address
for Hrundi V. Bakshi.

62
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,159
B-a-k-s-h-i.

63
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,386
Hello.

64
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,902
Vodka or scotch, sir?

65
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:42,608
No. l...

66
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,463
l never touch it.
Thank you.

67
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:05,265
Twenty-week layoff
that you've never seen--

68
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,518
No, thank you.

69
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:09,489
Hors d'oeuvres, sir?

70
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:12,461
Well, l'm on a diet,
but the hell with it.

71
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,590
-Pool.
-Pool.

72
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,627
-Pool is water, no?
-No, billiards.

73
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,701
Says the father,
''Oh, my goodness.

74
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,392
''We got the wrong baby,''
and the father says...

75
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,078
''Shh. lt's a better buggy.''

76
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:01,186
l never heard that one before.

77
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,625
Oh, yes. You...

78
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,306
l missed the middle part,
but l can tell from the way...

79
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:14,519
that you are
enjoying yourselves...

80
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,465
it must have been
a very humorous anecdote...

81
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,935
because the way
you are laughing...

82
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,463
just shows how much
you enjoyed it.

83
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:23,599
l love a good laugh, don't you?
lt makes the world go round.

84
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:27,179
lt's good to have a laugh.
Wonderful.

85
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:30,093
Very good.

86
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,866
l shall remember that one.

87
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,824
They were bound and gagged
for six hours.

88
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,351
They took everything...

89
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,431
even the gold watch
my daddy'd left me.

90
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:01,896
They took the gold watch
that your father left you?

91
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,463
l'm sorry.

92
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,965
lt is utterly fantastic.

93
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,348
What a wonderful thing
for anyone to do.

94
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,485
Take everything,
including the father's watch.

95
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,432
lt's wonderful.

96
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:13,471
l tell you, tonight
is one big round of laughter.

97
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,266
All fun and laughter.

98
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,642
The congressman
was just telling us...

99
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:21,175
about the time he was robbed.

100
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,448
Who's the foreigner?

101
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,013
l don't know.

102
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:34,224
Someone my mixed-up wife
invited.

103
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:37,351
Oh, dear.

104
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,799
Hello, dog.
What do you want?

105
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,355
What do you want, eh?
You like my feet, do you?

106
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:45,801
Have your fill, and away you go.

107
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:49,540
Feet are considered a delicacy
among certain animals.

108
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,302
Go on, you've had enough now.
Off. Chow!

109
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:56,986
ln fact, there are
certain man-eating animals...

110
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:59,410
who will eat only the feet,
leave everything else.

111
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,662
Would not touch one other thing.

112
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:04,046
Get away. Down, now.
Chow, dog.

113
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,257
Get away.

114
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,723
Get away from me, dog.

115
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:08,975
Vodka or scotch, sir?

116
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,920
Get away.
No, thank you.

117
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:14,021
Get away.

118
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,170
Oh, good evening, Mr. Divot.
How are you?

119
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:28,762
How are ya?

120
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,393
Smile, baby.

121
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,433
Good evening, General.

122
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,197
l'd like to have you meet
Miss Michele Monet.

123
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,955
Mr. Clutterbuck,
Mrs. Clutterbuck.

124
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:42,161
How are ya, Alice?

125
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,625
l'll introduce my guests,
if l may.

126
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:44,943
Here, Mrs. Dunphy.

127
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,366
l've heard some wonderful things
about you.

128
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:56,296
Well, sir, you seem to have
a wonderful party going here.

129
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,883
-How do you like it so far?
-Fine.

130
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,122
Have a drink. Go ahead.

131
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:25,036
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

132
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,956
And good evening.

133
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,297
Good evening.

134
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,021
What a beautiful evening it is.

135
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:32,227
To be sure.

136
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:40,733
What's in there?

137
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,392
What, in here?

138
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:47,289
Oh, there is nothing in there.

139
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,503
Yes, there is.

140
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:54,922
l don't know.
l don't think so.

141
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:58,505
-Let's see now. No.
-Don't you see it?

142
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:01,356
No, there is definitely
nothing in there.

143
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,161
lf there were something,
it's gone away now, anyway.

144
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:06,785
Well, l can see it.

145
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,153
What is it?

146
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,640
l don't know,
but l don't like it.

147
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,992
Pardon me, sir.

148
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,454
lt's quite all right, fella.

149
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,055
l'm so sorry.
l beg your pardon.

150
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:36,876
Come on over here, honey.
We'll...try it over here.

151
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,557
Right here, on the corner.
This is an easy shot now.

152
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:40,771
First things first.
Get in the saddle.

153
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,814
Just like l taught you,
that's it.

154
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:44,163
No, l feel silly because--

155
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:45,691
Oh, no, hon,
you can do it this way.

156
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,072
l was here the other day.

157
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,928
Now, just relax, and you--

158
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,317
Just relax. Just--

159
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,585
Pay no attention to me, sir.
l am merely spectating.

160
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,048
Oh. Fine.

161
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,951
l can see that you are
an experienced player.

162
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,477
One of the best, feller.

163
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:03,923
Sir, excuse me.

164
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,515
What is the name of a game...

165
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,941
that has a multitude
of colored balls like that?

166
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,477
-Pool.
-Poo?

167
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,762
-What?
-Poo?

168
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,519
No, not poo. Pool.

169
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:13,984
-Pool!
-Pool.

170
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:15,913
-Oh, like swimming pool.
-You got it, honey.

171
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,602
l never heard of
a game called poo.

172
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:18,816
Fine game.

173
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,195
And so,
what is the object of it--

174
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:23,096
to disperse these colored balls
strategically around the table?

175
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,657
Get the balls in the holes.
All except for the white one.

176
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,004
Oh, that is the art?

177
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,598
The art is not
to have the white one in?

178
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,545
-Right.
-Good.

179
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:32,920
And how many people can play?
One, two, three, or what?

180
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:34,927
Oh, whole bunches,
or twos and threes.

181
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,427
With a group--
groups of people can play.

182
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,778
By yourself. Yes.

183
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,372
Thank goodness.
How wonderful.

184
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,763
Keep your eye
on the white ball--

185
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:53,533
Oh, excuse me.

186
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:56,157
Excuse me, sir, but...

187
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:58,398
you are, are you not...

188
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,984
Wyoming Bill Kelso,
the famous film star?

189
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,615
That's me, in the flesh.

190
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,823
Oh, God,
what a moment in my life.

191
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:07,029
Oh, sir, l've seen
every one of your films.

192
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,203
Oh, well, that's wonderful!

193
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:12,084
What a wonderful,
strong grip you've got.

194
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:13,229
Yes, l do.

195
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:14,609
My goodness, l would
have been disappointed...

196
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:16,202
if you hadn't crushed my hand.

197
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,369
Oh, listen.
Will you do me the honor...

198
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:20,583
to sign me an autograph?

199
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:23,172
Oh, sure. Here, hold this.
l'll be glad to.

200
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,836
l am also in the acting
profession, you know.

201
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:26,814
-Oh, you are?
-Yes, indeed.

202
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,742
l am not in your quality,
but l was around.

203
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:30,659
Well, what's your name?

204
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,211
Hrundi. H-r-u-n-d-i.

205
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,906
Wait till l tell them
at home that l met him.

206
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:36,056
They'll never believe me.

207
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,981
-Where you from?
-l am from lndia.

208
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,728
Got you covered, lnjun!

209
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:44,142
How do you--
Bang! Howdy, pardner.

210
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:45,709
Well, l'm pretty quick
on the draw there, right?

211
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,091
Never l believe
in all my whole life...

212
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,351
l would meet him, and he
would go, ''Bang, pardner!''

213
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:51,629
Listen to me.

214
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:55,339
''White man speak
with, uh, forked tongue!''

215
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,063
And look, mmm-mmm...

216
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:01,763
You old horned toad, buddy!

217
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,141
Cute little feller, isn't he?

218
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,580
l know all your sayings.
l know all of them.

219
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:06,553
Good. Hrundi, say hello--

220
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:08,896
The one where you walk along,
and then you go--

221
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,860
Hrundi, say hello
to Signorina here.

222
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,080
Hello, partner.

223
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:14,676
Piacere.

224
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:16,209
Bakshi.

225
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,256
-There you go.
-Oh, thank you.

226
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,986
This is a wonderful thing
you have done for me.

227
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,135
My pleasure.

228
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,180
Thank you, and l will--
thank you.

229
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,192
l would love to say
that it has been...

230
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:27,240
the greatest moment in my life.

231
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,954
Bang! Aha, got you!
l was quick on the draw.

232
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:33,736
You beat me that time, pal.
That's right.

233
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,801
-Goodness me.
-Lots of luck to you.

234
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,431
And the same to you, sir.

235
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,079
Howdy, pardner!

236
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,857
That was so groovy.

237
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,780
-That was a short dance.
-That's right.

238
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:36,152
And they don't go on
for long, do they?

239
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:38,551
-No, they don't.
-Yes, we just started, and--

240
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:39,827
Well, anyway,
thank you very much.

241
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:40,974
Thank you.

242
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:43,281
Perhaps we can
dance again later.

243
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,453
lf your carnet du bal
is not full up.

244
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:53,986
Oh, l'd love to.
Thank you.

245
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,466
What is that ring
on your finger, chopped liver?

246
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,347
Hello, Polly.

247
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:07,864
Pretty one.

248
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,656
Hello.

Would you like--

250
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:13,136
Would you like
some food, Polly?

251
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:14,932
Pretty Polly.

252
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,154
Where is the--oh.

00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:35,839

the birdie num nums.

260
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:49,745
Sure, look.
He's waiting for more num num.

261
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,235
All gone.
Num num is gone.

262
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:06,114

Birdie num-num.

265
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,192
What in the world is that?

266
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:13,379
l can't imagine.

267
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:22,715
Howdy, partner.

268
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,606
What is that?!

269
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,164

You've got my hand.
Thank you.

The picture?

292
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:37,277
lt was going fine until
some idiot blew up the set.

293
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,309
Vodka or scotch, sir?

294
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:47,413
No, nothing, thank you.

295
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,066

-Sir?

Oh, eat.

301
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:49,278
Sure, honey, we're gonna eat...

302
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:50,875
but they gotta ring
the little bell first.

303
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:53,181
Bell?

304
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:55,702
Bell. Dingy dingy.

305
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:57,334

Friendliest little critter

00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:35,074
Are you having a good time?

326
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:37,146
Good.

327
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,493
Are you having a good time?

328
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:41,492
Oh, yes.
l am having a good time.

329
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:45,872
lt's good to be
having a good time.

330
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:49,779
You're an actress?

331
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:52,177
Oh, yes. l can tell.

332
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:53,639
Oh? How?

333
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:55,174
Because l am an actor.

334
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:59,207
Actors can tell when
actresses are actresses.

335
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,471
lt is a thing
that we have together.

336
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,879
You are also French.
l know that.

337
00:34:03,913 --> 00:34:05,820
-How do you know that?
-Well, your name...

338
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:07,203
and also the way you
are speaking English.

339
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,211
Oh, that's right.
Do you speak French?

340
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:12,151
Well, just enough
to get myself into trouble.

341
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:14,264
l'll tell you what l can say.

342
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,862
Ou est la direction
de la Tour Eiffel...

343
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:17,078
s'il vous plait?

344
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:18,490
-That's pretty good.
-Thanks.

345
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:21,204
-You do speak French.
-You speak Hindustani?

346
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,443
Well, you're not
missing anything.

347
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,939
Oh, dear.

348
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,434
l am here at the moment
taking part...

349
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,165
in Mr. General Clutterbuck's...

350
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,206
latest motion picture
extravaganza.

351
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:32,588
Oh, that's wonderful.

352
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:33,800
lt is a main featured role...

353
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,363
and l am very glad
to have the opportunity...

354
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:36,613
to come here and do it.

355
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:38,624
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

356
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:41,215
You are doing something
in a movie?

357
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,773
Working on a movie?

358
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:47,104
But next week l'm doing
a test for Mr. Divot.

359
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:49,371
Oh, Mr. Divot.

360
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:53,462
-What?
-Oh, listen, l--

361
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:54,926
OK, let's get to the bar.

362
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,099
-Mr. Divot, how do you do?
-Yeah, right, fella.

363
00:34:58,135 --> 00:35:01,067
Good-bye.

364
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,523
Who is that guy?

365
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,672
A very nice man...

366
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,099
with a completely
unpronounceable name.

367
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:10,506
l know him from someplace.
Well, how are you, General?

368
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,807
Remember
Miss Michele Monet here?

369
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:14,727
Have you heard her sing yet?
We're giving her a test.

370
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,871
She sings like a bird--
a nightingale.

371
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,916
Fine. l'll look forward to that.

372
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:20,060
We're going over to the bar
to have a little nippy.

373
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:33,300
-Dinner is served.
-Good.

374
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,371
Dinner is served.

375
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:11,121
Alice, do you know
where Miss Monet is sitting?

376
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:12,431
Right around here, dear.

377
00:36:19,788 --> 00:36:21,216
Excuse me for a minute,
sweetheart.

378
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:38,007
Dear.
l believe you're over there.

379
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:42,002
Right down there.

380
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,179
Here. Bakshi, right?

381
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,289
Oh, yes. Mr. Bakshi.

382
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,823
There's no chair.

383
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:53,861
Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck,
everybody needs to move over.

384
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:56,767
Darling, would you mind
moving up just one?

385
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,200
Hey, fella! l believe
you've got my tiddly, there.

386
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:32,767
l'm sorry, darling.

387
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,262
You're gonna have to move back.
A mistake.

388
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:36,479
l'm awfully sorry.

389
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:39,483
Levinson, will you get
the gentleman a chair?

390
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,375
No, it was a mistake.

391
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,295
He's going to bring you a chair,
and then you'll be all right.

392
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:44,788
All right? Good.

393
00:37:55,124 --> 00:37:57,391
My goodness! What happened
to your little face?

394
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:58,604
Nothing, except that it is...

395
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,908
somewhat nearer
to the table now.

396
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,592
My chair is lower
than your chair.

397
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:19,930
Do you like the strawberry soup?

398
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,737
Oh, strawberry soup.
l haven't had it lately.

399
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,263
Lovely in the summer,
don't you think?

400
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:28,597
Yes, it's--oh.

401
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,035
lt's lovely right now.

402
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:31,976
Good. l'm so glad.

403
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:20,863
Hey, give me some of that,
will you, pal?

404
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:22,559
How's the chow?

405
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:25,724
lt's excellent.

406
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,370
No wine, please.

407
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:52,833
Please, no wine.

408
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:54,878
l know you would
like me to have it...

409
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,379
but l don't want it.

410
00:39:56,421 --> 00:40:00,956
All right. l don't drink.
l don't smoke. No wine.

411
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,026
Are you all right?

412
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:28,128
l'm so sorry.

413
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:33,281
Yes, l will be
perfectly all right.

414
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:34,427
l won't be in anybody's way.

415
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:35,579
Now, you're sure
you're comfortable?

416
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:37,590
Absolutely. l'm getting
out of the way here...

417
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,223
then the door won't bang me.

418
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:41,594
All right. Excuse me.

419
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:50,602
They should be finished
with the soup by now.

420
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:52,169
Get the plates.

421
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,921
Mrs. Clutterbuck...
shall l serve the salad?

422
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,533
Excuse me, what are you doing?!

423
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,578
Get in the kitchen.

424
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:42,667
That is just outside Bombay.

425
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:44,041
And Bombay is in lndia?

426
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:46,343
Oh, that is very much
in lndia, yes, indeed.

427
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,763
And that is indeed
the gateway to lndia.

428
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:49,951
When all--

429
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,336
l think that one
of these bearers...

430
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:59,097
does not like
the other one.

431
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:04,019
You have a very hard time
finding good help these days.

432
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:06,160
Yes, you certainly do.

433
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:23,064
Did you ever hear the one
about the trapeze artist...

434
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:24,210
who got divorced?

435
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:25,523
Caught his wife in the act.

436
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:32,232
That's terribly funny.

437
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:35,172
Yeah, it's been terribly funny
for about twenty years.

438
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,417
Please, no more drinking.

439
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:49,578
Gore, are you sure
it's all right?

440
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,527
lt's not all right.
lt's divine.

441
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,859
You are too kind.

442
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:06,143
lf you want to keep
the women's vote...

443
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,033
you've got to start
with education.

444
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:10,301
That's where
you spend the most--

445
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:13,778
Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck.

446
00:48:13,821 --> 00:48:15,576
Please, can l take
this opportunity...

447
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,104
to apologize to you formally...

448
00:48:17,146 --> 00:48:18,803
for what happened
at the dining room table.

449
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,521
Oh, my dear, just forget it.
lt wasn't your fault.

450
00:48:21,558 --> 00:48:22,899
Thank God.
What embarrassment.

451
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,044
Oh, l know.

452
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:27,114
lt was that ridiculous
little chair they put you on.

453
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:28,712
lt was awful,
but at the same time...

454
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:30,921
l feel that it is my
duty to say this to you.

455
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,442
l just think we should all
forget all about it.

456
00:48:33,483 --> 00:48:34,594
lndeed, you are right...

457
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:37,120
but before that l would
also go to your husband...

458
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,501
and say to him that l'm sorry.

459
00:48:38,534 --> 00:48:40,224
Oh, that's not necessary.
Really.

460
00:48:40,261 --> 00:48:41,470
lt's on my conscience.

461
00:48:41,507 --> 00:48:43,480
Well, if you want to, go ahead.

462
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:45,431
-Thank you.
-All right.

463
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:55,568
lt's a wonderful story.

464
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:05,964
General, excellent aroma.

465
00:49:05,997 --> 00:49:07,818
Oh, l'm glad you like it.

466
00:49:07,852 --> 00:49:10,915
l still have a few left over
from the pre-Castro days.

467
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,992
General Clutterbuck.

468
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:14,459
Sir.

469
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:17,249
Please, l would like
to formally apologize to you...

470
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:20,151
for any inconvenience
that l may have caused you...

471
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:22,132
or your guests
at the dining room table.

472
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,483
lt's understandable.

473
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:25,970
l'm very sorry, and it
will never happen again...

474
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:28,082
should you wish to have me
on your list of guests...

475
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:29,233
on some other occasion.

476
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:30,383
lt's all right.

477
00:49:30,422 --> 00:49:31,981
When l saw what havoc
that l wrought...

478
00:49:32,022 --> 00:49:34,159
my poor old knees went to water.

479
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:36,615
-God, what a state l was in.
-Yes, l can imagine.

480
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,249
But now that l have
apologized to you--

481
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:39,465
lt's all right.

482
00:49:39,503 --> 00:49:41,868
Spoken to your good lady,
and l've told her, sir...

483
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,135
that it is a terrible thing
to have happened...

484
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,510
and l'm sorry.

485
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:47,780
-Deep down inside.
-Enjoy yourself.

486
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:48,927
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

487
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:51,102
Thank you for listening to me.

488
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,317
lt's all right.

489
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:53,631
General, about this Wac.

490
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:56,413
l asked her to go out
with me one night.

491
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:57,591
A Wac?

492
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,254
She was a buck sergeant, too.

493
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:01,560
We were going down Manila Bay.

494
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,349
Brandy or creme de cocoa, sir?

495
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:14,745
Oh, beg your pardon.

496
00:52:14,784 --> 00:52:16,821
lt's all right.

497
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:29,514
lt is occupied.

498
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,022
Speak Hindustani?

499
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:51,608
Oh, excuse me, please.

500
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,260
Hey, close the door, man.

501
00:54:32,387 --> 00:54:34,489
Look, l told the General
you were gonna sing.

502
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:36,599
Well, l'd rather not
do it tonight.

503
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:38,197
Why not?

504
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:40,275
The orchestra is gone.

505
00:54:40,315 --> 00:54:43,160
Well, there's a guitar.
You play the guitar?

506
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:44,435
All right, then you play
the guitar and you sing.

507
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:45,647
That's all, honey.

508
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:47,059
Hey, waiter, come over here.

509
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:50,504
Look, you're gonna be a smash.
Don't worry about a thing.

510
00:54:50,545 --> 00:54:51,657
Come here.

511
00:54:51,696 --> 00:54:54,115
See that guitar?
Go get it.

512
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,392
Get the guitar.

513
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:47,220
Nothing to lose

514
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:51,120
lf we are wise

515
00:55:51,162 --> 00:55:59,218
We're not expecting
rainbow-colored skies

516
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:01,768
Not right away

517
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:12,322
Nothing to lose,
it might be fun

518
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:20,251
No talk of spending
lifetimes in the sun

519
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:24,080
Although we may

520
00:56:24,124 --> 00:56:32,234
Both you and l have seen
what time can do

521
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:35,209
We'll only hurt ourselves

522
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:42,629
lf we build dreams
that don't come true

523
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:45,316
What can we lose?

524
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:49,059
We know the score

525
00:56:49,092 --> 00:56:53,147
Let's wait before we talk

526
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:57,239
Of evermore

527
00:56:57,277 --> 00:57:01,397
One day we may

528
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:06,349
Nothing to lose,
but much to gain

529
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:13,671
lf love decides to stay

530
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:26,113
Both you and l have seen
what time can do

531
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:29,210
We'll only hurt ourselves

532
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:35,472
lf we build dreams
that don't come true

533
00:57:35,514 --> 00:57:39,253
What can we lose?

534
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:43,342
We know the score

535
00:57:43,379 --> 00:57:46,889
Let's wait before we talk

536
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:51,299
Of evermore

537
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:55,264
One day we may

538
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:59,904
Nothing to lose,
but much to gain

539
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:07,636
lf love decides to stay

540
00:58:07,677 --> 00:58:11,830
Nothing to lose

541
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:14,034
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

542
00:58:28,394 --> 00:58:29,918
Well, how do you like her,
General?

543
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,868
-All right. Very good.
-How do you like her, Bernie?

544
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:33,339
She's great!

545
00:58:33,381 --> 00:58:34,754
l think she's really great.

546
00:58:44,506 --> 00:58:45,651
Hi.

547
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:56,750
All right, you win, partner.

548
00:58:58,766 --> 00:59:01,481
l'm telling you, he loved you.
He thought you were terrific.

549
00:59:01,515 --> 00:59:02,942
We talked about it after
you finished the number.

550
00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:04,195
He was very impressed.

551
00:59:04,232 --> 00:59:05,344
He thought you were
beautiful, you know?

552
00:59:05,384 --> 00:59:07,205
So tomorrow will be
just a formality, the test.

553
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:09,625
We want to see what you
look like on film, that's all.

554
00:59:09,668 --> 00:59:11,554
Trust me.
Will you just trust me?

555
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:13,145
Here, we can talk.
lt's a little quieter in here.

556
00:59:13,184 --> 00:59:15,005
Oh, Charlie,
this is the bedroom.

557
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:17,012
Oh, this is the bedroom.

558
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,295
Come on,
let's sit over there, baby.

559
00:59:18,331 --> 00:59:20,185
-l wanna tell you something.
-Why don't we go downstairs?

560
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:22,517
Too much noise downstairs.
Let's just sit on the bed. Sit.

561
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,979
Look, why do you think
l brought you to the party?

562
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,890
Let's sit down. That's it.
That's a good girl.

563
00:59:28,018 --> 00:59:29,643
lt's what l brought you
to the party for.

564
00:59:29,681 --> 00:59:31,174
Just one little kiss.

565
00:59:31,216 --> 00:59:33,124
Don't do that.
Let's go. Charlie!

566
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,785
-Give me my gun.
-Thank you, partner.

567
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:41,924
Where you going?

568
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:43,549
Attention!

569
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:45,919
Oh, God.

570
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:47,546
Just forget it.

571
00:59:53,788 --> 00:59:56,339
Knock it off and hit the sack!

572
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:06,030
Cookie!

573
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:26,971
Wait.

574
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:33,041
Who's in the head?

575
01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:26,114
Help! Somebody!

576
01:05:27,081 --> 01:05:30,591
Help, anybody!

577
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:33,759
Please, come and help me.
Somebody's in the pool.

578
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,038
Honey, what can l do for you?

579
01:05:35,074 --> 01:05:37,374
-Hurry up, please. lt's--
-Oh, hey, little buddy!

580
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:39,294
American aid, partner.

581
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:41,365
Great night for a dip.
You know that little fella...

582
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,791
just has a heap of talent
wherever he goes.

583
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:46,253
He's drowning?
Buddy, you drowning?

584
01:05:47,415 --> 01:05:50,063
Great leapin' pollywogs,
that little gal can swim !

585
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,131
Get him, gal!
Grab him by the wigwam !

586
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,542
l'll wait right here for ya!

587
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:57,128
Come on, honey,
bring him over here.

588
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,684
Get ahold of him.
Get out of there.

589
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:02,089
Here we go.
Come on, little buddy.

590
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:19,987
Bartender, we've been fishin'.

591
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:21,169
Caught ourselves
a little lnjun here.

592
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,311
Oh, God, he's gonna catch
a death of cold.

593
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,691
Oh, no, l don't drink.

594
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:26,512
Come on. Good, just a little.

595
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:29,228
There we go.
Right down the old hatch.

596
01:06:29,264 --> 01:06:31,629
There you go, that'll
straighten you right out.

597
01:06:31,663 --> 01:06:33,004
You'll feel better, huh?

598
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:35,424
-But l don't drink.
-You need a little more.

599
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:36,872
There you go, huh?

600
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,017
That straighten you out
all right?

601
01:06:38,056 --> 01:06:39,168
How 'bout a little more?

602
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:40,416
No, l'm perfectly all right now.

603
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,980
All right, good.

604
01:06:42,022 --> 01:06:43,361
Oh, up! Got him.

605
01:06:43,395 --> 01:06:44,921
Looks like little buddy
went bye-bye.

606
01:06:44,962 --> 01:06:46,651
Get ahold of him, Bill.
You got him?

607
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:50,100
Hang on, here we go!

608
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:51,799
Poor darling, l'm so sorry.

609
01:06:51,836 --> 01:06:54,135
You stay there and, well,
l don't know what we can do.

610
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:57,233
But perhaps we can
at least dry it out for you.

611
01:06:57,272 --> 01:06:59,408
Oh, dear, honestly.

612
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:02,024
Come in!

613
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:03,440
This tie looks like
a salamander's tongue...

614
01:07:03,473 --> 01:07:05,959
that got stepped on.
Oh, hiya, honey.

615
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:07,111
ls he all right?

616
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,326
Oh, he's all right.
He's just a little wet.

617
01:07:08,365 --> 01:07:09,858
You got some dry duds
we can put on him?

618
01:07:09,899 --> 01:07:11,327
Oh, surely, yes.
l'll get something of Fred's.

619
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,579
l sure would appreciate that.

620
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,157
Here, darling, put this on him.

621
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,617
Oh, thank you
very much, ma'am.

622
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:22,071
l love the wet clothes!
Thank you for a marvelous party!

623
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:23,256
Let's go, buddy.

624
01:07:25,405 --> 01:07:27,345
Fred, darling, l had
to loan him your terry.

625
01:07:27,387 --> 01:07:29,622
He's soaking wet.
This is hers, not his.

626
01:07:29,657 --> 01:07:31,249
Oh, and, darling, do hurry

627
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:33,196
because the Russians
will be here any minute!

628
01:07:33,238 --> 01:07:34,349
The Russians?

629
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,656
The dancers, darling,
the ballet.

630
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,200
Come on, sidekick.

631
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:49,188
Now, what's--
Kelso, would you mind?

632
01:07:49,223 --> 01:07:50,531
What are you doing up there?

633
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,637
-l am not doing anything.
-You're wetting the bed.

634
01:07:52,676 --> 01:07:54,562
-l'm not wetting the bed.
-Yes, you are. lt's wet.

635
01:07:54,595 --> 01:07:56,959
My clothes are wetting the bed.
l am not wetting the bed.

636
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:58,234
This is the big chief here.

637
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:00,822
Oh, big chief speak
with forked tongue.

638
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:02,833
Try to get his clothes off.

639
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:06,548
l'll hold him, boss.
You get his pants down.

640
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,752
All right, come here.
Don't do that, no.

641
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,544
Come here, lovely man.
l love you!

642
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,487
l got something dry over here.

643
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:15,375
Listen, you take off--

644
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:17,478
Hey, he invited me.

645
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:20,385
We'll take off your clothes,
and you take off...

646
01:08:22,505 --> 01:08:24,325
Have you got him?

647
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:25,884
Loosen his belt, Kelso.

648
01:08:25,925 --> 01:08:27,647
l'm trying, sir.

649
01:08:27,683 --> 01:08:29,657
For crying out loud,
let's get 'em off.

650
01:08:32,607 --> 01:08:34,167
Get up off the floor.

651
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:36,472
l got him !
Come on there!

652
01:08:39,738 --> 01:08:41,262
Oh, you naughty boy.

653
01:08:41,304 --> 01:08:43,855
Now, here, put this on.
Put these on.

654
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:45,005
Wait!

655
01:08:45,045 --> 01:08:46,287
Come on now.
Can you handle it?

656
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:49,582
-l have to go downstairs.
-All right. l'll handle it.

657
01:08:49,616 --> 01:08:51,021
Partner, why do you want--

658
01:08:51,055 --> 01:08:53,224
Little sidekick,
put these dry clothes on.

659
01:08:53,261 --> 01:08:55,778
All right, l will put them on.
And then l'll--

660
01:08:55,818 --> 01:08:58,085
Good idea.
l gotta get downstairs...

661
01:08:58,121 --> 01:09:00,223
before Conchita cools off.

662
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:01,787
You come downstairs
with wet clothes on...

663
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:03,966
l'm gonna stomp you
and the horse you ride in on.

664
01:09:04,003 --> 01:09:05,179
You got that?

665
01:09:05,217 --> 01:09:07,103
Tongue buddy, partner buddy.

666
01:09:07,136 --> 01:09:08,760
l'll see ya, little buddy.

667
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:12,915
Oh, you got me right
in the pantaloons, partner.

668
01:09:12,955 --> 01:09:14,741
Adios!

669
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:16,466
Hold on, Conchita!
l'm comin'!

670
01:09:16,503 --> 01:09:18,411
Adios, partner.

671
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:24,516
l do like these Americans.

672
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,413
They really are...

673
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:01,617
Hello.

674
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,624
Hello.

675
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:10,597
You're having some difficulty?

676
01:11:13,964 --> 01:11:15,239
You sure?

677
01:11:19,463 --> 01:11:23,289
Well. Excuse me.

678
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,882
You know that l don't think...

679
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,698
you're being
entirely honest with me?

680
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:55,873
We have a saying in lndia.

681
01:12:03,997 --> 01:12:05,207
Well?

682
01:12:05,245 --> 01:12:07,414
Well, what?

683
01:12:12,854 --> 01:12:17,040
You were saying
something about a saying.

684
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:23,753
What is it?

685
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,011
''Wisdom...

686
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:34,207
''is the province of the aged...

687
01:12:34,242 --> 01:12:38,166
''but the heart of a child
is pure.''

688
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:42,710
That's very pretty.

689
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:46,735
l'm not sure l know
what it means.

690
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,225
Neither do l.

691
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:56,235
What does it have
to do with me?

692
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:59,137
Well, it has everything
to do with you.

693
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:01,446
For one thing, you see,
it stopped you crying.

694
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:03,749
lt's true.
l feel better.

695
01:13:03,783 --> 01:13:05,123
Thank you very much.

696
01:13:05,157 --> 01:13:08,057
Don't thank me.
Thank my saying.

697
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,375
Thank you, saying.

698
01:13:10,496 --> 01:13:13,047
Do you want to hear
another one of my sayings?

699
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:14,330
This is
a particularly good one...

700
01:13:14,365 --> 01:13:16,021
because it will help you
always to remember...

701
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,392
how many days there are
in each month.

702
01:13:18,426 --> 01:13:20,911
lt goes like this:
''Thirty days hath September...

703
01:13:20,951 --> 01:13:22,837
''October, June, and February.

704
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,777
''All the rest got twenty-nine...

705
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:27,751
''except my brother
who got six months.''

706
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:35,490
Just what l thought.

707
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:37,219
l've been looking
all over for ya.

708
01:13:37,256 --> 01:13:38,978
Go get your clothes,
we're gonna leave.

709
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,769
Oh, l don't think so.

710
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:42,364
Look, you came with me,
you're gonna leave with me.

711
01:13:42,404 --> 01:13:44,190
Now get your clothes.

712
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,337
No.

713
01:13:45,376 --> 01:13:47,480
Don't say no to me.
Now get your stuff.

714
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,688
-Go on!
-Mr. Divot, please--

715
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:51,763
Look, will you stay
out of this, buddy.

716
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:53,906
lf Miss Monet wishes to remain,
that is her right.

717
01:13:53,944 --> 01:13:55,503
Just who do you think you are?

718
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:57,103
ln lndia, we don't
think who we are...

719
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:58,254
we know who we are.

720
01:13:58,293 --> 01:13:59,404
You're meshugah!

721
01:13:59,443 --> 01:14:00,904
l am not your sugar.

722
01:14:02,194 --> 01:14:03,621
OK, look, baby, you decide.

723
01:14:03,664 --> 01:14:05,550
You wanna come with me,
or you wanna stay with this guy?

724
01:14:05,582 --> 01:14:06,727
l want to stay.

725
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:10,144
You're gonna stay with him, huh?

726
01:14:10,186 --> 01:14:11,974
Nobody ever does this to me!

727
01:14:12,008 --> 01:14:13,152
You hear that?

728
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:14,750
And forget about
that test tomorrow, baby.

729
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:16,795
You're finished in this business
before you even start!

730
01:14:16,836 --> 01:14:18,557
You're wiped out!
You're finished!

731
01:14:23,454 --> 01:14:27,128
That was a short career,
wasn't it?

732
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,615
Oh, don't worry about that.

733
01:14:31,446 --> 01:14:34,956
l better find something
to put on and call a cab.

734
01:14:34,995 --> 01:14:36,816
No, don't call a cab.

735
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:38,189
Stay at the party and after...

736
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:40,589
l'll take you home
in my three-wheeler Morgan.

737
01:14:40,622 --> 01:14:42,725
No, that would be nice,
but l can't stay.

738
01:14:42,763 --> 01:14:43,940
Why not?

739
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,160
l got myself into
a funny situation.

740
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:50,947
What, with old Divot?

741
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,985
ls that why you were crying?

742
01:14:53,026 --> 01:14:55,032
Yes, but it's
not really his fault.

743
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:56,632
He's a terrible man.

744
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:59,222
Please, stay at the party.
Let's have a wonderful time.

745
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,877
l'd love to, really,
but l have nothing to wear.

746
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:04,596
That's no problem. They have
millions of clothes here.

747
01:15:04,632 --> 01:15:07,662
And anyway...l've got an idea.

748
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,537
Who goes there?

749
01:15:14,575 --> 01:15:17,027
Mr. Bakshi
and a damsel in distress.

750
01:15:17,068 --> 01:15:18,758
What do you want?

751
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:20,997
You look like
a man of the world.

752
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:23,965
This poor lady is urgently
in need of some dry clothing.

753
01:15:24,006 --> 01:15:26,905
And l perceive that you are both
approximately the same size.

754
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,296
Marvelous! Just marvelous!

755
01:17:54,332 --> 01:17:57,047
Everyone, let's have a toast
for our wonderful friends.

756
01:18:23,585 --> 01:18:28,153
Fred, we need to move the bar.

757
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:30,010
Oh, l know how to do that.
l'll do that for you.

758
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:32,115
Oh, no, l'd rather do it myself.

759
01:18:32,154 --> 01:18:34,006
Fred, stop him.

760
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:28,639
Come on, it's fine.

761
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:30,051
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

762
01:19:30,084 --> 01:19:32,449
Yes, will you please come?
lt's fine!

763
01:19:32,482 --> 01:19:33,910
But your mother's
having a party.

764
01:19:33,953 --> 01:19:35,294
Can you think of a better time
to shake 'em up?

765
01:19:35,328 --> 01:19:37,715
You've done some pretty stupid
things in your life, but this--

766
01:19:37,757 --> 01:19:39,316
Wow! What a house!

767
01:19:56,843 --> 01:19:58,249
Hi.

768
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:09,499
-Hello, Mom.
-Oh, darling!

769
01:20:09,537 --> 01:20:11,029
l thought you were
out protesting.

770
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:13,142
No, it's a love-in. l wanted you
to meet some of my friends.

771
01:20:13,181 --> 01:20:15,928
l can't now, darling.
l've got all these wet Russians.

772
01:20:15,962 --> 01:20:18,328
But l'll come back,
and l'll meet your friends.

773
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,099
Oh, there they are over there.

774
01:20:30,412 --> 01:20:32,516
General, your wife
just fell in the pool.

775
01:20:32,555 --> 01:20:34,147
Get her jewelry.

776
01:20:36,839 --> 01:20:38,398
Molly, what was that?

777
01:20:38,438 --> 01:20:39,713
An elephant.

778
01:20:39,749 --> 01:20:43,771
An elephant?! Oh, my God!

779
01:20:43,809 --> 01:20:46,654
Molly, how could you do this?
This is perfectly dreadful!

780
01:20:46,686 --> 01:20:48,376
Well, l didn't mean
to offend you.

781
01:20:48,413 --> 01:20:49,525
Now, listen here, young lady...

782
01:20:49,564 --> 01:20:51,188
you get that elephant
out of this house!

783
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:53,974
Yes. Oh, Mother!

784
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,516
-Hello.
-Hello.

785
01:21:05,548 --> 01:21:06,660
How are you?

786
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,812
l'm all right.
ls this your elephant?

787
01:21:07,851 --> 01:21:09,028
Yeah. This is Jongo.

788
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:11,398
You've done a proper old
paint job on this, haven't you?

789
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:12,543
What's wrong with it?

790
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,760
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

791
01:21:13,798 --> 01:21:15,421
-Why?
-This is a symbol of my country.

792
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,833
Don't you paint them in lndia?

793
01:21:16,867 --> 01:21:20,092
Yes, but we don't
paint slogans all over them.

794
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:22,134
Look, he has got ''the world
is flat'' on his forehead...

795
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,929
''Socrates eats hemlock''
on the side...

796
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:25,970
and ''go naked'' all over his bum.

797
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,187
l'm terribly sorry.

798
01:21:27,225 --> 01:21:28,850
We didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

799
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:30,991
l know, but it's humiliating.
They know, you know.

800
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,622
l mean, how would you
like it if an lndian person...

801
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,730
such as myself
came along and drew...

802
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:36,143
a mustache and a beard
on your Lady Bird.

803
01:21:36,177 --> 01:21:37,605
lt's the same thing, isn't it?

804
01:21:37,647 --> 01:21:39,587
l'm awfully sorry.
What do you suggest we do?

805
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:41,962
-Get some water and wash it off.
-Wash it?

806
01:21:41,995 --> 01:21:44,132
Wash it, scrub it, get it off.

807
01:21:44,169 --> 01:21:45,859
Hey, gang!

808
01:21:45,896 --> 01:21:47,422
We're gonna wash the elephant.

809
01:21:47,463 --> 01:21:49,697
What do you mean
wash the elephant?

810
01:23:15,414 --> 01:23:18,673
All right! That's it! Get out!

811
01:23:35,012 --> 01:23:38,456
Wash it off!
Get it all off!

812
01:23:38,529 --> 01:23:40,535
Bakshi!

813
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:45,111

814
01:23:45,147 --> 01:23:46,967
l knew it!

815
01:23:54,098 --> 01:23:56,714
Hello?
Buggercult--l--

816
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:58,507
l wanna talk to the General.
This is C.S. Divot.

817
01:23:59,982 --> 01:24:02,946
No! You cannot--

818
01:24:02,986 --> 01:24:04,643
What's going on there?

819
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,225
Paint on the ear.

820
01:24:14,017 --> 01:24:17,396
Do you believe that child of
mine bringing home an elephant?

821
01:24:17,437 --> 01:24:19,258
-Dirty.
-Oh, really!

822
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:24,334
All right, that got it!

823
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:27,056
That's enough.
We take him outside now.

824
01:24:27,092 --> 01:24:29,774
And wash all the soap off.

825
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:55,480
Oh, what do you suppose
that awful racket is?

826
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:57,422
-l'll be right back.
-Darling, l'm not finished.

827
01:24:57,464 --> 01:25:00,527
l've got to see. God only knows
what's happening now.

828
01:25:07,055 --> 01:25:09,606
Mom, what are you doing?

829
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:16,454
You and me gotta find
someplace to be alone.

830
01:25:20,163 --> 01:25:23,008
Wells, save the paintings!

831
01:25:33,783 --> 01:25:35,691
Oh, Mom, are you all right?

832
01:25:44,397 --> 01:25:47,394
Get the paintings!
Don't stand there!

833
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:57,471
l should never, ever
in all my life...

834
01:26:17,774 --> 01:26:19,747
Not that one, you idiot!
Just the good stuff.

835
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:21,194
Put it back.

836
01:27:17,368 --> 01:27:18,741
We gotta get this
stuff out of here.

837
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:21,228
-Turn on the air conditioner.
-l'll never make it.

838
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:22,511
There's a control
in the master bedroom.

839
01:27:22,547 --> 01:27:24,488
-Go get it on.
-Yes, sir.

840
01:29:17,962 --> 01:29:19,269
Just a minute, sir.

841
01:29:19,304 --> 01:29:21,244
Hey, look, l'm C.S. Divot,
the producer.

842
01:29:21,287 --> 01:29:22,463
l'm a friend
of Mr. Clutterbuck's.

843
01:29:22,502 --> 01:29:23,613
l gotta tell him something
right away.

844
01:29:23,653 --> 01:29:24,763
Divot, C.S.?

845
01:29:24,803 --> 01:29:25,980
That's right, buddy.
Thanks. Divot.

846
01:29:26,018 --> 01:29:28,698
Hey, what's with
the ambulance here?

847
01:29:32,572 --> 01:29:35,384
Honey, let's go stroll
in the straw, huh?

848
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,238
You're a little late, mac.

849
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:39,822
What the hell is
going on around here?

850
01:29:41,396 --> 01:29:44,556
Do you believe it?
The party isn't over!

851
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:45,704
Hey, General!

852
01:29:45,744 --> 01:29:47,269
l don't even know how
the hell it got started.

853
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:50,155
We gotta put something
in our report.

854
01:29:50,187 --> 01:29:52,259
General, l gotta
tell you something.

855
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:53,857
lt was crazy. You should've--

856
01:29:53,896 --> 01:29:55,204
Alice, baby,
are you all right?

857
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:56,351
Do you feel better?

858
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,420
Oh, l'm fine! l'm going
to be in the aquacade.

859
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,662
That's nice.
Don't drop her.

860
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:03,070
Congressman, Mrs. Dunphy...

861
01:30:03,103 --> 01:30:05,622
l don't know how to tell you--

862
01:30:05,662 --> 01:30:06,970
lt's quite all right.

863
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:09,075
Call me if there's
anything l can do.

864
01:30:16,724 --> 01:30:19,177
Mr. Clutterbuck...

865
01:30:19,217 --> 01:30:22,759
May l apologize to you
for the discomfort--

866
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:23,974
lt's all right.

867
01:30:24,012 --> 01:30:25,255
General, it's him !

868
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:27,428
-Who?
-Bakshi!

869
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:29,700
The idiot
who blew up the location!

870
01:30:30,822 --> 01:30:33,056
General, you got the wrong guy!

871
01:30:40,255 --> 01:30:41,814
Hey, little buddy,
hold on a minute.

872
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,411
Here's one of my old Stetsons.

873
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:45,140
Look at that. lt just fits.

874
01:30:45,178 --> 01:30:48,109
And here's an autographed
picture of me and my horse Fang.

875
01:31:35,883 --> 01:31:37,704
This is where l live.

876
01:31:37,737 --> 01:31:39,645
You have a beautiful home.

877
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:44,987
l would ask you to come up,
but it's a little late.

878
01:31:45,027 --> 01:31:46,934
Or early. l don't know.

879
01:31:48,415 --> 01:31:51,511
Anyway, l have to
get back to feed Apu.

880
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,685
-Apu?
-Yes, my monkey.

881
01:31:53,723 --> 01:31:56,567
Oh. lt's a lovely name.

882
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,445
For a monkey, anyway.

883
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:01,744
-He's used to it by now, anyway.
-Oh, good.

884
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,301
l would like to say that...

885
01:32:07,342 --> 01:32:09,064
l enjoyed myself
very much last night.

886
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,585
l did, too, very much.

887
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,623
Especially l thought that
your song was very beautiful.

888
01:32:14,664 --> 01:32:16,701
-You did?
-Yes.

889
01:32:16,741 --> 01:32:18,017
Thank you.

890
01:32:22,113 --> 01:32:23,290
Good-bye.

891
01:32:23,328 --> 01:32:24,571
Good-bye.

892
01:32:24,606 --> 01:32:26,360
Oh, here's your hat.

893
01:32:26,397 --> 01:32:29,873
Oh, look. You keep it.

894
01:32:29,913 --> 01:32:32,878
But you may need it.

895
01:32:32,919 --> 01:32:35,567
No, l'd like you to keep it.

896
01:32:35,603 --> 01:32:37,741
All right.

897
01:32:37,778 --> 01:32:40,677
lf you think that you should
want it or need it sometimes...

898
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,856
Well, if l need it...

899
01:32:42,894 --> 01:32:46,305
l could always come,
perhaps, and pick it up.

900
01:32:46,347 --> 01:32:47,971
That would be very nice.

901
01:32:48,009 --> 01:32:51,835
When would you be available
for me to pick up my hat?

902
01:32:53,956 --> 01:32:56,092
Maybe next week.

903
01:32:56,129 --> 01:32:58,332
l'll come and get it then.

904
01:32:58,368 --> 01:33:00,253
For l'd love
to have my hat back.

905
01:33:00,286 --> 01:33:01,463
Good-bye.

906
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,677
Bye-bye.
