1
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,265
Narrator: People are always asking me...

2
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,865
...if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:03,712
Tyler: 3 minutes.

4
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:04,593
Tyler: 3 minutes.

5
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:07,627
This is it: ground zero.

6
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,776
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

7
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:10,832
[Muffled]

8
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,688
Narrator: With a gun barrel
between your teeth,

9
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:14,672
you speak only in vowels.

10
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,017
I can't think of anything.

11
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,552
For a second I totally forget...

12
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:20,049
...about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

13
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:22,256
and I wonder how clean that gun is.

14
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,953
Tyler: Getting exciting now.

15
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,009
That old saying,

16
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,152
how you always hurt the one you love?

17
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:29,391
Well, it works both ways.

18
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,032
[Police Sirens]

19
00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:31,473
We have front row seats...

20
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,553
...for this theater of mass destruction.

21
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,792
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem...

22
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:38,193
...wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings...

23
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:41,073
...with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes,

24
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,993
primary charges will blow base charges...

25
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:44,272
...and a few square blocks...

26
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,993
...will be reduced to smoldering rubble.

27
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,016
I know this...

28
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,713
...because Tyler knows this.

29
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,377
21/2.

30
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:53,297
Think of everything we've accomplished.

31
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:56,208
And suddenly, I realize that all of this:

32
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,609
the gun, the bombs,
the revolution...

33
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,409
...has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

34
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:06,378
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

35
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:10,288
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

36
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,688
The big moosey slobbering all over me,

37
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:13,713
that was Bob.

38
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:15,853
We're still men.

39
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,840
Yes, we're men.

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,232
Men is what we are.

41
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,288
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

42
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:25,712
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits...

43
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,697
...because his testosterone was too high,

44
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:29,488
and his body upped the estrogen.

45
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:30,768
And that was where I fit...

46
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,688
They're gonna have to
open up my pecs again...

47
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:33,744
...and drain the fluid.

48
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:35,633
Narrator: Between those huge,
sweating tits...

49
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,896
...that hung enormous the way
you'd think of God's as big.

50
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:41,898
OK. You cry now.

51
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,321
No, wait. Back up.
Let me start earlier.

52
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,272
For 6 months,
I couldn't sleep.

53
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,832
Echo: I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

54
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:52,944
With insomnia,
nothing's real.

55
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:55,499
Everything's far away.

56
00:03:55,605 --> 00:04:00,165
Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.

57
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:05,105
When deep space exploration ramps up,

58
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,760
it'll be the corporations
that name everything:

59
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,217
the I.B.M. Stellarsphere,

60
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,144
the Microsoft Galaxy,

61
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,666
Planet Starbucks.

62
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,304
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

63
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,744
We got some red flags to cover.

64
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,184
It must've been Tuesday.

65
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,265
He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.

66
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,345
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports...

67
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,713
...until you advise of a status upgrade?

68
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:27,504
Make these your primary action items.

69
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:28,624
Here's your flight coupons.

70
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:30,224
Call me from the road if there's any snags.

71
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,664
Narrator: He was full of pep.

72
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:34,909
Must have had his grande latte enema.

73
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:38,545
Like so many others,
I had become a slave...

74
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,784
...to the IKEA nesting instinct.

75
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:44,624
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

76
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:45,584
Operator: Please hold.

77
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:46,864
If I saw something clever...

78
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:49,904
...like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

79
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:51,600
I had to have it.

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,384
The Klipske personal office unit,

81
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,816
the Hovetrekke home exer-bike,

82
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,544
or the Johannshamn sofa...

83
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,721
...with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

84
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,641
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps...

85
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,744
...of environmentally friendly
unbleached paper.

86
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,505
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:

87
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:11,515
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

88
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:12,816
I had it all.

89
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,032
Even the glass dishes...

90
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,920
...with tiny bubbles and imperfections.

91
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,960
Proof that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

92
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,720
hard-working indigenous peoples of...

93
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,680
Operator: Please hold.

94
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,640
Narrator: Wherever.

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,984
I was holding.

96
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,506
We used to read pornography.

97
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:28,560
Now it was the Horchow collection.

98
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,497
No, you can't die from insomnia.

99
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:32,657
What about narcolepsy?

100
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:35,504
I nod off. I wake up in strange places.

101
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,072
I have no idea how I got there.

102
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,833
You need to lighten up.

103
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,040
Can you please just get me something?

104
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,177
Narrator: Red and blue Tuenols,
lipstick-red Seconals.

105
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,684
No. You need healthy natural sleep.

106
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:52,613
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

107
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:57,135
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.

108
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,896
You wanna see pain?

109
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,624
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.

110
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:03,664
See the guys with testicular cancer.

111
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,764
That's pain.

112
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:14,564
Chorus: # La la la #...

113
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,783
...# La la la la la la #

114
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,352
I always wanted 3 kids,

115
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,272
2 boys and a girl.

116
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:28,071
Mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy.

117
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,985
We never could agree on anything.

118
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,912
Well, uh,
you know, she...

119
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:35,504
She had her first child last week, a...

120
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,168
...a girl.

121
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:40,656
With... With her, uh,
with her new husband.

122
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:42,993
Man: [Whispering] Fuck.

123
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:46,987
Hey... Hey, thank God,
you know.

124
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,328
I'm... I'm glad for her.

125
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:53,583
Because she deserves it.

126
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,106
Group Leader: Aw.

127
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:59,600
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

128
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,871
All: Thank you, Thomas.

129
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,073
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage,

130
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,184
and that gives me strength.

131
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:09,521
We give each other strength.

132
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,472
It's time for the one-on-ones.

133
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,160
So let's all of us here
follow Thomas' good example...

134
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,560
...and really open ourselves up.

135
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,831
Would you find a partner?

136
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:23,152
Narrator: And this is how
I met the big moosey...

137
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:25,296
Man: Come on.
Let's go over here.

138
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:29,051
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears...

139
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:33,957
...knees together,
those awkward little steps.

140
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:39,632
My name is Bob.

141
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:41,072
Bob.

142
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,633
Narrator: Bob had been
a champion body-builder.

143
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,553
You know that chest-expansion program...

144
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,529
...you see on late-night TV?
That was his idea.

145
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,353
I was a juicer.

146
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:53,802
You know,
using steroids.

147
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,494
Diabonal and...

148
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,072
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that...

149
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:02,126
...on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

150
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:04,846
And now I'm bankrupt.

151
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,949
I'm divorced.

152
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,279
My 2 grown kids...

153
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:14,000
...won't even return my phone calls.

154
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,792
Narrator: Strangers
with this kind of honesty...

155
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:18,612
...make me go a big rubbery one.

156
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:22,759
Go ahead, Cornelius.

157
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,868
You can cry.

158
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:38,377
[Crying]

159
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,735
Narrator: And then,
something happened.

160
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:43,184
I let go.

161
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:44,656
That's really good.

162
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,641
Lost in oblivion...

163
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:49,740
...dark and silent and complete.

164
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:53,105
I found freedom.

165
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:56,783
Losing all hope was freedom.

166
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,884

the blood parasites...

00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:13,103
multiply it by the probable
rate of failure, 'B,'

450
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:14,159
then multiply the result...

451
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,431
...by the average
out-of-court settlement, 'C.'

452

'A' times 'B' times 'C'

453
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,591
equals 'X.'

454
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:23,471
If 'X' is less than the cost of a recall,

455

Yeah. I guess so.

485
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,799
You know why they put
oxygen masks on planes?

486
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,527
So you can breathe.

487
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:39,344
Oxygen gets you high.

488
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,879
In a catastrophic emergency,

489
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:43,759
you're taking giant panicked breaths.

490
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:46,256
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

491
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,461
You accept your fate.

00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,151

He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

all on one big reel.

So someone has to be there
to switch the projectors...

717
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,119
...at the exact moment that one reel ends...

00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:45,965
We make soap.

1345
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:47,085
Really.

1346
00:57:47,185 --> 00:57:49,990
To make soap,
first we render fat.

1347
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:09,709
The salt balance has to be just right,

1348
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:13,390
so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

1349
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,702
Wait.
What is this place?

1350

The richest, creamiest fat in the world.

Unhh.

1357
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:54,413
As the fat renders, the tallows
float to the surface.

1358
00:58:54,513 --> 00:58:56,173
Like in Boy Scouts.

1359

Once the tallow hardens,

we skim off a layer of glycerin.

1363

If you were to add nitric
acid, you got nitroglycerin.

1364
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:09,422
If you were then to add sodium nitrate...

1365
00:59:09,522 --> 00:59:12,013
...and a dash of sawdust,
you got dynamite.

Now, ancient peoples found
that clothes got cleaner...

...on the hills above this river.

1374
00:59:30,257 --> 00:59:32,269
Bodies burned. Water seeped
into the wood and ashes...

1375
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:33,933
...to create lye.

1376
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:36,205
This is lye,
the crucial ingredient.

1377
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:37,933
Once it mixed with the melted fat of bodies,

1378
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,405
a thick, white,
soapy discharge...

The first rule of Project Mayhem...

2146
01:34:37,775 --> 01:34:38,603
Shut up.

2147
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:40,683
I want to know what you're thinking.

2148
01:34:40,783 --> 01:34:41,675
Fuck what you know.

2149
01:34:41,775 --> 01:34:42,923
You need to forget about what you know.

2150
01:34:43,023 --> 01:34:43,915
That's your problem.

2151
01:34:44,015 --> 01:34:45,195
Forget about what you think you know...

2152
01:34:45,295 --> 01:34:46,955
...about life,
about friendship,

2153
01:34:47,055 --> 01:34:49,291
and especially about you and me.

2154
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:50,283
What?

2155
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:53,613
What is that supposed to mean? What...

2156
01:34:55,759 --> 01:34:57,759
What are you doing?

2157
01:34:58,767 --> 01:35:01,323
Guys, what do you wish
you'd done before you die?

2158
01:35:01,423 --> 01:35:02,379
Paint a self-portrait.

2159
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:03,339
Build a house.

2160
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:04,811
And you?

2161
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:07,339
I don't know.
Get in the right lane.

2162
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:08,939
I have to know the answer to this question.

2163
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:10,027
If you were to die right now,

2164
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:11,947
how would you feel about your life?

2165
01:35:12,047 --> 01:35:13,099
I don't know.

2166
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,219
I wouldn't feel anything good about my life.

2167
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:15,563
Is that what you want to hear me say? Fine.

2168
01:35:15,663 --> 01:35:17,131
Come on.
- Not good enough.

I'm sick of all your shit.

01:35:31,087 --> 01:35:32,939
OK.

2178

OK.

2179

Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.

Look at you.

Take the wheel.

2182
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:39,851
Look at you.
You're fuckin' pathetic.

2183
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:41,419
Why? Why?
What are you talking about?

2184
01:35:41,519 --> 01:35:44,802
Why do you think I blew up your condo?

What?

2186
01:35:47,023 --> 01:35:48,939
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.

2187
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:50,763
It's not a goddamn seminar.

2188
01:35:50,863 --> 01:35:52,683
Stop trying to control everything...

Narrator: I'd never been in a car accident.

2194
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:04,170
This must have been what
all those people felt like...

2195
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:08,010
...before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

Ha ha ha ha ha hahh.

2199

We just had a near-life experience.

2200
01:37:20,527 --> 01:37:22,818
In the world I see,

2201
01:37:22,927 --> 01:37:25,579
you're stalking elk through
the damp canyon forest,

2202
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,994
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

2203
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:31,947
You'll wear leather clothes...

2204
01:37:32,047 --> 01:37:34,827
...that will last you the rest of your life.

2205
01:37:34,927 --> 01:37:39,007
You'll climb the vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

2206
01:37:39,631 --> 01:37:41,451
And when you look down,

2207
01:37:41,551 --> 01:37:44,331
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

2208
01:37:44,431 --> 01:37:47,691
laying strips of venison
on the empty carpool lane...

2209
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:50,681

Tyler was gone.

01:38:33,295 --> 01:38:35,368
Was I asleep?

01:38:37,007 --> 01:38:38,219
Had I slept?

2217
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:39,659
You are not a beautiful...

...unique snowflake,
do you understand me?

2219
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,979
Narrator: The house had become
a living thing,

2220
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:46,379
wet inside from so many people...

2221
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:47,723
...sweating and breathing.

2222
01:38:47,823 --> 01:38:49,643
We are all from the same compost.

2223
01:38:49,743 --> 01:38:52,973
So many people moving,
the house moved.

Trapped inside this
clockwork of space monkeys.

You can't be smoking in here.

Do you know how much ether
we have in this fucking house?

and sleeping in teams.

The second rule is
you do not ask questions.

01:49:04,878 --> 01:49:06,122
They talk to themselves.

2478
01:49:06,222 --> 01:49:08,266
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

2479
01:49:08,366 --> 01:49:10,186
They don't have the courage you have,

2480
01:49:10,286 --> 01:49:12,286
to just run with it.

2481
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:16,874
Naturally, you're still wrestling with it,

2482
01:49:16,974 --> 01:49:18,346
so sometimes you're still you.

2483
01:49:18,446 --> 01:49:20,138
We should do this again sometime.

2484
01:49:20,238 --> 01:49:22,954
Other times, you imagine
yourself watching me.

2485
01:49:23,054 --> 01:49:24,298
If this is your first night at Fight Club,

2486
01:49:24,398 --> 01:49:25,418
you have to fight.

2487
01:49:25,518 --> 01:49:26,762
Little by little,

2488
01:49:26,862 --> 01:49:30,092
you're just letting yourself become...

2489
01:49:30,094 --> 01:49:32,363
Tyler Durden.

2490
01:49:32,462 --> 01:49:33,418
You are not your job,

2491
01:49:33,518 --> 01:49:35,114
or how much money you have in the bank.

2492
01:49:35,214 --> 01:49:36,298
No, you have a house.

2493
01:49:36,398 --> 01:49:37,515
Rented in your name.

2494
01:49:37,615 --> 01:49:39,435
You have jobs, you have a whole life.

2495
01:49:39,535 --> 01:49:41,034
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

2496
01:49:41,134 --> 01:49:42,858
Or you stay up and make soap.

2497
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:44,394
Marla... You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

2498
01:49:44,494 --> 01:49:46,346
Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

2499
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:48,911
But it's all the same to her.

2500
01:49:49,934 --> 01:49:51,934
Oh, my God.

2501
01:49:52,398 --> 01:49:54,282
Now you see our dilemma.

2502
01:49:54,382 --> 01:49:56,382
She knows too much.

2503
01:49:57,422 --> 01:49:58,410
I think we're going to have to talk...

2504
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,546
...about how this might
compromise our goals.

2505
01:50:01,646 --> 01:50:04,516
Wh... What are you saying?

2506
01:50:04,622 --> 01:50:06,186
This is...
This is bullshit.

2507
01:50:06,286 --> 01:50:07,786
This is bullshit.

2508
01:50:07,886 --> 01:50:08,682
I'm not listening to this.

2509
01:50:08,782 --> 01:50:09,706
You are insane.

2510
01:50:09,806 --> 01:50:11,466
No, you're insane.

2511
01:50:11,566 --> 01:50:15,306
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2512
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:18,314
It's called a changeover.

2513
01:50:18,414 --> 01:50:19,755
The movie goes on,

2514
01:50:19,855 --> 01:50:21,194
and nobody in the audience...

2515
01:50:21,294 --> 01:50:23,294
...has any idea.

2516
01:50:35,246 --> 01:50:36,106
Woman: Sir.

2517
01:50:36,206 --> 01:50:37,514
Are you checking out?

2518
01:50:37,614 --> 01:50:38,666
Yeah, uh,
b-bill me.

2519
01:50:38,766 --> 01:50:40,394
I need you to initial this list...

2520
01:50:40,494 --> 01:50:42,619
...of phone calls,
please.

2521
01:50:45,326 --> 01:50:46,410
When were these made?

2522
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:47,626
It says right there, sir,

2523
01:50:47,726 --> 01:50:49,194
between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

2524
01:50:49,294 --> 01:50:51,294
No, I w...

2525
01:50:54,414 --> 01:50:55,306
Have I been going to bed...

2526
01:50:55,406 --> 01:50:56,586
...earlier every night?

2527
01:50:56,686 --> 01:50:58,981
Have I been sleeping later?

2528
01:51:00,526 --> 01:51:03,586
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

2529
01:51:06,894 --> 01:51:08,894
Is anybody here?

2530
01:51:10,734 --> 01:51:13,353
Déjà vu all over again.

2531
01:51:14,414 --> 01:51:15,274
Yeah, with enough soap,

2532
01:51:15,374 --> 01:51:18,519
we could blow up just about anything.

2533
01:51:19,854 --> 01:51:21,854
Oh, my God.

2534
01:51:24,686 --> 01:51:25,578
Man On Telephone: 1888.

2535
01:51:25,678 --> 01:51:26,954
I'm sorry,
who am I calling?

2536
01:51:27,054 --> 01:51:29,944
1888 Franklin.
This is Maintenance.

2537
01:51:30,894 --> 01:51:32,234
Hello?

2538
01:51:32,334 --> 01:51:33,194
Hello?

2539
01:51:33,294 --> 01:51:35,114
1888 Franklin Street?

2540
01:51:35,214 --> 01:51:38,051
Yes.
Can I help you?

2541
01:51:40,302 --> 01:51:41,834
Hello?

2542
01:51:41,934 --> 01:51:42,986
Yeah, yeah.

2543
01:51:43,086 --> 01:51:44,266
Uh, I need to talk to your supervisor...

2544
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:45,226
...right away.

2545
01:51:45,326 --> 01:51:46,186
Speaking.

2546
01:51:46,286 --> 01:51:47,146
OK, listen to me.

2547
01:51:47,246 --> 01:51:48,362
I think something really terrible...

2548
01:51:48,462 --> 01:51:49,354
...is about to happen at your building.

2549
01:51:49,454 --> 01:51:50,474
You have got...

2550
01:51:50,574 --> 01:51:52,614
It's under control, sir.

2551
01:51:52,974 --> 01:51:53,866
Excuse me?

2552
01:51:53,966 --> 01:51:55,434
Don't worry about us, sir.

2553
01:51:55,534 --> 01:51:57,534
We're solid.

2554
01:52:00,366 --> 01:52:02,366
Man On Telephone: 2160.

2555
01:52:09,294 --> 01:52:10,186
Marla.
Marla.

2556
01:52:10,286 --> 01:52:12,286
Hey... Fuck. Wait.

2557
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:14,826
Wait, I gotta talk to you.

2558
01:52:14,926 --> 01:52:16,010
Marla, Marla.

2559
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:17,129
Your whacked-out bald freaks...

2560
01:52:17,229 --> 01:52:18,602
...hit me with a fucking broom.

2561
01:52:18,702 --> 01:52:20,266
They almost broke my arm.

2562
01:52:20,366 --> 01:52:21,898
They were burning their fingertips with lye,

2563
01:52:21,998 --> 01:52:22,922
the stink was unbelievable.

2564
01:52:23,022 --> 01:52:23,882
Look... Look,
listen,

2565
01:52:23,982 --> 01:52:24,842
it's gonna take a tremendous act...

2566
01:52:24,942 --> 01:52:25,802
...of faith on your part,

2567
01:52:25,902 --> 01:52:26,794
but you've got to hear me out.

2568
01:52:26,894 --> 01:52:28,682
Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

2569
01:52:28,782 --> 01:52:31,332
A little more faith than that.

2570
01:52:34,382 --> 01:52:35,242
No, listen,
I don't want to hear...

2571
01:52:35,342 --> 01:52:36,202
...anything you have to say.

2572
01:52:36,302 --> 01:52:38,249
You have every right to be...

2573
01:52:38,349 --> 01:52:40,394
Um, I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

2574
01:52:40,494 --> 01:52:43,178
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2575
01:52:43,278 --> 01:52:45,226
Why is it free of charge?

2576
01:52:45,326 --> 01:52:46,346
Don't... Don't ask.

2577
01:52:46,446 --> 01:52:47,434
Whatever.

2578
01:52:47,534 --> 01:52:50,026
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken...

2579
01:52:50,126 --> 01:52:51,146
...with the baked potato with everything,

2580
01:52:51,246 --> 01:52:52,618
and a chocolate chiffon pie.

2581
01:52:52,718 --> 01:52:54,718
Clean food, please.

2582
01:52:54,894 --> 01:52:56,458
In that case, sir,
may I advise against...

2583
01:52:56,558 --> 01:52:57,706
...the lady eating the clam chowder?

2584
01:52:57,806 --> 01:53:00,016
No clam chowder,
thank you.

2585
01:53:01,838 --> 01:53:04,218
You've got about 30 seconds.

2586
01:53:05,934 --> 01:53:06,794
Marla, I know that I've been acting...

2587
01:53:06,894 --> 01:53:08,009
...very, very strange.

2588
01:53:08,109 --> 01:53:10,154
OK, I know that it's got to seem...

2589
01:53:10,254 --> 01:53:11,241
...like there's 2 sides to me...

2590
01:53:11,341 --> 01:53:12,201
...2 sides?

2591
01:53:12,301 --> 01:53:13,514
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

2592
01:53:13,614 --> 01:53:14,474
I deserve that,
but...

2593
01:53:14,574 --> 01:53:15,658
I've come to realize something...

2594
01:53:15,758 --> 01:53:16,618
...very, very important.

2595
01:53:16,718 --> 01:53:17,706
What?

2596
01:53:17,806 --> 01:53:19,146
The full extent of our relationship...

2597
01:53:19,246 --> 01:53:21,194
...wasn't really clear to me up until now,

2598
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:22,409
for reasons I'm not going to go into,

2599
01:53:22,509 --> 01:53:23,850
but the important thing is, I know...

2600
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:25,066
...that I haven't been treating you so nice.

2601
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:26,026
Yeah, whatever.

2602
01:53:26,126 --> 01:53:27,018
No, no...
15 seconds.

2603
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:28,234
15 seconds,
please, please.

2604
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:30,058
15 seconds, don't open your mouth.

2605
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:32,586
I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry.

2606
01:53:32,686 --> 01:53:33,802
Because what I've come to realize...

2607
01:53:33,902 --> 01:53:36,962
...is that I really like you, Marla.

2608
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:38,922
You do?

2609
01:53:39,022 --> 01:53:40,458
I really do.

2610
01:53:40,558 --> 01:53:41,450
I care about you...

2611
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:42,506
...and I don't want anything bad...

2612
01:53:42,606 --> 01:53:45,034
...to happen to you because of me.

2613
01:53:45,134 --> 01:53:47,687
Marla, your life is in danger.

2614
01:53:48,814 --> 01:53:49,674
What?

2615
01:53:49,774 --> 01:53:52,042
You need to leave town for a while.

2616
01:53:52,142 --> 01:53:53,322
Get out of any major city...

2617
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:54,474
...and just go camping or something.

2618
01:53:54,574 --> 01:53:55,562
You're an insane person.

2619
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:56,714
No, no,
I've involved you...

2620
01:53:56,814 --> 01:53:58,474
...in something terrible
that's about to happen.

2621
01:53:58,574 --> 01:53:59,914
No.
Shut up,

2622
01:54:00,014 --> 01:54:02,014
shut up.

2623
01:54:04,206 --> 01:54:05,834
Listen,
I tried, Tyler.

2624
01:54:05,934 --> 01:54:07,018
I really tried.

2625
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:07,978
I know you did.

2626
01:54:08,078 --> 01:54:09,930
There are things about you I like.

2627
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:11,434
You're smart,
you're funny,

2628
01:54:11,534 --> 01:54:13,770
you're spectacular in bed.

2629
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:16,870
But you're intolerable.

2630
01:54:16,974 --> 01:54:19,754
You have very serious emotional problems.

2631
01:54:19,854 --> 01:54:21,482
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek...

2632
01:54:21,582 --> 01:54:22,826
...professional help.

2633
01:54:22,926 --> 01:54:24,234
I know,
and I'm sorry.

2634
01:54:24,334 --> 01:54:25,130
Yeah, you're sorry,
I'm sorry,

2635
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:27,230
everyone's sorry.
But...

2636
01:54:27,789 --> 01:54:29,829
I can't do this anymore.

2637
01:54:30,478 --> 01:54:31,914
I can't.

2638
01:54:32,014 --> 01:54:34,014
And I won't.

2639
01:54:34,478 --> 01:54:36,478
I'm gone.

2640
