00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,000
I think he could use our support.

155
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,500
How did it happen?

156
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,300
- How did what happen?
- Your accident.

157
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Honey, here.

158
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,500
<i>[Frank] Oh, no, it's okay.</i>
<i>Unless you object.</i>

159
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,800
No, I'm pro-honesty here.
I just think, you know, it's up to you.

160
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,500
Be my guest.

161
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Olive, um, Uncle Frank
didn't really have an accident.

162
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>What happened was he...</i>
<i>tried to kill himself.</i>

163
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,000
<i>You did? Why?</i>

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,100
[Stammering] I'm sorry. I don't think
this is an appropriate conversation.

165
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,300
Honey, let's let Uncle Frank
finish his dinner, okay? Shh.

166
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Why did you want to kill yourself?

167
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,900
<i>[Richard]</i>
<i>No, don't answer the question, Frank.</i>

168
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,400
- <i>Richard! Richard!</i>
- He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.

169
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,900
- I wanted to kill myself-
- Don't listen to him.

170
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,200
- <i>I was very unhappy.</i>
- <i>He's sick in his head.</i>

171
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,700
- Richard!
- I'm sorry! I don't think it's
an appropriate conversation...

172
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,900
- for a seven-year-old.
- She's gonna find out anyway.

173
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,800
- Okay.
- Go on, Frank.

174
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Why were you unhappy?

175
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mainly, though, I fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

177
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
Who?

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,000
<i>One of my grad students.</i>
<i>I was very much in love with him.</i>

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
Him?

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,900
<i>It was a boy?</i>
<i>You fell in love with a boy?</i>

181
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,100
- Yes, I did. Very much so.
- That's silly.

182
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,900
<i>You're right. It was silly.</i>
<i>It was very, very silly.</i>

183
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,100
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

184
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,100
- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- <i>Well, no.</i>

185
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,800
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man- Larry Sugarman.

186
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,100
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

187
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,400
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

188
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,100
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

189
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,800
So that's when.

191
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,300
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

192
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,700
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

193
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,900
<i>and I did some things</i>
<i>that I shouldn't have done...</i>

194
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,100
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

195
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,300
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment</i>
<i>and move into a motel.</i>

196
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,000
[Blowing Nose]

197
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,600
- And that's when you tried to-
- <i>Well, no.</i>

198
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,900
Actually, all of that was okay.

199
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,600
What happened was two days ago the
MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...

200
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,900
<i>awarded a genius grant</i>
<i>to Larry Sugarman.</i>

201
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,300
And that's when I-

202
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,000
<i>Decided to check out early.</i>

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,700
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

204
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,800
<i>Olive, the important thing</i>
<i>to understand here...</i>

205
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,100
<i>is that Uncle Frank</i>
<i>gave up on himself.</i>

206
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,200
He made a series of foolish choices-
I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...

207
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,800
which is something winners never do.

208
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,700
So that's the story, okay?
Now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh-

209
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,000
- <i>[Sheryl Continues]</i>
- Is he always like this? How can you stand it?

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Olive, tell him about your
routine while you're doing this.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is
a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque...

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,200
but you have to be six or seven
and you have to be a girl.

213
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,500
This is our sister.

214
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
- Cindy.
- Spring break.

215
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,600
Dwayne went to see his dad
in Florida for two weeks...

216
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,100
and Olive went to Laguna
to see her cousins.

217
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,600
- She made it to the top
of the regionals out there.
- I was in second place.

218
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,700
Well, what do you think
your chances are?

219
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,800
I think I can win,
because some of the other girls...

220
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,300
<i>they've been doing it longer,</i>
<i>but I practice every day.</i>

221
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,200
- Yeah. Good luck.
- Not about luck, Frank.

222
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,800
<i>Luck is the name losers give</i>
<i>to their own failings.</i>

223
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
It's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.

224
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,600
- You've got to want it badder than anybody else.
- I do.

225
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,000
- Then you're gonna be a winner.
- <i>[Sheryl] Richard.</i>

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's the truth.

227
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,300
<i>You know, actually, there is a message</i>
<i>from Cindy on the machine.</i>

228
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,400
Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.

229
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,900
- What? Little Miss Sunshine?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

230
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,600
What?

231
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,100
- <i>[Machine Beeps]</i>
- <i>[Woman On Machine] Sheryl, it's Cindy.</i>

232
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Remember when Olive
was here last month?

233
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,600
She was runner-up in the
regional Little Miss Sunshine?

234
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,200
<i>They just called right now and said that</i>
<i>the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.</i>

235
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I don't know why.
Something about diet pills.

236
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,800
- Now she has a place in the state
contest in Redondo Beach!
- [Screaming]

237
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,900
- <i>[Continues, Indistinct]</i>
- [Screaming Continues]

238
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
Oh, my gosh! I won!
I won! I won! I won!

239
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
- <i>[Richard] Finish your dinner!</i>
- I'm finished!

240
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
- What happened?
- I'm just calling to- Cindy!

241
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,300
Yeah, we just got it.
Yeah, she basically went crazy.

242
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,100
- <i>[Olive] I won! I won! I won!</i>
- No, I didn't get that.

243
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,300
- The machine cut you off. Okay.
- <i>[Olive Continues, Indistinct]</i>

244
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,800
<i>Redondo Beach. This Sunday?</i>

245
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,000
- <i>Wh-Are you guys going?</i>
- [Whispering] Yes.

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
- Can you put it off?
- They have to. They have to.

247
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,000
- Where does that leave us?
- We can't do it. We can't.

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,800
No, no- No, I understand
that, Cindy. Yeah.

249
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,400
- They-
- I just- No, I'll just
figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.

250
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,500
It's this Sunday?
Why can't Jeff and Cindy take her?

251
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
They have some equestrian
thing in Santa Barbara.

252
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,400
You know, they do that horse
shit every single weekend.

253
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
Well, it's the nationals. They're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.

254
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
What about Olive?

255
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,000
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! I won!

256
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,300
I won!

257
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
I'm going! We're going!

258
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,000
- You promised?
- We'll fly out and come back Monday.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,600
- How are you gonna get around out there?
- We'll rent a car.

260
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,200
- And stay at a hotel?
- We can afford it.

261
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,600
- This is our seed money.
- Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.

262
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
- Don't start that.
- It all goes to your nine steps!

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
I told you I'm gonna talk
to Stan Grossman!

264
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,100
We're gonna get locked and loaded on this
deal and start generating some income!

265
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,100
- But in the meantime we've gotta be-
- <i>Okay, okay! We'll drive!</i>

266
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,300
- I'm not drivin'.
- How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

267
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,200
- <i>Well, Grandpa does not have to come.</i>
- What? I coached her!

268
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,500
I gave her the moves.
I gotta go.

269
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,800
- Why don't you take the V.W.?
- I cannot drive a shift. I tried.

270
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,300
- We'll fly there.
- <i>We can't afford it.</i>

271
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.

272
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,400
Here. This is dessert.

273
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,500
<i>I won! I won!</i>
<i>I won! I won! I won!</i>

274
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,000
I won! I won! I won!

275
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,400
<i>Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!</i>
<i>Little Miss Sunshine!</i>

276
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,500
All right.
I'll drive the bus.

277
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,400
Richard, I was told explicitly
not to leave Frank by himself.

278
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
- No offense, Frank.
- None taken.

279
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,000
You got Dwayne here.
They can look after each other.

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,100
No, Richard! That's asking too much.
If something happened-

281
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,700
We can't go, then, unless
Dwayne and Frank go with us.

282
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,700
- <i>[Olive] Mom, where's my bathing suit?</i>
- Right.

283
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Frank?

284
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,500
- <i>I found it!</i>
- <i>[Door Slams]</i>

285
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Okay.

286
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,100
<i>I'm going! I'm going!</i>
<i>I'm going!</i>

287
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,900
Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.
Think of your sister.

288
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,900
<i>[Richard] Come on, Dwayne.</i>
<i>It'll be a lot of fun.</i>

289
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,400
<i>You can go to the beach and-</i>

290
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,100
<i>[Frank]</i>
<i>"This is unfair.</i>

291
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,500
"All I ask is...

292
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,900
<i>that you leave me alone."</i>

293
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,000
Dwayne, flight school.

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,500
I will give you permission
for flight school.

295
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,700
<i>[Olive] I won! I won! I won! I won!</i>
<i>I'm gonna win this one too!</i>

296
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,400
"But I'm not going...

297
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,600
to have any fun."

298
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,400
<i>Yeah, we're all with you</i>
<i>on that one, Dwayne.</i>

299
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,100
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Is Grandpa coming to California?

300
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,900
- <i>We're all coming, honey.</i>
- [Richard] Hey, uh, hold on.

301
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,000
Olive, come over here
for a second.

302
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Sit down for a second.</i>

303
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,100
Look, there's no sense
in entering a contest...

304
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,500
if you don't think
you're gonna win.

305
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,100
So do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

306
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,000
<i>Richard-</i>

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,700
Are you gonna win?

308
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,100
Yes!

309
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,600
We're going to California.
[Laughs]

310
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,500
Good night, Dwayne.

311
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,000
<i>[Writing]</i>

312
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,700
<i>Not on your watch.</i>
<i>I wouldn't do that to you.</i>

313
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,100
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>Thank you, Dwayne.</i>

314
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

315
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,700
Good night.

316
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,000
Jesus, I'm tired.
I'm so fucking tired.

317
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do you know how tired I am?

318
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,500
If some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it.

319
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,900
- Dad? Watch the language, huh?
- <i>That's how tired I am.</i>

320
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
She's listening to music.

321
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Olive, I'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around.

322
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,900
- <i>See?</i>
- All right.

323
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,100
- But the rest of us.
- <i>Oh, the rest of you.</i>

324
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,900
Can I give you some advice?

325
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,300
- I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.
- Can't wait to hear this.

327
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,400
Dwayne-That's your name,
right? Dwayne?

328
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
<i>This is the voice</i>
<i>of experience talking.</i>

329
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,500
<i>Are you listening?</i>
<i>Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.</i>

330
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,900
- <i>Hey! Dad!</i>
- Not just one woman. A lot of women.

331
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,100
- <i>That's enough, all right?</i>
- Are you gettin' any?

332
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,000
- <i>Dad!</i>
- You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any?

333
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,200
- <i>Come on, please.</i>
- No? Jesus. You're what, 15?

334
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,600
- My God, man!
- <i>Dad!</i>

335
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,100
<i>You should be gettin' that young stuff.</i>
<i>That young stuff is the best in the world.</i>

336
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,000
- Dad, that's enough! Stop it!
- Will you kindly not interrupt!

337
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,400
See, right now you're jailbait.
They're jailbait. It's perfect.

338
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,200
I mean, you hit 18-Man, you're
talking about three to five.

339
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,300
Hey, I will pull
this truck over right now!

340
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,700
So pull the truck over!
Fuck you! I can say what I want.

341
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,700
- I still got Nazi bullets in my ass!
- Ah, the Nazi bullets!

342
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,800
- You're as bad as those fuckers at Sunset Manor.
- [Horn Toots]

343
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
- What happened at Sunset Manor?
- Frank, don't encourage him.

344
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,300
<i>I'll tell you what happened.</i>
<i>I paid my money. They took my money.</i>

345
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,100
I should be able to do
what the fuck I want!

346
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,100
- He started snorting heroin.
- You started snorting heroin?

347
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
- I'm old!
- Well, that stuff'll kill you.

348
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
What am I, an idiot?
And don't you start taking that shit.

349
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,700
When you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.

350
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,900
- What about you?
- I'm old. When you're old,
you're crazy not to do it.

351
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,900
<i>We've tried. Believe me. The intervention</i>
<i>was a fiasco. He's worse than a two-year-old.</i>

352
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Can we please talk
about something else?

353
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,200
- <i>[Frank] I take it you didn't</i>
<i>like it at Sunset Manor.</i>
- Frank.

354
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,600
Are you kidding me?
It was a fuckin' paradise.

355
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,800
They got a pool.
They got golf.

356
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here,
sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa.

357
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,100
<i>Look, I know you're a homo and all,</i>
<i>but maybe you can appreciate this.</i>

358
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,800
You go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.

359
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,300
- Can you imagine what that's like?
- You must've been very busy.

360
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,700
Whoa! I had second-degree burns
on my johnson. I kid you not.

361
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,800
- Really?
- <i>Forget about it.</i>

362
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,900
What are you guys
talking about?

363
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Politics.

364
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,400
Oh.

365
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,700
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
I have no reason to lie to you.

366
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,900
Not one woman.
A lot of women.

367
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,900
<i>You heard what I said?</i>
<i>Did it go in anywhere?</i>

368
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
[Richard] Yeah, I think
we get the point, Dad.

369
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,700
[Grandpa] Don't show me the pad.
I don't want to see the fuckin' pad.

370
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,600
Mom, how much can we spend?

371
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,500
<i>I would say four dollars.</i>
<i>Anything under four dollars.</i>

372
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,800
Hi. You ready?

373
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,100
Yeah, I'm gonna have the,
uh, number five with coffee, please.

374
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
<i>All right.</i>

375
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,900
A number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

376
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,800
- Grapefruit. Okay.
- I would like a fruit plate.

377
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,900
- And do you have chamomile?
- <i>Yes.</i>

378
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,600
- <i>With honey, please.</i>
- <i>[Frank] I would like</i>
<i>the lumberjack and coffee.</i>

379
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,000
- And extra bacon.
- <i>Extra.</i>

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
- Now, Dad, you should probably-
- Richard, don't start.

381
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Well, it's his life.

382
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,500
- Thank you, Sheryl.
- <i>[Waitress] Garden salad?</i>

383
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,400
And you.

384
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,900
- I- I'm sorry. I, um- Sorry.
- <i>Take your time.</i>

385
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,700
<i>Don't apologize, Olive.</i>
<i>It's a sign of weakness.</i>

386
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,400
<i>Um, well, I want- Okay, okay.</i>
<i>I know what I want. I know.</i>

387
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Okay, can I get
the waffles and, uh-

388
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,700
I don't-
What does "alamodey" mean?

389
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,900
- Oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
- Okay, "alamodey" then.

390
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,500
- <i>[Sheryl] Olive, for breakfast?</i>
- You said four dollars.

391
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Okay. You're right.
Thank you.

392
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,200
Okay. Be right back.

393
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,400
<i>Actually, Olive,</i>
<i>"à la mode" in French...</i>

394
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,100
translates literally
as "in the fashion."

395
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,400
À la mode.

396
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
<i>"Mode" is derived from Latin</i> modus,
<i>meaning "due or proper measure."</i>

397
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
- Frank, shut up.
- <i>[Sheryl] Richard!</i>

398
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,600
<i>Olive, can I tell you a little</i>
<i>something about ice cream?</i>

399
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,500
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Well, ice cream is made from cream...

400
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,400
which comes from cow's milk...

401
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,200
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

402
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
- Richard.
- What?

403
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,100
- She's gonna find out anyway, remember?
- What? Find out what?

404
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat
in the ice cream becomes fat in your body.

405
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,400
- <i>[Sheryl] Richard, I swear to God-</i>
- <i>It's true.</i>

406
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,900
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

407
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,000
So if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.

408
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,900
And if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.

409
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,000
- Mom-
- Olive, Richard is an idiot.

410
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
I like a woman
with meat on her bones.

411
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,500
<i>[Olive]</i>
<i>I don't- Why's everyone so upset?</i>

412
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
<i>No, no one's upset, honey. I-</i>

413
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,100
I just want you to understand...

414
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,400
it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay
to be fat, if that's what you want to be.

415
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,700
Whatever you want, it's okay.

416
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,700
<i>Okay, but, Olive,</i>
<i>let me ask you this.</i>

417
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,600
Those women in Miss America-

418
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,900
Are they skinny,
or are they fat?

419
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,900
<i>Honey?</i>

420
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,800
<i>Well, they're skinny, I guess.</i>

421
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,700
<i>Yeah. I guess they don't</i>
<i>eat a lot of ice cream.</i>

422
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,000
<i>Okay. Coffee. Coffee.</i>

423
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,600
- Grapefruit.
- Thank you.

424
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,800
Chamomile.
And here's your ice cream.

425
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,300
"Alamodey," right? I'll be back
with your waffles in a second.

426
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,900
Does anyone want my ice cream?

427
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,400
<i>Yeah, I'd like a little.</i>
<i>Dwayne? Frank?</i>

428
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,700
- Olive's not gonna have her ice cream.
- Do you mind if I have a little?

429
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,100
- Yeah, let's dig in.
- That looks really good.

430
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,700
<i>[Grandpa]</i>
<i>Boy, I feel sorry for anybody...</i>

431
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,500
that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.

432
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,300
- <i>Boy, that looks good.</i>
- <i>You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive?</i>

433
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,500
<i>Those waffles are gonna be</i>
<i>awful lonely in there.</i>

434
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,200
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Watch this.

435
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Wait! Stop!
Don't eat it all.

436
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,700
- All right, Olive-
- Richard!

437
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,400
- Hey, Stan!
- [Truck Horn Honks]

438
