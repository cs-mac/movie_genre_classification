1
00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:03,035
<i>A few months ago, I discovered</i>
<i>I had a twin sister.</i>

2
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:05,708
<i>And then she she asked me</i>
<i>to take her place,</i>

3
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:07,982
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

4
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,725
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,257
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

6
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,226
<i>How long could you keep up</i>
<i>the lying game?</i>

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,403
I want to now what's going on
with you and Rebecca.

8
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,059
Nothing is going on.

9
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:22,271
REBECCA:
I'd like to see this one.

10
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:26,278
Guess who's gonna be joining
the band at Coachella 2012?

11
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:28,180
I think you look good
in just about anything.

12
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:30,221
It always bugged the crap out of me.

13
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:32,189
I was there the night
that Derek got killed.

14
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:33,124
You saw who did it?

15
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,927
He's the district attorney.

16
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:36,262
Alec Rybak.
Yeah.

17
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,198
Clearly, somebody's playing me.

18
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:40,103
Why didn't you tell
me that you were at

19
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:41,304
the scene of the crime that night?

20
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:42,973
You have to believe me.

21
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:44,842
Sutton means nothing to me.

22
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,312
Thayer and I slept together.

23
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,981
JUDGE:
Case is dismissed.

24
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,951
<i>I heard how weird</i>

25
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,953
Ethan was to you at the courthouse,

26
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,221
<i>and I think I know why.</i>

27
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,256
Ethan and I slept together.

28
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:04,797
EMMA:
<i>It was just so matter-of-fact,</i>

29
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,832
you know, the way that she
said it. Breezy almost.

30
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,201
Like she forgot to
tell me she borrowed

31
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,038
my sweater or something.

32
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:11,274
"Oh, by the way,
I slept with your boyfriend."

33
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,876
But, Emma, consider the source.

34
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:15,078
She's probably making
the whole thing up.

35
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,813
You were there.

36
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:18,215
When Ethan blew me off
at the courthouse,

37
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,018
when I looked into his eyes,

38
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,953
he was not the person
that I fell in love with.

39
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:23,188
And you called him?

40
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:24,956
Yes, four times. No returns.
I'm done.

41
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,159
You know what?
Just stop the car.

42
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,161
Mads, we're almost at school.

43
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:29,895
I know. Just pull over, okay?

44
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:36,168
Okay, get out.

45
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:38,002
What are we doing?

46
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,170
Changing places.

47
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,205
You shouldn't be driving.

48
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,175
Why, because I'm so
clearly intoxicated?

49
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,078
No, but you're having boy troubles,

50
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:49,016
which is still a crippling
form of impairment.

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,927
What? What are we...?
Where are you going?

52
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:58,328
Where do you think?

53
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,296
Ethan's?

54
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,965
No, Mads, we have school.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,001
Screw school.
This is more important.

56
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,104
Personally, I think
Sutton's full of crap,

57
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:08,907
but either way, that Ethan
Whitehorse is gonna man up,

58
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,044
look you in the eye and tell you
the truth. Now.

59
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,825
No one's home.

60
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:26,260
Oh, yes, he is.
His jeep's right there.

61
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:29,863
You need to knock louder like this.

62
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:36,036
Hey! All right, already!

63
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,271
Shouldn't you be in school?

64
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,939
I want to talk to Ethan.

65
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:41,040
Now's not the best time, Sutton.

66
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,308
What is that supposed to mean?

67
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:43,309
Is he here?

68
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,111
You should go.

69
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:48,081
No! Not until I can talk to him!
He can't avoid me!

70
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,216
Ethan!
Stop, stop!

71
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,918
All right, listen.
Listen to me.

72
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:53,053
I tried reasoning
with you as a friend.

73
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,922
This is the badge talking.

74
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,192
Go to school, or I'll haul
you in for trespassing.

75
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,894
It's that simple.

76
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,233
Wait, Sutton, wait.

77
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,037
If you want me to give him
a message, I will.

78
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:13,009
You can just tell him I came
looking for some answers...

79
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:15,245
and I got 'em.

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,075
Shouldn't you be at work, buddy?

85
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,978
I got the day off.
Shouldn't you be in school, buddy?

86
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:49,948
Mmm, I thought about it.

87
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:51,917
Then I realized I didn't feel
like being

88
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:53,084
the only former murder suspect

89
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,987
at the pep rally this morning, so...

90
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:58,323
All right, I get that.

91
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,225
I got to ask you, though.

92
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,894
What's going on between you
and Sutton?

93
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,830
Why'd you have me send
her away like that?

94
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:07,266
Let's just say I didn't feel
like seeing her.

95
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,201
Then you're an idiot.

96
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,904
Oh, really?

97
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,173
Yeah, she cares a lot about you.

98
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,942
She stood by your side
when everyone else

99
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,143
had already written you off.

100
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:18,145
You got a girl like
that in your corner,

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,047
you don't just walk away, man.

102
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:21,882
Believe me, I know.

103
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:26,821
Trust me, Dan, there's a lot
you don't know.

104
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,956
It's bad enough he did what he did.

105
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,058
I just can't believe
that he isn't man enough

106
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,094
to look me in the eyes and admit it.

107
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:35,163
Well, at least you tried
to confront him.

108
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,898
Now that just leaves Sutton.

109
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,033
What do you mean?

110
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,267
Well, if it were me,

111
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:42,004
I'd slap the lips off
of her smug little face.

112
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,205
Ah, that's not really my style.

113
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:46,108
(bell ringing)

114
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:48,144
Well, if it isn't the
elusive Madeline Rybak,

115
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:49,278
ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,080
You know, I called you last night

117
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,181
and the night before.

118
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:53,916
I know, Ryan.

119
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,284
I'm sorry I haven't called you back.

120
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,921
I've just got a lot
going on right now.

121
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,089
No worries.
I get it.

122
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:01,258
But if you'd like to make it up to me,

123
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,160
why don't we blow off
afternoon classes...?

124
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,896
I really can't. I'm right in
the middle of something.

125
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,931
Right. Hey, Mads.

126
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:12,034
Would you excuse us for just a moment?

127
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,135
Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:17,906
Okay, I'm confused.

129
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,942
Is this because I didn't tell
you about Sutton coming on to me

130
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,110
at the Black and White Ball?

131
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,112
No.

132
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,848
Then what?

133
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:28,250
I can't tell you.

134
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,954
Look, Ryan, if you could
just be a little...

135
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:32,122
Patient?

136
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:33,958
I don't know, Mads.

137
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:37,095
This is getting kind of old.

138
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,998
Do you want to be with me or not?

139
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:42,200
Because right now, I'm starting

140
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:45,237
to miss those days where you'd
just make fun of me to my face.

141
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,339
At least then I knew where I stood.

142
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:56,176
I guess I'm just a little
worried about somebody going

143
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,571
to the police with that picture.

144
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,671
I mean, it's pretty incriminating.

145
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,973
I don't think that's gonna happen.

146
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,524
If they were gonna go to the cops,
they would have done that by now.

147
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:07,158
It's somebody just playing with me.

148
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,523
Some fun.

149
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,096
So what do we do now?

150
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:14,900
Nothing. Just go on
with our lives as normal,

151
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:17,036
wait for them to make the next move.

152
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,972
And then what?

153
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:24,978
Then we make sure it's their last.

154
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:28,014
Mmm...

155
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:31,918
You're really not scared, are you?

156
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:35,856
I'm just grateful to have you
by my side on this one.

157
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:37,959
I guess that's why I like my odds.

158
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:40,194
I'm gonna be late to the office.

159
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,970
Hey, what are you doing there?

160
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,974
Hey, what, what are you doing
home at 3:00 in the afternoon?

161
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:53,142
Let me just...

162
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:55,143
I had a few things canceled.

163
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:55,878
I thought I would come home

164
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,154
and spend some time
with my beautiful wife.

165
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,369
I'm actually kind of a busy.

166
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,104
I wish you had
called or-or some...

167
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,373
Honey, what are you doing with these?

168
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:06,076
These are the files
for Justin's mother's case.

169
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,244
They were in my office closet.

170
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,113
<i>Locked</i> in your closet.

171
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,316
This is my work!
You don't have any right...

172
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,084
I have every right.
I want to know

173
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,219
what happened in the hospital, Ted.

174
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:15,872
Honey, we've been over this.

175
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,573
Is this about me and Rebecca again?

176
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:18,927
No, it's about us.

177
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,895
No, it's not about us.
This is my issue.

178
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,764
This happened to me, okay?!

179
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:24,565
It affected both of us back then,

180
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
and it is affecting us now.

181
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,770
Well, I'm sorry.
I refuse to keep reliving this.

182
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:44,688
Emma, I was starting to think
you didn't get my message.

183
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,757
No, I got it.
And actually, I have something

184
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,959
I want to say to you, too.

185
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,694
What did you want?

186
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,763
Oh, here. That's for you.

187
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:54,032
What is it?

188
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,068
Cash. It's not much,
but it's more

189
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,803
than what you came here with.

190
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,639
And I figure it's enough

191
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:01,607
to get you where you need to go next.

192
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:03,643
So, what?
This is your way of saying...

193
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:04,977
Well, let's face it,

194
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,947
since you and Ethan are
finally done, you're kind of

195
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:09,648
running out of reasons to stay.

196
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:12,684
Right. Fine.

197
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,786
Well, before I go, I just want

198
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:16,755
to get to the bottom of something.

199
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,923
Great! I love it!

200
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,559
Clearing the air. Sit down.

201
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,695
I want to know what happened

202
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,730
between you and Ethan at that ranch.

203
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,734
Are you sure, Emma?

204
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,002
'Cause I would be

205
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:34,705
more than happy to give you
the lurid details.

206
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,840
You know, the blow-by-blow.

207
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,575
I'm not asking for details.

208
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,677
Fine, broad strokes then.

209
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:46,616
Well, let's just say Ethan...

210
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,784
kissed me.

211
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,787
And then he kissed me,

212
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,624
and then he kissed me,
and then he kissed me...

213
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:57,929
(sighs)

214
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,933
Violence, Emma?

215
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,869
Classy.

216
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:07,706
Just goes to show that
they can take the girl out

217
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,221
of the foster system,
but you can't take

218
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,520
the foster system out of the girl.

219
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,979
Know what?
You can have Ethan.

220
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:14,848
But as far as me leaving,

221
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:15,983
you can forget it,

222
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:17,565
because, Sutton,
you may be done with me,

223
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:20,588
but I am nowhere done
with this family!

224
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:23,023
Really? And what is
that supposed to mean?

225
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:25,992
It means I'm gonna come clean
to Ted and Kristin

226
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:27,644
about everything.

227
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:32,065
And you thought I was running
out of reasons to stay.

228
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,903
(door slams shut)

229
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:48,792
Mom?

230
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,033
Sutton, what are you doing here?

231
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:54,152
Well, I just, I wanted
to talk to you about...

232
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:56,163
Are you okay?

233
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:57,254
I'm-I'm fine.

234
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,948
I'm just...
I'm just exhausted.

235
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:03,070
I don't know why I thought
I could exercise today.

236
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:05,597
That doesn't explain
why you're crying.

237
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:09,668
I'm, sweetie, I'm not.

238
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,541
I, I'm your daughter.

239
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,096
If something is wrong...

240
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,669
I just want to help.

241
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,639
Well...

242
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:23,259
you know how I told Laurel

243
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,851
she couldn't go to Coachella
with her band?

244
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:27,979
I've changed my mind.

245
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:30,915
And, and I want you to go with her.

246
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,785
Okay.

247
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,620
Why the sudden change of heart?

248
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:37,423
Well, I just think

249
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:41,560
it's a good opportunity for Laurel.

250
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,796
Why, why do I feel like there's
something else going on here?

251
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:47,833
It's not...

252
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:48,967
Mom, please talk to me.

253
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,971
Look, I heard you arguing with Dad

254
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,707
about Rebecca.

255
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,844
Honey, I don't, I just don't
want to discuss it anymore.

256
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:59,612
It's between your father and me.

257
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,848
Oh, my God.

258
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:06,019
You think Dad and Rebecca...?

259
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,926
I promise you, whatever it is,

260
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,629
everything's going to be okay.

261
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,540
(door opens, closes)

262
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:39,986
So do you think it's true?

263
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,654
Damn it! Sutton.

264
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,756
I mean, my dad and Rebecca.

265
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,991
How messed up is that?

266
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,659
I don't know.

267
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,927
It's pretty messed up.

268
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,662
I guess I've always just taken

269
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:51,030
certain things for granted.

270
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:54,667
Some of which I know
you have pointed out.

271
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,803
But if there was always
one thing I could count on...

272
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,905
Yeah, well, I didn't really
see it coming, either.

273
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,642
I mean, they've always
seemed so in love.

274
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:03,976
I know.

275
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,846
So... what do we do now?

276
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,915
I don't know.

277
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,886
Wait. "We"?

278
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,739
Do I want to hear this?

279
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:33,641
Maybe not.

280
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:34,876
Um...

281
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,945
Look, Ryan,

282
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,614
I still can't tell
you all the details,

283
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,716
but you wanted to
know what's going on.

284
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:45,687
I've been really worried

285
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:48,790
that someone very close to me

286
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:51,893
may have been involved
in something bad,

287
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:54,962
and now I'm scared

288
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:57,832
that I'm about to find
out that they were.

289
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:01,903
I just hate that you don't think
you can trust me, Mads.

290
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,542
It is killing me that I
can't share this with you.

291
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:07,943
It's like I'm

292
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:09,979
pushing you away, and I can't help it.

293
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:12,581
It's okay.

294
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,883
So this...
this person--

295
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,952
if they actually did something bad,

296
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:19,721
don't you think the truth's
going to come out eventually?

297
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,789
Maybe.

298
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:23,692
Probably.

299
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:27,529
Well, then, if it were me,
I think I'd rather know now.

300
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,698
Find out the truth, whatever it is,

301
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:31,667
and then deal with it.

302
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,886
What are you doing here?

303
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,988
You really have to ask?

304
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:53,924
We have nothing to talk about.

305
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,926
Are you kidding me?

306
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,828
Everything is falling apart,

307
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,763
and the one person

308
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,533
that I tell everything to
is avoiding me.

309
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,568
Fine.

310
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,570
What do you want from me?

311
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,772
I want to hear you say it.

312
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,642
I want you to look me in the eye

313
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:14,777
and tell me what happened.

314
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,579
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

315
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:18,581
I know you slept with Sutton!

316
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,983
Slept with Sutt...?

317
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,885
I did not sleep with your sister!

318
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,553
Really?

319
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:24,822
Then why are you acting this way?

320
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:25,989
Avoiding me at the courthouse,

321
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,691
dodging my phone calls.

322
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:28,859
Why do you think?

323
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:30,595
Because of what you did.

324
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,630
The way that you told me that.

325
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,898
I told you what?

326
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:35,667
That you slept with Thayer!

327
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,002
Thayer?

328
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,905
I didn't tell you I slept with Thayer

329
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,740
because I didn't sleep with Thayer.

330
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:45,044
And the fact that you
even think that...

331
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:49,715
What?

332
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:53,619
Son of a...

333
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:55,688
Sutton.

334
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,923
I don't know how
I didn't know it was her.

335
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,758
The guards wouldn't let us
get close enough

336
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,527
to each other.

337
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,800
I never, ever want
to feel that way again.

338
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,869
I'm so sorry for doubting you.

339
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:12,772
Me, too.

340
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,641
It's just that, when you guys were up

341
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:15,875
at your dad's ranch, I just let

342
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,744
my imagination get the best of me.

343
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:20,779
And I know... I know that
nothing could have happened.

344
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:26,619
Nothing did happen, right?

345
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:28,854
No.

346
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,590
Of course not.

347
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:36,896
You promise I know
everything there is to know?

348
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:41,801
I promise.

349
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,637
Okay.

350
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,774
I just think unless we all
start working together

351
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:57,949
we'll never get
to the bottom of this.

352
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,623
No argument here.
Where's Mads?

353
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,523
I texted her that we
were meeting here,

354
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,189
but I wouldn't count on her.

355
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,986
SUTTON:
Aw!

356
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,797
Look who patched things up.

357
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,172
Sutton, how long
did you think it would be

358
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,623
before we figured out what you did?

359
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:13,638
Actually, I'm kind of surprised
it took you guys this long.

360
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,553
You got some real issues, you know?

361
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:17,006
Oh, what are you going to do,
slap me again?

362
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,807
Next time, it won't just be a slap.

363
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,676
THAYER: Hey, nobody is
going to slap anybody.

364
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,845
Can we all just sit?

365
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:25,949
THAYER:
Now?

366
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,717
Thank you.

367
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,920
All right, so it looks
like my dad's guilt

368
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,655
or innocence comes down
to whether Rebecca

369
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:32,890
was telling the truth
about where he was

370
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,592
the night of Derek's murder.

371
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,660
SUTTON:
So what do we know

372
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,895
about Rebecca?

373
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,029
I don't know.

374
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,731
But there's just something about her.

375
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,667
She showed up at the birthday party,

376
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,702
and all the adults
were acting strangely.

377
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,704
Alec, Kristin, Ted.

378
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,940
She has gotten close
to my dad really quick.

379
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,009
EMMA: Yeah, she hadn't
been here two weeks,

380
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,677
and Phyllis and Char were gone,

381
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,612
and she moved into their home.

382
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,880
I was talking to Kristin

383
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,784
yesterday at the club, and...

384
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:58,918
Yes?

385
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,855
Nothing.

386
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,524
She... said she never
really trusted Rebecca.

387
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,660
THAYER: Okay, so I guess
we start by doing

388
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,662
some digging on Rebecca.
EMMA: You're going to have

389
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,931
to do it without me
for a couple of days.

390
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,733
Where are you going to be?

391
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:14,935
Well, in a half hour,

392
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,903
we are leaving
for Coachella with Laurel.

393
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,673
We?
I'm going, too.

394
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,942
Oh, of course you are.
EMMA: You do realize that you're

395
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:23,978
going to have to stay
in the cabin for a couple days?

396
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,847
As opposed to driving 300 miles
to the desert

397
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,817
to hang out with a bunch
of sweaty, gross hipsters?

398
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,553
Yeah, I'm good.

399
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,054
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just the two of us.

400
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:37,792
Hey.

401
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,026
Sorry I'm late.

402
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,596
He may be our father, Thayer,

403
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,731
but if he's done anything wrong,
we need to know about it.

404
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,840
You busy?

405
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,842
Hey, Theresa.

406
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:55,644
You didn't expect
to see me today, huh?

407
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,846
Well, since my brother's case

408
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,047
was dropped, I figured...

409
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,715
That we'd wait another seven years

410
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,850
until we hang out again?

411
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,619
No.
I mean,

412
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,521
if you want, I-I can leave.
No!

413
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,890
No. I was... I was just
surprised. That's all.

414
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,927
Actually, uh, I've been
meaning to call you.

415
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,862
Everything happened so
fast the other day,

416
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,698
I... I didn't get
to thank you.

417
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,868
If you really want to thank me...

418
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:18,703
You name it.

419
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:19,970
Well, you know, if memory serves,

420
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,772
you grill a pretty mean filet.

421
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,329
How about tonight?

422
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:24,572
What do you say?

423
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:27,200
I'd say it sounds
like you thanking me.

424
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,169
I'll see you tonight.

425
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:32,171
WOMAN: No, I don't have an appointment.

426
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:34,307
This is about my son, Derek Rogers.

427
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,276
I need to see

428
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,410
Officer Whitehorse.

429
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:39,079
DAN:
Schaub, it's fine.

430
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:40,246
I got it.

431
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,082
How can I help you, ma'am?

432
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:44,384
You can start by telling me
what the hell is going on.

433
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,387
Is anyone still looking
for whoever killed my son?

434
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:49,990
Yes. I can assure you
we're doing everything we can

435
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,225
to bring Derek's killer to justice.

436
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,227
Then some of you have a
funny way of showing it.

437
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:56,163
I'm sorry?
District Attorney Rybak.

438
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,332
I've been calling
him for a week--

439
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,368
sometimes three, four times a day.

440
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,403
The man won't return my call.

441
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,172
Then I will call him myself.

442
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,007
Because of whoever did this,

443
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,009
my brother almost went to prison
for the rest of his life.

444
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,143
It's personal for me, too.

445
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,147
I really do want to believe you,
Officer Whitehorse.

446
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,123
(groaning)

447
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:24,192
Ah, geez. Ugh!
Great.

448
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:27,195
Okay, something tells me
this never happens

449
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:28,429
to Florence and the Machine.

450
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:30,098
No, it'll be...
it'll be fine.

451
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:32,099
Ethan is really good with cars.

452
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,200
He can fix it.

453
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,335
You can fix this.

454
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,970
Yeah, maybe.

455
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:37,338
Uh, Baz, you got any tools?

456
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,273
I do. Oh, man,
I took them out

457
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,441
to make room for the equipment.

458
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,209
Awesome.

459
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,978
Great.

460
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:46,013
So now what do we do?

461
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,148
Well, considering we haven't seen

462
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:49,183
a car pass by in the last ten minutes,

463
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,353
I'd say we start praying
for cell reception.

464
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,125
ALEC:
I got to say, Dan, I'm not sure

465
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,393
I appreciate your
just stopping by like this.

466
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,028
I have a secretary, you know?

467
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,163
She's good.

468
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:01,431
This is urgent.

469
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,367
I got a visit from
Derek Rogers' mother.

470
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:05,202
She's a little frustrated

471
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,471
about the lack of progress
on her son's case.

472
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,473
Well, I'm sure you reassured her
by way of consolation

473
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,043
that we're doing
everything we can, right?

474
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,011
Are we, Alec?
Are we what?

475
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,447
Well, with all due respect,
are you sure that I know

476
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,449
all there is to know about this case?

477
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,384
There's no leads I don't know about?

478
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:23,052
No new suspects?

479
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,387
Let me think.

480
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,422
Uh, no.
You're up to speed.

481
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:29,158
Why are you even asking me that?
Well, I... I don't know.

482
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,393
I guess I'm just a little confused.

483
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,063
A little unsure about a few things.

484
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:34,397
Such as what?

485
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,265
Well, for starters, how did you

486
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,202
track down my brother
at our father's house?

487
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:41,070
And then, when you
seemed so hell-bent

488
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,338
on locking him up and
throwing away the key,

489
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:43,505
you dropped the case--
why is that, Alec?

490
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,307
First of all, Danny,

491
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,476
I'm not sure I like your tone.

492
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,079
And second of all, you're
looking at the man who bent

493
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:52,113
over backwards to spring
that punk brother of yours,

494
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:54,315
so before you come down here
to my place of employment

495
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,350
and tell me how to do my job,
why don't you

496
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,085
get off your ass
and start doing yours?

497
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,422
Find out who really killed that kid.

498
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:04,992
Honestly, Danny,

499
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,361
I expect more out of you, son.

500
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,239
LAUREL:
This sucks.

501
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,208
I can't believe
we're going to miss our show.

502
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:20,476
Well, you don't know that yet.

503
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,478
MAN:
Okay, bad news first.

504
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:26,115
Your van is quite broken.

505
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:28,017
Yeah, that's not really news.
Well, here's the good part.

506
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:29,184
You folks could not have broken down

507
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,285
in a more ideal county

508
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,487
for van servicing and repair.

509
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,423
Not to brag, but I'm the best.

510
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:36,424
How is that not bragging?
ETHAN: So when do you think

511
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,126
you can have us back on the road?

512
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,460
I got to pick up a few parts

513
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:41,195
from my supplier over in Rock Ridge,

514
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,296
and he closed at 6:00,

515
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,131
so I'd say...

516
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:46,133
by tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

517
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,467
Well, that's great.
I mean, if we hurry,

518
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:49,469
we can still make it
to Indio for our set.

519
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:51,204
Yay!

520
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,472
Okay, so we'll just have

521
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:55,108
to make the best of it and see what...

522
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:57,244
Buford Falls has to offer.

523
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:59,279
We should start looking into motels.

524
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:01,982
Let's go.

525
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,384
TED: <i>You know, I was kind of surprised</i>

526
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:07,254
when you let the girls go to
that rock concert in the desert.

527
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:09,089
Well, I love seeing them together.

528
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:11,425
It was important to Laurel, and...

529
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,194
it gives us a chance to talk.

530
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,429
Absolutely.

531
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:17,230
What do you want to know?

532
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,132
You want to talk about Justin,
hospital, anything?

533
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:23,036
Did you sleep with Rebecca?

534
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,138
(laughs)

535
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:26,439
No.

536
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,474
The deposition said you received
an unsettling phone call

537
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,346
when you scrubbed in that
afternoon-- something personal.

538
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,382
I know Rebecca was living
in L.A. at the time.

539
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,150
Why are you bringing this up again?

540
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:40,455
Because every time I
do, you shut me down.

541
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,390
I'm trying to protect you.

542
00:22:42,424 --> 00:22:44,058
Don't.

543
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,326
Who was that phone call from that day?

544
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,295
Was it me?
Were we in a fight or something?

545
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:48,329
It wasn't you.

546
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:49,430
Then what?

547
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,499
Please, I'm begging you, tell me.

548
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:54,402
(sighs)

549
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:59,273
Um... it was Dr. Rance.

550
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:02,176
The fertility doctor?

551
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,445
Remember that ultrasound tech

552
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,181
who said she was so sure
we were pregnant?

553
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:09,050
We'd been trying for so long.

554
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,418
But you said we had to wait

555
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:13,154
until Dr. Rance could
call to confirm it.

556
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,223
You had been through so much.

557
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:17,225
We were out of money.

558
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:20,227
It felt like this was
our last chance at having a kid.

559
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:22,997
That's...

560
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:24,365
That's who the phone call was from?

561
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:27,135
Dr. Rance when he called
to say there was no baby?

562
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,372
That's the distraction?

563
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:31,073
Yeah.

564
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,178
It was my fault.

565
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:37,180
Honey, no.

566
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:40,083
No, no. That's exactly why
I didn't tell you.

567
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:44,287
Honey... as a surgeon,

568
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:47,190
it is my job
to put aside all distractions

569
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:50,460
when I walk into the
operating room, and I didn't.

570
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:54,530
I was young, I failed.

571
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,433
(sighs)

572
00:23:58,468 --> 00:24:00,069
I had no idea.

573
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:02,304
I'm so sorry, Ted.

574
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,106
I should've never said those things.

575
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:07,242
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

576
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,266
Everything's gonna be fine, honey.

577
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,349
No more secrets, I promise.

578
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:21,321
I just I can't believe I lied to Kristin
about something like that.

579
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,201
I mean, I guess I was
just so focused on trying

580
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:27,005
to keep my family together,
I... I got desperate.

581
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,240
You were just protecting her, man.

582
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:29,308
Think of it that way, okay?

583
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,976
She was getting too close.

584
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,046
No, I can't think of it
like that--

585
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:34,180
rationalizing everything away.

586
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:35,949
She deserves better than that.

587
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:38,985
(sighs)

588
00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:45,124
What's happened to us, Alec?

589
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:48,194
Life.

590
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:53,032
We're dealing with it
the best way we can.

591
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:56,169
Trust me, I've got my own
little mini hurricane brewing.

592
00:24:58,204 --> 00:25:00,940
What? What's going on?

593
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,007
Ah.

594
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,010
It's nothing I can't handle.

595
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,913
And to tell you the truth, it's
been nice having Rebecca around.

596
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,181
Yeah?

597
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,183
Mm-hmm.

598
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,186
She's, uh, been a pretty big help?

599
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,355
Could say that.

600
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:25,297
I'm sorry I couldn't tell
you the truth at the time.

601
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:28,267
I mean, trust me, I-I wanted
to ditch the force for college

602
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:30,236
right along with you.

603
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,906
I did, it's just...

604
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,174
I guess Alec had other plans for me.

605
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:37,077
Okay, so wait.

606
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:41,079
Some spoiled party girl
OD's on her mom's pain pills,

607
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,316
and Alec Rybak convinces you

608
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,285
that unless you sell your soul to him,

609
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,154
you're gonna take the blame for it.

610
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:49,389
I thought he was doing me a favor.

611
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:53,127
I guess, with the benefit
of hindsight though, right?

612
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:56,964
You wouldn't have chosen him over me?

613
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,242
I know I should have stood up to him.

614
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,144
I'm sorry.

615
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:12,947
But I was young,

616
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:15,883
and we both know how
convincing Alec can be.

617
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:19,153
Alec is a bully.

618
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,255
And there's definitely something about

619
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,159
this Rogers case that stinks.

620
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:27,896
All right.

621
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,900
So what are you saying there?

622
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:34,302
You want me to dig a little further,

623
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:37,005
try and bring Alec down?

624
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,106
No.

625
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,175
(chuckles):
Whoa, what?

626
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,914
I am saying that
maybe we should at least

627
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:48,250
think about bringing him down.

628
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,286
Together.

629
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,302
So...

630
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,971
you excited for the big show tomorrow?

631
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:10,972
Yeah.

632
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,073
(both chuckle)

633
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,942
Kind of nervous, too.

634
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:16,311
It's gonna be weird playing
in front of an actual crowd.

635
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,346
You know, people who don't
go to our school

636
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:20,982
or play couples golf with our parents.

637
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:22,083
(chuckles)

638
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,219
Are you sure the butterflies

639
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:29,192
don't have anything
to do with, say... Baz?

640
00:27:29,226 --> 00:27:31,194
Baz?

641
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,995
What are you talking about?

642
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,131
Oh, come on.

643
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:37,267
I see you guys together.

644
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:38,268
I'm not blind.

645
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:40,003
Okay, so?

646
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:41,938
You should see the
way he looks at you--

647
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:45,175
he doesn't even look at
his guitar like that.

648
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,010
Okay, yeah, maybe.

649
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:49,213
I don't know,
there's just so many reasons

650
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:51,015
not to go there, you know?

651
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,050
Band chemistry, for one.

652
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,953
Plus, it's too soon.

653
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:56,955
I mean, Justin only recently stopped

654
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,925
leaving those epic voice messages.

655
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,260
(chuckles)

656
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,995
But enough about my love life.

657
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,865
I want to know why you are
still in here with me.

658
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:08,867
What do you mean?

659
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,301
Well, we're in a motel,

660
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:14,205
we're at least a hundred miles
from any parental supervision,

661
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,241
your boyfriend's two doors down,
probably shirtless--

662
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:19,177
do I need to go on?

663
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:20,614
It's complicated.

664
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:25,951
And there's a reason why I am
here with you and not Ethan.

665
00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:27,886
And that reason would be?

666
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,355
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

667
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:31,990
Oh, try me.

668
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,290
What, are you guys fighting?

669
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:33,990
No.

670
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,057
Got your period?

671
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,535
No.

672
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:37,837
You already did it today?

673
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:39,044
No!

674
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:40,163
Well, then what?

675
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,231
I give up.

676
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:43,967
(groans softly)

677
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:50,273
I'm a virgin.

678
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:53,943
(laughs loudly)

679
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:55,211
(chuckles)

680
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:01,690
So... What did you dig up on Rebecca?

681
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,765
Multiple aliases?

682
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,360
Dismembered ex-husbands?

683
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:08,704
Ooh! Was she
a porn star?

684
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:09,771
Nope.
Hmm.

685
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:11,673
Look, I hate to break it to you,

686
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:14,876
but everything
she's told us checks out.

687
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,321
Marvin Jenns, ex-husband,
founder of Jenns Records.

688
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:22,016
Married 2002,
swanky address in Beverly Hills.

689
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,117
That's it?

690
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:25,085
I was able to find
a red carpet picture

691
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,987
of her standing next to Bono
and Kelly Clarkson.

692
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:30,022
No, that's not helpful.

693
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:31,691
Actually, there is one more thing.

694
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,626
Jenns is a pretty
high-profile guy,

695
00:29:33,694 --> 00:29:35,828
so you would think that
if there was a divorce,

696
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:37,062
there'd be an article
or something about it.

697
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:39,097
I haven't been able to find anything.

698
00:29:39,132 --> 00:29:41,700
Do you think maybe she's lying?

699
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:43,101
Well, that would
certainly cast new light

700
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:45,036
on her credibility as my dad's alibi.

701
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,838
Hmm.

702
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,940
Maybe we should just ask her
if she's still married.

703
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:51,809
Or better yet, we can ask him.

704
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,010
Do you have his number?

705
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:56,815
Other people do know
how to use Google.

706
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:00,685
(mutters)

707
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,687
(line ringing)

708
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:06,124
(phone ringing)

709
00:30:06,158 --> 00:30:07,892
Jenn residence.

710
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,894
This is Carmella.

711
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:10,895
Yeah, hi.

712
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,031
Uh, is Marvin there, please?

713
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:15,033
No, I'm sorry.
He's out of the country.

714
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:16,701
May I take a message?

715
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:18,737
Well, I just had
a few questions for him.

716
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,939
I'm actually a friend
of his ex-wife, Rebecca.

717
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:23,040
Oh, Rebecca. Oh, my God.
How is she?

718
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:25,977
She's fine.

719
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:27,145
She's great, actually.

720
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,913
Uh, she sends her best.

721
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:31,716
Hi.

722
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,151
I'm also a friend of Rebecca's.

723
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:35,787
And-- you two
were close?

724
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:37,989
Oh, yes, I was her housekeeper
for eight years.

725
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:41,059
I was so sad when she moved away
after the divorce.

726
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:43,929
Can you tell me
where she's living now?

727
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:45,063
Phoenix.

728
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:47,766
Oh, Phoenix. Thank God.

729
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,735
Why are you so happy about that?

730
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:52,070
Well, she was always
talking about returning home.

731
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:55,073
And the love of her life
was always in Phoenix.

732
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:58,043
The love of her life?

733
00:30:58,077 --> 00:30:59,911
Well, she never told me his name,

734
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,747
but, you know, she always
had a photograph of his

735
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,082
in a locket around her neck.

736
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:07,985
And her husband never even knew
that it opened.

737
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,087
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say was calling?

738
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:11,722
Just a friend.

739
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:12,823
This man

740
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:13,891
that you're talking about...

741
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:16,060
I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

742
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:18,095
(sighs)

743
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,098
He so needs to fire her.

744
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,066
Great love of her life
in Phoenix--

745
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:24,868
I wonder who that can be.

746
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:27,171
Well, it makes sense
that it would be your dad.

747
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:30,742
I think we really need
to find that locket.

748
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:36,848
Would-- could we please
stop discussing this?

749
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:38,183
You are embarrassing me.

750
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:39,785
Well, I'm sorry.

751
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,120
It's just kind of hard to believe.

752
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:43,990
Sutton Mercer is still
holding the V-card.

753
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:46,959
So what were you doing with
all those guys all this time?

754
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:48,927
Are you one of those
"everything but" girls?

755
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,095
Stop.

756
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,964
BAZ:
He's four hours late.

757
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:53,932
They moved our set;
we're still not gonna make it.

758
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,102
What is this?

759
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:00,103
Okay, that's not my van.

760
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:01,671
Hey.

761
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:02,772
Bad news, y'all.

762
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:04,941
Oh, please don't say that!

763
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,910
I thought I'd have you
on the road by now,

764
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:10,848
but my guy gave me a water pump
for a '96 instead of an '81.

765
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:12,082
Can't you get the right part?

766
00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:14,118
Not until tomorrow.

767
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:16,988
Great. So much for
making the show.

768
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,856
I guess so.

769
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,858
Hey, there'll be other chances though.

770
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:23,761
BRODY:
Real sorry about that.

771
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:24,995
So, uh, you guys got yourselves

772
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,964
some kind of a musical combo, huh?

773
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:29,867
We were supposed to play
Coachella today.

774
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,702
Well, I don't know what that is,

775
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:32,969
but if you're looking for a gig,

776
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,704
I might know of a place.

777
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:35,805
What, a club?

778
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,974
Well, it's not a club exactly.

779
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,709
So, like, a house party?

780
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:41,810
Actually, more of a home.

781
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:44,779
Ethan's just grabbing
something from his room.

782
00:32:44,814 --> 00:32:46,048
Can we just wait a second?

783
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:48,150
What, are you kidding?
What?

784
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,819
Uh, Sutton and Ethan have some stuff

785
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,721
that they got to take care of here.

786
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,823
What, you love him, right?
Yeah.

787
00:32:53,857 --> 00:32:55,826
So what are you still
doing standing here?

788
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,828
Go.

789
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,704
You forget something?

790
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,973
Uh, no.

791
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:10,908
There's actually been
a change of plans.

792
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:12,944
Oh, don't tell me that guy
didn't get the van fixed.

793
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:14,712
Actually, he didn't.

794
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:15,947
But it's okay, because
the band found another gig,

795
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:17,882
and I told them to go without us.

796
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:19,984
What? Why'd you do that?

797
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,186
'Cause.

798
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:24,956
Ethan...

799
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,058
you and I have
been through a lot together,

800
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:29,961
but as much as we
care about each other,

801
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:33,699
there is always something
that... keeps us apart.

802
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,167
Yeah?

803
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:38,838
And every time it happens,
we always say

804
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:39,973
that the timing is just wrong.

805
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:43,878
And here we are, alone, and...

806
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:46,180
miles away from
everything and everyone,

807
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:49,816
and I can't help but think...

808
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:52,886
What?

809
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,130
The timing is right.

810
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,711
Oh, it's easy.

811
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:19,846
You and Mads will go over to
Rebecca's, where your father

812
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,682
is having dinner with her,
and confront them

813
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:24,985
for being involved--
possibly-- in Derek's murder...

814
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,787
No.
Yes!

815
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:28,722
...and you'll leave the
back door open for me.

816
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:30,891
(sighs) I will go upstairs,
and look for the locket.

817
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:33,093
No. No way.

818
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:34,995
It's already risky enough,
without having to worry about

819
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,163
someone seeing you.

820
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,098
Well, then, we'll do it together.

821
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,034
Okay. You know what, Sutton?

822
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:41,869
This really has
nothing to do with you.

823
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:44,138
It's about my dad,
and it's about Rebecca.

824
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:45,806
Well, fine.

825
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,708
But I can be moral support.

826
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:49,911
(sighs)

827
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,781
There is really no way

828
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,849
that I am going to talk
you out of this, is there?

829
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,018
Mm...
Yeah. No chance in hell.

830
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,755
Oh, okay.

831
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,841
You sure about this?

832
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,810
Positive.

833
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:36,907
Are you okay, Alec?

834
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:39,477
You seem... elsewhere.

835
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:40,434
(laughs) I'm sorry.

836
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:43,781
Yeah, no, I've just...

837
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:45,749
I'm just concerned
that I haven't heard from

838
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:47,518
whoever it was that sent that picture.

839
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:48,819
You know?

840
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:50,688
I thought by now
we'd have heard something.

841
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:53,825
Oh, well, it's only been a few days.

842
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:54,993
We just need to be patient.

843
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,662
You're right.

844
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,765
I know that. Makes sense.

845
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,868
It's just, if that picture
gets into the wrong hands,

846
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,603
I don't have to tell you...

847
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:05,539
You know, I've spent my whole career

848
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:07,975
fighting for the good guys, and...

849
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,609
this is how it's gonna end?

850
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:10,910
You know, I just...

851
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:12,545
I'm all right.

852
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,480
Just blowing off steam.
I'll be okay.

853
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:15,681
You know...
(clears throat)

854
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,950
I've been thinking about this, too.

855
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,886
I might have a...

856
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,554
little solution.

857
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,757
I'm all ears.

858
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:29,760
You have to be willing to
think outside the box.

859
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,829
Okay.

860
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:37,502
So, it's not exactly Coachella.

861
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,704
Well, maybe if you squint...

862
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,544
Pretty sure that would require

863
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,546
an impossible amount of squinting.

864
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:51,648
I hope you're not too disappointed.

865
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:53,717
I know you've been waiting
to play a show like that

866
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,553
a lot longer than I have.

867
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:56,754
Well, to be honest, Laurel,

868
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:58,589
Coachella wasn't
the only part of this trip

869
00:36:58,623 --> 00:36:59,924
I was looking forward to.
Really?

870
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,926
Yeah. A chance to
spend a little time with you.

871
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,830
I know that sounds kind of dorky.

872
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:08,734
Kind of?

873
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,703
No, I've-I've had a lot
of fun with you, Baz.

874
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:13,006
Well, I guess we should get started.

875
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,742
Uh, not yet.

876
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:18,878
Okay, now I'm ready.

877
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:21,614
Hello, everyone!

878
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:22,949
We're Strangeworthy.

879
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:24,718
We're going to play a couple
songs for you guys today.

880
00:37:24,753 --> 00:37:26,620
(applause)

881
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:27,855
One, two.

882
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:30,057

(Rebecca sighs, giggles)

903
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,797
Mads. Thayer.

904
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:45,666
What's up?
What are you guys doing here?

905
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,670
Hey. We actually had something
to talk to you about.

906
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:50,904
And it's kind of important.

907
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:52,874
Well, that's perfect timing,

908
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:56,578
because we also have something
we would like to share with you.

909
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:58,747
I... o-okay.

910
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,881
What is it?

911
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,516
It's good.

912
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,851
It's good news.

913
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,653
Honey?

914
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,823
We're getting married.

915
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:10,926
Wow.

916
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,661
ALEC (laughing):
Huh?

917
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,572
THAYER:
Find anything yet?

918
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:23,974
Ah. No.

919
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,677
Just that her taste in jewelry
scares the hell out of me.

920
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,845
Yeah, well, this evening

921
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,880
is scaring the crap out of me, too.

922
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:31,682
My dad just proposed to Rebecca.

923
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:32,950
What?

924
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:34,685
I... I'll explain later.

925
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,819
Did you find the locket?

926
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:37,954
No. No, I don't think it's here.

927
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:39,889
And if it is, Rebecca
has it hidden somewhere,

928
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:41,624
so let's just go.

929
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,793
Come on. What? No. No, no, no, no, no.

930
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,862
If that woman is about
to become my stepmom,

931
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:47,697
I gotta figure this out
before anything happens.

932
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:49,599
Shh.

933
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,934
Besides, the locket has
to be here somewhere.

934
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,670
Well, I looked over here.

935
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:59,574
What's that?

936
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,644
How did I miss that?

937
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:04,846
I don't know.

938
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:17,960

939
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:19,762

What?

941
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:22,732
Is it your dad?

942
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:24,701
No.

943
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:26,703

(sniffs)

962
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,804
I can't.

963
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:34,805
What?

964
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,675
Why?

965
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:43,816
I haven't been honest
with you about something.

966
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,854
Something I should have told you.

967
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:51,992
What are you talking about?

968
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,697
The other day you asked me
if anything happened

969
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,565
on the ranch with Sutton.

970
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:01,535
You slept with her?

971
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:04,605
No. I didn't.

972
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,973
But we kissed.

973
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,545
And for a little while,
things between us

974
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,648
were complicated.

975
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:18,886
"Complicated"?
What does that mean?

976
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:21,722
I was on the run,

977
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:24,791
and there was all this stuff
going on with my dad.

978
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:26,927
But it's over now.

979
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,663
It's over?
How can you even say that?

980
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,764
Because it's true.
No!

981
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:36,503
It...

982
00:42:36,538 --> 00:42:37,738
This is never going to be over.

983
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:40,808
As much as you deny it,
and as close as we get,

984
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,945
and as... as much as you
tell me that you love me...

985
00:42:46,516 --> 00:42:50,686
...there's always going to be
a part of you that wishes

986
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,955
that you could be with her.

987
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,961
What do you want me to say?

988
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,566
Nothing.

989
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:08,637
Nothing. Actually, I am...

990
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,540
I am grateful to you.

991
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:13,875
For what?

992
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:18,646
For keeping me from making
the biggest mistake of my life.

993
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:33,282
