2
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,267
In the year 3535

3
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,600
Ain't gonna need
to tell the truth, tell no lies

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,800
Everything you think, do and say

5
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,936
Is in the pill you took today

6
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,744
In the year 4545

7
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,718
Ain't gonna need your teeth,
won't need your eyes

8
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,689
You won't find a thing to chew

9
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,319
Nobody's gonna look at you

10
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,331
In the year 5555

11
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,392
Your arms are hanging
limp at your sides

12
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,836
Your legs got nothing to do

13
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,933
Some machine's doing that for you

14
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,810
In the year 6565

15
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,407
Ain't gonna need no husband,
won't need no wife

16
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:29,648
You'll pick your son,
pick your daughter, too

17
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:36,423
From the bottom
of a long glass tube, whoa-oh

18
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,965
In the year 7510

19
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:49,030
If God's a-coming
He ought to make it by then

20
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,942
Maybe he'll look around himself and say

21
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,743
Guess it's time for the Judgment Day

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,616
In the year 8510

23
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,881
God is gonna shake his mighty head

24
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,087
He'll either say,
'"I'm pleased where man has been '"

25
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:14,861
Or tear it down and start again, whoa-oh

26
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,865
In the year 9595

27
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,739
I'm kind of wondering
if man is gonna be alive

28
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,802
He's taken everything
this old Earth can give

29
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:32,908
And he ain't put back nothing, whoa-oh

30
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,147
Now it's been 10,000 years

31
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,419
Man has cried a billion tears

32
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,290
For what he never knew

33
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,590
Now man's reign is through

34
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,664
Benjamin.

35
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,128
What are you doing? We're going to be late.

36
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,293
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,631
And guess what?

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,140
I heated up the hot water bottle
so you can sit on it while we drive.

39
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:02,005
In the year 2525

40
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,812
If man is still alive

41
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:12,586
If woman can survive
they may find

42
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,770
Benjy, I'm so glad you signed up for this.

43
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,833
I think this is gonna be
a really neat opportunity for you.

44
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,379
- Hey. You Benjamin?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,648
I'm Mr. Keefe,
the homeschool co-op advisor this year,

46
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,748
but you can call me Todd,
or some people just like to call me Keefe.

47
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,489
I think you're really gonna enjoy
the Cletus Festival this year.

48
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,589
It's the best writers' camp in the state.

49
00:03:55,668 --> 00:04:00,264
Keefe, can you tell me how much money
he's gonna need for two days?

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,530
You think 4 bucks would be enough?

51
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:08,139
- Uh... I'd say more like 40, maybe
- Really?

52
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,212
Well, we better hit the road.
Got a big day tomorrow.

53
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,325
Be safe.

54
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,029
Hey, Benjy.

55
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,362
Remember who you are
and what you stand for.

56
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,997
I love you forever and ever.

57
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,411
Good morning, homeschoolers

58
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,149
Is everybody excited
for Cletus Fest or what?

59
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,194
Yeah.

60
00:04:56,095 --> 00:05:00,327
We will be stopping for lunch
at the Kozy Cafe in Echo

61
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,131
Some of you can afford to eat there,

62
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,940
but those who can't will just eat
the food they brought from home

63
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,069
Are there any questions?

64
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,485
Whether you like it or not,
when you get overseas,

65
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,717
- especially to Europe, I think...
- Right.

66
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,019
- It's different.
- It's totally different.

67
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,289
And you're completely infused
with another energy,

68
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,490
whether you open yourself up to it or not.

69
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,762
- So, I found it really, really inspiring.
- Hey, Benjamin.

70
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,894
Come here, I want you to meet someone.

71
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,770
Benjamin,
I'd like you to meet Tabatha Jenkins.

72
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,809
She's new to the co-op as well. Kind of.

73
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:54,553
She spent all last year as
a foreign exchange student out in Europe.

74
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,179
Cool. Where did you go?

75
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,257
Brussels.

76
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,520
Benjamin is from Saltair,
and he likes to write sci-fi stories.

77
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,237
Keefe is so dang awesome.

78
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,797
Yeah, he seems pretty cool.

79
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,602
I write French mysteries, you know.

80
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,170
How long you been doing that?

81
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,114
Mainly the last six months.
I write about a stable hand named Pierre.

82
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,287
Can I borrow some money
to buy some tampons?

83
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,350
All my cash is still in euros and I haven't
had time to change it over yet.

84
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,996
What? Yeah, sure.

85
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,202
Thanks. I owe you big time.

86
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,074
Don't worry about it.

87
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,930
Sorry, they didn't have any, so I just
bought some treats for me and Lonnie.

88
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,391
Hey, can we come sit by you?

89
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,295
Hey, Lonnie, bring our stuff.
Let's sit over here.

90
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,547
Benjamin, this is Lonnie Donaho.

91
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,142
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

92
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,053
He has his own video production company,
Donaho Studios.

93
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,320
Since I've been away,
he's been shooting my work on weekends.

94
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,590
I sent him my latest installments via e-mail.

95
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,963
It's been an amazing experience.

96
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,032
How many films have you made?

97
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,435
Mmm. Eighty-three.

98
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,771
But some are just trailers.

99
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,241
Dang. That's a lot.

100
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,309
Do you produce only Tabatha's work?

101
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,780
No. I do all kind of movies.

102
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:10,612
Horse movies, romance, soaps, fantasies...

103
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,682
Hey, Lonnie, can you squirt me
some of that lotion we just bought?

104
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,801
Will you give me a hand massage?

105
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,864
Yeah.

106
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,201
Yeah, I can do that.

107
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,701
You guys are so lucky
you get to be roommates.

108
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,499
Mine just wants to eat.

109
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,645
Hey. I don't think you're allowed to be here.
Mr. Keefe is right next door.

110
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,112
Relax, Benjamin,
I just want to get to know you better.

111
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,720
So, when are you gonna let me read
one of your stories?

112
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,190
I don't know.
I usually don't let people read my stuff.

113
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,263
Why not?

114
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,193
I've let my mom read a few,
but they've just made her cry.

115
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,428
Most people just get sicked out
and stop reading.

116
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,231
Really? Are there romantic sequences?

117
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,609
No. None of that crap. It's just some mild
swearing and sci-fi violence.

118
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,202
Well, have you tried posting
any of your stories online?

119
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,980
Yeah. But everybody can do that, you know.

120
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,846
I want to get published for real.

121
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,682
Ronald Chevalier had his first trilogy
published when he was 15.

122
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,088
Well, you'll never get anywhere
by just letting your mom read your work.

123
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,307
You can read this. It's called Yeast Lords

124
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,347
The Nad Lab was a cold,
white room

125
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,653
Bronco, the last of the Yeast Lords,

126
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,662
lay spread-eagle,
strapped to a medical pod

127
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,222
Someone had stolen his yeast,
and he had gone totally ape-sh

128
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,771
What the crap?

129
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,166
Oh, my... My gems!

130
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,076
Sorry, Bronco.
We had to borrow one of your gonads.

131
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,115
Daysius. I should've known it was you.

132
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,345
Oh, I'm not the real Lord Daysius.

133
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,719
My name is Dennis.
I'm one of his many clones.

134
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,726
We're all very sorry.
Lord Daysius sends his regards.

135
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,059
But we're investigating ways
to strengthen the military.

136
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,396
Your gonad is being used for research.

137
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,663
You took my nads.

138
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,704
We only took one.

139
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,706
You took my nads, Dennis.

140
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,504
I know you're upset,
but we plan to give it back.

141
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,737
We'll be done with it very soon.

142
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:59,411
Darn you, flippin' Daysius.

143
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,656
Get away from me with that. You hear me?

144
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,887
Relax, Bronco. This will ease the pain.

145
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,994
You release me, my cat's hungry.

146
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,231
Release me!

147
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,382
You tell Lord Daysius
to eat the corn out of my crap.

148
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,970
Good night, Benjamin.
I really need to think about this one.

149
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,229
Program.

150
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,800
Program.

151
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,489
Before we commence the activities,

152
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,158
I'd like to introduce you
to a very special person

153
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:02,597
He is a man who has repeatedly
probed our imaginations for decades

154
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:10,109
A man whose canon of work has pushed
the envelope of science and reason

155
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:18,187
A man who has created such realistic
characters, I call them friends

156
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,481
Chevalier.
He's talking about Ronald Chevalier.

157
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,249
Without further ado,

158
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:27,328
I give you one of the greatest
science fiction authors of our time,

159
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,396
Dr Ronald Chevalier

160
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,045
Thank you. So good to see you, Cletus.

161
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,785
Greetings and salutations

162
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:01,090
It is such an honor to be in the midst
of so many juvescent ripe minds

163
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:07,168
When I was your age,
I had just completed my first trilogy,

164
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:12,373
a body of work you now know
as The Cyborg Harpies.

165
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,376
- I love you, Ronald!
- Thank you

166
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,775
But what many people fail to recognize

167
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:25,482
is that I created over 49 different
pieces of cover art for that trilogy

168
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,592
No way.

169
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,564
In this first piece, we see an early
rendering of a harpy named Linda

170
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,842
Here, she uses her knowledge of lasers
to rupture the crust of a distant moon

171
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,419
Here is a detail of the ruptured moon crust

172
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,986
'"Must rupture the moon crust, '"
she's thinking

173
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,090
This is a piece that came to me in a dream
when I was 11

174
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,866
I call it Migration,

175
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,504
and it depicts a fleet of harpies
synchronizing their mammary cannons

176
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,267
to create laser-rain

177
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,335
A hard rain's gonna fall

178
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,846
And finally we have a youngling

179
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,985
trying to penetrate
the secrets of the human mind

180
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,188
You won't do it like that, youngling
You must use friendship

181
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,890
Thank you

182
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,492
For the first time ever,
it is my privilege to announce

183
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,704
Prism Publishing will be hosting a contest

184
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,434
for the best work submitted at this festival

185
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:56,604
It will be judged by a panel
of industry professionals,

186
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,381
including myself,

187
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,019
and the winner will receive
a 1,000-copy release of their work

188
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,749
at selected bookstores nationwide

189
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:18,935
In addition, I will personally
create an original piece of cover art

190
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,733
to accompany the winning story

191
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,740
May the glistening chrome of
the Borg Queen shed her light upon us all

192
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,652
Amen

193
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,149
I'm assuming that most of you are here
for two main reasons.

194
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,959
Alpha, you love to write fantasy fiction,

195
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,494
and beta, the character names
in your stories are suffering.

196
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:28,101
We're going to begin with a little game
which will demonstrate a theory of mine

197
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,166
known as "The Power of the Suffix."

198
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,779
You. Give me the name
of one of the protagonists in your fantasies.

199
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,878
Nebuchadnezzar.

200
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:40,985
Oh, boy.

201
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,620
Very original.

202
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,789
I've heard that one before.

203
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,687
But don't worry, need thou not be afraid,

204
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:54,931
for we can turn a humdrum,
forgettable name like Nebuchadnezzar

205
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,564
into something magical like this...

206
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,832
Nebucoronius.

207
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,602
And it's that easy.

208
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:13,345
We can add "onius," "ainous," or "anous"

209
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,080
to just about anything,
and it becomes magical.

210
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,881
You. Give me the name
of one of your central protags.

211
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,693
Bronco.

212
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,891
What is he, a centaur?

213
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,985
No.

214
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,066
Does he shape-shift into equine form ever?

215
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,464
No, he's just a man.

216
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,367
Well, then, I would...
I would lose the "C" immediately,

217
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,297
and I'd replace it with an "L." Bronlonius.

218
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,744
And if he's part of a traveling clan,

219
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,406
his clansfellow could call him
Bronlo for short,

220
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,543
except on formal occasions.

221
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,940
Yes?

222
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,020
What about names found in troll colonies?

223
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,323
In troll colonies,
well, that's a different matter.

224
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,922
Give me an example.

225
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,725
One of my trolls is named Teacup.

226
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:04,101
I don't like it.
I would go with Trojainous every time.

227
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,662
Yes?

228
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,638
But I still like the name Teacup better.

229
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,742
It's not a...

230
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:15,279
It's not a question of liking it better,
it's just I'm, as an author,

231
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,008
picturing myself as a troll mother.

232
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:22,014
I have just given birth
to a litter of troll cubs.

233
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,656
They're covered in placentae,
pawing at my many teats

234
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,817
for the vital, life-giving colostrum.

235
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:34,397
I'm not thinking, "Hmm, Teacup," am I?

236
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,927
It's just not believable.

237
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,528
And if I don't believe it,
the reader doesn't believe it.

238
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,368
Trojainous. Troka Kahn. Trody.

239
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,411
Names in this vein.

240
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,707
If female, Trojana.

241
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,785
Yes?

242
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,352
I thought trolls were supposed
to be named after resources, like trees.

243
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,426
Are you telling me
what trolls are named after?

244
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,265
You do realize I am the author of Troll, Ho

245
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,734
Because it all boils down to species.

246
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,494
Are they tree-dwellers,
bridge-dwellers, subterranean?

247
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,467
A troll wouldn't come up
with a name like Teacup, a little girl would.

248
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,211
Trojainous.

249
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,079
How was the workshop?

250
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,247
I don't know.
Chevalier seems kind of full of himself.

251
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,380
He's kind of lame.

252
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,492
Really? I think he's gorgeous.

253
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,387
He's not gonna like my story,
the names are all wrong.

254
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,323
Oh, I don't think so.

255
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,102
What do you mean?

256
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,239
Well, I thought your story was really good.

257
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,174
Really?

258
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,511
I thought you didn't like it.
Last night you seemed offended.

259
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:59,409
No. I... I actually thought
it was kind of amazing.

260
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,551
What inspired it?
Some weird surgery you had?

261
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,621
I wanted to write a story for my dad.

262
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,423
He kind of died when I was young.

263
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,494
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

264
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:20,995
He was real brave.
He was a game warden, an explorer.

265
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,869
I see. So Bronco is kind of like your dad,

266
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:30,142
and his gonads are his seed,
which means the gonads are you.

267
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,176
That's why they're so precious.

268
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,448
Well, you know, like all great writers,

269
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,784
you're gonna have to go through
a lot of crap,

270
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:43,520
but someday your junk will be seen by all,
and it will be awesome.

271
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,793
I truly believe that.

272
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,033
Thanks, Tabatha.

273
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,610
Chevalier.

274
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,875
Ronald, how's
the conference going Any contenders?

275
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,746
Well, let me read you a passage
from what I'm reading right now.

276
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,421
"Pierre used to be a jockey in college.

277
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,458
"He loves to have rice pudding with his tea.

278
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,262
"He loves solving animal murders.

279
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:24,429
"Pierre has two horses,
Jacques and Paris France, both girls.

280
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,732
"He rides Paris France
on the brick roads in London,

281
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,932
"looking for mysterious things.

282
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,977
"He rides Jacques for pleasure."

283
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,945
Merve, never make me do
another one of these things again.

284
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,573
These kids are a joke.

285
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,376
Ronald, as your publisher,

286
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,849
it's not a bad idea to get in touch
with your audience once in a while

287
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,926
All right.

288
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:55,125
Listen, Merve, did you have a chance
to look at the Sandcastle Diaries yet?

289
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:59,260
Ronald, I'll cut to the chase It's horrible

290
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,635
We can't publish it It won't sell

291
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,535
Unless you can give us something
worth taking to print,

292
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,201
we're just gonna have to let you go

293
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,606
Merve, Merve, wait.

294
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,012
Moon Fetus

295
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,209
A fetus is found on a moon base.

296
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,320
That's the premise.

297
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,051
I'll talk to you later

298
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,473
Bronco cried out in pain
as he sat on the shore of Goose Lake,

299
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,640
trying to sew his junk back on

300
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,023
- Excuse me.
- What?

301
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,490
Is this your pudding?

302
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,682
What do you want?

303
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,863
Hey!

304
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
That was my backup nad.

305
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:36,901
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,333
Was it a fancy pudding?

307
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,111
I know who you are.

308
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,547
Say what?

309
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:54,947
Our fathers fought valiantly
and were victorious in the Battle of Shiroh.

310
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,153
I was but a child then,
maybe you don't remember.

311
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,459
When your father died
at the hands of Daysius,

312
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,396
your mother wept so hard
that her milk dried.

313
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,566
To keep you alive,
we shared suckle at my mother's breast.

314
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,300
Vanaya?

315
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,674
- It is I.
- I don't believe that.

316
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,609
My family is dead.

317
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,104
My brother and I have been forced
to work in the yeast factories

318
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,739
ever since the epidemic.

319
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,750
- You have a brother?
- Yes.

320
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,220
His name is Kanaya.

321
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,245
He doesn't speak.

322
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,155
But he's very handy
with powders and gizmos and such.

323
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,353
He can build anything.

324
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,190
What y'all... What y'all want from me?

325
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,198
Let us come with you.

326
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,336
Together, we can destroy
Lord Daysius once and for all.

327
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,736
We shall begin a new yeast colony,
just like when we were children.

328
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,542
Well, that's my dream,
but there's only one problem.

329
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,309
They got my reproductives, Vanaya.

330
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,018
Daysius is gonna build himself an army
using my seed.

331
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,584
I can't let that happen.
His power's become unruly.

332
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,421
You know how weird that'd be,
a bunch of gorgeous yeast lords

333
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,336
with my face, running around,
making dang fools of themselves?

334
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,636
I'm sorry, Vanaya, I have to do this alone.

335
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,805
You and Kanaya would just be dead weight,
big time.

336
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,235
Gotta cut bait on this deal.

337
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,905
Krolaxx, come on. Come on, Krolaxx.

338
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,450
We know where
Daysius is hiding your yeast, Bronco.

339
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,752
Yeah, right.

340
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,914
I can smell a cache
of yeast cakes 40 mile off.

341
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,955
It's being held in
a mountain fortress just north of here.

342
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,227
I can show you.

343
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,692
Kanaya and I just escaped
from the yeast factory there.

344
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:51,969
If you don't believe me, smell my breath.

345
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,548
Tastes like homemade licorice.

346
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,317
Take me there.

347
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,086
Take me to your yeast factory.

348
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,757
I am your soldier.

349
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,061
I know
you like wearing your dad's old clothes,

350
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:31,066
but while you were at Cletus Fest,
I got you some new shoes.

351
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,973
Only $5, clearance sale at Haymart.

352
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,716
These are girls' shoes, Mom.

353
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,151
Oh, shoot.

354
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,817
I thought they were skipper shoes.

355
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,956
How about some good news?

356
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,727
I got really inspired about my collection,

357
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,395
and I came up with a bunch of new designs.

358
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,834
Do you mind if I run a few of them by you?

359
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,445
Okay.

360
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,479
I've changed the name of my collection
to Decent Beginnings.

361
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,981
I liked it 'cause I thought
it had a wholesome ring,

362
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,079
but I was hoping
it could appeal to a younger market.

363
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:25,152
Now, my first one is called Front Pew.

364
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,656
Now what I did was I extended
the hemline down like that,

365
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,236
so it brings the attention
back up to the eyes.

366
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,700
And this one, it's breakfast-inspired.

367
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,037
It's called Simply Cinnamon.

368
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:45,982
I'm gonna make it out of some beach
towels with some burlap fringe.

369
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,483
This one is called Righteous Dew.

370
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,057
Your father would've just loved this one.

371
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,231
This one's called Reachable Dream,

372
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:06,670
because all of our dreams are reachable,
Benjy, even yours.

373
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,726
Hi. Welcome to LeVonne's.

374
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,420
Can I look at that salmon gown?

375
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,266
Certainly.

376
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:47,066
This is a very practical design from
LeVonne's new Sunset Plains edition.

377
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,202
Well, how much is it?

378
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,279
This treasure right here
is on sale today for $79.95.

379
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,348
Well, that's a rip-off.

380
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,824
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

381
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,158
Lonnie's stepsister runs
the Navajo Taco stand.

382
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,432
They make a really good taco.

383
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,738
So, I noticed you left Cletus early.

384
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,610
Yeah, I had to come back and
help my mom with the trade show.

385
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,211
When do we get our manuscripts back?

386
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,813
Well, we got ours at the end of camp.
Maybe they'll mail yours.

387
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,150
But don't you have another copy?

388
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,782
Because I really think Lonnie should read it.

389
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,153
He has connections
in the audiovisual industry.

390
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,163
He might know someone
that could help get you published.

391
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,197
Are you serious?

392
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,460
Mmm.

393
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,932
Well, it was so nice
to see you, Benjamin. Bye.

394
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,266
Oh, okay.

395
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,344
Yes.

396
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,494
Bronco.

397
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,631
I can do better.

398
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,831
Broncanuss.

399
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,934
Broncaho.

400
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,235
Not quite.

401
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:30,942
Brutus.

402
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,421
Forgive me.

403
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:42,893
Cyclops there.

404
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,728
Cyclops there.

405
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,124
Brutus and Venonka surveyed
the yeast factory,

406
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,533
looking for an Achilles'heel

407
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,263
There was none

408
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,807
Cyclops there. Cyclops there.

409
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,507
Cyclops there.

410
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,215
Turrets.

411
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,948
Moon buggies.

412
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,823
Oh, my holy crap.

413
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,223
Surveillance does.

414
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,695
I hate those.

415
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:23,357
This is ridiculous. That's the most
well-guarded yeast factory I've ever seen.

416
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,459
Kenonka. Kenonka.

417
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,237
Show me your bag of secrets.

418
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,536
What's all this crap?

419
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,170
I thought you said he was good at making
bombs and robots and stuff.

420
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,012
What I meant to say was
he likes collecting things.

421
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,987
What's he doing now?

422
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,651
I don't know.
He must have found something.

423
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,282
(SIGHS) I'm not seeing it.

424
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,357
I'm not seeing results.

425
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,020
All I see is a bunch of organic waste.

426
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,025
What did he find, the genius?

427
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,128
Wait a sec.

428
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,579
Well, it's not a clean yeast.

429
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:17,010
It's just a fungus beef
sharing a few yeast-like properties.

430
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,918
'Tis ripe and delicious, though.

431
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,087
Watch this.

432
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,737
All right, let's give it a little test.

433
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,775
Not bad.

434
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,278
It's pretty good yeast.

435
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,772
This isn't bad.

436
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,739
This is pretty good.

437
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,218
It's not concentrate,
but it's pretty darn good.

438
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,278
Ha ha, whoopee!

439
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,759
I like it.

440
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,551
I like it.

441
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,979
Hey, Benjamin, come here.
I want you to meet someone.

442
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,123
Benjamin.

443
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:36,531
I want you to meet Dusty,
your new Guardian Angel.

444
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,668
What?

445
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,860
Well, I noticed you didn't have any friends,

446
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,032
so I signed you up
for the Guardian Angel program at church.

447
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,537
I thought maybe you two could go out
in the back and get to know each other

448
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,638
while I grill up some cod.

449
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,314
Oh, my word.

450
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,391
That's all right.

451
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,088
Maybe I have some paper towel.

452
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,496
Oh, my goodness.

453
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,875
Your mom's smoking hot.

454
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,916
What?

455
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,108
Shh!

456
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,828
What is that?

457
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,930
It's rat poison and some of my poo.

458
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
Sick. Is it lethal?

459
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,331
No. I don't know. Maybe.

460
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,474
Here, you try it.

461
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,634
I can't.

462
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,472
Dude, it's the circle of life. Go for it.

463
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,907
Centaur lover

464
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,443
Centaur lover

465
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,353
Chevalier.

466
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,081
- Ronald, it's Merve
- Yes?

467
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,259
I don't know where this came from,
but it's fantastic

468
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,219
Really? You like it?

469
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,559
I haven't even finished reading it,
I've already approved it for print

470
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,632
That's amazing.

471
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,667
I mean, it's a little jarring in places,
but I think it's gonna sell really well

472
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,862
Are you sure, Merve?

473
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,065
I've just completed the cover art
for Star Bracelets

474
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,472
No, no, no, I want you to start doing
preliminary sketches

475
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,841
of Brutus and his dog, Balzaak

476
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,041
Yes. Yes, I'll get right on it.

477
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,312
You're back to your old self
Congratulations, Ronald

478
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,981
- Thank you, Merve.
- No, thank you

479
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,892
- Mom.
- What?

480
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,486
You're not bleeding, it's just water.

481
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,165
What?

482
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,503
My gelee insert.

483
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,076
You're gonna be okay.

484
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,840
Hello?

485
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,111
May I please speak
to Mr Benjamin Purvis?

486
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,954
Tabatha?

487
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,216
I'm calling you on behalf of Donaho Studios

488
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:50,851
Lonnie thinks he wants
to produce Yeast Lords

489
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,056
Are you serious?
He wants to make it into a movie?

490
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,566
Mmm-hmm. It's gonna be
our next major motion picture.

491
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,159
We'd like for you to come down
to Donaho Studios to discuss.

492
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,506
Also, could you play a role in the movie
that we're shooting right now?

493
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,201
The sooner we finish it,
the sooner that we can start yours.

494
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,712
Yeah.

495
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,581
Yeah, totally. I'd be honored.
What's it about?

496
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,345
It's a romantic story I wrote.
You would be perfect.

497
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,318
And also, since your mom
works for LeVonne's,

498
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,321
do you think you could
bring some nightgowns?

499
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,516
'Cause we are in desperate need
of sexy nightwear.

500
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,560
That's fine. Yeah, I could do that.

501
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,253
Okay, great. So, we'll see you soon.

502
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,198
And congratulations, Benjamin.
This is a very big deal.

503
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,109
Are these the nighties?

504
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,683
Yeah. We have to be really careful
with them, though.

505
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,690
Hey, Lonnie, what are my lines?

506
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,656
Okay, guys,
we've just got two more scenes,

507
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,421
and then this trailer will be done.

508
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,225
Headphone, please.

509
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,832
And...

510
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,077
Action.

511
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,853
Mmm. You like?

512
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,067
Cut!

513
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,966
Lonnie! You can't do that.
That's an $80 Don Carlos.

514
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,471
Excuse me?

515
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,702
I don't even think
we were supposed to take the tags off.

516
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,811
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't do this.
This movie's gonna suck.

517
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,153
Benjamin.

518
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,916
No, Benjamin, wait, I'm sorry.

519
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,650
Look, it was Lonnie's idea, not mine.

520
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,488
And I'll have my people restore it
with scrap linens.

521
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,561
Tabatha, me and my mom are
gonna be out, like, 100 bucks now.

522
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,960
We can't afford that.

523
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,530
Benjamin, look,

524
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,399
Lonnie has come into
some serious cash lately.

525
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,205
What does that mean?

526
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,873
Benjamin, Lonnie wants
to pay you for Yeast Lords

527
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,178
Are you serious?

528
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,912
I'm dead serious.

529
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,345
Yeast Lords is amazing,

530
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,441
and it is definitely worth
at least a couple hundred bucks.

531
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,050
Hey, Lonnie?
Tell him how much you're willing to pay.

532
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,418
500, cash.

533
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,692
500?

534
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,754
What's wrong?
These guys owe you some money?

535
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,996
No.

536
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,857
Who's that guy?

537
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,225
He's my Angel.

538
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,470
Nice.

539
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,505
So, do we have a deal or what?

540
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,707
Yeah.

541
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,852
Hi, guys.

542
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,991
Did you catch any neat rocks?

543
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,751
Yeah. It was fun.

544
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,725
How about you, Duster?

545
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,369
What?

546
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,870
Bronco and Vanaya
began their assault on the yeast factory,

547
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:32,139
but the yeast patty Bronco had previously
eaten started to make him feel like crap

548
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,232
Bronco!

549
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,577
We must stop that gunfire
before it kills Lord Bronco.

550
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,148
Well, find something, Kanaya, anything.

551
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,795
Well, not that, you idiot.

552
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,894
That's just an old pudding.

553
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,005
Bronco. Are you all right?

554
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:45,606
What happened?

555
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,146
The fungus beef,
it's poisoned your spine juice.

556
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,719
We must get you out of here.

557
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,415
I can't move.
My buttocks is completely numb.

558
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,123
Oh, mother. A battle stag.

559
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,497
I hate those.

560
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,803
No! Run, Kanaya, run!

561
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,668
No, Kanaya, no! Run away!

562
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,825
And action.

563
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,438
Are you all right, Vanaya?

564
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:24,141
My brother.
He sacrificed himself, and for nothing.

565
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,515
We are yeastless.

566
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,480
We are yeastless.

567
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,243
Easy, easy.

568
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,120
Your brother loves you, Vanaya.

569
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,988
He'll do anything for you.

570
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,660
But Daysius has surely
destroyed him by now.

571
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,764
He's the chosen one.

572
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,165
He was born with flesh pockets.

573
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,799
Haven't you read the prophecies?

574
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,175
No.

575
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,975
We must stop him, Bronco.

576
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,805
Yes, but first
we must rest our bodies.

577
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,609
Come, let's bed down for the eve.

578
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,680
Okay.

579
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,790
And...

580
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,058
Cut!

581
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,697
Lonnie.

582
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,366
Lonnie.

583
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,468
And there we go, I think. Is that good?

584
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,593
Yes.

585
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,699
Oh, my gosh, Lonnie, I think all
the changes you made to the script

586
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,934
are so much better than the original.

587
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,908
I mean, this will be one
of the few movies out there

588
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,445
that is actually way better than the book.

589
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:15,285
Without a doubt,
the best line I've ever written is this,

590
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,091
'"Referring to her neck, she squawked,

591
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:23,493
'"'This isn't a wart,
this is the chancellor of the galaxy

592
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,897
'"'Now let us in"

593
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,738
Next question

594
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,509
Over here

595
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,978
In the second book
of the Cyborg Harpies trilogy,

596
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,671
Tribonius seduces the Borg Queen

597
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,615
by playing her an original piece
of music on his harpy-chord.

598
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,312
Can you explain what that music
was supposed to sound like?

599
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:48,987
Yes I believe you're referring
to a piece entitled Gorgana's Lullaby,

600
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:54,928
the notes of which are too numerous
for the human ear to decipher

601
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,496
I can, however,
reveal the lyrics to that tune,

602
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,969
which until now have been unpublished

603
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,339
That'd be awesome.

604
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:13,539
'"Within my breast-meat, there is a famine

605
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:18,218
'"No more sweets in the mammary cannon

606
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:23,757
'"You are Gorgana, my eagle, my queen

607
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,062
'"Your ovaries will destroy me

608
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,529
'"Collect me in your wings

609
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,903
'"I am just a man, and I want to breed

610
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,333
'"Together we will learn to love

611
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:44,973
'"You gorgeous hag, you freak machine'"

612
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,950
Yes, the young man right over here

613
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:59,119
I recently sold a story that I wrote
to some independent filmmakers,

614
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,787
and I'm worried they're gonna ruin it.

615
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,699
I know a lot of your books
have been made into TV movies,

616
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,325
so I'm just wondering
how you've been able to let go

617
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,200
and let somebody else completely
change the vision of your work.

618
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,236
Great question
Thank you for firing it at me

619
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:21,109
I remember early on in my career working
on the first Harpy mini-series

620
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:25,587
I told the producers I wanted
everything to be absolutely real

621
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,256
No special effects
I didn't believe in them and I still don't

622
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:34,621
And I had a scientist friend
of mine from MITbuild

623
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,395
a prototype of some mamocans,
which shot actual lasers

624
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,432
I tried them on
during a lunch break in front of the crew,

625
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:49,274
and one overheated
and began to malfunction,

626
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,971
and actually exploded
and maimed a dolly grip

627
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,675
It was very sad

628
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,853
So how do I avoid situations like that?

629
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:01,546
I mean, the idea of somebody
bastardizing my work really freaks me out.

630
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,650
I see Have they paid you yet?

631
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,285
Yeah. They gave me a check.

632
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,899
Well, cash that check immediately
Enjoy your money

633
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,901
I mean, isn't that why we do what we do,
dagnammit?

634
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,670
For the money, for the riches of the earth

635
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,741
When the future generations will look back,

636
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,333
do you think they will remember us
for our writing?

637
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,345
No, but for the wealth
we have accumulated

638
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,415
Why do you think I wear this bracelet?

639
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,187
And who knows?
Perhaps these producers may create

640
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,419
something even better
than your original version

641
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,494
Thank you, and thank you for coming.
Thank you.

642
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,797
Thank you very much.

643
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,700
You're welcome. Thank you.

644
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,139
Hello.

645
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,470
Hey. I don't know
if you remember me or anything.

646
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,806
I was actually
in your workshop at Cletus Fest.

647
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,471
Of course. Yes, you look vaguely familiar.

648
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,510
I submitted this story called Yeast Lords

649
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,676
I know it didn't win or anything,

650
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,811
I was just wondering
maybe if you had read it,

651
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,253
I thought maybe you can
give me your feedback.

652
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,619
No, I don't think I read that one.

653
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,820
It must have been one of the other judges.

654
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,198
Okay.

655
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,794
Goodbye.

656
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,247
Mom.

657
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:48,714
Mom, you need to calm down
and stop watching yourself cry.

658
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:02,256
My gosh.

659
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:08,335
I just... You know, I did the inventory
for the LeVonne's gowns this morning,

660
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,409
and it... It appears that
there's one or two things missing.

661
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:14,843
And that's $100 we don't have this month.

662
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:18,111
I don't know how
I'm gonna give you a birthday.

663
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,514
Don't worry about that, I'm fine.

664
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:25,352
You know, in the meantime, I might have
you try to sell some of my Country Balls.

665
00:53:26,124 --> 00:53:29,958
You know, maybe we could have, like, a...
A two-for-one deal.

666
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:36,358
Mom, I am not selling two in a sack.

667
00:53:37,035 --> 00:53:39,526
Come on, feel how heavy these are.

668
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:47,440
Two-for-one Country Balls.

669
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,145
Two-for-one Country Balls.

670
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:03,084
Hi. I just need to cash this.

671
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:08,090
This check is post-dated for next year.

672
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:09,200
It is?

673
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:11,393
Come back in a year from now,
and we'll see if it clears.

674
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,066
Yeah!

675
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:58,941
The world is closing in

676
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:02,110
Did you ever think

677
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:08,887
that we could be so close, like brothers?

678
00:55:10,095 --> 00:55:13,064
The future's in the air

679
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:16,362
I can feel it everywhere

680
00:55:16,468 --> 00:55:22,464
Blowing with the wind of change

681
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:30,209
Take me to the magic of the moment

682
00:55:30,315 --> 00:55:33,580
On a glory night

683
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:39,146
Where the children of tomorrow
dream away

684
00:55:39,257 --> 00:55:42,522
In the wind of change

685
00:55:51,503 --> 00:55:54,233
Walking down the street

686
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:57,432
Distant memories

687
00:55:57,542 --> 00:56:04,209
Are buried in the past forever

688
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,576
I follow the Moskva

689
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:11,850
Down to Gorky Park

690
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:18,328
Listening to the wind of change

691
00:56:19,865 --> 00:56:25,531
Take me to the magic of the moment

692
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:28,970
On a glory night

693
00:56:29,074 --> 00:56:34,569
Where the children of tomorrow
dream away

694
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:38,945
In the wind of change

695
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:05,367
Broadcasting live from Saltair Studios

696
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:07,274
here in the Great Basin valley,

697
00:57:07,646 --> 00:57:10,444
we bring you The Rod Decker Show,

698
00:57:10,548 --> 00:57:13,016
serving your community for over a decade

699
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:15,412
Your host, Rod Decker

700
00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:19,553
Good morning
Welcome to The Rod Decker Show.

701
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:22,349
We have some filmmakers here today

702
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:26,060
Mr Lonnie Donaho is
the director ofYeast Lords.

703
00:57:26,331 --> 00:57:29,494
Miss Tabatha Jenkins is the producer.

704
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:33,637
And seated next to me is
Mr. Dusty Crissop. He's the leading man.

705
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:36,172
Look. It's Dusty.

706
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:40,742
These guys are prolific.
This is your 84th production, Mr. Donaho?

707
00:57:40,946 --> 00:57:41,913
And what's it about?

708
00:57:42,314 --> 00:57:46,045
Basically, it's a story
about two Ionely souls

709
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,254
that find love during
a time of war and disease.

710
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:52,188
War and disease

711
00:57:52,457 --> 00:57:55,517
Okay, that sounds
That sounds interesting Yeast Lords.

712
00:57:55,827 --> 00:57:57,761
Your idea? Did you come up with it?

713
00:57:57,862 --> 00:58:02,094
No way. She bought
the story from a boy named Benjy Purvis.

714
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:04,498
This is so neat.

715
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,697
But to be honest,
his story had some major issues.

716
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:13,808
Bridgette? Some kind
of troupe of pre-teen amateur circus freaks

717
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:15,880
have made an adaptation
of Brutus and Balzaak

718
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:17,276
without my permission.

719
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:21,416
I'm completely distressed. I can't even
concentrate on my audio book narration.

720
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,519
Dusty Crissop, the leading man,
a movie star.

721
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:27,750
What was it like working with Mr. Donaho?

722
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:33,023
Lonnie is the best director
I've ever worked with, by far.

723
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:39,632
I don't know of another director
who can call "action" one minute,

724
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:43,400
and the next he puts on
a bald head and he's acting.

725
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:46,708
Yes, I don't know what we can do.
Can we sue them?

726
00:58:47,746 --> 00:58:49,373
Can we crush them in the press?

727
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:52,678
It's like working
with an extension of myself

728
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:55,947
I know, but if there's
one thing I can't stand, it's plagiarism.

729
00:58:56,621 --> 00:58:57,588
We're out of time.

730
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:00,183
If you want to see Yeast Lords,

731
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:03,192
premiere is tonight at the Saltair Cinema.

732
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:05,753
And to my guests, break a leg.

733
00:59:05,864 --> 00:59:07,889
I think that's
what they say in show business.

734
00:59:08,266 --> 00:59:09,995
Thanks for being here. Good luck to you.

735
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:12,160
- Thanks, Rod.
- Thank you.

736
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,673
Oh, my gosh. Benjamin.

737
00:59:19,477 --> 00:59:21,570
What are you and I gonna
wear to the premiere?

738
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:25,406
You got to promise me
you're gonna let me make you something.

739
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:37,019
Mr. Donaho?

740
00:59:38,696 --> 00:59:41,164
Hi, I'm with the Village Gazette
Nice to meet you.

741
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:42,233
Hi.

742
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:55,909
Hey, Benjamin. I'm so glad you came.
How are you?

743
00:59:56,014 --> 00:59:57,072
I'm good.

744
00:59:57,182 --> 00:59:59,207
Nice to see you, Benjy-boy.

745
00:59:59,384 --> 01:00:02,376
Hey, Lonnie. This is my mom, Judith.

746
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,646
Hi. I like your matching hippie clothes.

747
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,423
Oh, thank you.

748
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:12,528
There are important press people here,

749
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,790
so don't forget to do
a nice standing ovation.

750
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:17,193
You got it.

751
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:19,961
Shall we take our seats?

752
01:00:35,653 --> 01:00:37,644
Daisy had everything

753
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:39,757
Beauty

754
01:00:40,825 --> 01:00:41,792
Money

755
01:00:43,361 --> 01:00:45,921
A 50-acre horse ranch

756
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,801
A prize-winning stallion

757
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:53,995
But what she didn't have was

758
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:57,205
Logan, the stable boy

759
01:01:02,447 --> 01:01:05,678
But he was already married to her sister

760
01:01:15,393 --> 01:01:17,987
Hey, Logan, want to go for a ride?

761
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,625
Can we bring old big sis along?

762
01:01:20,965 --> 01:01:23,229
I was thinking it could be just the two of us

763
01:01:26,104 --> 01:01:28,664
Come on in The water's great

764
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,408
I don't think that's a good idea

765
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:57,895
I don't care if you have
a 50-acre ranch or a prize-winning stallion

766
01:01:58,069 --> 01:02:01,163
I love my wife
We have a great physical relationship

767
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:06,400
My horse's semen
is worth $10 million

768
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:10,347
Investors from all over the world have tried
everything they can

769
01:02:10,448 --> 01:02:11,847
to get their hands on it

770
01:02:23,228 --> 01:02:24,195
Benjamin.

771
01:02:34,172 --> 01:02:36,868
I've only just realized
that what we shared together onscreen

772
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:39,239
was very real to me.

773
01:02:40,745 --> 01:02:41,712
I don't feel very good.

774
01:02:42,013 --> 01:02:44,675
Oh, well, you're nervous about the film,
aren't you?

775
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,339
Yeah.

776
01:02:46,451 --> 01:02:47,475
Well, let's get out of here, then.

777
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:51,077
Let's go someplace
where we can relax and be alone.

778
01:02:54,892 --> 01:02:55,859
Okay.

779
01:02:56,694 --> 01:02:57,956
Can you hold on for just a second?

780
01:02:58,062 --> 01:02:59,029
Oh, yeah.

781
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:27,618
Come with me to my underground facilities

782
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:39,694
Working at the yeast facility
has made my breasts so big

783
01:03:40,104 --> 01:03:42,368
and gave me so many diseases

784
01:03:43,174 --> 01:03:45,608
I wish I could've been there for ye

785
01:03:48,146 --> 01:03:52,276
Your brother loves you, Vanaya,
and he'd do anything for ye

786
01:03:53,117 --> 01:03:55,847
But Daysius has surely
destroyed him by now

787
01:04:10,935 --> 01:04:13,961
One of the laser hit my boobs

788
01:04:14,806 --> 01:04:16,205
Okay, we can go.

789
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:38,555
I thought we could grab a couple of
sudokus and snuggle up somewhere.

790
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,196
Groggily,
Brutus regained consciousness

791
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:20,200
There was a numb pain below,

792
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:23,603
some stitches obviously
sewn by a medical droid

793
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:28,938
Instantly, Brutus knew that one
of his reproductive bags had been stolen

794
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:36,947
Oh, my gosh, is that
the new Chevalier book?

795
01:05:37,722 --> 01:05:38,689
Read this.

796
01:05:39,323 --> 01:05:40,813
Benjy, don't ruin it for me.

797
01:05:40,925 --> 01:05:41,892
Just read it.

798
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,827
Okay.

799
01:05:47,965 --> 01:05:50,627
"As Brutus struggled to free
himself from the medical pod,

800
01:05:50,735 --> 01:05:52,896
"a voice spoke to him
from across the room.

801
01:05:53,237 --> 01:05:56,400
"'I'm sorry, Brutus,
we had to borrow one of your gonads.

802
01:05:57,775 --> 01:06:01,768
"'We're investigating ways
to strengthen the military."'

803
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,777
I don't believe this.

804
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:20,855
Benjamin, wait, we can get through this.

805
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:24,464
Strutting into town
like you're slinging a gun

806
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:29,268
Just a small-town dude
with a big-city attitude

807
01:06:29,373 --> 01:06:33,241
Honey, are you looking
for some trouble tonight?

808
01:06:33,344 --> 01:06:35,369
Well, all right

809
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,007
You think you're so bad,
drive the women folk wild

810
01:06:39,116 --> 01:06:43,519
Shoot them all down
with the flash of your pearly smile

811
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:47,250
Honey, but you met your match tonight

812
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:49,155
Oh, that's right

813
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,160
You think you'll knock me off my feet

814
01:06:51,262 --> 01:06:52,854
Till I'm flat on the floor

815
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:56,627
Till my heart is crying Indian
and I'm begging for more

816
01:06:56,734 --> 01:07:00,431
So come on, baby
Come on, baby

817
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:02,938
Come on, baby,
show me what that loaded gun is for

818
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,029
Dusty?

819
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:08,410
What are you doing here?

820
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,041
I brought your wrap gift.

821
01:07:14,151 --> 01:07:15,118
Oh.

822
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:25,619
People hated your movie.

823
01:07:26,564 --> 01:07:27,588
Some of them walked out.

824
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:29,689
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

825
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:33,670
And this guy said
you stole the whole deal from some book.

826
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:34,738
It's not true.

827
01:07:35,406 --> 01:07:38,102
Yeah. I hit that guy in the face.

828
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:40,767
Then I punched Lonnie in the neck.

829
01:07:41,946 --> 01:07:43,504
Lonnie's a butthole.

830
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:47,076
Did you hear what he did to my voice?
I sound like a leprechaun.

831
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,219
That's why if somebody messes
with one of your stories again,

832
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:51,618
you gotta take them out.

833
01:07:52,423 --> 01:07:53,390
'Cause you're good.

834
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:57,317
And I'm not saying that
just 'cause I'm your Guardian Angel.

835
01:07:59,797 --> 01:08:00,764
Thanks.

836
01:08:04,068 --> 01:08:06,502
Just like Jesse James

837
01:08:06,604 --> 01:08:10,631
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames

838
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:13,107
Just like Jesse James

839
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:17,374
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames

840
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:23,511
Just like Jesse James

841
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:28,251
I'm gonna shoot you down, Jesse James

842
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,161
Look.

843
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:35,297
Who's that?

844
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:39,330
Isn't that your hero? He's in town.

845
01:08:39,804 --> 01:08:43,262
Maybe after Don Carlos,
we could drop by the book signing.

846
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:46,768
You know, Don Carlos owns the biggest
nightgown company in the state,

847
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:49,345
and he wants to see my entire line.

848
01:08:49,447 --> 01:08:51,347
I mean, this could be my big ticket.

849
01:08:52,016 --> 01:08:54,211
I feel like things are changing for us,
don't you?

850
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:59,288
And it's gotta be Dusty.
He's our good luck charm.

851
01:08:59,457 --> 01:09:02,654
Come on. Come on, honey, I need your help.

852
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,855
We gotta do a few loads.

853
01:09:05,963 --> 01:09:06,987
Ow.

854
01:09:07,531 --> 01:09:08,498
Get her.

855
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:16,269
Guess this is it.

856
01:09:17,508 --> 01:09:18,998
I'm so nervous.

857
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,606
I just pray that he likes my collection.

858
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:25,949
How do I look?

859
01:09:26,651 --> 01:09:27,777
You look fine.

860
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:29,984
Wish me luck.

861
01:10:10,061 --> 01:10:12,188
Your house is a real palace.

862
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:15,855
Hey. I didn't see you there.

863
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,791
Love your dress.

864
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:20,704
Thank you.

865
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,999
Why don't you go into my bedroom
and undress to your comfort level,

866
01:10:24,108 --> 01:10:25,871
and I'll be there in a second.

867
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:44,756
Brutus stood
at the edge of the pond

868
01:10:44,862 --> 01:10:47,592
and held aloft a futuristic cylinder

869
01:10:48,065 --> 01:10:50,192
I made us a time capsule.

870
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:53,293
I put a butt-Ioad of keepsakes in it.

871
01:10:53,404 --> 01:10:55,634
We can send it floating downstream,

872
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,936
and that way, if we die,
future generations will learn from us.

873
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:02,377
Look at this.

874
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:04,542
It's a friendship stone.

875
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:07,678
Come closer.

876
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:10,879
Let's blow on it.

877
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:13,489
You blow first.

878
01:11:32,009 --> 01:11:32,976
What?

879
01:11:53,531 --> 01:11:56,432
Mom. What happened?

880
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:03,698
He wanted me to bed down with him.

881
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:04,775
He what?

882
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,866
He said if I slept with him,

883
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:11,975
that I could have my nightgowns
in every Penney's across America.

884
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:19,021
But I couldn't do it.

885
01:12:21,392 --> 01:12:24,691
Benjamin, no! Benjamin, no!

886
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:29,395
Hey, Don Carlos! How about you come
down here and fight me like a man!

887
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:31,760
Benjamin, stop, get back in the car.

888
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:34,933
Benjamin, get back in the car!

889
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:42,841
You think you can harass
my mom, you fat sack of crap?

890
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:45,044
Come down here and fight me!

891
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:55,853
Mom, I need you to pop open the trunk
and run away from the car.

892
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,120
I can't.

893
01:12:57,228 --> 01:12:59,458
Just pop open the trunk
and get out of here.

894
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:01,263
No, but I can't.

895
01:13:50,381 --> 01:13:56,013
Finished with my woman
'cause she couldn't help me with my mind

896
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:02,116
People think I'm insane
because I am frowning all the time

897
01:14:13,771 --> 01:14:16,103
All day long I think of things

898
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:17,764
But nothing seems to satisfy

899
01:14:21,612 --> 01:14:23,443
- Hello.
- Hi.

900
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:25,071
And who can I make this out to?

901
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:26,171
Kristie.

902
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:27,784
Kristie.

903
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:37,688
I would just love to step inside your brain
for a day and see what it's like.

904
01:14:38,495 --> 01:14:41,828
Explore its many kingdoms
and learn its darkest secrets.

905
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:46,603
Take it from someone who lives there,
you might not be able to handle it.

906
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:51,272
My mind is a landscape
of mystery, of thrills.

907
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:54,033
A place where even the bravest of travelers

908
01:14:54,178 --> 01:14:56,840
would be shaken
by its geysers of original thought.

909
01:14:57,548 --> 01:14:58,606
Wow!

910
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,141
Hmm.

911
01:15:00,651 --> 01:15:03,814
I know. May the gods bless you.

912
01:15:04,955 --> 01:15:10,757
And so as you hear
these words telling you now of my state

913
01:15:10,861 --> 01:15:16,731
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late

914
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:22,363
- Hi.
- Hi.

915
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:27,370
I was wondering
if you would sign this for me.

916
01:15:43,193 --> 01:15:45,058
Excuse me for a moment.

917
01:15:51,702 --> 01:15:54,500
Friends Friends

918
01:15:55,205 --> 01:15:59,335
I would like to introduce you
to a dear disciple of mine

919
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,640
This young man standing beside me

920
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:05,940
loved Brutus and Balzaak so much

921
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:13,381
that he turned it into a gripping screen
adaptation called Yeastie Boys.

922
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,786
As a reward for his efforts,

923
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:21,426
Prism Publishing has decided to honor him

924
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:25,157
with an all-expenses-paid trip

925
01:16:25,269 --> 01:16:28,500
to any one of the lower 48 states,

926
01:16:29,706 --> 01:16:36,270
And this commemorative bean-pillow,

927
01:16:36,747 --> 01:16:37,714
mini-size,

928
01:16:43,387 --> 01:16:44,820
this jacket,

929
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:49,483
and a trip to Space Camp

930
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:51,995
Awesome.

931
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:55,461
Join me now in a moment of silence

932
01:16:55,566 --> 01:17:00,868
as we commemorate his contribution
to science and the arts

933
01:17:18,322 --> 01:17:20,449
Put the pillow down, I beg of you.

934
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:21,819
You stole my story.

935
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:23,492
I don't know what you're talking about.

936
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:26,787
All you did was change the character
names and turn Bronco into a tranny.

937
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:29,457
Shut up.
I don't know what he's talking about.

938
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:31,431
Please, someone seize him.

939
01:17:33,036 --> 01:17:34,003
Seize him.

940
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:37,805
You're a fraud, and all your fans
should know you're a fraud.

941
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:39,843
Take him away.

942
01:17:41,712 --> 01:17:42,679
Get lost.

943
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,538
But, please, show leniency.
Always leniency.

944
01:17:47,518 --> 01:17:48,883
Open the gate.

945
01:17:53,157 --> 01:17:54,385
Benjamin?

946
01:17:55,626 --> 01:17:56,854
Benjamin?

947
01:17:58,595 --> 01:17:59,562
Benjamin?

948
01:18:02,132 --> 01:18:05,226
Oh, Benjamin. There you are.

949
01:18:06,136 --> 01:18:07,501
Oh, honey.

950
01:18:08,872 --> 01:18:11,170
This is a terrible place.

951
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,969
Are you all right?
You're not wounded, are you?

952
01:18:15,145 --> 01:18:16,112
I'm fine.

953
01:18:16,513 --> 01:18:19,448
I don't know how this all happened. I just...

954
01:18:19,716 --> 01:18:22,651
You're gonna have to spend
your birthday in jail.

955
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,854
Oh, honey, don't cry. I know I...

956
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:29,320
I brought you some presents.

957
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:40,767
Happy birthday. A popcorn car.

958
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,114
Well, I can give it to you later.

959
01:19:05,028 --> 01:19:06,620
I've been registering all your stories

960
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:09,096
with the Writers' League
since you were seven.

961
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:23,271
In the year 2525

962
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,905
I thought someday
you could show it to your kids.

963
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:30,009
If man is still alive

964
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,715
If woman can survive

965
01:19:33,824 --> 01:19:39,820
They may find

966
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:47,061
"'Aroo? ' questioned Balzaak.

967
01:19:47,938 --> 01:19:52,136
"'Don't give me that, you crazy wolf,'
erupted Brutus.

968
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:56,603
"'You know why I put that in there.
Perhaps they can clone me.

969
01:19:57,214 --> 01:19:59,910
"'And besides,
it's always good to have a spare."'

970
01:20:01,451 --> 01:20:03,851
In the year 4545

971
01:20:03,954 --> 01:20:08,015
Ain't gonna need your teeth,
won't need your eyes

972
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,092
Chevalier.

973
01:20:09,192 --> 01:20:11,820
You won't find a thing to chew

974
01:20:11,928 --> 01:20:15,386
Nobody's gonna look at you

975
01:20:15,499 --> 01:20:19,526
In the year 5555

976
01:20:19,636 --> 01:20:23,504
Your arms are hanging
limp at your sides

977
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:27,008
Your legs got nothing to do

978
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,671
Some machine's doing that for you

979
01:20:31,214 --> 01:20:34,945
In the year 6565

980
01:20:35,052 --> 01:20:38,510
Ain't gonna need no husband,
won't need no wife

981
01:20:38,622 --> 01:20:41,716
You'll pick your son,
pick your daughter, too

982
01:20:42,893 --> 01:20:47,091
From the bottom
of a long glass tube, whoa-oh

983
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:51,099
In the year 6565

984
01:20:51,201 --> 01:20:54,693
Ain't gonna need no husband,
won't need no wife

985
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:58,764
You'll pick your son,
pick your daughter, too

986
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:01,435
From the bottom
of a long glass tube, whoa-oh

987
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:03,137
Land your stag!

988
01:21:45,622 --> 01:21:47,613
Come on, Daysius.

989
01:22:08,912 --> 01:22:11,608
For what he never knew

990
01:22:11,715 --> 01:22:14,479
Now man's reign is through

991
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:17,075
But through the eternal night

992
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:19,951
The twinkling of starlight

993
01:22:20,056 --> 01:22:22,684
So very far away

994
01:22:22,793 --> 01:22:25,921
Maybe it's only yesterday

995
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:31,360
In the year 2525

996
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:34,130
If man is still alive

997
01:22:45,615 --> 01:22:46,582
Yeah.

998
01:22:51,688 --> 01:22:53,121
Oh, my gosh.

999
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:56,691
Benjamin, you are so talented.

1000
01:22:57,961 --> 01:22:59,428
This is amazing.

1001
01:23:00,697 --> 01:23:02,028
So are you, Mom.

1002
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,167
What's this?

1003
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:13,042
I love you.

1004
01:24:43,633 --> 01:24:46,431
Carry on my wayward son

1005
01:24:46,536 --> 01:24:50,597
There'll be peace when you are done

1006
01:24:50,707 --> 01:24:54,575
Lay your weary head to rest

1007
01:24:54,678 --> 01:24:57,772
Don't you cry no more

1008
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,234
Once I rose above
the noise and confusion

1009
01:25:54,337 --> 01:25:58,296
Just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion

1010
01:25:58,408 --> 01:26:02,310
I was soaring ever higher

1011
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:05,472
But I flew too high

1012
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:10,084
Though my eyes could see
I still was a blind man

1013
01:26:10,186 --> 01:26:13,451
Though my mind could think
I still was a madman

1014
01:26:13,556 --> 01:26:17,583
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming

1015
01:26:17,694 --> 01:26:21,221
I can hear them say

1016
01:26:21,331 --> 01:26:25,097
Carry on my wayward son

1017
01:26:25,201 --> 01:26:28,830
There'll be peace when you are done

1018
01:26:28,938 --> 01:26:32,635
Lay your weary head to rest

1019
01:26:32,742 --> 01:26:35,540
Don't you cry no more

1020
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:49,649
Masquerading as a man with a reason

1021
01:26:49,759 --> 01:26:53,286
My charade is the event of the season

1022
01:26:53,396 --> 01:26:56,957
And if I claim to be a wise man

1023
01:26:57,067 --> 01:27:01,003
It surely means that I don't know

1024
01:27:01,104 --> 01:27:04,870
On a stormy sea of moving emotion

1025
01:27:04,974 --> 01:27:08,410
Tossed about,
I'm like a ship on the ocean

1026
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:12,311
I set a course for winds of fortune

1027
01:27:12,415 --> 01:27:15,077
But I hear the voices say

1028
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:19,781
Carry on my wayward son

1029
01:27:19,889 --> 01:27:23,484
There'll be peace when you are done

1030
01:27:23,593 --> 01:27:27,188
Lay your weary head to rest

1031
01:27:27,297 --> 01:27:29,663
- Don't you cry no more
- No!

1032
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,111
(MOANING) Oh, yeah.
