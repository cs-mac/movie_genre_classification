1
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,809
<i>This film was restored by PATHE m 2014</i>

2
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,405
WAITER!

3
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,041
Water.
Andouillette for madam.

4
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,377
And your lamb.
A Gamay!

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
The John Dory?

6
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,807
Schnitzel for the young man.

7
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,016
Michel...

8
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,395
A half-bottle of Pouilly.

9
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,273
Philippe...

10
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
- Table 11.
- Right away.

11
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,613
Bill for tables 5 and 11!

12
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,866
A half of Pouilly.

13
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,618
Roger, still roasting that coffee?

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,547
Goodbye.

15
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,558
Gangway!

16
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,190
2 chickens! Ready?
Take 'em away! Where's Dominique?

17
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,736
One rare steak! Take it!
I have  turbot and kebab waiting!

18
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,948
One buss. One lamb chop!
Let's have them!

19
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,619
Announce your orders!
I'm not part of the decor!

20
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,205
Alex needs two more chickens!

21
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,917
Where's my marrow?
ls that lamb still here?

22
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,629
Gone? Glad to hear it!
Someone take the sausages!

23
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,214
Speak up!

24
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,632
One fillet, one ray!

25
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,635
So soy so!
Roger, your scallops.

26
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,804
- Rare or medium?
- Rare!

27
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,849
So say "rare fillet"!
Alex, take these away!

28
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,144
Whose supremes are these?
Gilbert's! He's not here.

29
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,188
- I'll take them.
- No!

30
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,857
Chop it up.
Garnish it with cress.

31
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,944
Meat on this side.
Watch that, not me.

32
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,571
Veggies for my guinea fowl!

33
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,533
Where's my order got to?

34
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,370
Don't fret, pal! It's on its way!
Made to order.

35
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,914
Finally!
How are you, Mr Gilbert?

36
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,959
- A party of 6...
- Let's hear it.

37
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,336
Say it's best lukewarm.

38
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,006
One ribs, one pork, two supremes,
one chicken and one steak!

39
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,092
6 dishes for 1 table!

40
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,678
- Got it in for me?
- They insisted...

41
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,014
Because they saw
you were a pushover!

42
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,686
Get going!
I need veggies for the guinea fowl!

43
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,313
One guinea fowl...

44
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,608
How's the chicken done?

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,026
Grilled

46
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,947
with a sauce of tomatoes, shallots,
cognac and white wine.

47
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,824
It's a bit spicy.

48
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,618
- Can you hold the sauce?
- It comes separately.

49
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,705
Would you prefer fish?

50
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,708
Maybe... I'm not sure.

51
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,252
We have brill with basil sauce.

52
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,629
It's steamed. Very light.

53
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,922
Where is it?

54
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,091
In the daily specials.

55
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,011
- Bye, Alex.
- Goodbye, Mr Gachet. Sir...

56
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,388
But it's with basil.

57
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,642
Maybe I'll have meat.

58
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,853
Meat...
Grilled or with sauce.

59
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,146
No sauce.

60
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,692
I'm holding you up...

61
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,485
It's all right.
Excuse me.

62
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,155
- Two calvados.
- Right away! Maurice!

63
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,868
The chicken, plain chicken.

64
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,621
One chicken.
The guinea fowl, sir?

65
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,289
- Yes.
- Very good.

66
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,791
Thank you.
l'll send the wine list.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

68
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,964
You make me so happy, Sylvia.
Especially now.

69
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,841
Excuse me.

70
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,594
The wine list.

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,624
- Met Maurice?
- No.

72
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,833
Meet Coline.

73
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,001
Hello.

74
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,712
See you at half past?

75
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,257
She's a bit shy.
You hadn't met?

76
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,969
- No.
- I thought you knew her.

77
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,028
That's fine!

78
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,991
Those who are staying
can work with Dick and Jaia.

79
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,617
How was it?

80
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,536
Dynamite!

81
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,663
Well?

82
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,583
- Did you "dig" it?
- My feet hurt!

83
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,169
Try to memorize the steps.

84
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,504
Can you take over?

85
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm waiting for Coline.

86
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,634
- I'll try to find Bob.
- Good idea.

87
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,141
Simon was a great dancer.
As good us any American.

88
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,517
What about you?

89
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:19,147
I kept up but his legs were
like machine guns!

90
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,274
Our trio became a duo.

91
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,444
The last guy quit
at the London Palladium.

92
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,530
Then it was my turn...

93
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,076
But there's still some life
in the old boy yet!

94
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,786
- I'm off.
- See you later.

95
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,248
I've kept you waiting.

96
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,167
How are you?

97
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,587
Are things that bud?

98
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,592
Alex,
I don't know how to tell you this...

99
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,761
I can't see you anymore.

100
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,971
You can't?

101
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,349
Richard wants me all to himself.

102
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,226
Only natural.

103
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,606
He's fond of me,
so we've decided to live together.

104
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,691
That's good.

105
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,156
I always said he was a nice guy.

106
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,993
He's young...
much smarter than I am...

107
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,079
A go-getter.

108
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,248
A little aggressive maybe...

109
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,625
That's no sin.

110
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,837
That's what I'm saying!
And he's handsome, in a way.

111
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,798
What way?

112
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,383
I'm saying that because...

113
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,552
I'm jealous.

114
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,056
You're not.
You're too old for that.

115
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:51,405
Betting's off
on 3, 7, 8,11,14 and 21.

116
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,325
- Who's with me?
- Me.

117
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,537
- William?
- 100 francs for me. Thanks.

118
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,372
Same for me.

119
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,749
You should thank the horses.

120
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,252
You never bet...

121
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,630
But Mrs Paulin does!

122
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,426
She's got looks... and luck!

123
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,681
Be careful; the horses
slow down when they spot Alex!

124
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,015
Not all of them.

125
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,600
This is stone cold!

126
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,104
50 francs for me.

127
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,775
Your perfume drives me wild!
Smell it?

128
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,402
I sure do!

129
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,611
Stop it...

130
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,405
How about Urbain?

131
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,241
No, Urbain can't afford it.

132
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,994
He makes as much as we do.

133
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,830
Sure, but he has 6 mouths to feed.

134
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:46,043
Dinner's over.
Hurry, we're running late.

135
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,963
We're not fussy but this is cold.

136
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,633
Two of my burners are out.
Any veal stew left?

137
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,262
Here, this should be hot enough
for them.

138
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,638
Thank you.

139
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,524
Cigars, Monique!

140
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,580
Two pork, one rabbit,
one medium steak!

141
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,666
Who forgot their hum and parsley?

142
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,586
Whose scallops?
Take them away!

143
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,631
Yes, Mr Gilbert?
Your daily special?

144
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,382
Here you go!

145
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,843
Bastard!

146
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,762
Change jobs, stupid!

147
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,390
- It was red hot!
- So use your napkin!

148
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,019
You keep bringing food buck!
"Dry", "too salty"...

149
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,772
Now it's my fault you drop it?

150
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,106
Enough, Francis.

151
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,568
Stay out of it!
Whose mushrooms are these?

152
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,153
I'm quitting.

153
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,739
Good riddance!
One less jerk here.

154
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,115
Apologize!

155
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,242
Shut up!

156
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,786
- Shut up yourself!
- This is my turf!

157
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,579
I'm the boss here!

158
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,707
This is no sideshow!
Get moving!

159
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,503
- Whose schnitzels are these?
- Mine.

160
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,171
It's not over?

161
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,422
No, it's not.

162
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,677
Take the chicken away!
We're out of pork and lentils.

163
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,721
What's with Gilbert?

164
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,601
He's quitting. If he goes, I go.
I've got better things to do!

165
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,561
Don't just stand there!

166
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,438
Bill for table 4!

167
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,482
3n coffees for table 5!

168
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,158
Here, boss.

169
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
Thanks.

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,212
Who'll set up tomorrow?
It was Gilbert's turn.

171
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,976
Well then...

172
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:11,063
I hear the revolution's begun!
You're abandoning ship!

173
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,106
A quick word...

174
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,693
Hold on!
I reckon I need to apologize.

175
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,112
- I apologize, Alex.
- Not to me...

176
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,656
OK. To Gilbert, then.

177
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,118
I admit the plate was red hot.
So was l.

178
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,580
I hereby apologize. Publicly. OK?

179
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,126
Drinks are on me!
Maxime, start pouring!

180
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,046
- Champagne for everybody!
- No, wait!

181
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,715
This is on me.
Maxime, Perrier-Jouét!

182
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,718
In that case, make it a '55!

183
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,597
- Shake, Gilbert!
- Bravo, Francis!

184
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,100
Where's the photographer?

185
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,028
I'm no fool:
it's happened to others.

186
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,822
With Charlie, it was
"I don't like queers."

187
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,784
With Rico, it was dagos...

188
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,082
I couldn't refuse
to shake his hand...

189
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,127
But I know I have to leave.

190
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,505
Don't get curried away.

191
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,133
If you lose your job...

192
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,886
what'll your wives and kids do?

193
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,682
When I said I'd quit,
I realized I was skating on thin ice.

194
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,853
What's that?

195
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,230
A map.

196
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,482
A map of what?

197
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,484
Some land.

198
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,487
Your father's land?

199
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,032
And?

200
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,909
Nothing.

201
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,672
Stop the machine!
It's the red button.

202
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,343
Francis has always been like that.

203
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,303
Seven of diamonds.

204
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,392
I need a card
and can't draw it!

205
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,685
I draw 'em all!

206
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,105
I knew Francis
when he was in short punts!

207
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,482
He fought with the cashier.

208
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,112
- Play, Armand.
- He got kicked out right away.

209
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,283
Your turn, Jeannette.

210
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,670
- I don't believe it...
- Oh, what a beauty!

211
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,340
What's she up to now?

212
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,687
Who was that?

213
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,024
She won't answer.

214
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,027
Take these.

215
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,614
- Whose turn?
- Yours, Jeannette.

216
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,868
Drinking won't help.

217
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,995
I don't care!

218
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,831
What did he play?

219
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,959
- Queen of clubs.
- Just what I needed.

220
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,253
I'm gin.

221
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,254
What a woman!

222
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,341
All I needed was a jack!

223
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,927
I've been holding one cord forever!

224
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:28,928
Right!

225
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,679
See you, Armand.

226
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,973
- It's not polite to leave.
- I know.

227
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,892
It's because he's losing.

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,977
Always cut your losses!

229
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,062
Right!

230
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,481
- You leaving, Jeannette?
- No.

231
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,150
He loves your visits.

232
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,028
- Bye, Jeannette dear.
- Bye.

233
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
Alex?

234
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,635
I remember you...

235
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,054
I'm Claire.

236
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,897
We met at my father's wedding,
on the bout.

237
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,400
- In Toulon.
- Orthez...

238
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,985
The violinist!

239
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,529
How is he?

240
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,031
He died three years ago.

241
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,701
How about you?

242
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:34,994
Still tap-dancing?

243
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,497
That's behind me now.

244
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,627
I have to run!
I've got a taxi waiting...

245
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,630
See you again maybe.

246
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,022
This is my favourite.

247
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,607
It's beautiful!

248
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,652
To set the colours,
wash it in cold water...

249
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,739
- With salt and vinegar.
- Hung it on the wall.

250
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,909
- You said I was wrong!
- I did not!

251
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,539
Don't tell him I came.
I'm in a hurry.

252
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't want to hear about it!

253
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,252
Calm down!

254
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,297
I um calm!
I'll fetch some water.

255
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,840
And the other night?

256
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,386
He apologized.
Then he started again.

257
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,472
He can't sleep at night

258
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,891
and he panics if I'm not here.

259
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,393
Off you go.
I won't see you out.

260
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,687
- Thanks.
- Don't give up your job!

261
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,147
Don't worry.

262
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,485
Off you go.

263
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,126
I sent it away.

264
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,670
The taxi...

265
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,549
You're going back to Paris too.
And I've got a car.

266
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,259
Wonderful!

267
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,513
- Where to?
- The 20th district.

268
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,185
I take the Porte de Bagnolet?

269
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,645
I think so.

270
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:29,441
What was I going to say...
How long has it been?

271
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,153
17 years.
I was 17 at the time.

272
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,738
17 years...

273
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,076
Sorry!

274
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,584
How's your wife?

275
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,919
My wife?

276
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,588
All water under the bridge.

277
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,383
She's remarried.
To our divorce lawyer.

278
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,010
It was my fault: I screwed up.

279
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,556
I made her sell her restaurant.
Know why?

280
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,725
To buy a music hall.

281
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,145
I wanted to take up dancing again.

282
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,313
Goodbye, Fred Astaire!

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,734
She wanted a hotel,
so we bought a complex.

284
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,319
Hotel, nightclub, pool: the works.

285
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:19,408
I got in over my head.
The whole thing folded after a year.

286
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,995
She'd had enough of old Alex.

287
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,123
I'm still paying off my share.

288
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,167
And now?

289
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,379
I work in a brasserie.
Head waiter.

290
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,507
For the time being.

291
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,305
Are you going home?

292
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,558
No, an intensive English class.

293
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,311
You're a teacher?

294
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,857
I guess so.
It's only been 2 months.

295
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,236
I've never seen you at Jeannette's.

296
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,614
Jeannette more or less raised me.

297
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,826
I didn't see her much
after my marriage, until last year.

298
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,662
What does your husband do?

299
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,623
No idea.

300
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,793
I left him for another man.

301
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,925
A little less than a year ago.

302
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,428
But that affair's over now too.

303
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,138
Already?

304
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,478
So I guess you're...

305
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,355
ls he crazy?

306
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,484
It's a one-way street.

307
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,572
Sorry! I'll move!

308
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,950
I'll backup.

309
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,959
You're going wrong way,
you moron!

310
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,502
I know, I know.

311
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,796
Can't argue with a doctor.

312
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,515
- Are you late?
- Right on time!

313
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,516
Bye!

314
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,563
Just a second...

315
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,529
They've nearly finished.

316
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,073
Ashtray, table 5.

317
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,742
Mussel soup...

318
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,160
And the herring.

319
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,997
Then the duck confit...

320
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,790
Duck, red mullet and 2 soufflés.

321
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,793
- Orange ones.
- Very good. Enjoy your meal.

322
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,132
- Taste!
- No, thanks.

323
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,092
Be u good boy and taste!

324
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,304
3 coffees, 1 cognac!

325
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,265
2 espressos, 1 decaf.

326
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,813
Look who's sitting at table 14.

327
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:04,448
Our beloved Gloria
with her husband in tow.

328
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,956
In a London pub,

329
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,167
a guy asks the barman

330
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,169
for something tall and cold.

331
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,463
The barman says, "Take my wife!"

332
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,522
Marie-Pierre has invited us
to dinner Thursday night.

333
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,108
What a woman!

334
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,236
Little Paul gushed his chin
the other day.

335
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,531
Ambulance, hospital, 2 stitches...

336
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,660
She only told me today,
so I wouldn't worry.

337
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,119
Seen Gloria?

338
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,414
Pick me up at the Bel Air
at 3:30 sharp.

339
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,708
Make up a story, anything.

340
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,760
- Are you tired?
- No.

341
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,016
I hate seeing you like this...

342
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,936
So overworked.

343
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,356
Listen: work is exhausting
for everyone.

344
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,738
But a man of your intelligence
could somehow...

345
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,618
Victor wasn't always successful.

346
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,413
But he rose to the challenge.

347
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,167
If I could get you a position
in his firm,

348
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:44,464
you'd earn more, have greater
responsibilities... and more freedom.

349
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,093
Ready-to-wear isn't bud.

350
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,388
Maybe, but I'm not interested!

351
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,473
Do you understand?

352
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,938
I'm so tactless.
Sorry I made you angry.

353
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,314
Forget it.

354
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,281
I'm thinking of myself, us well.

355
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,199
I see you so rarely.

356
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,118
I thought...

357
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,955
if you had a job
that allowed you to travel...

358
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,790
I could come along.

359
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,626
We could sleep together
without hiding.

360
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,589
I have nothing against ready-to-wear
but leave me be.

361
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,507
Don't come to the brasserie...

362
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,469
Victor insisted!
He loves eating there!

363
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,511
What could I say?

364
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,638
Nothing.

365
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,526
You shouldn't.

366
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,155
Button-downs.
I noticed you didn't have any.

367
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,531
Any what?

368
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,410
Button-down collars.
We make them.

369
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,500
- Sorry, but...
- What?

370
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,876
We have to go!

371
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,960
Where?

372
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,713
You know where.
Hello.

373
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,424
It completely slipped my mind!

374
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,718
Will I see you Saturday?

375
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,304
Alex!

376
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,808
Thank you.

377
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,023
- I was tongue-tied.
- I noticed!

378
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,654
Maurice Palazzi.

379
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,072
That's me.

380
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,076
That cubicle.

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,210
German police!

382
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,503
All right!

383
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,005
I'm coming.

384
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,925
How's your blood pressure?

385
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,426
180 over 110.

386
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,719
Pretty high!

387
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,180
Watch those carbs!

388
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,433
Want to know my count?

389
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,018
Sure. What is it?

390
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,020
140 over 90.

391
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,983
The engine's in perfect running order.

392
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,236
So I asked about the old ticker.

393
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,779
A jewel!

394
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,282
- See you later, Urbain.
- See you.

395
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,744
Hi, pal.
Hi, Gilbert.

396
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,042
Don't let them take too much blood!
It's illegal.

397
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,879
They take blood now?

398
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,592
Coming to the bank?

399
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,512
Today's my lust installment.
I've paid it all off.

400
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,514
I'm free!

401
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,642
Congratulations. But I can't...

402
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,646
Bariollet's opening a new restaurant.
A classy place.

403
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,148
I'm going to apply.

404
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,193
The problem will be
the two days off.

405
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,070
Should I bring it up right away?

406
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,615
You're not listening!

407
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,700
- I um.
- No you're not!

408
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,306
I got the idea when I dropped you off
the other day.

409
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,892
In this world, it's the survival
of the fittest.

410
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,644
In every line of work,

411
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,397
the polyglot beats the bilingual,

412
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,025
who beats... the monoglot?

413
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,820
- Who knows?
- Anyway, that's how I got the idea.

414
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,906
It's tiring, the first lesson.

415
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,908
You should've called me.

416
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,702
How could I?

417
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,955
Jeannette and Armand
have gone away.

418
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,208
They're in Menton at her sister's.

419
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,546
- My car's over here.
- I already have a ride.

420
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,674
- Goodbye.
- OK, goodbye.

421
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,486
Sorry!
I wasn't paying attention!

422
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,966
There you go.

423
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,176
Got your braces?

424
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,636
Fetch them!

425
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,139
- Braces?
- For his teeth.

426
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,515
That's Marianne.

427
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,308
They want a story.

428
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,726
It won't be long.

429
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,728
Let them in.

430
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,814
Hurry it up.

431
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,113
Everybody tucked in?

432
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,781
Yes!

433
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,537
Once upon a time
there was u beautiful princess

434
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,332
with two lovely eyes...
Especially the left one.

435
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,879
Such style!
He does that so naturally!

436
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,797
I've had enough, thanks.

437
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,300
There must be days...

438
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,970
I couldn't do it.

439
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,389
It's hard on the legs,
always standing.

440
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,057
Standing but bowing.

441
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,726
What do you mean?

442
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,644
Bowing to serve others.

443
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,980
- Flunkeys!
- I didn't say that!

444
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,065
But it's what you meant.

445
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,775
Cigarette ash...

446
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,320
What's it called in your job?

447
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,448
When your boss calls you
into his office

448
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,076
and says, "Bring me
that motorway feeder file,"

449
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,536
it's, "Right away, sir!"

450
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,873
If you bring him the wrong file,

451
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,791
it's back to the kitchen.

452
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,088
Gilbert...

453
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,382
Marie-Pierre picked it.

454
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,177
I feel its bouquet
"throughout the body".

455
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,305
He's learning English.

456
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,516
It may come in handy.

457
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,518
Sounds fishy to me.

458
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,438
The warm tart...
It's the oven again.

459
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,649
Repaired just yesterday...

460
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,734
- Flip the switch!
- Where is it?

461
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,028
Take the tart out of the oven.

462
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,031
There's a warm tart?

463
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,123
Gilbert couldn't find the fuse box!

464
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,167
He doesn't live here.

465
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,169
He doesn't?

466
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,838
If Suzanne found out
we had 2 kids

467
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,551
and were living together,
imagine the scandal!

468
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,720
Think of poor Suzanne.
What would she say?

469
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,473
- Sorry!
- Thanks a lot.

470
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,601
Keep it.

471
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,063
For seven years now,

472
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,858
he keeps on fretting;
has Suzanne committed suicide?

473
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,736
He left her
when I had my second baby

474
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,240
but he stays at Alex's
to be on the safe side.

475
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,200
He has it easy.

476
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,203
It's his home away from home.

477
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,455
This is delicious.

478
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,625
Maybe when we're grandparents,

479
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,086
he'll tell her about us.

480
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,879
That's enough!

481
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,172
All right.

482
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,177
She's right, you know.
You only see your side of it.

483
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,721
In her shoes,

484
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,389
how would you feel?

485
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:41,311
Think of the children.
Do you have kids?

486
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,395
Yes.

487
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,447
I really shut that guy up.
What's his name again?

488
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,073
Jean-Jacques.

489
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,994
You shut everybody up!

490
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,955
What's wrong?

491
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,791
Let me ask you something.

492
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,669
When I left my wife
and you invited me to stay...

493
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,715
For 2 weeks! Not forever!

494
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,636
You just hate living alone.
It wasn't for my charm!

495
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,891
You didn't think of Marie-Pierre
or the kids at the time.

496
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,727
You know why?

497
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,438
You don't give a damn about people.

498
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,816
Marie-Pierre, Suzanne, Gloria,
me, the Pope...

499
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,069
You couldn't care less!

500
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,741
You just put on an act.

501
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,786
You show off.
The rest doesn't mutter.

502
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,500
You've got a son you never see,
yet you criticize me!

503
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,959
You're too much!

504
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:51,631
Hold on a second! My son's been
in Canada for nearly 20 years!

505
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,383
I don't even know him!

506
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,176
That suits you fine!

507
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,348
- How can you say that?
- I believe it!

508
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,351
If I said my mother had died...

509
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,062
you'd say: "Oh, really?"

510
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,065
When I told you about Poul,
you didn't listen!

511
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,901
You don't cure about my new job!

512
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,779
Yet I asked for your opinion
three times!

513
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,324
You don't care about
anybody or anything!

514
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,946
You're still angry?

515
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,300
It's partly true, isn't it?

516
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,887
Some of it.
But I'm not that bad.

517
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,809
Don't bow too low as you come in!

518
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,067
Hello! How are you?

519
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,238
I followed you because you weren't
at class on Tuesday.

520
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,658
I saw you as I arrived today...

521
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,370
But you were leaving!
So, right away,

522
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,415
I did a U-turn and almost had
an accident. I tried to follow

523
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,125
but those buses go fast!

524
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,753
I'm in a new classroom now.

525
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,713
That explains it.

526
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,299
How are you?

527
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,051
I'm fine.

528
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,762
Since you didn't answer my letter...

529
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,222
What letter?

530
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,558
You didn't get it?

531
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,309
No.

532
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,521
You wrote to me?

533
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,772
Yes.

534
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,316
Well...

535
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,653
What did you say?

536
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,782
It's hard to explain here...

537
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:10,079
I said that I'd like to see you...

538
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,542
more often than every 17 years.

539
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,670
Because I'm really...

540
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,631
attracted to you.

541
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,260
It's easier to write about
than to say...

542
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,971
Mind if I walk with you?

543
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,058
Not at all. I have to pick up
some things at home.

544
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,270
My former home, that is.

545
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,025
I'm divorcing. It's my fault.

546
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,985
He said he'd be out.

547
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,323
The other day at the school,
someone picked you up.

548
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,326
That was him. He came to say
he'd be away 3 days

549
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,579
and that I was wicked.
I already knew that.

550
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,466
You're here?

551
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,928
Yeah,
I didn't go away after all.

552
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,600
This is my friend Alex.
Alex, this is Francois.

553
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,936
Her husband.

554
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,732
I'll only be a minute...

555
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,541
The Reynolds are back from the USA.
They've invited us to dinner.

556
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,172
I guess they haven't heard.

557
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,593
- What shall I say?
- Whatever you like.

558
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,772
- Taking those, too?
- What?

559
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,607
My dad's books.

560
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,027
He gave them to me.

561
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,535
Can you lend me a hand, Alex?

562
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,261
Goodbye.

563
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,556
Bye.

564
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,644
Give me that!

565
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,688
Give it back!

566
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,899
Stop it!
If you wont the books, take them!

567
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,952
He makes prefab homes?
I saw the plans.

568
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,038
Yes, for the time being.

569
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:03,252
He's in good shape.
That's quite a right hook he has...

570
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,630
I tried a classic party but...

571
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,508
What's a classic party?

572
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,011
You don't know?

573
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:17,308
You dodge and turn...
But it's tough with a suitcase.

574
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,728
He got me.

575
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,856
Not hard, but it hurts.

576
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,691
You're bleeding.

577
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,235
Here.

578
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,076
- This is...
- To stop the bleeding.

579
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,038
Leave it on 5 minutes.

580
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,587
- When do you start work?
- Now!

581
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,674
Fancy a drink?

582
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,676
No, thank you.

583
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,473
<i>Upper Volta
Wells in the desert</i>

584
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,100
Is this him?

585
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,851
Who?

586
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,521
The divorce by your fault...

587
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,190
ls he your fault?

588
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,527
I don't mean to pry.

589
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,321
Yes, he's the one.
I feel like a drink.

590
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,328
Where is that?

591
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,580
In Upper Volta.

592
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,582
Yes, it says so.

593
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,043
An important guy...

594
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,087
I read the article.

595
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,840
They go over there...

596
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,927
to improve the land.

597
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,806
I wish I could too...

598
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,816
Not that I'd be able to...

599
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,155
That's Margot. This is her place.

600
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,823
You've met her.

601
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,161
The English teacher. Hello.

602
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,371
I picked up the laundry.

603
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,540
Did you bring the car back?

604
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,126
No. The cops had clamped it.

605
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,003
I don't believe it!

606
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,548
I'm late. You know
you're on the list for England?

607
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,716
Yes, I know.

608
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:14,758
Did Jean call?

609
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,429
What a bastard!

610
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,557
I have to run.

611
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,683
Your coat?

612
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,437
No coat.
What's the list for England?

613
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,356
We rotate:
2 days there, 3 days here.

614
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,112
You never wrote me that letter.

615
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,204
I tried
but it was difficult.

616
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,522
Shall I cull you or...

617
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,233
l'll call you.

618
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,420
The sausage was for table 8!

619
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,136
I got it all wrong!

620
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:45,432
You wanteda salad!
I'll be right back.

621
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,437
The sausage for the lady.
Enjoy your meal.

622
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,690
Don't forget my Saumur!

623
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,400
- Telephone.
- Right away.

624
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,568
The salad for table 1!

625
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,992
Claire...

626
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,994
No, not at all!

627
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,789
I finish in about 2 hours.

628
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,348
Are the coffees ready?

629
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,767
- Alex!
- Coming.

630
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,769
Where's my Saumur?

631
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,980
It's right here!

632
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,189
What's Francis doing?

633
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,693
He's resting while Coco takes over.

634
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,195
I'm training Coco as night chef.

635
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,656
He's temperamental but he's the best.

636
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,242
Bravo! Keep it up!

637
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,330
It's your fault, Mr. Mazet!

638
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,708
I know. Maxime, that's 8 coffees!

639
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,501
I need a clean shirt.

640
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,087
There's one in my locker...

641
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,435
I know it's not your neck size.

642
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,647
I'll wear it open.
The problem's the sleeves.

643
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,399
Use rubber bands.

644
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,282
How's it going with Marie-Pierre?

645
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,617
What about her?

646
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,036
Since the other day,

647
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:33,123
I'm afraid you'll bite my head off
if I mention her!

648
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,419
We're heading for the rocks.
But don't worry.

649
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,172
But I do worry.

650
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,674
Damn! No rubber bands!

651
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,635
I've got some.

652
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,975
Why not sleep at her place?

653
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,977
When?

654
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,272
One night... Tonight, say!

655
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,941
Tonight?

656
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,029
I didn't let her know.

657
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,992
That's just it. If you go tonight,
you'll surprise her.

658
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,496
If she's surprised, she'll worry.

659
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,291
If she's worried,
she'll feel reassured.

660
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,018
- What are you looking for?
- Women.

661
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,439
Do many come here?

662
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,941
Here? No, never!

663
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,655
Am I the first?

664
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,990
Yes.

665
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,087
My father!

666
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,756
Yes, at the wedding.

667
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,050
What were you doing there?

668
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,303
My job: entertaining.

669
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,973
Here's Jeannette, in slacks.
And Armand...

670
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,642
And the guy you had a fight with.

671
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,769
I had a fight?

672
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,647
Gilbert.

673
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,612
How's Monsieur Gilbert today?

674
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,238
It's pouring outside.

675
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,533
We just had a big fight.

676
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,037
On account of her sister.

677
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,706
Not the one you know.
The bossy one.

678
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,294
At first, Marie-Pierre was delighted.

679
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,131
But I forgot; no school today,

680
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,259
so the kids were in our bed.
What a madhouse!

681
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,684
You didn't give me time.

682
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,144
Hello!

683
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,189
Come and say hello.

684
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,697
Gilbert.

685
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,866
So this is Gilbert.

686
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,326
Claire.

687
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,914
Sit down.

688
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,544
I can't.
I've got to make a phone call.

689
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,588
Is it ruining?

690
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,344
Take my coffee.
I'll make some more.

691
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,806
I see you're using the...

692
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,309
Yes. I shouldn't have?

693
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,103
Sure, it's all right.

694
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,314
- The what?
- Never mind.

695
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,899
I want to know!

696
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,317
These cups are...

697
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,736
They're a gift from his mother.

698
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,573
We never use them.
It's the first time...

699
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,659
You should hurry up
and make your call.

700
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,077
Excuse me.

701
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,832
You left your light on.

702
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,750
- I didn't.
- You did.

703
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,502
Finish my coffee now.

704
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,302
How big is this plot? An acre?

705
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:18,015
A little over an acre.
I checked the land register.

706
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:22,686
Your land starts at the fence
and goes to those trees.

707
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,357
My neighbour's built on his land.

708
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,736
He's in a different zoning district.

709
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,951
You should've sold it long ago.

710
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,539
You can't build,
so why hold onto a patch of sand?

711
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,042
I know. But no thanks.

712
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,753
Going back to Paris?

713
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,633
Shall I tell them you'll rent it?

714
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,969
No thanks, Mr Gallois.

715
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,556
Can't I say you're not sure?

716
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,643
If you want. It's just us easy.

717
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,896
It was more like a fun park.

718
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,857
- My brother run it.
- Where is he now?

719
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:13,111
No idea. I'll give you
Sangali's address. He's the expert.

720
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,198
He's got the equipment
and the know-how.

721
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:20,035
Maurice, bring me my address book.

722
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,622
Never mind! I've got it.
Got u pen?

723
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,291
Sangali's a big shot now.

724
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,960
He's with Vassard in Brussels.

725
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,546
Telephone: 288-80-09.

726
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,549
Over here, the wobble bridge.

727
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:39,012
Impossible to stand up!
It's hilarious!

728
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,139
There, the magic house.

729
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:45,852
In between, the swings
and next to them...

730
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,771
the trampoline.

731
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,065
Next, a slide and super-slide.

732
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,819
And by the road,
rental of tandems, tridems

733
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,488
and even a bike for five.

734
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,535
A bicycle with square wheels
for solos!

735
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,079
You said they were oval.

736
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:08,333
I did? Well, oval or "crazy wheels".

737
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,002
And you end up at the magic house.

738
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,796
There's Sangali.

739
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,635
- Are you Alex?
- That's me!

740
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,471
Weren't you in Brussels?

741
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,891
No, I was in the area.
Did you get the catalogue?

742
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,686
- Well?
- This is the plot. It's small...

743
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,313
But that fence can be pushed buck.

744
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,150
My neighbour miscalculated.

745
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,319
It's my land up to those trees.

746
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,844
It's a long story.

747
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,598
The first 2 years,
he wouldn't tell his wife.

748
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:08,977
It drove me mud.
So I took another lover on the side.

749
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,355
I was happy.
It made me feel special.

750
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,441
That went on for a year.

751
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,818
Did Gilbert know?

752
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,487
Yes, he knew.

753
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,908
What got me was when I broke oft
with the other guy...

754
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,327
I was pregnant.

755
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,996
Do you have kids?

756
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,539
No.

757
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,458
Why not?

758
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,170
Maybe no one cured enough.

759
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,839
Anyhow, I told Gilbert,

760
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,926
"I'm sure it's yours.
I know it is."

761
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,806
He was wonderful.
He never doubted me.

762
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,391
He asked no questions and yet...

763
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,146
You're nuts,
taking your socks off in winter.

764
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,192
Know what winter is?
You don't know, do you?

765
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,157
Paul!
I don't believe it...

766
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,409
Crazy kid!

767
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,998
You're gonna get it!

768
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,126
What are you doing, Gilbert?

769
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,753
I'm fishing!

770
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,713
I'll give you what for!

771
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:26,221
We open July 1
and close August 31: 2 months.

772
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,098
Before and after, zilch!

773
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,769
We need a permit to stay open
after 10 pm for adults.

774
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:38,108
The bar's the real money-maker.
Sandwiches, hotdogs, etc.

775
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,736
The problem is the neighbour
because of the noise.

776
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:46,366
But since he's encroaching on
my land, there's a solution.

777
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,617
We'll trade:

778
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,329
I get my permit and he keeps
his rhododendrons.

779
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,666
- What does he want?
- Your sandwich.

780
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,877
Don't provoke him!

781
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,503
I'm not provoking him.

782
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,256
Stray dogs can be dangerous.

783
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,508
Surely we can talk?

784
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,511
When do you open?

785
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:10,348
I don't know.
Not this summer but the next.

786
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,851
Why not this summer?

787
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,311
It's 3 months away.

788
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,022
The construction work takes time.

789
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,398
I'll need help.

790
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,733
You can't get that?

791
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,276
I don't know...

792
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,196
I can't think with this dog.
Can't someone call him off?

793
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,032
Here kitty, kitty...

794
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,869
Come on.

795
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,747
Nice kitty... Come here.

796
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,805
- How's things?
- Hi, Francis.

797
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,059
I saw Armand.
Why don't you visit him?

798
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,353
He knocks it back,
with his diabetes...

799
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,021
I know.

800
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:04,653
- Your call, Alex!
- Thanks. Michel! Finish up.

801
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,613
Maxime, an espresso!

802
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,906
Another?

803
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,702
Hello, Sangali? Alex.

804
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,246
I'm calling to tell you...

805
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,998
We're all set to go!

806
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,833
We open this summer.

807
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,252
In July.

808
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,007
You can't mean that!

809
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,385
Why not?

810
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,681
It's up to you.
I'm ready right now!

811
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:39,104
About that first installment...
How much?

812
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,901
Is that negotiable?

813
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,280
Good. Call me back soon.

814
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,784
That's fine. Goodbye.

815
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,724
What a surprise!

816
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,314
How are you?

817
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,365
And Richard?

818
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,617
It's over.

819
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,872
Was it you or him?

820
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,207
Him.

821
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,252
How about that...

822
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,047
He must be nuts!

823
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,052
I'm broke. I need to find a job.

824
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,262
So I'm looking around.

825
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,683
I heard Monique was about
to quit the checkroom.

826
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,144
So I got my hopes up...

827
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,645
She changed her mind.

828
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,524
Her modeling career fizzled out.

829
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,778
What about Clovis?

830
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,156
He won't be back till Wednesday.

831
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,243
Coming!

832
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,540
I've got to run.

833
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,875
So long...

834
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,632
See you soon.

835
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:44,979
There's a hitch.
I just spoke to Sangali.

836
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,774
We can get the equipment.

837
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:52,070
We'll use the demo models
from a trade show.

838
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,447
The trouble is...

839
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,617
they want money.

840
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,663
A lot of it...

841
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,834
- An oil bottle's broken.
- Tell Denis.

842
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,169
Aren't you eating?

843
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,671
I am...

844
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:23,935
I can accept the fact
that you dumped me.

845
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,063
But why didn't you tell me?

846
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,774
It's not that hard.

847
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,859
It is.

848
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,322
I should have figured it out.

849
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:40,660
You never came by, didn't answer
my letters or phone calls.

850
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,455
And when I called Maxime,
he said you were at the sea.

851
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,040
But I was!

852
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,839
Anyway, I'm grateful to you
for coming by.

853
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,053
- Don't you want your beer?
- Sure.

854
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,019
You have another woman?

855
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,645
Yes.

856
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,732
Younger than me?

857
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,693
That's not the reason.

858
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,863
- Do I know her?
- Let's not discuss her!

859
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,324
Why not,
since we can't talk about us?

860
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,954
And I was about to get a divorce...

861
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:30,210
A divorce?
Did I hear you right?

862
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,003
Divorce Victor?

863
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,298
Did you tell him?

864
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,425
Not yet.

865
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:45,266
You were always praising
his devotion, his kindness...

866
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:49,103
Victor, compared to...
even to me...

867
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:53,149
And you're going to destroy him
after 25 years?

868
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:57,153
I can't believe
what I'm hearing, Gloria.

869
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,197
I must be mistaken.

870
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:00,782
How do you mean?

871
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,078
This can't be you.
Not my Gloria.

872
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,331
That's not the Gloria I knew...
It can't be.

873
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,628
I'm sorry.

874
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,965
Right now, I've got problems.

875
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,551
Well, everybody's got problems!

876
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,221
I can't sleep.

877
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,392
So I'm tense, I'm jittery.

878
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,728
You've got problems?

879
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:31,938
Yes.

880
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,109
Not vital problems,
just money problems.

881
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,154
But they really get you down.

882
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,492
I'll be going.

883
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,829
No, tell me.

884
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,627
Do you know about my fun pork?

885
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,462
No.

886
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,922
That's why

887
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,008
I was out of town.

888
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:04,220
I have to find 100,000 francs
or else.

889
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,432
I know, it's u tidy sum...

890
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,143
I can lend you that much.

891
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,479
What? You?

892
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,317
- Why you?
- I can afford it.

893
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,779
Think about it.
Just when we're splitting up...

894
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,033
Never mind, I want to.

895
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,494
Be quiet.

896
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,039
I'll sign for it.

897
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,542
- No need to.
- I insist.

898
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:38,421
I, the undersigned...
I'll pay interest.

899
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,632
Or else I refuse. I mean it!

900
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,684
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

901
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,812
- Your bug?
- It's behind you.

902
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,317
- When's the plane?
- AT 6:30.

903
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,783
- Are you OK?
- Great!

904
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,077
My banker lent me the money.

905
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,119
- How much?
- Ten!

906
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,748
- With surety?
- No surety. After you...

907
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,416
What a businessman!

908
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,959
A barracuda!

909
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,215
Mind you,
these little London trips...

910
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,926
2 days here, 3 days there...

911
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:27,428
Sometimes, I wonder.

912
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,472
You wonder what?

913
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,184
If you're meeting him there.

914
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,645
He's not always in Upper Volta.

915
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,399
I could meet him here too.

916
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:41,317
That's true.

917
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,279
Him or someone else.
As they say...

918
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,199
If it's not him, it's his brother.

919
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,285
But that's a vicious circle.

920
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,252
What a joke!

921
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,256
But I don't feel like laughing.
Our life here is absurd.

922
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,715
- Are you cold?
- No.

923
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,925
Yes, you are!

924
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,718
I'm not!

925
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,138
I need some air.

926
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,391
I stifle when she's not home.
She never is.

927
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,934
Poor Jeannette!

928
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:19,188
Poor thing!
She rushes to work before I wake!

929
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,400
She dashes buck at noon.
We bolt down our lunch!

930
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,404
When she visits those flats,
she forgets I'm alive!

931
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,824
Though I don't mind her
helping out a friend.

932
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,911
Afternoons, she's busy
with Pierre, Poul and whoever.

933
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,330
It's as if I had no wife!

934
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,707
You've got me.

935
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,792
What an idiot...

936
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:44,172
Wait.
She said she'd see you at noon.

937
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,424
It is noon. Raymond.

938
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,758
So long.

939
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,052
I won't see you out.

940
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,638
- You don't deserve it.
- Bye, Gilbert.

941
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,058
Gilbert, I rely on you

942
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,437
to make him come here.
He's a lousy friend!

943
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,938
I promise.

944
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,863
Nice place!

945
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,075
Two small rooms,
with a communicating door...

946
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,912
I've got the key somewhere.

947
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,080
Looks nice.

948
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,625
It's up to Marie-Pierre.

949
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,878
I didn't tell you.
My divorce is set.

950
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:28,132
Suzanne's a new woman.
She's being cooperative.

951
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,134
- I didn't know.
- Now you do!

952
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,053
Here we are.

953
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,805
I can show you 2 more places...

954
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:38,768
Without me. I have to be
in Brussels by 3 pm.

955
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,563
One in this building
and a smaller one next door.

956
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,274
Personally, I prefer it.

957
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,759
And this is the monkey barrel.

958
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,344
You'll see.

959
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,989
No! 45% isn't 50%...

960
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,157
It's second-hand stuff.

961
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,078
At 50%, our margin is really small.

962
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,373
What do you say, Mme Pierreux?

963
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,626
To be honest, we never deal that way.

964
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:50,298
I've got to run now.
Frank will pay.

965
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:55,928
We'll go for 50%,
but in two payments instead of three.

966
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,722
And cash, us agreed.

967
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,057
You can have the cash right now...

968
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:03,686
I wont to go home
with a signed contract.

969
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:04,812
That's fine

970
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,732
but all the papers are at my place.

971
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,026
Will you excuse me?

972
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,569
Certainly.
Goodbye, Jacques.

973
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,237
Goodbye, Madame Pierreux.

974
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:25,166
Are you related to the Pierreux
of the Pacra Concerts?

975
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:37,011
You have nice hands.

976
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,389
A drink?

977
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,934
Let's have one at my place.

978
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,686
Fine.

979
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,065
Do you live alone?

980
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,942
For now, I do.
In fact, I'm scared.

981
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,195
Of what? Of wolves?

982
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,781
Some wolves!

983
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,909
It depends which ones.

984
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,484
Calm down, guys!

985
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,860
That's enough.

986
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,991
I didn't go home last night.

987
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,120
The cur broke down.
It's the clutch.

988
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,997
I gave them notice.
I quit tonight.

989
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:48,916
Already?

990
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,128
I'm going to Bariollet's.
Starting tomorrow.

991
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,018
Don't read over my shoulder.
I can't concentrate.

992
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,980
Don't forget...
The mayor and town council!

993
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:15,609
The "Bordelaise"...

994
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:17,027
For the gentleman.

995
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,363
- André!
- Sorry.

996
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,699
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

997
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,041
"Awaiting your approval

998
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:35,421
"and the agreement
of the town council for my permit..."

999
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,839
ls that ok?

1000
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:40,009
- Fine.
- Wait, I'm not finished.

1001
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,803
What's this I hear?
Gilbert is leaving?

1002
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,513
Tonight?

1003
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:45,598
I don't get it.

1004
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,852
Bariollet's offering me a job
as maitre d'.

1005
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,940
- A toast?
- Not now...

1006
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,692
Tonight, before dinner.

1007
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,695
Do you mind chatting someplace else?

1008
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,531
Bariollet has women chefs.

1009
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,617
You'll miss your pal Francis.

1010
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,120
I yell but I don't shriek!

1011
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,906
Hello.

1012
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,158
Hello.

1013
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,077
There was a strike.

1014
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,496
A plane strike?

1015
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,373
No, I flew back.

1016
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:56,710
At the school.

1017
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,305
- You're on holiday then?
- Yes.

1018
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,559
How did it go?

1019
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:15,771
Just great!
I'll spare you the boring details

1020
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,816
but I'm all set to go.
Aren't you cold?

1021
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,027
You got back late?

1022
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,241
I called at midnight.
No answer.

1023
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:34,456
Same thing at 2 am and 3 um.

1024
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,667
I was at Sangali's.

1025
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,587
We dined there - the whole family...

1026
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:43,090
father, mother, kids...
an endless dinner...

1027
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,301
Coffee, liqueurs...

1028
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,220
It was so late, I slept there.

1029
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:51,307
I left early this morning.

1030
01:11:55,644 --> 01:12:00,941
I should've called you.
It was thoughtless of me.

1031
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,451
Were you worried?
What could have happened to me?

1032
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,370
Another woman.

1033
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,920
She left you a message.

1034
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,343
I don't understand.
That's impossible.

1035
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:33,599
<i>Claire, it's Margot.
Call me when you get back.</i>

1036
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,393
<i>Hello, Claire. Ronnie Sharp.</i>

1037
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,106
<i>Thursday's meeting
is pushed back to 8:30 pm.</i>

1038
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,987
<i>Alex, it's me.</i>

1039
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,197
It's Gloria!

1040
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,990
<i>Just to tell you...</i>

1041
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,952
<i>I told Victor everything.
Even the cheque.</i>

1042
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,829
<i>I feel better and so does he.</i>

1043
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,581
<i>We're inking u trip.</i>

1044
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,043
<i>I won't write.
Take care.</i>

1045
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,295
It was Gloria.

1046
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:10,219
She's a friend.
A woman friend. Before you...

1047
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,263
When you live alone,
you flutter around.

1048
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,807
Do you miss that?

1049
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,561
What's she like?

1050
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:24,942
A brunette...
She used to be very beautiful.

1051
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,111
She's been married 25 years.

1052
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,406
Very dynamic.
What else can I say?

1053
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:31,740
You still see her?

1054
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,368
I saw her recently.

1055
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:38,122
She lent me that money.
She was the banker.

1056
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,166
But I hadn't called her since.

1057
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,712
Not since you.

1058
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:50,426
She asked me to explain
and I explained.

1059
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:53,178
What?

1060
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:57,850
That I was in love.

1061
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:16,910
What's wrong?

1062
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:21,582
Nothing.
I feel tired all of a sudden.

1063
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,926
To our friend, the maitre d' to be!

1064
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,736
As the actress said to the bishop,

1065
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:54,031
"It depends where you put it!"

1066
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,912
You'll be married this year,
Gilbert!

1067
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,793
It's Jeannette.

1068
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,676
Hello, Jeannette?

1069
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:34,863
We're all eating with Jeannette.

1070
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,038
How did it happen?

1071
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,207
He was alone when he died.

1072
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,001
He had an attack.
He needed medicine,

1073
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,879
so Jeannette run out to get some.

1074
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,090
By the time she got buck...

1075
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,355
No, back up.

1076
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,149
No, he has to pull instead.

1077
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,277
There's no talking to him.

1078
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,903
Come on!

1079
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,488
Is that ok?

1080
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,324
Down there, Maurice!

1081
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,785
Walk straight, Martel.

1082
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,192
I thought...

1083
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:58,113
We got here last night.
Seen all this?

1084
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,658
By tonight, the slides will be up.

1085
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,620
You're back from London?

1086
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,748
I never left.

1087
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:15,672
Is he back?

1088
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:32,022
He called several times.
I didn't want to see him again.

1089
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,944
This time, I called him.

1090
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:39,780
I lied to you.

1091
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,868
You didn't,
since you're telling me.

1092
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,586
You're leaving with him?

1093
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:56,255
Yes.

1094
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:03,929
I knew it would happen one day but...

1095
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,059
I'm not stupid, you know.

1096
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,855
I've always been aware
of the difference between us.

1097
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,233
I'm nothing.

1098
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,612
You mustn't say that, Alex.
I never thought that.

1099
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:23,115
You're you!

1100
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:28,662
You didn't take me.
I wanted you and I took you.

1101
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,540
Because of what you are,
who you are.

1102
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,584
It's not your fault.

1103
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,961
It's him.

1104
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:39,840
He's back from Upper Volta.

1105
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,550
How did you know?

1106
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,803
I took the trouble to find out.

1107
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:48,932
I thought: even if we go
to the end of the world,

1108
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:53,020
he'll be there
digging those wells.

1109
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,107
I'm going to make a phone cull.

1110
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,443
Is that his wife?

1111
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:00,444
No idea.

1112
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:04,239
Remember to ship
the crane tomorrow!

1113
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,503
Are you going to work
with him over there?

1114
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,589
I don't know.

1115
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,429
I don't want to talk about it now.

1116
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:29,723
I'll see.

1117
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:39,274
- Where's Alex?
- Over there.

1118
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,943
We'll do it without him then.

1119
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,370
Did you take your things yet?

1120
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,663
I'll pick them up tonight.

1121
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,293
Maybe l'll make u play for Margot.

1122
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:01,004
I don't recommend it.

1123
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,799
Can you lunch with us?

1124
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,092
Sure.

1125
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,053
Careful: 1, 2, 3!

1126
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,140
We can't find the bolts!

1127
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,392
What's up?

1128
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,185
We can't find the swing bolts.

1129
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,812
- What bolts?
- For the axles.

1130
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,189
Just ask Sangali.
Where is he?

1131
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,565
He's gone.

1132
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,359
- Where?
- To find a phone.

1133
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,486
- To call who?
- I don't know.

1134
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,862
Here are the bolts!

1135
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:31,118
Use your eyeglasses.
What about the swings?

1136
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,285
We'll finish them.

1137
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:35,163
When will you be finished?

1138
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:40,043
Just remember, I paid cash!

1139
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,134
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

1140
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,677
Enjoy it!

1141
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:49,613
Did you hear the racing results?

1142
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:51,740
- No.
- Can you read?

1143
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:58,330
In the right order.
Patience triumphs over confusion.

1144
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:01,666
I'd like to invite you
to dine on my winnings.

1145
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,543
Monday, at Lasserre.

1146
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:10,091
Just us two, Francis,
Gilbert, Urbain and Maurice.

1147
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:21,770
About 675 square feet.
2 rooms and a bathroom.

1148
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,189
I need about half that.

1149
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,026
Yes, for instance.

1150
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,404
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1151
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:43,333
I came for my lamp and the table.

1152
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,421
- You told me to stop by.
- Come in.

1153
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:54,219
See? It's all there.

1154
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,972
You've lost weight.

1155
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:58,473
Think so?

1156
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:00,392
Are you ok?

1157
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,935
Yes.

1158
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,985
Don't you miss me?

1159
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,028
A little.

1160
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,448
Are you settled in?

1161
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:16,866
Hello? I'm sorry.

1162
01:23:18,868 --> 01:23:21,538
Come by anytime.
The janitor has the key.

1163
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:53,903
Were you passing by?

1164
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,239
Yes.

1165
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,827
Why didn't you come up?
I'm on my own now.

1166
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:02,787
I know.

1167
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,835
You're in a bad way?

1168
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,675
I'm broke, I'm out of work,

1169
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:19,179
I'm pregnant and I'm alone.
I'm just fine!

1170
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,809
I've been drinking.
I don't know where to go.

1171
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:28,188
What do you mean?
What about my place?

1172
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:31,232
Take Gilbert's room.
You'll keep me company.

1173
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:34,319
But I'm moving in September.

1174
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:39,574
When's the baby due?

1175
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,368
In three months.

1176
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:43,995
I'll have to evict you both then!

1177
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,331
I'll be merciless!

1178
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,669
Here. In the meantime...

1179
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,047
Let me in.
I don't have a spare.

1180
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,755
Have this gentleman taste it.

1181
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:39,634
I already tasted the label.

1182
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,146
Words fail me...

1183
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,693
I'll stick to champagne.

1184
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,286
It's not exactly
a neighbourhood bistro.

1185
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:08,621
The atmosphere’s in the dish.

1186
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,460
Nutmeg...

1187
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:14,669
And the scallops?

1188
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,672
I can't analyze each mouthful.

1189
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,340
We're hereto enjoy this.

1190
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,842
To appreciate it.

1191
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,096
That's a sin!

1192
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,182
That's why it's so good.

1193
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,767
Light it for him.

1194
01:26:28,933 --> 01:26:31,394
How cold is the champagne here?

1195
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,354
5.5° C.

1196
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,648
- How do you know?
- I'm a regular.

1197
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,069
It's magnificent, Maxime!

1198
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,660
I'm not much good at speeches

1199
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,371
but thanks for being my friends.

1200
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:13,186
- What a crowd!
- It' might rain later.

1201
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,564
Hello.
Sorry, I won't shake your hand...

1202
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,691
She's my sister.

1203
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:20,109
Can you mind the kids?

1204
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:22,278
Sure. Going for a swim?

1205
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,155
But no more than an hour.

1206
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,366
Watch out!

1207
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,582
Does it hurt?
We'll put a big bandage on.

1208
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:38,002
Take him.
If they amputate, call me.

1209
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:39,254
Damn it!

1210
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:41,631
Get off my back!

1211
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,300
What's wrong with them?

1212
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:48,930
Can't you see I'm fixing it!

1213
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,474
Just wait. Go away, get off!

1214
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,269
- Can we help?
- No!

1215
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:05,738
Alex?
I want to kiss you goodbye.

1216
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,116
Already?

1217
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:10,785
Yes. Maurice is driving me buck.

1218
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:18,918
We have to get going.
I start early tomorrow.

1219
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:21,212
You'll learn to swim?

1220
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,506
I take my lesson every day.

1221
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,970
Cull me when you get there.

1222
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:38,771
Be careful! She's fragile!

1223
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,128
Francis, the tarps!

1224
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,757
I declare this a disaster urea!

1225
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:56,641
Lights! Lights!

1226
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:51,214
