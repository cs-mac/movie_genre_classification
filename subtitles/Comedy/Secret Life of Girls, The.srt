1
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:04,601
You would live
in the same room
as Amy?

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,000
Where else would I live?
In the nursery?

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,400
I made the garage
into a room for you.

4
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:09,567
Why does she get
the big new room?

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:10,734
I'm never
going to have sex again.

6
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:11,868
With you.

7
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:13,767
You know I care about you.
I love you, Adrian.

8
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,000
You just tell me you love me
when you're trying to have
sex with me.

9
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm moving in.

10
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,267
I love having you here, Betty.

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,367
I'm never having sex,
ever again.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,133
No one will believe that.

13
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,133
Moose is going?

14
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,534
Your mom doesn't want a dog.

15
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,701
So I called the guy
and told him
to pick him up.

16
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,267
I want to look for furniture
for my room.
I'll take you.

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,434
I love you, Tammy.

18
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:33,567
I want you.

19
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,901
George, I swear,
if you let anyone
take this dog away from me,

20
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,834
you're never moving back
into this house, ever.

21
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:41,734
I would never even think
about touching Ashley.
Never.

22
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:42,934
I think you would
think about it.

23
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,767
I met someone. A guy.

24
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,801
I'd like to go
to therapy with you.
No.

25
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,534
I think we need
to talk to someone.

26
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,567
I thought
I wanted you and Mom
to get back together,

27
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,701
but that means I have to
get back together with Amy,
and I really don't want to.

28
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,000
Jeff, this is
my son Tom.

29
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,067
You're the boyfriend?

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,567
Hey, uh,

31
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,267
when do you think
you might be coming here?

32
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:08,367
Hello?

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,367
It's my kitchen.

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,033
It's my new kitchen.

35
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:17,033
It's my new house.
I live in a house now.

36
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:20,033
I got stairs,
and I've got
a living room,

37
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,400
and I got a dining room,

38
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,400
and I can't see it all
from here,

39
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:26,400
because I live in a house.

40
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,067
I have a house. A house.

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,534
Congratulations.

42
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,567
Thanks.

43
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,734
Hey, I have an idea.

44
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,634
How about we go upstairs
and check out your bedroom?

45
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,234
How about we save that
for after therapy?

46
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,400
I told you,
we're not going to therapy.

47
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,133
Look, suit yourself,
but I'm going.

48
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,167
Yeah, I'm sure.

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
I called your therapist

50
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:48,501
and made an appointment.

51
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:49,567
I'm going this afternoon.

52
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,167
Oh, come on.
No you're not.

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,667
I am, and you can
go with me if you want.

54
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,934
No, I don't want.

55
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,434
And you're not seeing
my therapist.

56
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,767
No. I am.

57
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,601
Look, I've got
my own issues to work out,

58
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:02,133
and if you don't want
to be there to work out
our issues as well,

59
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,567
then that's okay.

60
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,701
But I'm not going
to have sex with you

61
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,367
until I feel I have
some future with you.

62
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,033
Or at least some possibility
we could get married some day

63
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,501
and have our own family.

64
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,701
That's what I want.

65
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:15,133
Well, you don't always
get what you want.

66
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,200
No, I do.

67
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:19,534
You see this house? Ta-da.

68
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:22,133
Adrian, I'm not kidding.
I don't want you to go
to Dr. Fields.

69
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,300
If you want to go
to therapy, fine.

70
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:26,701
But you can't go to therapy
where I go to therapy.

71
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,133
You said he was the best.

72
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,367
I want the best.
I deserve the best.

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,033
And I deserve you.

74
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,667
Adrian, therapy
is not what you think.
Believe me. It's hard.

75
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,834
It's not just
talking to someone
so you can get your way.

76
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,901
It's not just
getting someone
to agree with you.

77
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,501
It's almost the opposite.

78
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,801
Part of it
is getting you to see

79
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,901
when you're not
being honest with yourself.

80
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,067
Oh, I'm honest.

81
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,067
I'm brutally honest.

82
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,234
That's how I keep it real.

83
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,667
Oh, would you look at that?

84
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,434
You can see right into
Amy's living room
from here.

85
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,601
Like that's brutally honest?

86
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,934
Like you just discovered that?

87
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,434
That's why
you bought the house.

88
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,467
Oh. Right.

89
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:04,868
Speaking of which,

90
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,033
maybe your shrink
could figure out a way

91
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,634
the two of us
can see John together
without Amy around.

92
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,367
He's not Merlin.
He doesn't do magic.

93
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,033
Nothing's
going to happen today.

94
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a process.
It takes a long time.

95
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,033
It's slow.

96
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,968
I like slow.

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,834
Please, Adrian,

98
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,667
do not do this.
Do not go to my shrink.

99
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,734
You're just going to ruin
sex and therapy for me,

100
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,868
and those are the two things
I care about most.

101
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:30,133
Mm, you care about me?

102
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,734
Yeah. I do.

103
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,734
But we don't need
to talk about that
in therapy.

104
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,868
You don't need
to talk about that
in therapy.

105
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,334
I don't?

106
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,200
[Ashley clears her throat]

107
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:47,767
I'm so sorry.

108
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,367
I didn't realize
you already have the keys.

109
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,100
I was just making sure
I have everything.

110
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,334
And I do.

111
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:01,033
Okay. Uh, bye.

112
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,367
Enjoy.

113
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,033
Oh, and speaking of enjoying,

114
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:08,067
you know the window
is not a one-way mirror.

115
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,801
We can see everything
that's going on over here
in the kitchen,

116
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,234
so you might want to get
some blinds or something.

117
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,934
Maybe change the locks.

118
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,067
Okay, bye.

119
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,434
I'll just go. Yeah.

120
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,033
I don't care
if anyone sees in here.

121
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,667
Do you?
Yeah. I do.

122
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,534
Our business
should stay our business,

123
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,501
and my business with Amy
should stay my business
with Amy.

124
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,033
What goes on over here
should not affect

125
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,367
what goes on over there.

126
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,834
It shouldn't. But it does.

127
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,400
Da-da.

128
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah, that's Daddy
all right.

129
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,000
Da-Da.

130
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,734
Where's Mama, John?

131
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,767
Where's Mama?

132
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,000
<i>* Falling in love </i>

[Ricky whistles]

138
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,801
Howdy, neighbor.

139
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,133
You moving in too?

140
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,434
No.

141
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,501
I just always wanted to say
"howdy, neighbor."

142
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,501
Want to help me?

143
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:37,767
I doubt I can help you.

144
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:38,868
I need help myself.

145
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:40,000
Get over here.

146
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,334
You know there's a gate.

147
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,100
I didn't know.

148
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,501
So your girlfriend
getting all moved in?

149
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:51,968
Yeah, but your ex-girlfriend's
flying this week,

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,100
so she's not around.

151
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,501
Who asked you?

152
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,067
No one. Just thought
I'd let you know.

153
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,634
Why's that?
I don't know.

154
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,801
You do. You thought
you'd point out

155
00:05:58,834 --> 00:05:59,834
that I've made
a few mistakes.

156
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:01,067
I was just pointing out
one mistake.

157
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,634
I didn't know there were
a few mistakes.

158
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,968
Why would you be
pointing out my flaws?
You have your own.

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,634
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

160
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,501
Something tells me
someone's not having sex.

00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,300
Too close to
the mother of your baby

162
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,601
to maintain a relationship
with your girlfriend?

163
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:17,067
No.

164
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,434
Adrian wants a commitment.

165
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,734
Commitment?
What kind of commitment?

166
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,501
She wants to know
I might marry her
one day

167
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:22,534
and have children with her.

168
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,400
One day soon?
Just one day.

169
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:25,767
Anything's possible, right?

170
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,601
You could marry one day
and have children with her.

171
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:28,868
Adrian's a nice girl.

172
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,534
I'm not going to make
some promise I can't keep

173
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,767
just so I can--
You know.

174
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,234
Yeah, but it's
not a promise, is it?

175
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,767
She's not looking
to get engaged.

176
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:35,934
No, I don't think so.

177
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,767
She just wants to know
there's a possibility

178
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:38,767
we have some future together.

179
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,434
Seems reasonable.

180
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,767
Unless, of course,
you think you have
some future with Amy.

181
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,400
Oh, no.

182
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,434
Oh, no? What do you mean?
Amy's not good enough for you?

183
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,601
You made it pretty clear
I'm not good enough for her.

184
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:49,934
I don't want my daughter
marrying someone

185
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,434
who's not in love with her,
and you're not.

186
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,334
I can tell by the way
you look at her.

187
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:54,767
It's not that
she's not attractive.

188
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,234
There's just no heat.

189
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,467
Heat, huh?

190
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,667
Maybe if you lived
at band camp
there'd be heat.

191
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,067
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

192
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
I didn't plan it.

193
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,400
I like Amy.
I even love Amy. I do, but--

194
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,334
Don't say that again,
and never to her, okay?

195
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,734
Again, it's not
that she's not attractive.

196
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:11,734
Amy's really attractive, but--

197
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,067
Let me get
the shovel out,

198
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,234
so you can dig a deeper hole
than the one you're in.

199
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,367
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,367
Really, I don't mean

201
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,567
to offend you or her
or anyone.

202
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,434
I'm just trying
to figure things out.

203
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,701
But that you got figured out,
that you and Amy have no heat.

204
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,434
I didn't even
want to talk about Amy.
I want to talk about Adrian.

205
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:26,467
What about Adrian?

206
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,234
Did you and your wife ever--

207
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,901
I'm not going to talk about
things I've done with my wife.

208
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,267
I just want
to know if you went
to counseling together.

209
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,100
Like marriage counseling.
Course not.

210
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,767
The reason we have
such a great relationship

211
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,267
is we haven't gotten
anyone else involved in it,

212
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,501
other than the people
we cheated with.

213
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:40,567
You're divorced.

214
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,467
I keep forgetting.

215
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,434
I just-- I'm so confused.

216
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,434
How do you know
when you're with
the right person?

217
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,100
There is no right person.
There's just a person.

218
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,434
If that's the person
you want to be with
and have a family with,

219
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,934
then be with that person.
If you don't, then don't
be with that person.

220
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,334
It's not that complicated.

221
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,767
Maybe not for you,
but for me,

222
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,601
it's extremely complicated.

223
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,767
You know my history.

224
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,234
It affects everything I do.

225
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,400
I have to think about
everything I do.

226
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:05,734
I can't just be with someone
because I want to be
with them.

227
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,734
I might not want
to be with them
three days later.

228
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,501
Sometimes it's not even
three hours later.

229
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,267
For me.

230
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,901
Come on, son.

231
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,901
You're not
that much more complicated
than the rest of us.

232
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,934
My dad didn't abuse me.
He wasn't around
to abuse me.

233
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:21,701
<i>I learned everything I know
about being a great dad
from Leave it to Beaver.</i>

234
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,000
I just stepped it up a notch.

235
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,400
Look,
if I haven't said this--

236
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,868
I respect what you're doing.

237
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,367
Trying to leave
a different legacy
for your son

238
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,367
than the one
you were given.

239
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,367
But?

240
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,534
No buts about it.
I respect that.

241
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,567
There are things
I like about you.

242
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:39,634
Like that, as well as the fact
that there's no heat between
you and Amy.

243
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,133
What don't you like about me?

244
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,734
Your thick, gorgeous hair.

245
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,734
I used to have hair like that
when I was young.
When I met Anne.

246
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,734
When Anne and I
got pregnant with Amy.

247
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,067
I never worried about
having heat with her.

248
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,901
I worried about
being a father
to my daughter.

249
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,467
Look where we are today.
I'm just worried about
being a father to my son.

250
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,834
If this is
some kind of message,

251
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,167
could you be
a little less subtle
and a lot more direct?

252
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,934
Because I feel
just as confused
as when I came over here.

253
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,434
Are you saying that
I should marry Amy,

254
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,934
whether there's
any heat or not,

255
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:07,934
or are you saying
I should just worry
about being a good father

256
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:08,968
and be with Adrian?

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,300
All I'm saying is

258
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,801
if you don't feel obligated
to be with someone,

259
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:15,033
and you still want
to be with that someone
45, 50% of the time,

260
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,367
then you're probably
in love.

261
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,300
There's probably
some possibility

262
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,000
that one day,
you'll marry that person
and have children.

263
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,100
Just tell Adrian that.

264
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,667
Tell Adrian that?

265
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:23,834
Heat lasts.

266
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,601
Even when love is gone,
heat will still be there.

267
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,300
You got that?

268
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,634
I guess.

269
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:36,300
Enjoy that head of hair
while you still got it.

270
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:37,734
Don't flaunt it.

271
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,067
Hey, what you got there?

272
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,400
Wings.

273
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:53,901
It's a big cooler
for little chicken wings.

274
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a lot of wings.

275
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,033
Is that for me?

276
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,267
Uh--
That's okay.

277
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,400
Wouldn't want
to take anything

278
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,534
that doesn't belong to me.

279
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,000
I've done that.
It wasn't that much fun.

280
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,000
Cheating never is.

281
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

282
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,067
Someone was just
reminding me

283
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,200
of some of my mistakes.

284
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,834
And you bring that up because?

285
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,534
I was thinking about it.
Now I'm thinking
about this.

286
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,033
Why are you bringing
a barrel of wings over?

287
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,534
I want to ask Amy
if she wanted to have
a backyard picnic.

288
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,734
Sunday afternoon,
that's when I first proposed.

289
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,400
It's just a romantic notion.

290
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,501
Romantic, huh? So you two,
you're still in love?

291
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,067
Oh, yeah.
All right, well--

292
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,501
You're not doing anything,
are you?

293
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,734
Doing anything?

294
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,334
You shouldn't be doing.

295
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,567
No.

296
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,334
You got a funny look.
Are you doing something

297
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:31,934
you shouldn't be doing
with someone besides
my daughter?

298
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,167
What? No.

299
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,968
Are you thinking about
doing something?

300
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,367
What, you mean
somebody like Adrian?

301
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,968
Adrian? Who said
anything about Adrian?

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,200
I don't know
what you're getting at, sir.

303
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,868
Sir? Okay, you tell me
right here and now
what's going on.

304
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm not doing anything.

305
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,767
I'm not thinking about
doing anything.

306
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, maybe you ought to.

307
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,133
Maybe you should let Amy know
you're thinking about her
that way.

308
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,868
She's down right now
with Adrian moving in
next door.

309
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,968
Might be good
for her ego if you
tried a little something.

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,067
What?

311
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,901
I'm not saying
you should do anything,

312
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,334
but sometimes a woman
wants to feel like she's hot,
you know?

313
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,000
This is a very uncomfortable
conversation.

314
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,400
Come on, just do it.

315
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,334
Just take some action.
Nothing serious.
Nothing offensive.

316
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,334
Just something
that would let her know

317
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,367
that you find her--

318
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,901
Hot.

319
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

320
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,534
Mr. Juergens, are you okay?

321
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,567
Did you have a heat stroke?

322
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,400
Just do what I tell you.
Take it from a guy who's been
married for 17 years.

323
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:22,934
You're divorced.

324
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:25,567
Damn, why can't I get that
in my head?

325
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,234
Because you and Mrs. Juergens
are having a baby together?

326
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,567
It was a rhetorical question.

327
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:31,767
Got it.

328
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:36,434
Son, let me
tell you something.

329
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,100
I'm about to become a father
for the third time in my life.

330
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,434
I've learned a few things
over the years.

331
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,767
When women don't want
to have sex,

332
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,434
they still want you
to want to have sex.

333
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,400
So want to have sex,
but don't.

334
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,267
Got it.

335
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,767
Thank you very much.

336
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,234
Hey.
Why's everybody
at the back door?

337
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:11,567
What happened to
the front door?

338
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,734
There's a sign that says
"Don't ring the doorbell,

339
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,868
don't knock, baby's sleeping."

340
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,100
That explains it.
How are you?

341
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,834
I'm well, thanks.
How are you?

342
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:22,934
I got a lot
going on, Griffin.
Lot going on.

343
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,934
Thought we were on
the same team.

344
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,133
Team Ashley.

345
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,167
Oh. Yeah, of course.
Of course.

346
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,033
And yet last weekend,
she's standing on
the front porch,

347
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,534
making out while
you sit idly in the car

348
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,467
with the boyfriend's mother.
What's that all about?

349
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,534
They're not
going to do anything

350
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,501
on a front porch
with a spotlight on them.

351
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:38,701
They're not going to do
anything anywhere,

352
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,000
even with no light
on them.

353
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,033
Of course they're not.

354
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:44,601
I would put myself
between her and any guy.

355
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,234
You know what I mean.

356
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,334
I know what you mean.

357
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,901
So what do you have
going on?

358
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,734
You seem a little off.

359
00:12:55,767 --> 00:13:00,067
I got a baby coming.
I don't know if I'm
ready for him.

360
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,334
I don't know if I'm ready
for marriage and three kids.

361
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,367
Four, with your grandson.

362
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,133
And I hear you have
a special needs dog.

363
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,000
That may have been a mistake.

364
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:11,868
All of this may have
been a mistake.

365
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,133
I admit it,
not a lot of time's passed,

366
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,801
but I'm lonely, Grace.

367
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,501
And I had a good marriage.

368
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,467
But I like having
a man in my life.

369
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,501
A young man.

370
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:28,834
A much younger man.

371
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,200
Dad would not approve.

372
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,033
If your dad was around
to give his opinion,

373
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,367
I wouldn't be with
a young man.

374
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,567
Your point being?

375
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,033
That your dad's
not around.

376
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,868
It's so embarrassing.

377
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,367
What, that I would
be dating?

378
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,534
Yes. You should be in mourning,

379
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,868
not having sex with
some young, good-looking guy.

380
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,868
He is good-looking,
isn't he?

381
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,634
That's beside the point.

382
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,234
Grace.

383
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:53,234
Grace, don't make it
so important, honey.

384
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,400
It's not that important.

385
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,200
Then drop him.
I like him.

386
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't.
You don't even know him.

387
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:00,834
That's why he's coming over,
so we can all get to know
each other.

388
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:01,901
I don't want to know him.

389
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:03,400
I don't want to know
anything about him.

390
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,968
And I cannot believe
you brought him to church.

391
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,834
Mom, of all places, church!

392
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,734
He's Jewish.
It meant nothing to him.

393
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,567
I don't know
what I meant by that.

394
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,467
Everybody was staring at you.

395
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,667
And not you?

396
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:16,667
You and the minister's son?

397
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:18,133
No one was staring
at you and Jack?

398
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,467
I noticed none of
your TAG friends
would come near you.

399
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,834
Is there a reason
for that?
No, there isn't.

400
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:23,834
I'm not having sex.

401
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,167
I'm not being shunned
by my group,

402
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,334
if that's what you mean.

403
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,367
Are you having sex?

404
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,834
Are you having sex
with this guy?

405
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:31,868
Grace,

406
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:33,501
that's none of your business.

407
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,200
I think it's my business
if my mother is having sex.

408
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,367
Do you hear how ridiculous
that sounds?

409
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,501
No, it's not ridiculous.
What's ridiculous is the fact

410
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,000
that you brought
a guy to church

411
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,934
that you're having sex with
that you're not married to.

412
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:47,367
Hello. We're not
the only single people
in church having sex.

413
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,601
Ah ha.

414
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:49,601
If we were having sex,

415
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,167
and we're not having sex.

416
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,801
And when we have sex,
that's between
me and Jeff.

417
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,100
Not you, me and Jeff.

418
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,501
Fine. Go ahead.

419
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,834
Have sex.

420
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:58,601
But if you have sex,
I'm going to have sex.

421
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:00,534
You are too young
to have sex.

422
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,234
Oh? I think you're too old
to have sex.

423
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,968
Too old to have sex
with Jeff.

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,601
I thought you thought
I was too Christian
to have sex with Jeff.

425
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,534
Obviously you're not
a Christian.

426
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,067
And you?
Are you a Christian?

427
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,934
Yes, I am a Christian.

428
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:16,367
<i>I'm not having sex again
until I'm married.</i>

429
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
What?

430
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:18,901
You heard it here.

431
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,167
Hi.

432
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,834
Hi. Well,
I'll let you two talk

433
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,434
while I go up and change.

434
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:29,534
Into something younger?

435
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,868
Yeah. And perhaps
something more
Christian.

436
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,434
Maybe some strappy sandals.

437
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,934
Can you believe that?

438
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,868
My mom and her gigolo
at church?

439
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:41,467
She's disgusting,
and so is he.

440
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,334
You're not
going to have sex again
until we're married?

441
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,033
I thought we were moving
in the other direction.

442
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,701
I changed my mind.

443
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,000
Maybe I can
change it back.

444
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:49,834
Okay, all right.

445
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,133
I'm fine with that.

446
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,434
No, you're not.

447
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,267
You would have had sex
yesterday if I'd let you.

448
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,200
I'd have sex with you
every day if you let me.

449
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,434
Well, I'm not
going to let you.

450
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:58,968
This isn't just
your period talking?

451
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,501
Shut up about my period.
You do not know anything
about my period.

452
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,100
You got that?
I got it.

453
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,133
Why are you smiling?
No reason.

454
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,901
Maybe I should
come back in about five days,
when you're in a better mood.

455
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,467
You think you're so clever,

456
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,968
knowing all about
girl stuff.

457
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,968
Hello? You thought you were
so clever, knowing about
guy stuff.

458
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,801
Sports medicine,
groin injuries.

459
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,968
That's a perverse choice of
medical fields for a woman,

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,834
if you ask me.
Well, who asked you?
Nobody asked you,

461
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:23,167
and I'll specialize
in whatever field
of medicine I want.

462
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,067
I didn't know you want
to be a doctor.
That's great.

463
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,701
What field are you in?
Gynecology.

464
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,734
Knew it.

465
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,868
She just got
her period yesterday.

466
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:35,534
Yeah, I didn't think
you were buying tampons
for yourself.

467
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,601
Oh. Right.

468
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:39,534
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.

469
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,868
Is it possible for a woman
to get pregnant when
she's on her period?

470
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,200
Wow.

471
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,701
Nice to meet you, too.
Jack, was it?

472
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,033
Yeah. Yes, it is possible,

473
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,868
and at 16,
when a girl's period
is still irregular,

474
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,367
more possible,

475
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,534
so you should definitely
be using protection

476
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:54,868
and Grace should be
on birth control pills.

477
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:57,367
Oh, she is.
And I always use
a condom.

478
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,133
So what are you guys
talking about?

479
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,067
Golf.

480
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,067
Hey, I like your sandals.

481
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,167
Oh, thanks.

482
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,434
I'm going to go upstairs
and talk to Grace.

483
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,734
I hope you have better luck
with that than I did.

484
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,167
Me, too.

485
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,767
So you think
they're not having sex?

486
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,767
They're not having sex.
Grace just told me
they're not having sex.

487
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:20,934
Oh, oh, oh.

488
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:22,767
And we aren't
having sex either.

489
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,801
Sh.

490
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,100
I cannot believe
this is happening.

491
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,734
She's lost her mind.

492
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,067
Going out with the brother

493
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,901
of the doctor who killed
my father in a plane crash?

494
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:32,901
Who does that?

495
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,501
And just because he's Jewish,

496
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,234
that does not
give her an out.

497
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,200
They don't believe
in sex before marriage
any more than we do.

498
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:40,367
They have the same big ten
as Christians do.

499
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,067
No murders, no false idols,

500
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,734
no other gods, no gossiping,

501
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:46,067
no stealing, never use
the Lord's name in vain,

502
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,133
keep the sabbath holy,

503
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,400
and honor
your mother and father.

504
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,267
He is not honoring my father.

505
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,734
She is not honoring my father.

506
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,734
Oh, and no adultery.
How about that?

507
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:57,167
No adultery.
Oh, and no coveting
your neighbor's wife.

508
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,167
How about that?
He's coveting.

509
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,667
Does he live around here?
What?

510
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:02,334
Grace, there's probably not
a religious doctrine

511
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,167
that encourages
sex before marriage,

512
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,067
but people are
having sex.

513
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,234
People of all religions.
I don't even think

514
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,133
that atheists promote
sex before marriage, do they?

515
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,133
What's your point?

516
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,367
My point?

517
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,067
I want to have sex.

518
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,734
And we're too young
to get married.

519
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,767
What are we
supposed to do, Jack?

520
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,067
What are we
supposed to do?

521
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,901
I don't know.
But here's an idea.

522
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:25,033
Oral sex.

523
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,734
It's just an idea.

524
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,734
It's kind of a loophole.

525
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,534
It's still sex.

526
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,734
Not if you don't believe
it's still sex.

527
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:36,434
If you don't believe that,
everybody wins.

528
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,767
Sex is great.

529
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,767
It is.

530
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,268
What makes it great?

531
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,934
He does.

532
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,101
Okay, and me.

533
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:55,600
I got to give
a lot of credit to me.

534
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,600
I've got
a little technique.

535
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,268
But so does he.

536
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:01,734
[Dr. Fields]
Is it just the technical
aspects of the sex

537
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,533
that make it so good?

538
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,201
Oh, and the degree
of difficulty.

539
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:08,201
I mean, we're pretty much
comfortable doing anything.

540
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,600
[Dr. Fields]
I was talking about emotion.

541
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,268
How do you feel
after you have sex?

542
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,901
You want to take that one?

543
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't even want to be here.

544
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,368
Okay, well,
I don't know about him,

545
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,967
but I feel good after sex.

546
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,934
Really good.

547
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,467
And I sleep well, too.

548
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,467
Although other times,

549
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,901
it makes me feel
really energetic.

550
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,500
And hungry.

551
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:32,934
How do you feel about Ricky
after sex?

552
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,400
Good.

553
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,567
[Dr. Fields]
Good?
Mm-hm.

554
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,901
Good in what way?

555
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,334
I feel really
close to him.

556
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:41,901
And I love it
when he stays around
for a little while.

557
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:44,901
Other guys I've been with,
I don't care if they
stay around or not.

558
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,967
[Dr. Fields]
That's interesting.

559
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,234
Ricky, when you
stay around,

560
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,634
how long do you stay around?

561
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,901
Not overnight.
[Dr. Fields]
And why is it?

562
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,234
You're out on your own now.
You have your own place.

563
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,268
You don't have to report
to your mom and dad.

564
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:58,901
Why don't you spend the night?

565
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,567
Because I don't want to.

566
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,901
Why not?

567
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,901
Because I don't.
I like to be alone.

568
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,700
Especially after I have sex.

569
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,268
So Adrian would like
a little more time
with you after sex,

570
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,467
and you'd like
to be alone.

571
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,901
I know why Ricky
wants to be alone.

572
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:16,901
But Adrian, you tell me
why you'd like a little more
time with Ricky.

573
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:20,334
I don't know. I just
would like more time
with him.

574
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:23,334
At what age
did you start
having sex?

575
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,067
Why?

576
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,034
Are you uncomfortable
answering that question?

577
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:32,134
No. No.

578
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,634
15.

579
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,034
[Dr. Fields]
Tell me about it.

580
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:39,134
Really? 'Cause I've never
told him about it.

581
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,533
I never wanted to know.

582
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,734
You don't have to talk
about it if you don't
want to, Adrian,

583
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,400
but sometimes the first time
has an impact on

584
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,234
your subsequent
sexual relationships.

585
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,967
I was just trying
to get to know you better

586
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,734
so I can help you with
whatever you want me
to help you with.

587
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,967
It was with
my best friend.

588
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,500
My neighbor Antonio.

589
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,134
Jeeze, do I have to
hear this?

590
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,467
You don't want to hear this,
you can step out of the room.

591
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,934
Tell me about Antonio.

592
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,934
Older?

593
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,634
No. No, no.
It wasn't like that.

594
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:16,301
It wasn't some older guy
talking me into having sex.

595
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:19,634
Antonio and I
grew up together.

596
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:23,934
We lived in the same
apartment building
for seven years.

597
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:26,600
We rode the school bus
together

598
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:29,934
and we hung out.

599
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:34,268
We had sleepovers.

600
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,600
We were best friends.

601
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:38,101
And then, one day,

602
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:40,867
he said he was moving.

603
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,700
Just like that.

604
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,201
So we decided
we'd do it.

605
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,433
We always thought
we would do it.

606
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:52,934
We wanted to be
each other's first.

607
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,134
And last.

608
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,134
We always talked about

609
00:21:56,167 --> 00:22:00,600
getting married
and how many children
we were going to have,

610
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:03,067
where we were
going to live.

611
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:06,201
We loved each other.

612
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:10,201
I loved him.

613
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:11,400
And he loved me.

614
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,201
But he had to move.

615
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,867
He didn't have
any other choice.

616
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,433
So what happened
to him?

617
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:18,600
You didn't
stay in touch?

618
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:19,767
No.

619
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,967
Because?

620
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,967
Because it was never
going to be the same.

621
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:28,034
It was a really,
really wonderful night.

622
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:30,600
We went up on the roof
of the building

623
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:31,867
and we took our sleeping bags,

624
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:36,433
like we had done
a lot of times before.

625
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,368
Only this time,
we zipped them up together.

626
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,134
We listened to music

627
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:44,268
and we watched the moon.

628
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:48,034
It was a really, really
wonderful night.

629
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,167
It was magic.

630
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:53,134
And then it was over

631
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:57,268
and he was gone.

632
00:22:57,301 --> 00:22:59,834
And you never
heard from him again?

633
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,867
We agreed not to call
or write each other.

634
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,500
There was no point.

635
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,967
No point to staying
in touch with each other?

636
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:09,234
Why is that?

637
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:13,567
Because--

638
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,167
Because he was moving
to another state
for cancer treatment.

639
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,067
He had cancer.

640
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:33,201
I told you it wasn't easy.

641
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,934
Yeah, you told me.

642
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,234
Would you two like
to talk to each other,
alone?

643
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:39,901
Could we?

644
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:40,934
Sure.

645
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:51,301
So that's why
you want a commitment?

646
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:54,334
You're afraid I'm just
going to leave and never
see you again.

647
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:01,433
Yeah, I guess I am.

648
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:06,101
Gosh, I hadn't
thought about him
in a long time.

649
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:09,167
You're the first guy
I've had feelings for
since him.

650
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:13,433
And with Antonio,
I don't know if
we were friends

651
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:17,368
and I loved him,
but not like I love you.

652
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,867
I guess I'm afraid that
you could just walk out
of my life, too.

653
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,201
Sometimes there's just
no choice, Adrian.

654
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:24,667
We don't know
what's going to happen.

655
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,301
We're 17.

656
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,567
We wouldn't know
what's going to happen
if we were 70.

657
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,734
Right.

658
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,901
That's why we just
have to see how it goes.

659
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,268
There are no guarantees,
Adrian,

660
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:35,500
that we're going to live
happily ever after.

661
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,934
This is depressing.

662
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,967
Yeah, it is.

663
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:42,268
But I know what would
make you feel better.

664
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,500
I know what would
make me feel better,
anyway.

665
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,433
Sex.

666
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:47,667
Not just sex.

667
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,600
I'll spend the night.

668
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:51,600
We'll talk.

669
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:54,001
Spend the night?

670
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,934
The whole night?

671
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,767
It's your first night
in the house.

672
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,201
Ruben's going to be home.

673
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:00,901
We can stay
at my apartment.

674
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,600
If you want.

675
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,368
Aren't you ever afraid
of losing someone you love?

676
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
What do you mean?

677
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,201
Aren't you afraid
that one day,

678
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:15,433
Amy will move away
and take John with her?

679
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,368
I don't like
to think about that stuff.

680
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,867
You better
think about that stuff,

681
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,901
because it could happen.

682
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:22,867
What if the baby
had been her mother's
boyfriend's baby

683
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:26,101
and Amy moved with her mother
to that house near
her grandmother?

684
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:27,201
What if that had happened?

685
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,867
I don't like to play
what if.

686
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,268
Ricky, you're his father.

687
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:31,867
You have to think
about those things,

688
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,368
because it could happen.

689
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,201
She could take him away.

690
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:38,634
If she does, I don't guess
there's anything I could do
but follow her.

691
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,901
You know, there are
other things you can do.

692
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,734
You can go to court

693
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,234
and get your rights
to see your son

694
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,301
established before
anything happens.

695
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,901
You need to have some sort of
legal custody agreement

696
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,234
before something happens,
not after something
happens.

697
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:56,967
I don't want
to get into court.

698
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:59,001
What if they go into
my background

699
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:01,001
and decide I shouldn't
even be around my son?

700
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:02,067
What happens then?

701
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,201
I thought you didn't like
to play what if.

702
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:08,234
Who would stand up
for me in court?

703
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:12,201
Who would say that a boy
needs be with his father,
who was abused by his father?

704
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:15,268
People who know you
and love you.

705
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:17,433
People who know
what a good guy you are.

706
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:20,934
People who want to help you
break the cycle of abuse

707
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,901
and believe you can do it.

708
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:24,001
I can't.

709
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:25,934
I can't open the door.

710
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:29,934
If she leaves, she leaves.

711
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,533
She's not going to leave.
She's not going to take
John anywhere.

712
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,934
I'm just saying
you have rights.

713
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:38,834
I have privileges.
I don't want my privileges
taken away.

714
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,734
Then fight
for what's yours, Ricky.

715
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,734
Are you worried that Amy
will take John away from me,

716
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:47,167
or are you worried that Amy
will take me away from you?

717
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,567
Amy's in love with Ben,

718
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,567
and Ben's in love with Amy.

719
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,368
Ben would make a better father
than I would, anyway.

720
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,167
Ben does not love John
the way you love John.

721
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,001
You're John's father.

722
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:04,001
And I'm not so sure
that Ben loves Amy.

723
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:07,002
Why is that?

724
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,901
I'm so mixed up.

725
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,567
I love Anne. I do.
I really love her.

726
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,901
But a baby?
What was I thinking?

727
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:22,901
The girls are almost grown.
I could have been out of here
in a couple years.

728
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,901
Not that I want out of here.
I love Anne.

729
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,234
I already said that.

730
00:27:27,268 --> 00:27:29,600
It's just that
I screwed everything up.

731
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:32,268
Once you cheat in a marriage,
there's no going back.

732
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,268
A baby's not going to make
any difference.

733
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:36,268
She's not going to
trust me again.

734
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,600
I went and got her pregnant.

735
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:40,934
What if she dies
in childbirth? She's old.

736
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:42,268
We're both old.

737
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:44,600
We're too old to be
starting over again.

738
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:47,368
Jeeze. I'm a mess.

739
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,934
[woof]

740
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,901
Thank you for the wings.

741
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:55,268
It was nice of you
to do that.

742
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,600
It wasn't
quite the same, though.

743
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,334
Eating in the kitchen.

744
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:01,867
I was hoping we could go
somewhere more private.

745
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,667
Somewhere where
we could talk.

746
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:11,500
Talk and do this.

747
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:12,533
Again.

748
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:17,934
What are you doing?
My parents are home.

749
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:18,967
And if they weren't home?

750
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,368
Well, they are.

751
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,867
I can't help it, Amy.
You get me so hot.

752
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,467
Really?

753
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,533
Yeah.

754
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,533
I've tried to stay away,
but I can't.

755
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,634
I want you.

756
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,101
Do you?

757
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:32,533
Of course I do.

758
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,967
What happened to
you wanting to find

759
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:36,567
an activity we're both
interested in,

760
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,101
like cribbage?

761
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,467
What happened is that
I did my best

762
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,767
to try to distract
my desires,

763
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,301
but I can no longer
do that.

764
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:46,301
That's more like it.

765
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,967
That's more like
the Ben I fell in love with.

766
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:51,268
I love that you want me.

767
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:54,500
Excuse me.
Just passing through.

768
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,368
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

769
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:07,234
You know what I've been
thinking about?

770
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:08,934
I know what I've been
thinking about.

771
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,101
I've been thinking about
your breasts again.

772
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:13,533
I think we should
get engaged.

773
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:16,268
Aren't we already
kind of engaged?
Kind of married?

774
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:17,934
Yeah, but if it was official,

775
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:20,101
then maybe we could
move in together
at your house

776
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,901
until we graduate
from high school

777
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,067
and get married.

778
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:24,201
And during that time?

779
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:26,533
We'd be having sex.

780
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,001
Lots and lots of sex.

781
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:31,201
Wow.

782
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:34,034
Wow. I'm going to go home
and talk to my dad
about this.

783
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:37,101
Not about sex,
about the other part.

784
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:38,867
He already said
that you can sleep over,

785
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:40,834
but this maybe could be
more serious.

786
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,467
Kind of like
my dad and Betty.

787
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,533
Yeah. Mm-hm.

788
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,567
All right. I'm going to go.
I'll talk to you later.

789
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:55,201
You scored, man.
This is a great room.

790
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:57,201
It's like an apartment.

791
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:59,201
Maybe you could
help me decorate.

792
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:00,533
Why is that?
'Cause I'm gay,

793
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,533
and gay guys are good
at decorating?

794
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,368
No, because you're my friend.

795
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,433
And I've seen your room.
You are good at decorating.

796
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:07,867
It's a gift.

797
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,867
Okay, we need paint.
Black paint.

798
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:10,867
I'm thinking stripes.

799
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,334
Now bear with me here.

800
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:13,533
We need tape, painter's tape.

801
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,334
Some drop cloths.

802
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:17,268
We could stain the cement.

803
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:19,001
Do some carpet squares.

804
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:22,101
Put some small chandeliers
here and there as a contrast

805
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,433
of low-end, high-end.

806
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:28,567
I'm thinking Jacques Adnet
mixed with some Dorothy Draper.

807
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,533
You know, masculine-feminine
mix of some sort.

808
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:32,800
I have 50 bucks.

809
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,600
Or we can buy a lamp.

810
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,400
Yeah.

811
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,433
Just talk to her.

812
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:39,834
Talk to her?
Talk to your sister.

813
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:42,368
If you two are fighting,
you're never going to
enjoy the room.

814
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,001
You're not.

815
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:46,901
Still your number one gay?

816
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:51,867
I'll let myself out.

817
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,600
Hey.

818
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:13,634
Hey.

819
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,700
Truce?

820
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,334
Sure.

821
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:23,867
Thank God we didn't
have to talk about it.

822
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:27,001
Yeah.

823
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:29,667
I just want to say
it's okay about the room.

824
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
I don't care.

825
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:33,134
You should have it.

826
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,167
Hey, get back
in that bed. Move it.

827
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,334
No, I just need
to move around
for a little bit.

828
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:47,334
Because?
Because I'm uncomfortable.

829
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:49,001
Are you uncomfortable because
the baby's shifted around?

830
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,667
Maybe he's ready
to get out of there.

831
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,834
No. That's not it.

832
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,500
Do you want to go
to the doctor?

833
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:56,201
No, George, I just need
to get situated.
That's all.

834
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:58,201
Are you sure you're not
going into labor?

835
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:00,634
How would you know
if I'm going into labor?
I don't. I'm just asking.

836
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,634
Well, I think I would know
if I'm going into labor.

837
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,634
I know my own body.

838
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,234
Oh. Ow.

839
00:32:07,268 --> 00:32:09,301
Ow.

840
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,967
Oh, no, George.

841
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:13,301
Oh, no, I think this is it.

842
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,967
I'll grab the suitcase
and start the car.

843
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,634
I don't think that
we're going to have time.

844
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,301
Moose, call 911.

845
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:19,967
I'll get him.
He's in the backyard.

846
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,767
George, don't you think
you should call 911?

847
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,101
What's going on?
I'm not sure.

848
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:24,433
I'm having the baby.

849
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,800
Oh.

850
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,567
Mom, breathe.
Breathe. It'll help
with the pain.

851
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,934
Will someone
please call 911?

852
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,634
Oh, Moose is in the backyard.

853
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,867
Oh, I'll call them.

854
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,500
Thank you, Ashley.

855
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,967
I think this is really it.

856
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:38,634
I think he's really--

857
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,800
I think he's really coming.

858
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,400
Come on. I'll drive you
to the hospital.

859
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:43,400
We don't have time.

860
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:45,001
I can't make it
to the hospital.

861
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:47,134
Just try. Come on, lean on me.
Let's get in the car.

862
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,667
You do not want
to have the baby here.

863
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,533
I don't want to,
but I think I'm going to.

864
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:51,967
Ow. Ow.

865
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,167
Okay, just stay in the bed.

866
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,967
It'll be fine.

867
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,634
No, it won't. She needs
a doctor and nurses.

868
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,800
Mom, do not lay down.
We have to get you
to the car.

869
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,567
We have to get you
to the hospital.

870
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,767
Amy, I can't.
The baby is coming
right now.

871
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,634
We have a slight problem.

872
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,400
Evidently, 911 says
we've cried wolf
too many times.

873
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,867
George.

874
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:12,134
Girls, get on either side
of your mother and hold
her hands.

875
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,433
I'm going to
deliver this baby.

876
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,301
Jeeze, this is ridiculous.

877
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,334
Do it.

878
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,433
George, can you
really do this?

879
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,001
Can you really
deliver the baby
with one hand?

880
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:30,734
I can do this with both hands
tied behind my back.
You just push.

881
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,967
Come on, you guys.
Don't make me laugh.

882
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,567
Come on, we can do this.
We can. We have to.

883
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,268
You can't do that.

884
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:43,600
I have to.

885
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:45,101
You have to get engaged?

886
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,700
I mean,
you have to get married?

887
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,101
No, you don't.

888
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,533
I'm afraid I do.

889
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:50,600
Oh, jeeze.

890
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,001
She's not pregnant again,
is she?

891
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:54,600
No, but if
she were pregnant,

892
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,134
could we get engaged
and married?

893
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,268
What is this really about?

894
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,201
Amy really wants to move
out of the house,

895
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:01,867
and I really want to do
whatever Amy wants to do,

896
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:04,400
because I do not
want to lose her.

897
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,067
And you think you'll lose her
if you don't let her
move into our house.

898
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:08,734
Or do you think
you're going to lose her

899
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,234
if your friend
from Italy comes over?

900
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:12,234
I have a friend
from Italy.

901
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,500
It's no big deal.

902
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,901
It is if you slept with her.

903
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:16,268
It is if you love her.

904
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:19,467
I can't love Amy
and some other girl
at the same time--

905
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,467
Can I?

906
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,734
No, you can't.

907
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:22,867
Who do you love?

908
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:24,533
Amy.

909
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:25,734
I love Amy.

910
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:26,767
Are you sure?

911
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,533
No.

912
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,634
[knocking at door]

913
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,834
I was in the hallway
eavesdropping.

914
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,867
Would you like
a woman's opinion on this?

915
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:37,834
Yeah. I wouldn't mind.

916
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,867
Have sex with Amy
before you decide.

917
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:40,867
Hold it, hold it.

918
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,234
I don't know
about that, Betty.

919
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:44,067
What?
They're 16.

920
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:45,634
Amy had a baby.

921
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,533
They're a little young
to be having sex.

922
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:50,234
Yeah, but I thought Ben
was having sex with
that girl from Italy.

923
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:51,834
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.

924
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:54,234
I just thought you should
level the playing field.

925
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,101
Then what? Have Amy
have sex with a guy
in Italy?

926
00:34:57,134 --> 00:35:00,634
No. Ben should have sex
with Amy and see how it goes.

927
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:04,167
You shouldn't be married
to someone you're not
sexually compatible with.

928
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:08,134
Believe me, it leads
to a lot of problems.

929
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:11,500
But if Amy's not ready
to have sex because
she's too young,

930
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:15,167
and she does have a baby,
then you should wait
until she is ready.

931
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,368
Until you're both ready.

932
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,867
But if the sex isn't good,

933
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,433
you got to face the music.

934
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,867
Is any sex not good?

935
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:24,167
[both]
Oh, yeah.

936
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:25,834
Sex is no good
if you're not old enough,

937
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:29,368
or mature enough,
or in love enough
to make it good.

938
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,867
Make it good?

939
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,368
Make it well.

940
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,433
I left my cell phone
in the car.

941
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:39,067
You make it well.

942
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:41,134
You do, too.

943
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,001
I've got some news
for you.

944
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:45,634
I just got off the phone
with a private investigator.

945
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,600
I don't know how you're going
to feel about this,

946
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,867
but they found your husband
at the bottom of
the East River.

947
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,967
Is he dead?

948
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,967
Yeah, Betty.
That was years ago.

949
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,234
He's been dead
for a while.

950
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:00,101
That makes me so happy.

951
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,134
I'm happy if you're happy.

952
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,368
Let's plan a wedding.

953
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,533
Oh, no, we don't
have to have a wedding.

954
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,234
We could just
run off somewhere.

955
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,234
No. You're going to be
my wife for the rest
of my life,

956
00:36:13,268 --> 00:36:16,101
and I want to treat you
to the wedding of
your dreams.

957
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,134
Well, I want to treat you
to the honeymoon of
your dreams.

958
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,101
That's what I'm
talking about, baby.

959
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:33,734
You did fine.

960
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,034
She's fine, George.

961
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,533
And so is the baby.

962
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,867
You sure you don't
want to go the hospital?

963
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:41,467
No. The hard part's
done, right?

964
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,600
Right. I'll come back tonight
to check on you, though.
Okay?

965
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,201
And I'll stay with you,
Anne, just to make sure.

966
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:47,734
Thank you.

967
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,634
That was the scariest thing
I ever had to do in my life.

968
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:53,967
I'll say.

969
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:55,334
I thought I'd seen it all.

970
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,201
Nice going, everyone.

971
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,634
Nice going, Anne.

972
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,634
What would I have done
without you?

973
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,301
Is it too soon to ask
what we're going
to name him?

974
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,600
What do you want
to name him, George?

975
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:08,533
Do you want to name him
after you?

976
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,533
You delivered him.
No, I don't want
to do that.

977
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,301
I want to name him
after someone else.

978
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,700
Not Moose, I hope.

979
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,268
No, not Moose.

980
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:18,368
Although thank God
Moose managed to convince
the 911 operator.

981
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,001
So who?
Yeah, who, Dad?

982
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:23,368
I was thinking
maybe your dad.
Robert.

983
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,934
Robert Scott Juergens.

984
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,600
Really?

985
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:29,567
Hi, Robert.

986
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,301
Most people called
your grandpa Robbie.

987
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,567
Hi, Robbie.

988
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,734
Hi, Robbie.

989
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,467
Robbie.

990
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,368
Thank you, George.

991
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,301
No. Thank you.

992
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,834
No.

993
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:01,234
You say it first.

994
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,400
I am the champion
of sex talk.

995
00:38:04,434 --> 00:38:06,267
Well, good night, Tom.

996
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,567
Oh. You still here?

997
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:13,234
Oh, I'm leaving.
But just so you know,

998
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:15,667
talking about sex
on the phone is illegal.

999
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:18,000
Oh, yeah? Call the police.

1000
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:20,400
All right, look,
I had to say that.
Your mom made me.

1001
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:22,167
My mom knows?

1002
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,234
Moms know everything.

1003
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,968
Oh, really?
Does your mother know

1004
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,434
that you had sex
with my mother?

1005
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:31,534
Not only does she know that,
but she knows that I want
to marry your mom.

1006
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,334
But keep that
between you and me, okay?

1007
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,334
Marry her?

1008
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,234
Thinking about it.

1009
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,234
What do you think?

1010
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:40,667
I think I just
met you yesterday.

1011
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:42,601
Hm. Too soon?

1012
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,901
Whatever.

1013
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:47,934
Good night, Dad.

1014
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:58,801
Grace?

1015
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,601
<i>Just wanted
to say good night.</i>

1016
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:02,234
Good night.

1017
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,267
Good night.

1018
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,701
Are you okay?

1019
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,200
I'm fine.

1020
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:11,901
I take it Jack went home?

1021
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,200
Yeah. He went home.

1022
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:15,234
I'm breaking up with him.

1023
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:16,734
Oh, Grace.

1024
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,634
I am.

1025
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,133
Because?

1026
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:24,300
I'm just not ready for
a serious relationship
right now.

1027
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,234
That movie was so lame.

1028
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,734
And tomorrow is a school day.

1029
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,133
We have to get up
in the morning,

1030
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,701
and I'm not going
to be able to sleep.

1031
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:34,133
I have a text message
from Jack.

1032
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,234
What?

1033
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:36,400
What happened?

1034
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:37,767
They broke up.

1035
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:39,067
Jack and Grace broke up.

1036
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
No way.

1037
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,100
Yeah.

1038
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,234
Wow.

1039
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:44,767
Because of you?

1040
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,901
Well, not exactly, but...

1041
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:50,234
Because of oral sex.

1042
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:52,234
He put that
in a text message?

1043
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,200
Well, yeah.
We have a code.

1044
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:57,067
Someone wouldn't
break up with someone
because of that.

1045
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,701
Yeah, well,
Grace would.

1046
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:00,467
No. No. She had to
have found out

1047
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,467
that you two did that.

1048
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,501
Oh.

1049
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:10,567
What's the emergency?

1050
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:13,100
I think I'm going
to break up with Amy.

1051
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:15,667
Bologna.

1052
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:17,467
No, it's not that.

1053
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,167
It's just,
I'm not sure anymore.

1054
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm not really sure
I love her.

1055
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,167
I'm not really sure
I want to have sex with her,

1056
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,667
even though I told her
I wanted to have sex
with her.

1057
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:29,334
I love her. I really love her.

1058
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,567
And I don't want
to hurt her.

1059
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,300
This is going to kill her.

1060
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:34,801
No, don't say that.

1061
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,501
Maybe she should
be with Ricky.

1062
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,300
Maybe she and Ricky
want to be together.

1063
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:41,501
Maybe she and Ricky
should get married
and raise their baby

1064
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:43,667
because honestly, I don't--

1065
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:44,901
I don't think I can do it.

1066
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,300
I love you, Adrian.

1067
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,701
I love you, too.

1068
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,300
John's asleep in his room.

1069
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,968
Mom and Moose are asleep
in her room.

1070
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,767
Dad is getting to know Robbie
in the living room.

1071
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:27,634
Sounds like a full house.

1072
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:30,300
What do you think
is going to happen?

1073
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:31,968
Think they'll ever
get married again?

1074
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,968
Think we'll ever be
a normal family again?

1075
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,501
We weren't a normal
family to start with, Amy.

1076
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:37,801
Yeah.

1077
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,133
I asked Ben if we could
get engaged so I could
move over there.

1078
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,834
Oh. I wondered why
you didn't care
about the room.

1079
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:51,601
Yeah. It's a stupid idea.
I don't know why I did that.

1080
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,968
I don't want to get engaged
and move in with Ben

1081
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,934
and get married
right out of high school.

1082
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:58,300
I just want to start over.

1083
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:00,567
I just want to start
my life all over again.

1084
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,801
Well, you can't.

1085
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,300
You just have to go on, Amy.

1086
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,868
I can't go on like this.

1087
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:06,634
I have to make
some changes.

1088
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,667
Like?

1089
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:08,667
I don't know, Ashley.

1090
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:10,234
I don't know.

1091
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:11,701
Well, that's good, Amy.

1092
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:14,100
I think you should
make some changes.

1093
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:17,033
Just 'cause you have John now
doesn't mean your life's over.

1094
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,067
It just means you have to
realize your dreams in
a different way.

1095
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,167
Get some new dreams.

1096
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
Dreams can change.

1097
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,601
Hey there, Robbie.
Hey there, boy.

1098
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,267
Whose boy are you, huh?

1099
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,934
Whose boy are you?

1100
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,968
Whose boy are you?

1101
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:21,534
Whose boy are you?

1102
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,901
