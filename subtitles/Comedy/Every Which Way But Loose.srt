So, Tank was in the back seat
of this car with this debutante.

238
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:13,567
I mean, her daddy owned the whole town.

239

-And his buddy was in the trunk.
-And then what happened?

240

Well, you see, she was so pure...

241
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:24,206
That nobody believed these wild stories
that Tank had been telling about her.

242
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:27,325
-What happened?
-You got to use your imagination, Orville.

243
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,364
Anyway, after...

244
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,364
She heard all this bumping around
and laughing coming from the trunk.

245
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:36,843
And she started to scream.

246
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,963
So, all these cops came in,
six or eight of them.

247
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:43,643
Tank tried to explain, but nobody
believed him because they all knew him.

248
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:45,962
He must have put about four cops
in the hospital.

249
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,602
It took about 12 of them to take him in.

black widows than rattlers every year?

00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:48,794
And I think we are...

313
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:55,034
Then it appears he's got
a rather growing collection of our bikes.

314
00:32:55,195 --> 00:32:58,153
Yeah, but we don't know for sure
if he took them or not.

315
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:01,592
-We were...
-Unconscious for two hours!

316
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:03,952
-Sick son of a bitch.
-It's not true!

317
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:05,752
Shut up!

318
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,631
The very first thing we do...

319
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:15,590
Is find out who we're talking about.

320
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:19,470
I mean,
we don't even know where to find him.

321
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,749
How are we going to find him?

322
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,588
Well, it appears to me
that there can't be too many guys...

323
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,547
Driving around this valley with an ape.

324
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:39,586
-What you got sticking out here?
-Open it.

325
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:43,186
-It sure feels heavy.
-Open it.

326
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:49,625
-Philo. God, where'd you get this?
-Off a couple little old widows.

327
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,425
-You're kidding.
-Yeah.

328
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:56,024
More people are dying to buy widow bikes
than are dying by rattler bites every year.

329
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:01,343
Well.

330
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,502
-You like it?
-Well, yeah.

331
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:08,302
That I do.

332
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:12,142
Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit.

333
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:19,340
-What's the matter?
-I'm okay.

334
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:24,259
-House not too good tonight?
-I'm okay, Philo.

335
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:49,775
Well, at least this outfit you bought me
was a big hit.

336
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:56,934
I don't like the way this guy's driving.

337
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:16,891
Get down!

338

[Gunshot]

339
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,168
Is that somebody you know?

340
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:38,128
Schyler.

341
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:42,887
-I thought you said he didn't care.
-He must have changed his mind.

342
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:59,804
Philo, I'm scared.

343
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,204
-I won't let anything happen to you.
-That's not what I'm afraid of.

344
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:05,804
I'm afraid for Schyler.
Please don't hurt him.

345
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:09,363
Son of a bitch tried to blow my head off.
He didn't care you were sitting next to me.

346
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:12,042
That's just it.
He was just trying to scare you.

347
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,643
He doesn't even know how to shoot.

348
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:16,202
I sure don't like
the way he's trying to find out.

349
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:18,721
Philo, I know him.
He's probably in there now...

350
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:20,921
Hiding, scared out of his wits.

351
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:23,800
I don't like to see you cry.

352
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,840
Let me talk to him. Please.

353
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,080
I don't know.

354
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:32,359
Please. For me. Please.

355
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,519
All right. You talk to him.

356
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,999
And you tell him that I want you
to come with me...

357
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,357
And I want you to stay with me,
you hear?

358
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,638
Philo.

359
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:47,277
Here. I want you to dry those tears.

360
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:51,317
-I want you to take this. It's the dough.
-I couldn't take that.

361
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:54,235
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it now, you hear?

362
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,395
-Okay.
-I don't want you to cry no more.

363
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,952
Clyde, how'd you get out?
What, did you pull the lock off?

364
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,272
How'd you get out?

365
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:27,470
No, you don't. Come on. No, you don't.

366
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,550
Give me that! Give me it!

367
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,309
What the....

368
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,549
Good Clyde. Good Clyde.

369
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,148
Just hold that truck up, Clyde.

370
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,588
What are you doing, Clyde?

371
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:48,307
-Philo.
-Yeah.

372
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:52,546
Call this son of a.... No, don't call him.

373
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,826
Don't call him. Good Clyde.

374
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:58,786
That's it, Clyde. Hold it up.

375
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,664
How many times have I told you?

376
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:14,623
I don't want him drinking beer,
except on Saturday night.

377
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:36,620
-Don't expect I'll need these no more.
-Take it easy, Ma. This is the easy part.

378
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:43,459
Awful glad there ain't no more
of them squiggly pictures.

379
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,258
Good. Maybe you'll do it this time.

380
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,938
Maybe. Well, I guess I will.

381
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:55,657
Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses?

382
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:59,536
It's none of his goddamn business
what I wear.

383
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,576
Just wear them to read, anyway.

384
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:05,495
Was there anything else?

385
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:09,015
Told me I was too old.

Yes, Mother?

-Next time I'll wear my glasses.
-Good.

Goddamn it.

God, you're a handsome devil.

Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now.
Understand? I want you to handle it.

392
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:45,809
That means no spitting, pissing,
farting or picking your ass.

393
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:50,808
You hear me? Because if you do,
I'll throttle you. Understand?

394
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,045
Man, I'll tell you something.

395

People are going to talk, you know?

-What is it?
-That trailer that was parked down there.

397
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,718
What happened to it?

398
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,479
-What spot?
-That spot right over there.

399
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,758
I don't see it.

400
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,758
-Well, where'd it go?
-It's gone.

401
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,238
I know it's gone, goddamn it,
but where'd it go?

402
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,438
-Back home, I suppose.
-Denver?

403
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:01,957
Some folks
just don't take me into their confidence.

404

The plates said Colorado.
Sound right to you?

405
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:06,836
-When'd they leave?
-This morning.

406
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:08,276
Thanks.

-I'll know.

You never know what you can
find out here. Just listen.

I don't know what you can do about him.
What can we do, man?

You mean to stand there and tell me
you'd let him get away with it?

You got anything in mind?

What I got in mind is
to break his stupid head.

-Listen, are you sure that thing works?
-Sure it works. Just keep digging.

Besides, you don't even know
where to find him.

Don't worry. I'll find him.

What are you laughing at?

You're going to spend your two weeks
medical leave looking for him?

I'll spend the next two years

620
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:21,811
And I'll tell you something, Orville.

621
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:25,371
He thinks about a lot of things
besides Oreo cookies.

622
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:30,650
Right, Clyde?

623
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,409
-You don't mean....
-I mean exactly that.

624
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:42,809
Where the hell are we going to get
Clyde laid in the middle of the night?

625
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,209
Shit.

626
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:55,489
How the hell do you break into a zoo?

627
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,249
It's easy.
Zoos are meant to keep everybody in.

628
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,569
Listen to that.
He knows something good's gonna happen.

629
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:04,329
Well, how do you know there's a lady
in there for him?

630
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:06,368
I don't, but if there is one there...

631
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:10,568
And he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know
what to do, anyway. Give me a hand.

632
01:05:14,569 --> 01:05:15,648
Come on.

633
01:05:17,408 --> 01:05:19,408
ECHO: Well, what do you want us to do?

634
01:05:24,928 --> 01:05:29,127
The place is probably guarded, so I want
you to stay here and keep an eye out.

635
01:05:34,647 --> 01:05:35,847
Come on, pal.

636
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:39,766
Okay. All right, Clyde.

637
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:41,326
Up.

638
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:46,006
Boy, I bet there's a gal in there.
Think there's a lady in there?

639
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:48,886
You bet, man.

640
01:05:49,886 --> 01:05:52,326
Clyde, you think there's a lady in there?

641
01:05:58,046 --> 01:05:59,605
Come on. Clyde.

642
01:06:36,524 --> 01:06:37,563
Orville.

643
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:42,323
When we get to this next town,
you should drum up some action.

644
01:06:42,484 --> 01:06:44,683
We're getting a little short on cash.

645
01:06:45,884 --> 01:06:47,243
Sure, why not.

646
01:06:51,404 --> 01:06:53,802
Do you know where
the meat-packing plant is?

647
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:58,082
-No. But I'll find it.
-All right, I'll see you there.

648
01:06:58,243 --> 01:06:59,362
You got it.

649
01:07:21,322 --> 01:07:24,441
I don't care much
for that perfume they're wearing.

650
01:07:25,122 --> 01:07:27,640
-Do they know me here?
-No, it's even money.

651
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:31,840
-Anything else?
-Yeah. Guy's name is Kincaid.

652
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:36,240
He's a local champion. Taller than you.
About 240 pounds. I checked.

653
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:40,640
-And?
-They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock.

654
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:43,240
Tank Murdock?

655
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:48,040
You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall.
And another thing, he fights dirty.

656
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,319
-Orville Boggs?
-You got it.

657
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:52,439
Okay, open the gate.

658
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,439
It's over there in the cold room.

659
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,038
-How much you want?
-What you got?

660
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:08,359
-$1,200.
-We'll take it.

661
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,758
You've got to show me something
besides conversation.

662
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:17,398
-I'll take that.
-All right, if I see yours.

663
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,398
What do you want us to do with the body?

664
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:26,477
Save your breath.
It's enough you'll lose your money.

665
01:08:27,638 --> 01:08:29,357
-Hey, man.
-Hey, baby!

666
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:31,037
What's up?

667
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:51,916
I want you.

668
01:09:25,835 --> 01:09:27,914
Come on, Philo, put him away!

669
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:32,154
ORVILLE: Don't let him tag you!

670
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:59,153
What the hell are you doing, Philo?
Come on. It's getting cold in here!

671
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,229
-I think you owe us some money.
-What money?

672
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:58,829
Wait a minute.

673
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:03,029
You aren't gonna tell all these boys
that you'll take their money, are you?

674
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:12,229
That was just so you'd know
the first one was no accident.

675
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:34,227
Did you see this little filly shoot?
Where did you ever learn to do that?

676
01:11:34,388 --> 01:11:36,707
You could shoot a gnat off
a water buffalo's ass.

677
01:11:36,868 --> 01:11:40,227
-I told you I could take care of myself.
-She took care of us.

678
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:43,667
MAN: [On radio] Car 103.

679
01:11:43,827 --> 01:11:46,907
Proceed to the intersection
of interstate 5 and Velasquez Road...

680
01:11:47,068 --> 01:11:48,467
For a 602.

681
01:11:49,627 --> 01:11:51,546
MAN 2: 103 here. Got you, over.

682
01:11:54,427 --> 01:11:57,026
That 602's the same as our 406.

683
01:11:57,867 --> 01:12:01,505
No way. It's got to be the same
as our 309 or at the best our 213.

684
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:03,106
You're crazy.

685
01:12:04,146 --> 01:12:07,865
No New Mexican 602
can come anywhere near California 309.

686
01:12:08,786 --> 01:12:10,946
When's the last time
you been out on a 309?

687
01:12:11,106 --> 01:12:12,825
Maybe three or four months.

688
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:18,225
But it don't mean that I don't know that
our 309 ain't more than that damn 602.

689
01:12:19,946 --> 01:12:22,224
-What time you got?
-6:07.

690
01:12:22,466 --> 01:12:25,224
MAN: Unit 103, abort that 602, 103.

691
01:12:25,385 --> 01:12:28,905
Proceed to Velasquez Road
on interstate 5 for a 607.

692
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:40,424
Well, kiss my....

693
01:12:57,984 --> 01:13:01,302
I suppose you think I'm crazy
traipsing across the country...

694
01:13:01,463 --> 01:13:03,822
After a girl I hardly even know.

695
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:05,902
Hell, I'm not like Orville.

696
01:13:06,064 --> 01:13:08,662
It takes me a long time
to get to know a girl.

697
01:13:09,104 --> 01:13:11,542
Even longer to let her know me.

698
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,302
You know what I mean?

699
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,182
I'm not afraid of any man,
but sharing my feelings with a woman...

700
01:13:25,382 --> 01:13:27,821
My stomach just turns to royal gelatin.

701
01:13:28,422 --> 01:13:30,861
I don't suppose that ever happens to you.

702
01:13:33,062 --> 01:13:37,380
Well, I guess you just keep howling
till sometime they howl back.

703
01:13:47,741 --> 01:13:52,179
If this is a strike,
it means Ronstadt and Parton move over.

704
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:54,540
It's Halsey-Taylor to the top.

705
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,659
It's okay. It just means
it's going to take a little longer.

706
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,499
But we don't give up.

707
01:14:16,459 --> 01:14:18,378
If I get this pickup...

708
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:21,378
It means the same time next year...

709
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:23,778
Halsey-Taylor has her own special.

710
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:41,497
That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady.

711
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:44,537
Thank you.

712
01:14:54,977 --> 01:14:57,736
Will you mind Clyde for me?
I'm gonna go take a run.

713
01:14:57,897 --> 01:14:58,937
All right.

714
01:15:30,736 --> 01:15:32,054
Shit!

715
01:15:35,016 --> 01:15:37,574
Hey, Lynn! Wait up!

716
01:15:42,415 --> 01:15:44,054
Fancy meeting you here.

717
01:15:44,214 --> 01:15:46,454
Yeah. Incredible is more like it.
What are you doing?

718
01:15:46,615 --> 01:15:48,374
Following you.

719
01:15:50,095 --> 01:15:51,893
You're here just in time.

720
01:15:52,054 --> 01:15:53,573
All this weather.

721
01:15:54,294 --> 01:15:57,133
You took off so fast
I thought there was something wrong.

722
01:15:58,055 --> 01:15:59,413
Bad time to run.

723
01:15:59,574 --> 01:16:02,172
I figured maybe I'd better follow you.

724
01:16:02,614 --> 01:16:04,372
Thought you'd better?

725
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:07,812
Hell, you didn't even get a chance
to meet Clyde.

726
01:17:07,571 --> 01:17:09,490
Pull in right here. Yeah.

727
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:22,568
I know where he keeps the money now,
so it's a matter of finding the right time.

728
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,689
I still say my way would be quicker.

729
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,288
Philo, you promised.

730
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:30,808
Please don't make me sorry I told you.
You make me afraid to believe you.

731
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:33,088
I never want to make you sorry.

732
01:17:36,889 --> 01:17:39,088
You want to come down
and meet everybody?

733
01:17:39,249 --> 01:17:42,967
No, I'd better go back.
We'll do it when we have more time.

734
01:17:43,128 --> 01:17:46,287
Tomorrow night? Like we agreed?
El Patio Restaurant.

735
01:17:47,728 --> 01:17:48,727
Philo?

736
01:17:50,408 --> 01:17:51,967
You're really something.

737
01:17:54,888 --> 01:17:56,127
Bye.

738
01:18:15,727 --> 01:18:17,166
Jesus Christ.

739
01:18:17,647 --> 01:18:21,685
Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I think I'm still asleep and dreaming.

740
01:18:21,846 --> 01:18:24,245
You're not dreaming. Come on.
Get your ass up.

741
01:18:24,406 --> 01:18:26,286
Hi, Clyde. How you doing?

742
01:18:28,326 --> 01:18:30,205
Let's let the little lady up.

743
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:35,885
What did you do that for?

744
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:39,204
I think he's trying to tell us something.

745
01:18:39,365 --> 01:18:41,404
What's he trying to tell us?

746
01:18:42,206 --> 01:18:44,805
Why are you so all fired happy, Philo?

747
01:18:44,965 --> 01:18:48,364
Listen, the only time
I ever see you smiling is when....

748
01:18:50,405 --> 01:18:51,804
You got laid?

749
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:55,444
You were jogging down there,
and you picked up somebody and laid her.

750
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:57,964
-Did he?
-I'll do you one better than that.

751
01:18:58,124 --> 01:19:01,804
-You mean Clyde got laid again, too?
-No. I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor.

752
01:19:01,964 --> 01:19:03,563
How'd you do that?

753
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:06,163
I was running down the highway
and she picked me up.

754
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,963
-Where is she now?
-She's in town.

755
01:19:08,124 --> 01:19:10,443
She's getting things straightened up,
we'll see her tonight

756
01:19:10,603 --> 01:19:14,202
Goddamn, that is good news.
That means we can go home soon.

757
01:19:16,044 --> 01:19:17,563
I don't see why not.

758
01:19:17,803 --> 01:19:20,802
While we're waiting around
for true romance...

759
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:23,162
I think I'll jump down and get some flies.

760
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:26,282
There's no way I don't want
to get in on this action.

761
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,762
-Help me finish these first, will you?
-Right.

762
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:33,921
Did you ever notice how drinking
and fishing kind of go together?

763
01:19:34,082 --> 01:19:36,082
-You sell fishing licenses in here?
-Sure do.

764
01:19:36,242 --> 01:19:38,122
Something about the six-pack
and the worms.

765
01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:41,401
-Any good trout around here?
-Four or five miles down the road.

766
01:19:41,562 --> 01:19:42,721
It's a good spot, huh?

767
01:19:42,882 --> 01:19:44,041
Orville.

768
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:48,641
Don't these look like the humpers
Clyde was eating this morning?

769
01:19:49,882 --> 01:19:51,801
Are these the flies Philo wanted?

770
01:19:51,962 --> 01:19:53,641
Grayish yellow.

771
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,239
ORVILLE: Hey, Philo. Where's your boat?

-Take your hands off me!

931
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:50,783
Lynn? Is everything all right?

932
01:37:50,944 --> 01:37:55,262
Schyler, this is the one from L.A.
The big, dumb one I told you about.

933
01:37:59,103 --> 01:38:00,583
Schyler, with the shotgun?

934
01:38:00,743 --> 01:38:03,743
That was my idea.
I was hoping he'd scare you away.

935
01:38:04,223 --> 01:38:05,982
Why didn't you just say goodbye?

936
01:38:06,143 --> 01:38:07,462
You're here, aren't you?

937
01:38:07,623 --> 01:38:10,061
Guys like you don't understand goodbye.

938
01:38:15,182 --> 01:38:17,422
What do you do? You hustle for him?

939
01:38:18,862 --> 01:38:20,901
You're just not too smart, are you?

940
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,781
Why did you have to come?
Why couldn't you quit like everybody else?

941
01:38:23,942 --> 01:38:27,181
You had to come chasing me
and spoil it all.

942
01:38:28,142 --> 01:38:30,780
I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all.

943
01:38:31,061 --> 01:38:35,421
Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough
to want to take you further than your bed.

944
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:38,740
I hate you!

945
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:43,060
I hate you! I hate you!

946
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:44,420
I hate you!

947
01:38:56,381 --> 01:38:57,979
I hate you.

948
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,418
Well, listen,
do you want to rest up a little bit?

949
01:39:17,579 --> 01:39:20,538
-You don't have to take him tonight.
-Tonight's fine.

950
01:39:22,459 --> 01:39:24,578
-Are you Philo Beddoe?
-That's right.

951
01:39:25,739 --> 01:39:27,577
Straight down.
Keep on walking, you'll see him.

952
01:39:27,739 --> 01:39:28,738
Here you go.

953
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:30,617
-Is that all the money?
-That's it.

954
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:32,937
-What's with this girl here?
-Don't worry about it.

955
01:39:33,098 --> 01:39:35,737
What do you mean,
"Don't worry about it"?

956
01:39:39,978 --> 01:39:41,737
MAN: Right to your left.

957
01:39:43,337 --> 01:39:44,777
Right that way.

958
01:40:17,416 --> 01:40:20,135
Don't worry about it, Philo.
This guy's a real porker.

959
01:40:25,256 --> 01:40:28,294
Look at him. He's carrying his reputation
around his waist.

960
01:40:48,454 --> 01:40:51,293
Looks like you've had a go at it already.

961
01:40:51,854 --> 01:40:54,373
You sure that face won't hurt
too much to fight?

962
01:40:55,494 --> 01:40:59,133
-I ain't going to hit you with my face.
-That's funny.

963
01:40:59,374 --> 01:41:00,692
I like you.

964
01:41:01,253 --> 01:41:05,693
Don't worry, kid, we're gonna get this over
in a hurry and take care of you here.

965
01:41:08,573 --> 01:41:10,812
Where did you hear
of Tank Murdock before, kid?

966
01:41:10,973 --> 01:41:12,972
-All around.
-Yeah?

967
01:41:13,173 --> 01:41:15,572
-They say you're the best.
-They do?

968
01:41:18,772 --> 01:41:20,451
Well, let's get with it.

969
01:42:21,810 --> 01:42:23,609
Jesus Christ, who is that guy?

970
01:42:23,769 --> 01:42:26,688
I don't know, but he's the one
that's gonna beat Tank Murdock.

971
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,968
MAN: Come on, Tank! Come on, get him!

972
01:42:58,168 --> 01:43:00,526
Jesus Christ,
that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock!

973
01:43:00,687 --> 01:43:01,886
MAN 2: Get up! Come on!

974
01:43:03,127 --> 01:43:04,846
[Crowd booing]

975
01:43:15,086 --> 01:43:17,405
MAN: This guy's gonna be
the new Tank Murdock!

976
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:23,085
MAN 3: This is it for Tank!
MAN 4: Who is this guy?

977
01:43:23,246 --> 01:43:25,245
MAN: The new guy's beaten Tank!

978
01:43:41,645 --> 01:43:44,284
You has-been! You ought to learn to box!

979
01:43:45,565 --> 01:43:47,644
You old bum! You're all washed up!

980
01:44:00,444 --> 01:44:02,443
MAN 5: That guy's the new Tank Murdock.

981
01:44:06,044 --> 01:44:08,203
MAN 3: We're going to make money
on this guy.

982
01:44:18,363 --> 01:44:19,882
My champ! My champ!

983
01:44:48,361 --> 01:44:50,761
MA: "5, Z."

984
01:44:51,881 --> 01:44:55,240
MA: Just a minute there, now. "B."

985
01:44:56,441 --> 01:45:00,200
Why don't you try that one
with your glasses on?

986
01:45:02,201 --> 01:45:05,800
Yes. Why didn't I think of that?

987
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,320
-There. Now try it again.
-Thank you, I will.

988
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,399
"5, Z, B, D, F."

989
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,439
-You did it.
-Of course I did.

990
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,878
Now, if you'd please step over there
for your photograph.

991
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,719
-My what?
-Your photograph.

992
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,718
To put on your license.

993
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:25,959
My photograph.

994
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,718
Well, what will they think of next?

995
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:38,438
I think I forgot my comb.

996
01:45:38,879 --> 01:45:42,038
Don't you worry.
Your hair looks quite lovely.

997
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:44,918
You really think so?

998
01:45:50,918 --> 01:45:53,637
All right, you ready?
Let me get you focused.

999
01:45:53,798 --> 01:45:56,117
All right, now smile. Big smile.
