<i>Episode 21</i>

3
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,710
We...

4
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,920
You said that we are going to see other for a long time, right?

5
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,050
I also want to do that.

6
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,570
Seo Jae Woo,

7
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,030
Seo Jae Woo,

8
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,130
can you be my brother?

9
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,410
I don't really understand your words. But tell me why you are suddenly acting like this,

10
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,500
so that I can understand.

11
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,150
I came from meeting my father.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,470
My father, you know him right?

13
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,030
You saw him at the police station so you must know what kind of person he is.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,910
I can't see him because it's too embarrassing.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,440
I have more pride than it seems.

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,090
If I become your oppa, it won't be embarrassing?

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,590
Yes.

18
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,170
-Jeong Da Jeong! 
-My father...

19
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,410
asked Ahjussi to give him money.

20
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,950
I feel so ashamed and embarrassed to see his face,

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,230
but you know it's a little better thinking of him as my mother's Oppa.

22
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,780
Thinking of him as my mother's brother at times like those and

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,460
thinking of him as your father when I see you is laughable.

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,390
It's not laughable but shameless.

25
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,760
I don't want to meet a man by going so far as to do that.

26
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,990
I have something to talk about with Mom.

27
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,480
I will go in first.

28
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,430
Wait.

29
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,910
-Seo Jae Woo! 
-You said that I am your oppa.

30
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,110
Then do it.

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,990
Do it if you want. I will become your oppa.

32
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,130
Where is Da Jeong?

33
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,090
Yes. I knew that you sent her.

34
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,230
You raised the kid well.

35
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,800
Where is she?

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,520
How would I know? She just shouted at me and left.
<i>(He crosses out Da Jeong's name as a source of funds.)</i>

37
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,580
No matter how little I have, you shouldn't do that.

38
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,720
Did I ask the president of the rice cake shop for money?

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,600
That guy told me that he will give money.

40
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,970
What? You asked for money...?

41
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,230
Are you a human?
<i>(Now circling Rice Cake shop president.)</i>

42
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,850
I couldn't receive it because that hotel CEO or whatever took it.

43
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,390
I didn't get the money, but I have to pay some money.

44
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,980
What am I supposed to do?

45
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,580
Come here.

46
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,830
If you want to see me, you should come. I'm not scared of a thing like you anymore!

47
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,530
Oh, really?

48
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,340
I'm really going. Should I go?

49
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,120
Hello.

50
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,070
Hello? Da Ae's mom!

51
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,270
Hey...

52
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,630
Yes, Father.

53
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,500
Do you have somewhere to call?

54
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,880
No.

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,910
Father...

56
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,090
Da Jeong is good at working, right?

57
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,420
What you said about her being better than me when I first started learning,

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,680
are you being sincere? I'm hurt.

59
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,120
It's true that she is better than how you were.

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,480
Father...

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,870
Even if that's true, what does it matter? She has a job.

62
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,350
I can't ask her to change her job, either.

63
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,590
You like Da Jeong that much?

64
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,580
In Woo doesn't have a good eye for women.

65
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,260
It is hard to find a girl like her.

66
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,640
Is that kind of household okay?

67
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,000
Her single mother isn't living comfortably either.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
Hey, you...

69
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,560
You don't even have that kind of a single mother.

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,420
Are you becoming like Sin Ae?

71
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,840
Why are you looking at households?

72
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,210
Da Jeong!

73
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,020
Mom!

74
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,260
I'm taller than you. If you are tired,

75
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,260
lean on me.

76
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,010
Han Song Jeong, why did you do that?

77
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,800
If you lie next time, I'm not leaving you alone.

78
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,660
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,820
It's not your fault.

80
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,650
Let's tell Unni and Da In.

81
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,890
I will tell them. Give me just one day.

82
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,660
Just one day.

83
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,430
Writer Han, do you really have no eye for men?

84
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,310
From now on, meet someone after I allow it.

85
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,270
When did you grow up so much?

86
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,710
You are the same.

87
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,230
You are still pretty.

88
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,070
Let's go home. I'm hungry.

89
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,760
I'm hungry. Let's go, Mom!

90
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,760
Where are you? Are you drinking?

91
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,540
How can a woman drink at this hour? I will come and get you. Where are you?

92
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,110
Da In, age doesn't matter.

93
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,020
Promise me to wait six months.

94
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,740
That's not right. How can she wait six months?

95
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,330
I understand you.

96
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,390
But a woman alone shouldn't drink this late.

97
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,100
She is with Hee Joo.

98
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,700
Hee Joo?

99
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,430
Are you with Hee Joo...?

100
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,320
Hey, Han Da In, where are you? I told you not to see Hee Joo.

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,400
Put him on the phone.

102
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,070
This kid, you are a man, a man! Tell her!

103
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,640
Tell me where you are!

104
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,740
What? Little kid? Hey!

105
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,430
Yes. Little. Kid!

106
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,930
You can't come in here even if I tell you where it is.

107
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,610
Minors are not allowed in here.

108
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,910
That's right. I'm going to date Hee Joo. Why?

109
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,290
I hope your heart bursts.

110
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,430
Why are you being mean to the kid?

111
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,170
It's a punishment for lying to me.

112
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,850
Perhaps, you like Yoo Ji Ho?

113
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,480
Are you crazy? A high school student.

114
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
Hey, I like old guys.

115
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,740
I want someone cuddly as a father, who can forgive me no matter what I do.

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,530
Just drink and stop talking nonsense.

117
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,000
Da In,

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,060
can I board in your house?

119
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,250
-What? 
-I think I have to move out of the house I'm living in right now.

120
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,530
It will be for a short time, before I go to the military.

121
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,740
-Professor Kang is doing it, too. 
-He left.

122
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,390
And we have to move soon.

123
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,790
To where?

124
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,080
I don't know. If I talk about that, I'll get even more upset.

125
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,290
Drink, drink. Quickly.

126
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,150
I thought that he would call me again, but he isn't.

127
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,460
He has no perseverance.

128
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,040
You, if Ji Ho calls you, tell him that we're dating.

129
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,970
Okay?

130
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,540
-Come here, come here. 
-Let me go! She said that she is with Hee Joo!

131
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,810
You shouldn't call her.

132
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,510
Hey, that's why you won't do.

133
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,110
You have to end it right now for Da In to become impatient.

134
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,630
If you call her again, you are out.

135
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,650
Hyung, what should I do then?

136
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,560
Doctor Seo is too busy nowadays.

137
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Look... The thing is,

138
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,320
women are-
 - Does your girlfriend listen to you well?

139
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
Come here, come here.

140
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,520
Come here! This is why you won't do. This is why...

141
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,590
Yeah, when I say something to my girlfriend, she listens to me right away. What are you going do?

142
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,800
Softly, softly!

143
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,050
<i>Can you accept him just as a brother?</i>

144
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,830
In Woo... 
 - Aigoo, you...

145
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,870
Sit down.
 - Sit down quickly.

146
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,610
What about Jae Woo?

147
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,720
He went to bed early last night.

148
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,460
Then..

149
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,280
- Why are you dressed already? 
 - Are you going somewhere?

150
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,710
Yes. I have to leave early because I have a lot of work.

151
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,710
Even so... What time is it now?

152
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,750
Well, you and Grandfather go to work every day this early.

153
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,490
Jeez, this is so tiring. What should I do? Sit down.

154
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,840
- Eat at least a spoonful before you go.
 - It's alright.

155
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,100
- I'll be going. 
 - Oh my...

156
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,770
Hey, your stomach is going to get upset so eat something when you have time.

157
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,060
- Yes, I'll do that. 
 - Aigoo...

158
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,580
His company should give him a special award.

159
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,080
Da Jeong.

160
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,520
Pardon?

161
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,630
Why aren't you saying hello when you see your brother?

162
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,310
Work hard.

163
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,210
What did my brother say? "Oppa"?

164
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,580
Something happened between the two of you, right?

165
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,300
It's 4 AM again. I'm going to go crazy.

166
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,210
Aigoo, how long is it going to be like this?

167
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,760
Prepare the breakfast and send it up.

168
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,950
<i>It was ordered 30 minutes ago so it was sent up already.</i>

169
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,590
I did?

170
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,750
When did you get here?

171
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,800
Has it been 30 minutes?

172
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Uncle, your introversion must still be bothering you.

173
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,690
Did something happen?

174
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,720
There is always a lot of work...

175
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,990
I lied saying I have to go to work.

176
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,610
I'm going to try telling some lies now.

177
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,200
They were all fooled. It was fun.

178
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,130
What's the reason for the change?

179
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,650
You have a lot of younger sisters around you, don't you?

180
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,330
Hey... Where do I have any younger sisters, punk?

181
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,180
You know you have a lot of women around you who call you "oppa".

182
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,780
Why do women do that?

183
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,460
- Continue talking... 
 - Jeong Da Jeong asked me to act like her brother.

184
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,270
A little more...

185
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,900
She says she wants to see me for a long time. So...

186
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,560
Exactly...

187
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,840
She's trying to organize your relationship.

188
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,350
In any case, the women of that house are all very strong.

189
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,840
They are having a hard time because of the problem with the father.

190
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,120
Then she should discuss it and lean on you.

191
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
Han Song Jeong thinks she is a lone towering pine tree or something.

192
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,970
She is always trying to overcome things by herself.

193
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,330
I'm talking about Jeong Da Jeong.

194
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm saying this because the mother and daughter are both the same.

195
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,890
Look at Writer Han! She doesn't even call me once even after that incident happened.

196
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,680
Just thinking about it makes me angry!

197
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,870
This is dangerous...
 - What is?

198
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,310
I started like that with Jeong Da Jeong.

199
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,020
Uncle... No way...

200
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,760
Jeez, no, no. I'm not!

201
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,190
It's because I feel sorry for her. Because I feel pity!

202
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,400
Dad said to differentiate between love and compassion.

203
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,400
You're no help.

204
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,160
This little punk.

205
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,850
Jeez, I'm not!

206
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,230
It isn't!

207
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,780
Hey, dearie! When did you get here?

208
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,360
There are few points to better explain the relationship between the model and the product but

209
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,280
I don't think it's too bad for first draft.

210
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,040
I came early to to show off the work that I already did before.

211
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,910
Since we should just check out the initial layout,

212
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,870
I'll ask them to proceed when we settle the layout.

213
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,090
I see that dating makes you full of passion.

214
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,460
Should I call Jeong Da Jeong in order to raise your energy level more?

215
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,130
Here. These are samples; I got one for you and Jung Da Jeong.

216
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,330
And this is makeup.

217
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,400
Since Flying Squirrel has become the face of our company, she should take care (of her face).

218
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,810
I think she will like it.

219
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,720
I'll deliver them to her.

220
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
What's the matter?

221
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,150
Since you are taking care of all of the days work at a top speed,

222
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,470
let's call Jeong Da Jeong and tell her she should buy us some food today.

223
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,580
Today is the day she gets $5000 for the photo shoot.

224
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,630
She's busy.

225
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,770
She says she is learning how to make rice cake.

226
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,310
Rice cake?

227
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,870
You guys came early, I see.

228
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,070
Oppa has to work so let's delay the move. I'll see you later.

229
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,460
Eun Woo, did you get a girlfriend?

230
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,660
Oh, it's my little sister.

231
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,840
I was thinking... If somebody else heard you, they would think you have a girlfriend.

232
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,480
Everybody around me misunderstands, just like you.

233
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,520
Aigoo, I'm envious because my brother is my enemy.

234
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,490
Every time he sees me, he always asks me for money.

235
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,230
My brother does that ,too. He makes go on errands and does nothing at home.

236
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,340
When we were young, I used to wrestle and get head locked.

237
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,740
I almost got my arm broken.

238
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,820
He does those things with his younger sister?

239
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,500
Of course!

240
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,890
Everybody is the same, whether it's a younger girl or a guy.

241
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,090
Why are you messing up the reality?

242
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,470
Younger sister is better because you can watch movie or travel together.

243
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,350
You travel (with younger sister)?

244
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,010
You're showing that you don't have a girl. You watch when you get a girl.

245
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,020
Is that so?

246
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,780
Travel?

247
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,790
<i>Wow, it must taste good.</i>

248
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,360
Oh, yes.

249
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,720
The healthy sticky rice cake.

250
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,430
Yes. Yes. Thirty of them. I'll put the order in.

251
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,580
Why? Are you expecting a call?

252
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,120
Yes?

253
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,080
No.

254
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,890
President, I got an order

255
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,610
but I can't understand it because they want me to take out this and that.

256
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,900
Wow. You still can't take orders properly?

257
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,210
You guys take care of this.

258
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,740
Look here, Da Jeong.

259
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,760
Yes.

260
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,100
Did the things go well when you met your father?

261
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,140
Yes.

262
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,650
Ahjusshi, I have a favor to ask you.

263
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,750
Even if my father comes around again, please don't give him any money.

264
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,090
Oh, okay.

265
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,100
Your heart was burdened because of that I see.

266
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,440
Hey, be careful.

267
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,060
I used to get hurt in the past. Here, wear this.

268
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,740
Okay.

269
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,500
When these things come out, they are soft.

270
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,730
But when they harden, their edges get sharp.

271
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,700
Jae Woo and Jae In use to use these to have sword fights.

272
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,560
Oh, by the say, my mother is going to tell Unni and Da In everything soon.

273
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm trying to convince myself that this is better.

274
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,020
It's easier since I am wearing this.

275
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,930
Oh, is that so?

276
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,020
Mom.

277
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,250
She drank with Hee Joo yesterday.

278
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,880
She must be upset because of Ji Hoo.

279
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,980
Do you need to go now?

280
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,620
I can go after lunch. Do you have something for me to do?

281
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,780
There's a boarder again in Dr. Kang's room.

282
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,470
Mom!

283
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,020
He's a dentist.
He has a son who is in middle school.

284
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,870
Huh?

285
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm not giving my permission.
I will be observing again.

286
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,350
Mom!

287
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,670
Da Ae, let's talk.

288
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,560
Yeah.

289
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,530
Mom, what is it?

290
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,320
I... deceived you guys.

291
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,680
But listen and forgive me.

292
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,490
Your father... is alive.

293
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,060
Da Jeong met him yesterday.

294
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,610
She said she saw someone similar, it turns out she's right.

295
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,620
Somehow she recognized him, I guess.

296
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,550
You knew he was alive?

297
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,290
It doesn't matter.

298
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,170
Even if he is alive, he's already dead to us.

299
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,960
Da Ae.

300
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,670
Da Jeong and I remember.
You did nothing wrong.

301
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,210
Don't be sorry towards us.

302
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,450
There was nothing I could do for you back when I was young,

303
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,120
but we will protect you now.

304
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,470
If you find it hard to tell Da In, should I tell her?

305
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,790
No, I will be the one.

306
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,410
I will tell her.

307
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,420
It's alright, Mom.

308
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,760
Da In will also understand.

309
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,920
Mom.

310
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,470
Stop crying.

311
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,040
Han Song Jeong.

312
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,470
You think I won't be able to come if you tell me to?

313
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,760
I should settle my 10,000 Won.

314
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,340
Okay. For me, it's fight to the end. Fight to the end.

315
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,210
Grandma! Is your leg okay?

316
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,560
Yeah, it's gotten better with your heat treatment.

317
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,930
But doing this... it's so hard, I thought I would die while trying.

318
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,810
I will find an easier one next time.

319
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,160
I will be going.

320
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,490
You're better than my daughter.

321
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,250
Are you Da Ae?

322
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,100
I saw Da In and Da Jeong.

323
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,820
You are Da Ae, right?

324
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,890
Who are you?

325
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,750
Don't you recognize me?

326
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,860
Who are you?

327
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,750
Da Jeong even recognizes me, how can the eldest not?

328
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,800
I... am your father.

329
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,510
My father already died.

330
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,000
What?

331
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,800
Why not even one...

332
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,860
You brat!

333
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,410
Why are you doing this to me?

334
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,460
Did your Mom ask you not to recognize me?

335
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,750
How could she change so much.

336
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,060
In the 20 years I haven't seen her she's become so tough.

337
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,610
I don't know who you are but don't curse my mom!

338
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,700
This brat...

339
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,340
HEY!

340
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,770
I'm not a bit scared even if you shout at me.

341
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,890
JEONG DA AE!

342
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,770
Huh? Da Ae?

343
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,900
Wait... that person.
Isn't that the one who said he was connected with their mother?

344
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,120
WHO ON EARTH ARE YOU TO BE CALLING MY NAME?

345
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,610
Seriously.

346
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,250
Hey,

347
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,010
aren't you being too mean towards me?

348
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,210
Fine, let's say I haven't done my role as your father,

349
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,560
but I'm still your father.

350
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,010
How could you, so rude!

351
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,040
Father?

352
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,220
No... Da Ae, what is he talking about?

353
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,930
Nothing, Grandma.
Go inside.

354
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,230
No... What do you mean "father?"
Did you drink in the middle of the day?

355
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,940
You probably are not in your right mind.

356
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,920
Seriously, I'm going crazy.

357
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,630
Hey! Tell her properly!

358
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,310
Grandma, go inside.
It's alright.

359
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,150
Hey! Tell your mother to come out!

360
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,070
Da Ae.

361
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,920
Dr. Kang.

362
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,790
What's wrong?
- Eun Chan, welcome.

363
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,790
Who is he? 
Did something happen?

364
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,390
Doctor.

365
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,430
Da Ae, did you get married?

366
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,910
You had a child this big already?

367
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,970
Doctor, please chase that person out.

368
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,610
What?

369
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,290
Seriously, okay.

370
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,690
Okay.

371
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,560
Dr. Kang.

372
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,560
That person is strange.

373
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,290
Oh my! He's heading to the house.

374
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,180
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

375
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,310
Doctor.
- Look here!

376
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,790
Who are you?

377
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,350
I'm Da Ae's father.

378
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,400
Leave.

379
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,130
I said I'm her father.
- I SAID LEAVE!

380
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,220
All sorts of things are happening.

381
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,620
Hey, Sin Ae!

382
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,080
Hey! Hey!

383
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,470
Hey! There's a crazy person in front of the house.

384
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,820
Crazy person?

385
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,740
Yeah. I don't know if he's drank in the middle of the day

386
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,920
but he's saying that he's the neighbor's father.

387
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,720
What is that again?

388
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,210
They said a crazy person stopped by the the rice cake shop, too.

389
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,170
The rice cake shop, too?

390
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,540
I don't know. I don't know.

391
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,820
They said there was a crazy person eating all the rice cakes.

392
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,240
No... hey... that...

393
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,900
It's alright since Dr. Kang chased that person out.

394
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,530
Hey, the eldest daughter and Prof. Kang

395
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,320
I think there's something.

396
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,270
Prof. Kang?

397
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,580
He has a child.

398
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,440
That's why. It's big trouble if both of them like each other.

399
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,400
Mom, what nonsense are you saying?

400
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm telling you I'm right!

401
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,430
Did you drink in the middle of the day?

402
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,140
Where is the crazy person?

403
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,970
How is it? Do you like it?

404
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,600
It's nice.

405
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,300



406
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:42,350
If you use it here around your ankle, you won't have to worry about the rice cake room (temperature).

407
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,540
You must be having a hard time going to work since dawn

408
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,670
and because of this you dropped by?

409
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,850
I stopped by after going out for work.

410
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,520
Da Jeong.
- Yes?

411
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,710
Team Leader also has something for you.

412
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,490
There's cosmetics too, it's in the car so I will give it to you at home.

413
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,820
Yes.

414
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,260
Father, we were scolded for playing with those long rice cakes, right?

415
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,110
That's right.

416
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,930
Well, that...

417
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,580
In Woo was worse.

418
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,980
What do you call that... he wanted to use it for sword fights.

419
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,890
He would take the entire container and the whole family would be running around searching for him.

420
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,480
Yes.

421
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,350
Da Jeong, your oppas played around like that.

422
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,670
Honey! Honey, honey!

423
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,210
What's the matter?

424
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,630
I just have something to ask him.

425
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,560
What are you doing here?

426
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,980
I dropped by while I was out for work.

427
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,490
Grandpa, would you be able to adjust it by yourself?

428
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,160
It's not a problem, it's easy.

429
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,330
Honey, the crazy person appeared at home.

430
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,730
He was making a fuss saying that he's Da Ae's father.

431
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,240
What?

432
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,580
What are you whispering about?

433
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,390
Huh? Nothing.

434
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,810
Mom saw, Prof. Kang chased him out.

435
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,700
I will go out for a while.

436
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,530
Grandpa, I will be going too.

437
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,290
Okay.

438
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,160
I will use it well.

439
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,050
Da Jeong, Oppa will drop you off on the way.

440
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,790
Oppa?

441
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,060
Come out.

442
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,940
Get in.
- No.

443
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,830
If I run, it won't take long.

444
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,770
What's wrong with you?
 - Pardon?

445
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,750
You asked me to be an oppa so I did, but why are you so cautious?

446
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,640
You didn't want to (be cautious), isn't that why you asked me to be your oppa?

447
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,620
I will be late as well.
Let's go.

448
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,570
Do you like it?

449
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,890
What?

450
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,000
Do you like making rice cakes now that you've tried?

451
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,600
Yes.
- If you have any favors to ask regarding your dad, ask.

452
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,040
I couldn't hit the father of the woman that I like.

453
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,270
I couldn't give money, either, but it's better since I'm your oppa.

454
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,550
Now I can do it all.

455
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,130
Seo Jae Woo.

456
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,370
You said I'm your oppa?

457
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,150
I can do it, but isn't it that you can't be my younger sister?

458
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,300
I didn't ask you to be my oppa so that you can do this.

459
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,290
An oppa can watch movies together, give allowance, and even go on vacations

460
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,820
and help when the dongsaeng (younger sibling) is having a hard time, they say.

461
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,830
If you need money, tell me.
If you want to go on a vacation, let's go too.

462
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,090
What's wrong with you?
You already know why I said that.

463
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,880
I don't know.

464
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,670
Why? Did my father tell you not to date me?

465
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,970
I guess he didn't know I would be able to see you longer like this.

466
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,530
Please let me off.
We're almost there, wait.

467
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,140
You can go.

468
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,310
♬ <i>Even one step is hard for me..</i>♬

469
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:48,010
♬ <i>Just that I can see you, my heart is okay.</i>♬

470
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,170
Eun Chan.

471
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,160
How did you come?
- Together with my dad.

472
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,990
Are you back?

473
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,410
I think so.

474
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,040
We're busy moving that I don't have time for school.

475
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Well done.

476
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,730
Even if he's alive, to my children, they do not have a father.

477
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,640
Can you be understanding of that?

478
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,420
Yes.

479
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,150
While I was gone, something like that happened.

480
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,020
Mom.

481
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,950
Dr. Kang.
- Have you been well?

482
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,090
Yes.

483
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,860
Now, I just need to tell Da In. 
I already told them.

484
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,900
Unni, did you meet him?

485
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,910
Yeah, for a moment outside the house.

486
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,550
You're not worried about me, right?
I'm alright.

487
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,100
Yeah.

488
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,350
If you need anything, please tell me anytime.

489
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,150
While I'm here, I will protect you.

490
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,100
I feel assured.

491
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,710
Mom, it would be better if you tell Da In faster before she finds out.

492
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,720
I should.

493
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,990
But telling Da In is the hardest.

494
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,000
Dr. Kang!

495
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,050
Have you been well?

496
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,550
He's back.

497
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,550
If so, why did you leave?

498
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,740
Anyway, welcome!
Thank you for the furniture.

499
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,670
It's a relief that you like it.

500
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,970
But what were you all doing leaving me out?

501
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,740
You weren't talking behind my back, right?

502
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,080
We do it even if it's not behind your back, you know?

503
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,520
Mom, she's going around drinking.
She needs to be scolded.

504
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,220
That's right.
Da In, do you have time today?

505
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,990
I'm busy because I have to help the professor. Why?

506
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,080
Okay then, come home early after you're done.

507
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,130
What's wrong with all of you?
Is today a special day?

508
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,800
Could it be...

509
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,600
a consolation party for me because of the Ji Hoo incident?

510
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,090
Regarding Jeong In Seong's family, his wife died of an illness two months ago

511
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:31,280
and now he is living with his 21 year old son, Jeong Hee Joo.

512
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,260
He has a son?

513
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,740
Yes.
He's the same age as Han Song Jeong's youngest daughter.

514
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,080
It seems like the youngest daughter was born after the divorce.

515
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,640
He abandoned a woman who was pregnant?

516
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,330
He's not human then.

517
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,170
Where is that bastard?

518
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,240
In one hour, you have meeting with the city director regarding Young World Tower construction.

519
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,580
I'm asking, where is he?

520
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,390
I took 20,000 Won but had to give up 10,000 Won.

521
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:13,930
I have to settle the matter with that guy from the hotel.

522
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,370
Why isn't he coming out?

523
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,160
Should I go in?

524
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,030
Go... don't...

525
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,100
Go... hide!

526
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,470
Hey, if that crazy person comes, call me right away.

527
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,090
Don't worry.

528
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,570
The men in our family backs off so they won't do.

529
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,860
I need to be here.
Just wait til I catch him, I'm not going to let him off the hook.

530
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,810
She goes...

531
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,950
Comes...
- Hey, should I just wait here?

532
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,070
I feel like he's going to come today.

533
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,950
Just go, I can also throw a punch.

534
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,640
Oh, look.

535
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,210
Why are they in such a fuss to catch me?

536
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,740
Is it yummy?

537
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,600
I only ate one.

538
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,820
It's alright if you eat it all.

539
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,300
Where did you go?
- In our house.

540
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,850
You have a house but why are you living here?

541
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,630
It's better to live together than just being with my dad.

542
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,670
That's right.

543
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,180
It's been so long since we've seen you, do you have something you would like to eat?

544
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,080
Soybean paste stew.
You like soybean paste stew?

545
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,350
My dad does.
- So filial.

546
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,850
Everyone is inside, right?

547
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,800
Let's go inside.

548
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,210
My legs.
- Are you alright?

549
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,360
My legs won't listen to me.

550
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,270
You should listen well.

551
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,140
Let's go. Let's go.

552
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,700
I was on my way to bring this.

553
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,930
Let's eat kalguksoo (knife noodles) together tonight.

554
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,040
Yes.

555
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,400
But Da Jeong is home so you should tell her to take it with her.

556
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,580
You have to take out the clothes that needs laundering.

557
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,430
Yes.

558
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,580
You're here.

559
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,070
Grandma is here.

560
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,720
That... please bring this.

561
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,020
Tell them to come home early after work, we'll be eating kalguksoo together.

562
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,670
Yes.

563
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,510
You're going out like that?

564
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,480
Hey, go and change your skirt.

565
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,840
I'm wearing shorts.
Grandma, this is also in style.

566
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,160
I will be going.

567
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,600
Hey! Come home early!

568
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,410
Grandma, I'll enjoy the food. 
I'm going.

569
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,120
That... give me a cup of water.

570
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,220
You need to manage your daughters well.

571
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,740
Yes.

572
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,770
Do you have something to tell me?

573
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,090
Pardon?

574
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:22,790
No... your eldest daughter and the professor have something going on, right?

575
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,630
Dr. Kang says he likes my daughter.

576
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:35,760
No! No! No matter how nice a person can be, how can she raise someone else's child?

577
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,800
That's why I'm opposing them.

578
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,510
But, my children's business are not going the way I want.

579
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,720
Should I step in?

580
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,930
No. I'm just keeping an eye on them.

581
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,520
Would you want to keep an eye on them with me?

582
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,110
I think elders see it better.

583
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,770
There's nothing to watch.

584
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,460
Is there something?
- No.

585
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,310
What brings you here?

586
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:28,680
It's my brother's store.
What business do you have here?

587
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,260
Well... I... just some rice cakes...

588
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,330
Isn't it about time for you to be looking for your settlement money?

589
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:43,110
I'm going to go and get it now.

590
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,690
From my brother?

591
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,120
It's the next door's uncle.
- Da In.

592
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,260
Don't loiter around this area.

593
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,320
Well... is this your...

594
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,470
It's not like it's your street.

595
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,210
Do you think I don't know your intentions?

596
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,750
Okay... here.

597
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,230
Why do you live like this?

598
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,470
You're still young (and able), you should work instead.

599
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,420
It would be better if you begged for a position to work in instead?!

600
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,920
Uncle is really cool.

601
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,400
That person...
- Let's go.

602
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,700
Why are you grabbingme?
- Let's go.

603
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,440
Unni!
 - Let's go.

604
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,900
Da Jeong.

605
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,490
Go. Don't let the kids see this side of yours.

606
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,390
Leave.

607
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,570
What's wrong with you?
Let go.

608
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,870
Then.

609
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,950
Seriously, why are you like that? You're just strong for no reason.

610
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,850
Uncle.

611
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,530
Hello.

612
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,310
Right.

613
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,430
Do you know that person?
He's strange, right?

614
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,560
Oh... where are you going?
Should I give you a ride?

615
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,510
Really? I'm going to school.

616
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,330
That's great then.
Let's go.

617
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,460
Thank you.

618
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,700
So cool.

619
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,830
Jeong Da Jeong.

620
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,440
It's alright. Go and work.

621
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,390
Why are you not getting married?

622
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,800
There's not one man who wants marriage.

623
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,700
The moment a man gets married, love cools.

624
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,780
Why do you think that way?

625
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,840
There are a lot of people like Grandpa and Grandma who live very long while loving each other.

626
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,810
My parents didn't live like that.

627
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:15,310
Well... my father passed away so soon, my mom's the pitiful one.

628
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,560
I think marriage is hard.

629
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,680
Do you have a boyfriend?

630
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,450
Don't even talk about it.

631
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,650
He deceived me.
I just found out...

632
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,920
he's a high schooler.

633
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,900
Wow!

634
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,050
Where is that punk?
We need to catch him.

635
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,830
It's nice even just hearing it.

636
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,740
I would be nice to have a father like you.

637
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,160
Do it, I think you will be an awesome father.

638
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,070
Marriage... I won't do it.

639
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,660
Yes.
- I will do it.

640
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,900
Today he is going on a date with his sister.

641
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,580
What's with a younger sister? Hurry up and meet a woman.

642
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,380
Hello.

643
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,660
I came to see Chief Seo Jae Woo.

644
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,560
Who?

645
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,470
Check it well.

646
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,740
Chief Seo, who am I?

647
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,370
He's my brother.

648
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,110
I'm Seo In Woo.

649
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,040
Your brother is so cute. He's totally different from his brother.

650
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,110
I'm a whole lot better.

651
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,830
Aigoo... So you work in this place.

652
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
What's the matter?

653
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,940
What do you think about it?

654
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,810
<i>Samjin Capitol June Lease funds in the amount of 1,280,000 Won, could not be withdrawn due to insufficient funds.</i>

655
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,840
It wasn't your sunbae's car?

656
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,140
I came to make this deal.

657
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,780
Before I spill out that you and Jeong Da Jeong are secretly dating you should offer a bribe.

658
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,080
Would you say it instead?
- Hyung.

659
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,550
She found out about her father.
She asked me to be her oppa.

660
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,980
Jeong Da Jeong is going too fast... she's asking you to get married.

661
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,900
An oppa becomes a darling, and then becomes a honey... that's the order of dating.

662
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,070
It's too fast for marriage.

663
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,060
Don't joke around, it's serious.

664
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,810
Hyung, at times like this especially you should think of it simply.

665
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,340
When the other party is serious, if you were to come out serious as well,

666
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,790
then it's the end. Bye, bye (in chinese).

667
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,910
That's why I'm being her oppa.

668
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:02,290
Wait. Then we're in the same boat.

669
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,790
I'll be going first.

670
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,950
Where are you going?
- Fair play!

671
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,650
What fair play?

672
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,230
I was wondering where you went.

673
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,860
You're here.
- You're not going to make dinner?

674
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,610
Welcome.

675
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,460
We're doing it. When it's so hot, what's the use in preparing dinner at both houses?

676
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,070
Hey, since we're cooking Chicken Kalgooksoo (Hand Cut Noodles) here, let's just eat here.

677
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,490
Aigoo, why are you like this?

678
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,170
I heard you went on a trip Professor Kang. I guess you had a good time.

679
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,810
Your face is so bright!

680
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,670
Is that so?

681
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,660
Aigoo. My mom is so excited without lifting a hand.

682
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,070
With two assistants.

683
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,730
The chef is very picky.

684
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:57,000
You should knead the dough properly, it'll get separated.

685
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,160
Just cut it well, they're too thin.

686
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,230
They're too thin.

687
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,310
Da Ae.
 - Hey!

688
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:13,310
Do I have to tell you with words? Massage my shoulders.

689
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,050
Oh... okay.

690
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,900
Is it refreshing, Mom?

691
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,810
Yeah. It's really refreshing.

692
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:24,030
Dr. Kang.

693
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,420
I haven't given my permission yet. You should be careful in front of the elders.

694
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,020
Yes.

695
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,610
We'd better make the fresh (unripe) Kimchee at least, right?

696
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,700
Let's finish things up. They said that they're making Kalgooksoo (Hand Cut Noodles) tonight.

697
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,940
Yes.

698
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,410
Grandpa, I'm here.

699
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,160
I'm back.
- Both of you are coming in together.

700
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,860
I'm so lonely so we will be going together from now on.

701
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,820
Da Jeong, Oppa came and you're not saying your greetings.

702
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,200
Did you come?

703
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,800
Look at her. She has lost all her energy. Shouldn't you scold her?

704
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,820
She's my sister.

705
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,950
Da Jeong, I will give you allowance so say hello nicely.

706
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,250
Me too, allowance.

707
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,570
Nevermind.

708
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,210
Hey, both of you should come often.

709
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,120
I feel good with us gathering here.

710
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,100
Is this functioning well?

711
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,180
It works well.

712
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,610
Should I help you?

713
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,000
I... I'm done.

714
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,670
There are a lot of orders these days, aren't there? Which ddeok (rice cake) is the most popular?

715
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,150
These days...that's right,

716
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,610
electric...and some other

717
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,240
The family is over there, right?

718
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,090
Come over to Jae Woo's house for a bit.

719
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,360
I'm good, right?

720
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,830
That... if I got there... it's a bit...

721
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:05,080
Then come out.

722
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,640
I will be standing by the gate.

723
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,720
I was intending to come and see you soon.

724
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,440
Then... should I have waited until you came?

725
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,360
You should have told the kids.

726
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,750
Until when are you going to hide it?

727
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,450
You must be busy,

728
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,870
but you are concerned about me.

729
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,310
Now, I will handle my own problems.

730
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,740
I lived while working hard.

731
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,760
But this is all I amount to.

732
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:02,560
The same with Min Sik oppa and Chairman Nam Gong Yeong too...

733
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,690
Thank you.

734
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,070
I told you not to pretend like a woman.

735
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,160
I have never thought of that even once.

736
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,100
Just...

737
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:26,060
Just... I'm embarrassed and thankful, that's all.

738
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,560
I'm also thankful.

739
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,860
Pardon?
- You should have just accepted when I said I would invest.

740
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,940
Then things wouldn't have become this noisy.

741
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:48,200
The problem about Jeong In Seong, whatever it takes, believe in me this once.

742
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:54,390
For living while working so hard,

743
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,180
it's my gift.

744
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:14,500
I was going to tell him just this one thing.

745
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,350
Do you think you know me?

746
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:21,550
In the past, I used to do very well. Why are you being like this?

747
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,760
You know, I got...

748
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:34,390
humiliated in front of my children.

749
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,590
Say something.

750
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,700
Hee Joo's mother,

751
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,810
I turned out like this because of you.

752
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,430
Why did you like me so much?

753
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,890
Why did you make me this way?

754
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:01,120
Aigoo, stop with the nonsense bullcrap and get a hold of your self.

755
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,860
That young man only came today and settled your tab here.

756
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,540
That kid is my son.

757
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,780
Besides him, I have three other daughters.

758
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,450
While you don't even know well.

759
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:20,190
Aigoo, drink according to your limit!

760
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,150
Ahumma!
--Aigoo, really!

761
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,020
I'm already dead so I don't get drunk!

762
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,540
Han Song Jeong,

763
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,420
you're a bad woman.

764
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,650
I can do it by myself. I'm still strong.

765
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,830
Oh, I'll do it.

766
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,430
Love is timing. Your timing is amazing.

767
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,760
You're going to set your sights on the gap when Ji Hoo is not here.

768
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,860
Is that so?

769
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,010
It's not like that. Da In is like a younger sister to me.

770
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,670
Younger sister?

771
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,200
There are lot of younger sisters here around here. Isn't that so, younger sister?

772
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,500
Please wipe it, oppa.

773
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,870
The thing I will..

774
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,930
I'll put these in your room.

775
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,880
Uh, men aren't allowed up there. Hey...

776
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,520
Professor Kang, we're not a men but oppas.

777
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,510
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Extend the legs.</i>

778
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,840
Is it because it's a girl's room? It's charming and nice.

779
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,300
Why are you doing this?

780
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,820
What?
--Seo Jae Woo.

781
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:38,180
There you go again. What is this with Seo Jae Woo? Do you want me to be your big brother or what?

782
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,350
You doing this is bothering me.

783
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,510
You said we should do this.

784
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,650
Come down.

785
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,960
Seo Jae Woo.

786
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,570
Don't take it lightly.

787
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,110
Be your big brother? Think carefully.

788
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,990
Aigoo, this is refreshing and nice.

789
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,840
Do you know how much work it takes to make this even if it doesn't seem so?

790
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,180
I wanted to make you something delicious,

791
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,610
but the Professor and Da Ae did it all.

792
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,400
Aigoo, hey.

793
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,640
You're different that you appear on the outside.

794
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,490
When I first saw you, do you know that I was afraid of you?

795
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,720
Back then, the situation was a bit...

796
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,240
Who are you?

797
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,720
I am Jung Hee Joo, I'm Da In's friend.

798
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:44,530
He can't fit in here. If he does..

799
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,820
You look much like your father.

800
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,580
I don't think so...

801
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,700
Kang Eun Chan.

802
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,340
No, Eun Chan, you're cute. Don't lose your confidence.

803
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,250
I like him better.

804
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,720
Elder, that's kind of harsh...

805
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,190
Anyone for more portions?

806
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:15,630
Give oppa some more.

807
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,230
Take good care of your younger sister. It's what an oppa's suppose to do.

808
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,500
I was going to.

809
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,580
Our company's employee says that he sees movies and goes on trips with his sister.

810
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,910
Not trips!
So what, when she's a younger sister?

811
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,360
Da Jeong helps with the rice cake shop work very well and she's praiseworthy.

812
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,460
Oppa will show you a movie this weekend. Let's go.

813
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:48,220
You're really liking saying that 'Oppa, Oppa'... Hey, Jae Woo, why are you doing that?!

814
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,820
What am I doing?
Why should you... watch a movie... with Do Jeong?!

815
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,030
Aigoo, that's true. Hotel CEO, do you know?

816
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,130
Our Jae Woo has a girlfriend now.
Wow?

817
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,950
Is that right?

818
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,360
I'm awfully curious who Jae Woo's girlfriend is.

819
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,580
Me too, me too.

820
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,880
So what's the point of having one? He should show her to us.

821
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,130
On this kind of day you should call her.

822
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,640
Da Jeong!

823
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,090
I asked you to pour me more. What are you doing?

824
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,500
Thank you.

825
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,420
Shall we give you more?

826
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,150
Jae Woo Oppa's a little weird.

827
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,980
I know, right?

828
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,950
Father, should I give you a glass of Makgeolli (rice wine)?

829
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,630
That'd be nice.

830
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,100
Me too!

831
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,390
Oh, but...Writer Han can't.

832
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,920
Her drunken habits...

833
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:03,360
In Woo, just a moment.

834
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,130
Here it is.

835
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,180
Did Jae Woo say anything to you?

836
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,600
What does that mean?

837
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,750
Hey, you'll know that Da Jeong and Jae Woo are dating.

838
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,220
You know too, Father?

839
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,230
Jae Woo, why's he like that?

840
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:30,510
I'm just trusting and telling you since it's you, Father,

841
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,760
but he said that Jeong Da Jeong asked him to be her Oppa.

842
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,620
Oppa?

843
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,620
<i>Is as an Oppa not okay?</i>

844
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,150
The words are just like that, she's saying they should break up.

845
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:54,130
Hyung was being watchful of Mom's notice and couldn't say anything and one-sidedly he got kicked to the curb.

846
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,040
Are you really also against the two of them meeting?

847
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:07,220
Mom, Poop Grandma, even Father. There's no worse luck.

848
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,980
It makes sense that Hyung is going crazy.

849
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,180
Are you eating too much since your mood is good?

850
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,130
It's delicious.

851
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:18,100
Hey, this fresh kimchee (unripened) is delicious also.

852
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,380
Da Jeong, eat some.

853
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,050
This looks nice.

854
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:29,330
Aiyoo, it must be nice that Oppa's looking out for you.

855
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,530
Yes.

856
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:36,640
Aiyoo, really. My Puppy is doing things that he never in his life used to do.

857
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,320
I have to keep doing it, when I'm her Oppa.

858
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,730
Da Jeong, give Oppa some water.

859
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:56,650
<i>I'm done eating.</i>

860
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,310
Thank you. Da Jeong, eat a lot.

861
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,050
I'm going crazy.

862
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,260
Seo Jae Woo.

863
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,410
Even like this do you still want me to be your Oppa?

864
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,790
Jae Woo.

865
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,360
<i>Han Song Jeong!</i>

866
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,150
What's this?
 - What's that?

867
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:41,710
<i>Come out Han Song Jeong!</i>

868
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:45,110
Where is that coming from?
<i> - I'm telling you to come out!</i>

869
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:52,730
<i>Han Song Jeong, come out!</i>

870
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,890
Seo Jae Woo!

871
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,070
Jeong Da Jeong.

872
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Now what should we do?

873
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:12,300
♫ <i> When love has started, this moment I ran into you, </i>♫

<i>Just let them be!
They like each other so how could you stop them?</i>

879
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,570
<i>I'll request it of you like this. Does it make sense, my Jae Woo with Da Jeong?!</i>

880
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,730
<i>Don't you say that the children's dead father is alive,</i>

881
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:38,930
<i>What are you talking about right now?!</i>

882
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,690
<i>Father is alive? What is she saying?
- Da In.</i>

<i>Can't you like me? I will do well.</i>
