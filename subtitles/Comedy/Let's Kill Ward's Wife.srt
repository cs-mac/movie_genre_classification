1
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,704
Okay, everybody! Hello!

2
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,640
Hi!

3
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,875
Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:44,980
So this is a really big day for me.

5
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,985
I guess. Well, duh.
'Cause it's my only son's baptism.

6
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,459
I love paper.

7
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,731
I do. It's, like, my passion.

8
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:06,268
And I've always wanted
to own my own <i>papiere.</i>

9
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,904
Not that you care,
because I don't... You know what?

10
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,540
I don't tell people that,
because people steal ideas all the time.

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,911
It's happened to me numerous
occasions with... what?

12
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:16,311
What did you say?

13
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,514
- You just said something. What?
- I didn't say anything.

14
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,916
Yes, you did. You made,
like, a noise or something.

15
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:22,916
Whatever.

16
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,591
Great.

17
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:30,092
- God...
- You were saying?

18
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:34,063
I know what I'm saying! I know what
I'm saying. Just let me say it.

19
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,266
I had this whole thing prepared
about God and paper and love

20
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,039
and godparents, and it was all tied
in together. Now I can't do it now.

21
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,205
I can't do it now. So...

22
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:45,674
You know what? You can say something.

23
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:47,941
Ward!

24
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:51,144
- Say it.
- Okay. Okay.

25
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,080
I'll just plate the cake.

26
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,788
- We would like to thank...
- No, not "we," Ward.

27
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:02,158
I wanted to say something, and you
ruined it. You didn't let me say it,

28
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:06,560
so now it's on you. You can
fucking say something, you asshole.

29
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,438
Thank you all for coming.

30
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,843
- We've got cake!
- Right.

31
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:29,018
I just wanna smash her fucking face
right in that fucking cake.

32
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:32,287
I worked on that speech. I put my heart
into that speech, and you ruined it.

33
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,857
You gonna let her up?

34
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:37,791
- I wouldn't.
- Fuck her.

35
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,508
Are you sure it's not in your bag?

36
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:55,043
Yeah, honey, I'm sure.
You said you saw it in the bathroom?

37
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:58,480
I never said that. You're nervous.

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,919
No, I'm not... I'm not nervous, I'm excited.
I mean, it's Robin Peters, you know?

39
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,421
I don't even remember
the last thing she was in.

40
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,423
- How does she look these days?
- Well, here.

41
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,360
Pretty good.

42
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:22,471
Do you think she has implants?
Maybe I should get implants.

43
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:26,709
- Maybe her, not you.
- Well, it looks like it.

44
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,044
See if you can tell,
but don't be obvious.

45
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,444
Can you give me a break?

46
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,134
Babe, I checked there.

47
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:42,191
Well, thank you.

48
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,792
All right.

49
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:47,262
- I love you. I will see you later.
- I love you too.

50
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:50,899
Maybe we can do some loving tonight?

51
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:54,436
Yeah. Okay.

52
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,872
Lily, come on, honey. We gotta move.

53
00:03:56,972 --> 00:04:00,542
Hello? Y... Oh. Sorry. Hey.

54
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:05,380
Yeah, yeah. I got it all.
Got her lunch, her snack, got all her shit.

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,417
What? She can't hear me.
She's in the other room.

56
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,219
I'm right here.

57
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,456
She just rounded the corner.
We got it. We'll be there.

58
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:17,424
- Traitor.
- Potty mouth.

59
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,796
- Honey...
- Again!

60
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:25,701
Chicken wrap, all white,
no tomato, salsa... extra salsa.

61
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,569
On the side!

62
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,907
- Christ! On the side!
- On the side. I got it, babe.

63
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,543
Morning. Morning, Stacy.

64
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:37,140
Apparently I'm your number one neighbor.
You got a tough one there, my friend.

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,848
Well... Late start for you?

66
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,950
- Nah, I just forgot my shades.
- Oh, there you go.

67
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,887
You know, you got a brake
light out there, Ward.

68
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:47,767
- Really?
- Yep. Brake light is out.

69
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,625
I'm gonna need to see your
driver's license and registration.

70
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,695
Okay. I got... hold it.
Give me a second.

71
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:54,830
- Ward.
- Yeah?

72
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,868
I'm kidding. I'm your neighbor.
You have a good day, my friend.

73
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:03,572
- Thanks, Bruce.
- Yeah!

74
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:05,941
Hello.

75
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,977
- <i>You know what the fucking problem is?</i>
- Good morning.

76
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:12,990
Every fucking morning, I spend
nearly $3 for my iced coffee, mind you,

77
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,218
which is the same as the drip, which is
given to you at the counter, where you pay.

78
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:18,120
But is my iced coffee
given to me at the counter?

79
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,554
I am guessing no.

80
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:21,423
Do you know how long it takes
to make a blended drink?

81
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,160
- Seven hours.
- Fuck you. A long fucking time.

82
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,727
These people move
with the urgency of a glacier.

83
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:31,333
Hold on. Hey, you need a hand?

84
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,035
- Oh, I got it.
- You sure?

85
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,170
How's your iced coffee?

86
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,171
- It's the best one yet.
- You like it creamy?

87
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,144
I'll see you tomorrow.

88
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:45,080
- <i>Who was that?</i>
- The chick that works the counter.

89
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,116
- <i>Wow. You really let her know how you feel.</i>
- Fuck you. She's cute.

90
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,319
She sucks at her job,
but she's fucking cute.

91
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,422
- Hey, are we still on for Sunday?
- <i>Yeah, we better be.</i>

92
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:55,791
Good. A father's day golf is
just what the doctor ordered.

93
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,526
Of course, I'll spend my day
hitting tour-quality shots

94
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,929
while pussy Ward thins every iron and
somehow manages to end up on the green.

95
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,465
Oh, hey, I'm pulling up to Robin Peters.

96
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,367
- Oh, dude, that's today?
- <i>Yeah. I'll fill you in later.</i>

97
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,168
Wait. Tell her she
sucked in <i>Prairie Girl.</i>

98
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,545
Ms. Peters, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Tom Bradford, <i>Ego</i> magazine.

99
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:21,416
Mr. Bradford, I've been doing
interviews for over two decades now,

100
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:24,584
and not once have I had
to wait for the interviewer.

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,821
I'm... I'm so sorry I'm late.

102
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:33,093
You are seven minutes late.

103
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,299
Relax. Sit down.

104
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:39,102
Thank you.

105
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:42,337
Hey.

106
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,706
Sorry. We... we were...
we just got a muffin.

107
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:48,110
We stopped, and the line was...
I've actually never seen a line that long.

108
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,346
- Sure.
- Sorry.

109
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:52,848
Hey, tootsie. Why don't you go into your
classroom, and we'll be right there, okay?

110
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:56,785
Go on inside, okay? Go on. Run, run.

111
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,755
- What does that mean, "sure"?
- Nothing.

112
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:02,424
Can you take Lily this weekend?

113
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:04,026
You can't do this weekend?

114
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:06,295
I was just hoping we could
switch weekends is all.

115
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:10,065
- I mean, if it's a big deal, then...
- No. I can help you out.

116
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:12,167
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

117
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,118
You got a hot date? Or... no? Nothing?

118
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,773
You just... you just wanna be alone?
Get some alone time?

119
00:07:17,873 --> 00:07:20,842
- It's not like a Vegas girl's weekend...
- Can you switch with me or not?

120
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:23,211
Look, I'm just trying to have
an adult conversation here.

121
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,615
- Is that what this is?
- You're being super defensive, so...

122
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,718
so I guess I'll take that
as you have a new lover.

123
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,954
- I will hit you.
- Oh, that's vile.

124
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,124
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- Mom!

125
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,527
Hi. I am so sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

126
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,662
- It's okay.
- Is it okay if I take a picture with you?

127
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:41,997
- Sure.
- You don't mind?

128
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,266
- No, not at all.
- Would you mind?

129
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,800
- I'm coming in.
- Okay.

130
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,939
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Sure.

131
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,308
I'm just such a huge
fan of <i>West End Medical.</i>

132
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,010
- Oh, yeah?
- I miss Bryce.

133
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,211
- Yeah. Me too.
- So what are you up to now?

134
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,553
Not ripe yet.

135
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,456
Oh, yeah! Oh, shit.

136
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,227
Oh, God.

137
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,363
Oh, God.

138
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,207
Crabgrass?

139
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:29,311
- Robin Peters.
- Hey! How'd it go?

140
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,646
She is fantastic.

141
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:34,246
- Really?
- Fantastic.

142
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:37,317
- The interview, however...
- Why?

143
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,655
A two-time academy award nominee, right?

144
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:42,925
Couldn't get arrested after <i>Pole Dance.</i>
She claws her way back.

145
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,860
Bit part here, supporting part there.

146
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,429
- Oh, man, but her tits in <i>Brick Layer.</i>
- I know.

147
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,412
I know. Real, I think.
That reminds me. I gotta call Geena.

148
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,400
- Hey, remind me to call Geena.
- All right, boss.

149
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,302
- Okay, so she claws her way back.
- Yes. Right.

150
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,437
And so, this movie now
is getting some real traction.

151
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:01,574
So I show up and ask her what the readers
of our magazine really wanna know.

152
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,016
- You are cute and easy to talk to.
- Oh, thank you.

153
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,219
- You must be good at your job.
- Oh, please.

154
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,921
Well, you can put me at ease.

155
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,136
- Well, you're easy.
- Am I?

156
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:19,228
Okay, on that note,
I do have some questions for you.

157
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:22,164
We have some business.
There's some business we have to attend to.

158
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:25,467
- Business.
- Business, yes. Very serious stuff here.

159
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,937
All right. Well, the readers of
the magazine would like to know...

160
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,542
What would your readers like to know?

161
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,383
They wanna know about your dog.
About Sloopy.

162
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:54,394
It's a puggle, right?
Her dog? It's a pug?

163
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,405
You know who it is.
Just give me a second, all right?

164
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,405
Hey, babe.

165
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,877
Around 5:00.
So how... how... how's the baby?

166
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,082
Oh, really. So, look,
what I think you should...

167
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,888
Yeah, you do whatever you think.

168
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:22,291
At the end of the day, you're the mommy.
Whatever you wanna do.

169
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:26,629
I love you. Hello? Hello?

170
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,764
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She's...

171
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,669
She's just a little upset 'cause the
baby's cranky, and I'm not around.

172
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,138
- Because you're working.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,307
But I'm not there for her
and the baby either.

174
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:42,611
- Because you're at work.
- I know.

175
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,744
Just a really tough time right now.

176
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,318
Maybe you can have Stacy call Geena.
Maybe they can go to the park or something,

177
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:50,967
get the kids out of the house
for a little while.

178
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,356
Really? That'd be okay with Geena?

179
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:58,660
Are you kidding? Oh, she'd love that.

180
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,931
Maybe... maybe Sunday
while we're at golf.

181
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,049
You didn't tell her about golf?

182
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,526
I'm gonna. I promise. I am. It's...

183
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,905
It's really rough
right now with the kid.

184
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,744
You know I have a baby, too, right?
David... he's got a kid.

185
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:16,642
I'll tell her tonight.

186
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,921
Do these go with your pants,
or are they workout gear?

187
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:36,396
- So pants?
- That's what they are.

188
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:46,007
Hey, honey? Honey?

189
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,609
What?

190
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,978
So the guys are going
golfing for father's day,

191
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,912
and I was wondering
if I could go with them?

192
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,120
If you don't wanna spend father's day
with your son, that's up to you.

193
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,764
- No, I always wanna spend time with him.
- Obviously you don't, Ward.

194
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,993
You just told me you wanna spend it
with the guys playing golf.

195
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,895
I'm stuck here every day, but...

196
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:09,731
I'm sure Tom wants to spend it
with his wife and child.

197
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:14,502
No, babe. Tom's going.
Yeah, it was his idea. He's playing golf.

198
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:19,207
Don't pass the blame. You're responsible
for your own actions. All right?

199
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:22,842
Not Tom or Ronnie or any
of your other idiot friends.

200
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,144
How's he doing?

201
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,150
Yeah. He's such a good boy.

202
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:37,158
Man, if I'm exhausted, you've just
gotta be beat? He's a full-time job.

203
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,392
I'm okay.

204
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:47,233
- I'm almost back to my pre-baby weight.
- I know, and you look great.

205
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,945
You want a piece of this?

206
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,277
Yeah. Yeah, you know I do.
I'm just so tired, babe.

207
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,311
Come on. I'm so tired.

208
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,148
- Okay?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,221
- Night.
- Night.

210
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,777
You don't have a
cappuccino machine, do you?

211
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:33,179
- Big D! What'd you get?
- Wow. You look like a fool.

212
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:40,488
Hey, can I get a, breakfast Sandy,
no mayo? Reminds me of cum.

213
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:43,758
You know, make that two,
and a froot loops.

214
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,262
Lily!

215
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,813
Brought your kid?

216
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:52,091
Yeah. Amanda needed... I don't know.
Something. Whatever.

217
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,770
- You know, I'm not pulling my punches.
- She's heard it all before.

218
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,771
- Oh, I've got some new shit.
- I doubt that.

219
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,646
Yeah. Where you at?

220
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,450
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- You here?

221
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,884
<i>No.</i>

222
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:13,187
Look, I'm not gonna make it today.

223
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,856
What are you talking about?
It's fucking father's day.

224
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:16,991
That's the thing.

225
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,132
What a pussy.

226
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,727
Sorry. Christ. Hit another.

227
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:26,933
She says her relationship
with her father is strained.

228
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,105
- You're hitting three.
- Shut up.

229
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,140
- Dad.
- Sorry, honey.

230
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,151
- Fuck!
- Dad!

231
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:44,421
Sorry.

232
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,855
You know what? I'm just gonna go ahead
and talk in your back swing from now on

233
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,955
if it doesn't make any difference.

234
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:53,928
- I mean, do they even talk?
- What's that mean, "strained"?

235
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,496
- I don't know.
- It means he's a fucking pussy.

236
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,904
Tour quality.

237
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,722
She says that father's day

238
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:08,676
reminds her of how bad her relationship
is with her father, and that she needs him.

239
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,844
- Needs him?
- Yep.

240
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:13,982
She hates him. She spends her whole day
terrorizing and berating that pussy.

241
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:17,517
I mean, not that he doesn't
deserve some of it, but fuck.

242
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,589
- Not bad. You'll be okay.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,223
At least he's laying one.

244
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,429
Did you tell her she
sucked in <i>Prairie Girl?</i>

245
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,266
Yeah, Ronnie, I did. I told Robin Peters
that she sucked in <i>Prairie Girl.</i>

246
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,869
You know what? She's top three for me.

247
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:11,205
You just put me in a room with her,
I would close that deal so fast.

248
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,075
I met her a couple times.
We used to have the same publicist.

249
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,077
I think last time I saw her
was in a gifting suite.

250
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:18,813
- What the fuck is that?
- That's my point, Ron.

251
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,315
You'll never close
with somebody like that

252
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:22,517
because you need a connection,
an introduction.

253
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:25,319
- Tom, buddy?
- No way. Never.

254
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,290
All right. How about this?
If I sink this putt, it'll happen.

255
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,691
You sink this putt,
I will shit in the cup.

256
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,099
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na... Oh, God.

257
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,935
Hey, I think you owe me some poo.

258
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,274
Is that good?

259
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:53,225
- Ward. He wants to know who's ahead.
- Radio silence.

260
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:57,086
- No way. No sac, no scores.
- Daddy, what's a sack?

261
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:04,225
It's a bag of doughnuts. Ward didn't
show up with the bag of doughnuts, so...

262
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,794
I mean, seriously, Tom, you know,
there's not rocking the boat,

263
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:09,297
and then there's sacrificing
your entire fucking...

264
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:11,299
Sorry. Your entire existence.

265
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:14,168
I get it. Which sometimes
has to occur when you have a kid.

266
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:19,741
Yeah. Little bit. Christ, we haven't
seen him since the christening.

267
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:21,242
- What?
- Me neither.

268
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,311
Yeah. He won't let us come over. Germs.

269
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,989
I miss that pussy.

270
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,740
- Daddy.
- I know. I know, honey.

271
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,721
Just... can you go get us some M&M's?

272
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,556
Terrible.

273
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:38,049
I mean, come on. We joke
about it, right? We joke about it,

274
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:41,896
but Ward's always been easy
to be bullied. She's a fucking bully!

275
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:45,939
I mean, ever since she got pregnant,
she's got him. He's fucking trapped.

276
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,068
He called me before the baby was born.
She was, like, four or five months pregnant.

277
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:53,741
He was in tears. "I'm a horrible husband.
I can't make her happy. I treat her badly."

278
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,544
- What?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

279
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:58,112
Yeah, she's got him believing that
all of her problems stem from him.

280
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:00,848
How his parents hate her
and all this fucking bullshit.

281
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,315
We should just kill her.

282
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,049
Sure.

283
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:09,424
But you gotta think about the kid
growing up without a mother.

284
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:10,891
I wouldn't do that to a kid.

285
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:13,027
It's better than growing up
with that troll as your mother.

286
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,629
- That's so true.
- That's true.

287
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,931
- Or we could kill him.
- Ramone?

288
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,700
- What?
- Dude.

289
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,934
No, War... you don't kill
a fucking baby. Ward.

290
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,872
I'd do that for him. I'd do that for him.
It's a mercy killing.

291
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:28,042
Fuck that, because then
the kid's gotta grow up with her.

292
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:31,646
I wouldn't do that to the kid.
Not even one I'm not allowed to see.

293
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:35,750
Besides, if Ward's not here,
who am I gonna wreck on the golf course?

294
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,820
- David.
- It's too easy.

295
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,555
Oh, yeah?

296
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,958
- How's being separated?
- Go fuck yourself.

297
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,891
Point made.

298
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,931
There's a theory
that everybody gets one.

299
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:52,566
- One what?
- One murder.

300
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,770
Okay. How do you do it
and not get caught?

301
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,683
Well, she's got no friends. Mom died.

302
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:04,777
- Dad doesn't seem to care, I'm sure.
- It's true... no one would miss her.

303
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,819
- What'd you do, eat me for breakfast?
- You should think of murder at every address.

304
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,219
Daddy!

305
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,093
So what's the distance?

306
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:21,360
I don't know. 180, 190.

307
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,348
I should go pro.

308
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:03,035
Do you hear that? Do you hear it?

309
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,467
Now that you woke our baby up,
you're gonna get me a foot-long sub.

310
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,702
Double meat, double cheese.

311
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,905
Or are you gonna keep doing nothing
for your family because it's father's day?

312
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,539
Jesus! Are you sick?

313
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,478
- Good times today, boys.
- It was.

314
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,980
- Definitely.
- Lovely.

315
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,994
- I miss our black friend.
- We could kill her, you know?

316
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:51,452
Sure, buddy. You know what?
That sounds like a plan.

317
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:54,972
Now that you've been killed off your last
three TV shows and your wife moved out,

318
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,258
you got all the time in
the world to plan it out.

319
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:01,103
All right. A: that's just a trial separation.
We're just trying to work things out.

320
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:03,832
Okay. Sure, sure. What's B?

321
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,766
Nobody loves you.

322
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,916
Hey, there he is.

323
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:23,818
- Hi, Bruce.
- How are ya?

324
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:27,155
- Good. How are you?
- Good. How was golf?

325
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:31,592
I didn't make it today. It's father's day,
so I'm gonna spend it with my family.

326
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:34,395
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My kids called me earlier.

327
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,697
They're in Arizona, right?

328
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,167
Very good. Scottsdale.
With their mother.

329
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,269
Hey, I was thinking,
next time you guys go hit the links,

330
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,604
maybe I could dust off my clubs
and play a round with you?

331
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,339
- I'll let you know.
- All righty.

332
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:49,010
You know, I got a badge. I flash that thing,
we're gonna get a hell of a discount.

333
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,778
- Okay.
- All right. I will see you later.

334
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,623
- Good times, man.
- I know.

335
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:06,927
It's okay to have a life, you know. I mean,
have something outside of your family.

336
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,298
- That balance is important.
- I know. I just wish...

337
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:14,402
I wish Stacy had something else
to focus on other than just Ramone.

338
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,735
Like a hobby or a friend.
Just something.

339
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,042
- Please.
- She's a dick.

340
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,678
Yes, I know. I know she is.

341
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:28,447
- I'll need backup.
- Okay. Great idea.

342
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,019
Hey!

343
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,756
- Oh, my God. You look great.
- Who picked this place? The parking sucks!

344
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,327
- Really? I found a spot right away.
- It doesn't seem that full.

345
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,829
Yeah, well, it was full for me,
and he hates elevators,

346
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,363
and the stairs smell like piss, and...

347
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,608
Where's Larry?

348
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,370
Your kid.

349
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,138
Charlie.

350
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:54,408
I-I thought you said you didn't
want us to bring the kids.

351
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,744
Yeah, like a girls' lunch.

352
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,213
- Should we go home now?
- No.

353
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:02,514
- No!
- Yes.

354
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:45,526
And just know,
it does get better every day.

355
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,562
I know everybody
says that, but it's true.

356
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:50,865
And when they start
to talk, it's so cute.

357
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:54,700
Yeah, but when they start to talk,
they don't shut up, right?

358
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,139
I... I know for me,

359
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:02,376
once Charlie started sleeping in his
own room, things got a little better.

360
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:04,345
Oh, Ramone doesn't sleep
in his own room.

361
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,814
No, the only place he can
fall asleep is here, on me.

362
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:10,017
Yeah, but then you put him
in his bed after he's asleep, right?

363
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,653
Yeah, so he can wake up and cry? No.

364
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:16,290
You're not afraid you're gonna roll
over on him in his sleep or something?

365
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,992
Some days I wish I would.

366
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,229
I'm kidding. God.

367
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,999
No. Years ago, I trained myself
to be a back sleeper, you know?

368
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:30,004
'Cause Ward's a spooner, and... I can't
even stand the thought of him touching me.

369
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:32,440
I miss spooning.

370
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,076
I'm sorry you guys are
having such a tough time.

371
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:38,880
It's just hard for me to be with someone
who has no direction or no passion.

372
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,850
We don't connect, and... whatever.
It's tough. On me, on Lily.

373
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,221
I know how you feel. I mean,
it's different. We connect. We just...

374
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:51,092
We don't... have that spark, you know?

375
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:55,529
- What's that smell? Do we smell that?
- I think it's...

376
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah, it's not me who took the
big dump in his pants, it's Ramone.

377
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,769
- Do you wanna go change him?
- Yeah.

378
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,270
He doesn't mind a dirty diaper.
Unless you do?

379
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:13,345
- What's up?
- Hey.

380
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,951
- So I've been looking into it.
- Into what?

381
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,487
- What's up, Ken?
- What's up, Ron?

382
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:22,423
What we were talking about
with Ward's wife.

383
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,625
- I don't know.
- You know.

384
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:28,395
No, I don't know. If I knew,
I would've said, "oh, yeah, right. I know."

385
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:31,532
- What the fuck you talking about?
- About killing her.

386
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:34,499
- Hey, Ashley.
- Hi, Ronnie.

387
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:39,941
Do you have a fucking wire loose?
We were kidding.

388
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:44,211
I'm just saying that...
that the conversation inspired me.

389
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,848
That kind of shit fascinates me, you know?
The mind of a serial killer.

390
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,951
- Bro, she's an asshole, right?
- Yeah.

391
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,621
Yeah. And when people are assholes,
we talk about wanting them dead,

392
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:56,524
but we don't actually
want them fucking dead.

393
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:58,726
What the fuck is wrong with you?

394
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,427
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi, Ron.

395
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:04,065
- Do you know everyone here? Is that...
- How do you think I make a living?

396
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:07,368
I train all these people.
I'm at work right now, bro.

397
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:11,305
- You train all these people?
- Not yet. That's how it starts.

398
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,974
I do a couple push-ups,
I sit here in a beater.

399
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,544
They're like, "Oh, hey, hi.
You're a trainer?

400
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:20,118
Oh, my God, I'm so fat. I totally
needed a trainer." Next thing you know,

401
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:24,383
they're paying me two hundo an hour to
basically teabag them while they bench press.

402
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,822
And there's something wrong with me?

403
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:32,359
Hey, man, I'm a pervert. I'm not talking
about trying to fucking kill somebody.

404
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:36,063
Oh, shit. It's not like
I'd do it. It just...

405
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:40,866
it's just interesting to think about
how you'd get away with it.

406
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,305
That's all.

407
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,856
- Hi, daddy.
- Hello. Hello.

408
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,292
Can you believe it?
Like, it's been a year. It's crazy.

409
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:09,197
I know. It's crazy, right?
It's like he was born last week.

410
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:13,500
Time flies when you're not stuck
at home every day for the baby.

411
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,803
Yeah, but... but it's fun.

412
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:20,405
Sure. We have fun when daddy
abandons us. Right? We have fun.

413
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:24,521
- What's wrong with you? Are you sick?
- No, I'm fine.

414
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:27,514
- You make my baby sick, and...
- I'm not sick.

415
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,484
It's cake time, Ward. Wrap it up.

416
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:32,720
It's cake time, guys, so...

417
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,488
- Dude, what the hell?
- What?

418
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:37,558
She's just worried
about the baby, that's all.

419
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:40,328
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Hey, Bruce, how's it going?

420
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:41,862
- Good.
- Thank you for coming.

421
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,764
- Thank you for having me.
- Yeah.

422
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,733
- I'm sorry. Tom.
- Good to see you, man.

423
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,134
- Hey, guys. How are you?
- Ronnie.

424
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:50,036
- You met Geena, right?
- Yes, yes. Good to see you.

425
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,406
Ward keeps threatening
to take me golfing with you guys.

426
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,842
- Next time you go out, let me know.
- Yeah. We'll do that.

427
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:56,477
I play from the tips.

428
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,479
Okay.

429
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,784
Yeah, yeah. Cake time.

430
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,153
Stop it. It's half a Benadryl.
He'll be fine.

431
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:08,155
- I understand that.
- I've done it before. He'll be fine.

432
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:10,489
I just don't think it's really...

433
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,358
Tom?

434
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:17,431
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Tom?</i>

435
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:19,133
- Speaking.
- <i>Hey.</i>

436
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,035
- Hey.
- <i>You don't know who this is.</i>

437
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:22,436
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

438
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:26,674
<i>Well, we had a really nice meal
together a little while ago,</i>

439
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:31,445
the result of which was a fairly
bland article in your magazine.

440
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:35,147
Yeah, of course. It's work.

441
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,954
- Robin? Robin Peters?
- Am I interrupting something?

442
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,225
No, you're not interrupting anything.
Hi. How are you?

443
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:47,094
A little out of my
comfort zone, actually.

444
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:49,830
I was waiting for you to call me,

445
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,701
- and when the call never came...
- Well, I-I...

446
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:56,136
I thought that we had
a really nice time together.

447
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,173
We did have a nice time.
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

448
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,409
- <i>You enjoyed it?</i>
- I really liked it, actually.

449
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:05,412
Did you think about it afterwards?

450
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,282
Of course. Yeah. I mean...

451
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:13,620
- I thought that we made a real connection.
- Yeah. I felt it. The connection.

452
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,522
Well, I think we should
see each other again.

453
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:18,325
I'd like that... to see you again, yeah.

454
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,328
<i>Maybe for a more in-depth interview?</i>

455
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,597
Definitely. Something deeper.

456
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,734
<i>This is my cell. Call me on Tuesday.</i>

457
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,203
Okay. I will. I'll...
I'll call you Tuesday.

458
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,837
- <i>Good-bye, Tom.</i>
- Good-bye.

459
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,711
- You got a hot date, Tom?
- You scared the shit out of me.

460
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:39,813
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

461
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:43,952
- A hot date. Tuesday, was it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

462
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:48,956
I wouldn't blame you. I never thought
you and Geena would make it, you know.

463
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:51,825
She's too, boring and desperate.

464
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:56,596
- Not that those are bad qualities, but...
- Okay. Time out. That was work.

465
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,601
You're just different.
Not good different.

466
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:03,905
Not like me and Ward.
We're good different. We make it work.

467
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:06,673
But, you know, maybe that's because
he's not a cheater.

468
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,411
Ward's too much of a pussy to be
a cheater. But what do I know?

469
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,314
I never thought you
were a cheater either.

470
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,915
Okay. Thank you.

471
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:17,518
Listen. Come here. Come here.

472
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:18,986
Look...

473
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:21,288
I thought about cheating too.

474
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:25,626
And you know what?
Maybe I've already done it.

475
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:30,030
It's fun, right? Secret phone calls...

476
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,064
"I'll see you Tuesday"...

477
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,237
We're a lot alike.

478
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:41,107
You and me, Tom... we could
do it now. We could cheat now.

479
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:47,382
Maybe... maybe there's some
advantages to being with people as naive,

480
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:51,785
stupid as Geena and my little Ward.

481
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:54,586
I wonder what Geena
would think of that phone call.

482
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,661
What the fuck?

483
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,136
Fuck.

484
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,972
Oh, fuck.

485
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:24,118
Okay.

486
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:26,218
Okay.

487
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,398
Oh, shit.

488
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,201
Oh, shit.

489
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:22,743
Okay. Okay.

490
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,876
Oh, shit.

491
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,551
Okay. Okay.

492
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,091
Let me ask you a question...

493
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:40,627
- That was quite a call.
- Yeah.

494
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,863
Your wife says
you're almost out of diapers.

495
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,765
- Really?
- Yeah.

496
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay. You guys will be here
when I get back, right?

497
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,470
- You know I will be.
- We should probably get going.

498
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,904
Yeah. We'll be here. We'll be here.

499
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,905
- All right. See you in a sec.
- Yep.

500
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:59,012
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:01,446
- You're lying.
- Big-time.

502
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,452
I just wanted to mash her face
in the cake, you know?

503
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:07,087
But then she slipped, and...
I don't know.

504
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:09,089
- Tom!
- Holy shit, dude.

505
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,791
- Yeah, I know.
- She's dead?

506
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,359
Yeah.

507
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:14,744
But... but it was an accident, right?
I mean...

508
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:17,898
Wait. Is that icing on her neck?

509
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:21,320
Well, yeah. She was bleeding all over,
and she still had a pulse, so I...

510
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,770
So you strangled her?

511
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,771
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:33,080
I think she's probably put on 6
or 7 pounds since I saw her last.

513
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,273
No, I think that's just the cake...

514
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:39,152
- No, I... I thought that earlier.
- ...on her face.

515
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:41,355
So what do we do?

516
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:45,759
Well, we could've called 911 and said she
slipped but now that you strangled her...

517
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,695
No. I couldn't risk her waking up
and saying I smashed her face in the cake.

518
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:51,932
- No, I know. I know that.
- They'd know that she was strangled?

519
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,635
Yeah. Look at her neck.
That'll tell everything.

520
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,137
- I'm an idiot. Fuck!
- Hey.

521
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,706
- So I'm sorry...
- Can we just focus for a second, please?

522
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:01,675
My best friend's dead wife
is lying in a pool of blood,

523
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:04,111
covered with cake on his kitchen floor!

524
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:07,781
I got diapers! Got the last pack.

525
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:09,715
Hey, man.

526
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:21,629
You?

527
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,589
No.

528
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,873
Yeah.

529
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,438
Dude, we didn't need diapers.

530
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,775
- Where's Ramone?
- Fuck!

531
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,748
You killed my wife,
and you left my baby outside?

532
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:46,017
- I did not leave your kid outside.
- Oh, my God!

533
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:49,389
I'll take a look.

534
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,323
I know what to do.

535
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,198
We're in the kitchen!

536
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:04,634
What?

537
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,526
- Holy shit!
- I know.

538
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:08,775
- Jesus!
- Right?

539
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:12,379
- She dead?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

540
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:14,948
Your hair looks great!

541
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:18,719
- You like it? I'm not sure.
- Yeah! Really great.

542
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:20,924
All right, we need your help.

543
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,860
Okay.

544
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,694
This is crazy.

545
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,034
Anyway... when I was researching
how to dispose of her body,

546
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,803
I came up with a bunch
of possible solutions.

547
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,539
- When?
- What?

548
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,840
When were you researching
how to dispose of her body?

549
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,332
Just when Ron called.

550
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:49,783
No. No. You didn't know
she was dead when he called.

551
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:53,186
I-I knew that... I knew that...

552
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,389
Not her... body. Not your lovely wife.

553
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,959
I... that's what was so
crazy about all this,

554
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,862
is I... have been
doing all this research

555
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:04,696
about how to get away with murder.
For a role that I'm preparing for.

556
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,435
You guys planned this.

557
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:12,405
No, I never intended
to kill your wife. I did not.

558
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:16,676
We had talked not seriously
about Stacy dying, about killing her.

559
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:17,944
- You serious?
- Gross!

560
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:21,014
- Fuck, dude, shut up!
- Well, we had. We had talked about it.

561
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:24,585
- What the fuck?
- Look, I...

562
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,554
No, it's... I'm sor...

563
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:31,101
We were passing time on the golf course.
It wasn't serious! It was guys talking.

564
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:35,862
Obviously, it was serious.
Because fucking Harvey Keitel here has...

565
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:39,772
- Thank you.
- ...researched and compiled what...

566
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:45,071
What is this? 3 pages of
copious notes on how to kill my wife?

567
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,274
Not how to kill your wife.
How to dispose of her body.

568
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,596
- That's completely different!
- Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

569
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:55,282
I'm sorry that we...
we talked about killing your wife.

570
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,552
- Even as a joke, it's not cool.
- Yeah.

571
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:01,519
- Yeah, me too.
- Right.

572
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,262
Okay, let's get started. I got a few options.
A few different ways of doing this.

573
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,198
Of course I have my favorite,
but I think ultimately

574
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:14,034
this is a decision that we
should come to as a group.

575
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,099
- Agreed.
- If it's cool with Ward?

576
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,626
Sure. Why not? Fuck it.

577
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:22,209
Beautiful! There is the basic burial method.
Either whole or dismembered.

578
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:26,646
We take the body to a remote location,
dig a hole, or holes, and bury this bitch.

579
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:29,549
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:35,088
If we do choose this way, it is better
to dismember the body into 6 pieces.

581
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:37,357
We want to go head, torso, four limbs,

582
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:39,860
put each in a garbage bag,
fill them with bleach.

583
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,598
Now, the bleach not only disguises
any scent for any wandering animals, or...

584
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:49,035
or search parties, but it also begins
the breakdown process of the flesh.

585
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,716
Okay, then we just...
we just go to different locations,

586
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:55,672
- and we just bury her there.
- That makes sense.

587
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:58,967
- I think so.
- Yeah, that sounds about right. But...

588
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:03,750
What about DNA? What about... what about
dental records? What about fingerprints?

589
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,553
- Good question!
- Thank you.

590
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:09,022
Regardless of any method,
and I got a few more,

591
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:11,915
we want to cut off and burn the tips
of her fingers, pull out her teeth...

592
00:38:12,015 --> 00:38:14,594
if we can't pull them out,
grind them all the way down.

593
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:17,130
We just want to get rid of
any easy identifiers.

594
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,348
What about her face?

595
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:20,648
That too. We got to make it
totally unrecognizable.

596
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,670
- All right.
- I'm gonna need some more wine.

597
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,206
- Will you get wine?
- Yeah.

598
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,609
I'm just gonna keep going.
Here's the guy Ritchie method. Now.

599
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,946
I looked this up, and I couldn't really find
any concrete documentation on it,

600
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:36,449
but it sounds really cool.
Having her eaten by pigs.

601
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:40,087
Now we'd have to get her weight right

602
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:43,023
so that I can get the
appropriate number of swine.

603
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:45,691
Well, did you know what she weighed?

604
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:48,394
Between 133 and 134.

605
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,398
- That is way low!
- Yeah, way low.

606
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:55,001
- Women are brutal.
- We don't have any fucking pigs.

607
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:58,872
I know. That's why there's the ocean.
We weigh her down, take her out to sea.

608
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:01,574
Now, you do run the risk
of her washing ashore

609
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:04,244
unless you just jam her into an oil drum
and just pack it with concrete.

610
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,280
- Yeah, but we don't have a boat.
- We can always rent a boat.

611
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,856
- I'd love to go on a boat.
- Me, too. A cruise.

612
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:11,718
- Really?
- Yeah.

613
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,553
What, and then at some point
we just tell the captain,

614
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:17,057
"Hey, can you stop for a second while
we just drop some shit overboard?"

615
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:21,330
What we could do is
chop her up into tiny pieces,

616
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,751
and throw her over bit by bit.
He'd never see that.

617
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:25,859
- What, like Chum?
- Yeah. It'd be like <i>Shawshank,</i>

618
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:29,187
when... when Andy would
take pieces from his cell wall

619
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:31,839
- and sprinkle 'em in the yard.
- I love that movie.

620
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:34,040
You know? There's no women
in that movie. Isn't that weird?

621
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,843
We could go big and do a wood chipper.

622
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:39,245
- <i>Fargo!</i>
- Oh, I love that movie, too.

623
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:42,883
I mean, you shove her right into the teeth,
it's almost impossible to trace.

624
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:46,680
Yeah, but well, no. You could trace the
wood chipper through the rental, though.

625
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,891
Yeah. You would have to use cash,
use a fake name or a disguise.

626
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:53,994
- That's a pain in the ass.
- It is.

627
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,881
Oh! This is good. All right.

628
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:58,549
Now, depending on what type of
equipment you've got here in the house,

629
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,085
we could...

630
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:04,371
grind her almost completely down.

631
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:06,907
Like just, send her on down the sewer.

632
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,843
Right down into the drain.
It's gonna take a little longer.

633
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:12,378
You do run the risk of alerting
the neighbors to the noise,

634
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,249
of the machinery, or the smell...

635
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,382
but we would keep it all in the house.

636
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,620
- You don't like that one.
- No.

637
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,189
- He doesn't like that.
- All right.

638
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:24,236
Is that it?

639
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:26,970
I mean, unless anybody knows anyone
with access to an incinerator.

640
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,661
No, I don't.

641
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,997
I... no.

642
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:33,108
Well, then, that's it.

643
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:37,278
I am partial to dismembering and burying.
I think it's the easiest,

644
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:41,441
especially if we separate the pieces.
It will just be the hardest to trace.

645
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,909
I agree. I agree. Ladies?

646
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:44,611
- Go with the first choice.
- Oh, good.

647
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:47,213
- Ward?
- Yeah. Totally agree.

648
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:50,817
- We should chop her up and bury her.
- Great. That's what I wanted to hear. Okay.

649
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:53,987
So tomorrow we're gonna
reconvene here before golf...

650
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:56,723
- Wait.
- You're playing golf tomorrow?

651
00:40:56,823 --> 00:41:00,460
We have a 3:00 tee time.
Everything needs to appear completely normal

652
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,297
so that when we alert the police
to the fact that Stacy's disappeared,

653
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:06,533
we'll have no questions.

654
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,235
I can't remember the last time
I played golf with these guys.

655
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:11,838
- It is gonna be fun.
- Cool.

656
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:14,007
Right, now Tom, you go buy some bleach.

657
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:17,644
The more the better. Pay with
cash and throw away the receipt.

658
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:21,048
We'll move Stacy into the bathtub,
bleed her out, then clean this place up.

659
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:24,851
Tomorrow we'll cut her up and bag her
before golf. You ladies will do...

660
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:28,568
whatever it is that you do while
we're at golf. We'll each take a bag.

661
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:32,259
Fuck! Get me out! Fuck!

662
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,825
Get me up!

663
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,827
Fuck, man!

664
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,709
I'm out of shape.

665
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:47,107
- I'll rinse these.
- Okay.

666
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:48,973
Kitchen.

667
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:58,251
Got to make sure there's no trace
of anything in there.

668
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:01,721
Got to get on our knees,
scrub-a-dub-dub.

669
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:05,923
No blood, no anything that could
point a finger in our direction.

670
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,197
Just keep your eyes
on the task at hand...

671
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:13,331
and you should be golden.

672
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,781
Looks pretty great!

673
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:31,458
Definitely doesn't look like somebody
was killed in here, that's for sure.

674
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:35,563
Hey, man. I'm really sorry
I killed your wife.

675
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:39,926
I know. I know you are.

676
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:41,695
You guys are like family to me.

677
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:44,764
- We always have been.
- Ramone, too.

678
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,931
We love you guys.

679
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,469
I haven't seen your kid in months, man!

680
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,110
There he is.

681
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,776
Yeah.

682
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:04,117
- He's beautiful.
- So beautiful.

683
00:43:04,217 --> 00:43:08,252
- Thanks.
- So peaceful. So innocent.

684
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:11,091
- Fuck!
- What?

685
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:13,326
We forgot to bleed her out.

686
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:15,726
Come on, come on.

687
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,731
Okay.

688
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:30,741
Oh. Honey, could you go in the
kitchen and grab me a knife?

689
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:36,707
Okay, guys, we have to remember that
we need to bury all our clothes in a bag.

690
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:38,172
What?

691
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,585
I love these shoes.

692
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:45,325
- This good?
- That's perfect. Thank you.

693
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:48,801
Yeah. Tom. Take it.

694
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:54,567
So what I need you to do is,
"cut the thigh diagonally...?"

695
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,570
Now make sure you get deep enough
to hit the femoral artery,

696
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,540
so you gotta go in pretty good.
Give it a good whack.

697
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,542
You can do it, honey.

698
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:05,810
Come on. You strangled her with your
bare hands, you can cut her fuckin' thigh.

699
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,286
- I thought you said she hit her head.
- She did hit her head. Yes. And then...

700
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:14,787
I did. I strangled her. Yes.

701
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,957
- What the fuck, Tom?
- I know. I know, I'm so sorry. I am.

702
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:25,196
Go ahead. Cut her up.

703
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,601
You can do it.

704
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:35,673
Sorry. Sorry.

705
00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:45,518
- Oh, fuck!
- Yeah.

706
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:47,487
Yeah, that's not a really sharp knife.

707
00:44:47,587 --> 00:44:51,069
- We don't have a sharpener.
- That's really dangerous, you know?

708
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:53,726
Dull knives? The number one
cause of injuries in the kitchen.

709
00:44:53,826 --> 00:44:55,259
Okay, be careful, honey.

710
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,808
Okay... okay, I just...

711
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:03,352
Oh, no!

712
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,540
- I think you got to go deeper.
- That's a big fucking thigh.

713
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,910
Maybe try... try the other one.

714
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,245
Pretty fuckin' deep here, man!

715
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:17,884
I'm an idiot! I'm a total idiot. We got
to pump it out. Do chest compressions.

716
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:22,088
Apply suction to the atria using
the spring from the ribcage.

717
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:25,122
- Okay.
- Yeah.

718
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:30,532
- Like CPR?
- I think so.

719
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:37,669
- Harder.
- I'm pushing pretty hard here.

720
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:39,139
You got to do it harder.

721
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:41,972
I'm pushing pretty hard here, man.
If you want to give it a shot, be my guest.

722
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:45,625
Fuck it.

723
00:45:49,482 --> 00:45:51,163
- Jesus!
- That's it.

724
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:54,962
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

725
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,325
Okay, okay!
That's enough, that's enough!

726
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:02,126
And that's how you bleed a body out!

727
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:12,439
All right. Tomorrow mo...

728
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,474
- What?
- Who the fuck is that?

729
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:17,478
Hide. Hide! Come on.

730
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:21,318
- Go! Hide, hide!
- They can see the fireplace.

731
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:27,687
Hey, Ward, it's Bruce!

732
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:29,189
- Ward!
- What?

733
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,990
- Get the door. Deal with it.
- Yeah.

734
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:43,470
- Hey, Ward!
- Hey, Bruce.

735
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,638
- Hey, buddy. How are you?
- I'm great.

736
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:47,637
What's goin' on?

737
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:52,011
- Oh, I was getting ready for bed.
- Oh. Okay.

738
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:55,715
I believe that I left my shades
in your backyard earlier.

739
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:58,484
I was gonna go around
myself and, check it out,

740
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:00,620
- but trespassing is illegal, so...
- Yeah, it is.

741
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,589
I thought I'd knock. All right?
So if you wouldn't mind...

742
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:07,519
- You want to go through the house?
- Well, that's how you get to the back yard.

743
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:09,890
Right.

744
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,135
- What's goin' on? You okay?
- Everything's fine. Look...

745
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:17,663
What was that?

746
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,777
- Nothing.
- Okay.

747
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:27,213
You should probably go
around the side of the house.

748
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:30,550
Around the side?
What's going on? You okay?

749
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,519
Everything's fine. It's just that
Ramone is sleeping right now.

750
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:37,356
And Stacy gets really weird when
I have company while he's asleep.

751
00:47:37,456 --> 00:47:39,058
She doesn't want anybody
to come in the house.

752
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:41,494
I get that. Right. I understand.

753
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,297
We're playing golf tomorrow.

754
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:47,478
- Yeah?
- I was wondering if you were interested.

755
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,994
Yes. Yes! I would love
to join you. Absolutely!

756
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:52,939
Are you kidding me?
I could dust off the old clubs.

757
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:57,610
- That would be great!
- Okay? So, tee time is 3:00.

758
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,045
- 3:00 p.m.
- 3:00 p.m.

759
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:01,469
Right. So you could come back tomorrow.

760
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:03,082
- Great. 3:00 p.m.
- Okay.

761
00:48:03,182 --> 00:48:04,741
And I didn't see
your shades around back,

762
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,284
but you're more than welcome to look.
I just need you to go around.

763
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,122
Okay. I'll do that.
Hey, you know, I play from the tips.

764
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,826
- That's wonderful.
- From the tips! Okay.

765
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,733
Oh, shit. Blinds.

766
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:40,520
Holy shit!

767
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,988
- Dude, what the fuck?
- What?

768
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:43,656
You invited him to play golf?

769
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:46,759
What was I supposed to do?
I'm sorry. I panicked. I panicked!

770
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:50,824
It's fine. We'll deal with
him tomorrow. Be here, 9:30.

771
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:53,397
We'll finish the job, we play golf.

772
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:58,802
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Yeah.

773
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:01,772
I got it.

774
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:18,944
I don't blame you, you know.

775
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:21,211
No?

776
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:26,830
I wanted to just mush her fucking
face in that cake all day long.

777
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,737
What did it feel like?

778
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:33,128
I don't know.

779
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:37,274
I mean, I was nervous. But...

780
00:49:40,346 --> 00:49:42,721
Did it feel good?

781
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,253
I watched you today.

782
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:49,753
What do you mean? When?

783
00:49:50,622 --> 00:49:52,759
You were cleaning in the kitchen.

784
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,628
With your hands on your knees.

785
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:57,861
And your jeans were
pulling around your...

786
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:01,475
Around my pussy?

787
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:04,217
Yeah.

788
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:08,171
- That's hot.
- It was hot.

789
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:14,912
You talked about putting
your hands around her neck.

790
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:18,256
I got jealous...

791
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,700
- And wet.
- Really?

792
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,065
Really?

793
00:50:33,165 --> 00:50:35,365
You said pussy,
and I went hard in a second.

794
00:50:38,437 --> 00:50:40,403
Oh, God!

795
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,481
Squeeze...

796
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:01,594
I was impressed.
You took control of that situation,

797
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:04,330
and things could have gotten
really hysterical,

798
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,766
but they didn't, and it just...

799
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:09,199
<i>You did good.</i>

800
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,535
Lily asleep?

801
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:16,612
She's right here, next to me. Bad dream.

802
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:20,312
<i>You don't mind taking her
while I golf tomorrow?</i>

803
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:23,281
- Of course.
- And maybe afterwards,

804
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:27,885
we could take Lily to a mini-golf.
With all of us.

805
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:30,456
Maybe.

806
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:32,958
<i>I should get to bed.</i>

807
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:34,856
Good job today.

808
00:51:35,056 --> 00:51:38,898
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

809
00:53:10,745 --> 00:53:13,222
- Hey.
- Hey.

810
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,162
You look like shit. You okay?

811
00:53:16,262 --> 00:53:20,330
I hated her as much as anybody, okay?
But this is way fucked up, you know?

812
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:23,235
- Yeah.
- Morning!

813
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:24,369
Morning.

814
00:53:27,105 --> 00:53:29,811
- What's up?
- This is fucked up.

815
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:33,234
This is way fucked up.

816
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,315
It is. It's totally fucked up.

817
00:53:36,415 --> 00:53:39,051
- And hey, it's all my fault.
- Yeah, no shit.

818
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:42,054
But look. After today, it's done.
Right? Right?

819
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:44,690
Right. Right! Done.

820
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,593
And I feel horrible.
I mean, look, I never wanted...

821
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:50,696
Well, I wanted to, but...

822
00:53:50,796 --> 00:53:52,790
He feels really bad.

823
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,368
- You do?
- I do. Yeah.

824
00:53:56,768 --> 00:53:58,499
Me too.

825
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:00,270
I feel really bad.

826
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,632
I know you do.

827
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:06,610
Let's go cut her up.

828
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,009
Come on!

829
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:17,256
- Hello?
- Hey, we're in here, guys.

830
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:19,825
Good morning. How was the night?

831
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:23,029
Slept till 7! Pretty impressive.

832
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:29,644
Just finished our first egg, and...
Where's Amanda?

833
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:32,872
She's with Lily. She didn't
want to bring her. You know.

834
00:54:32,972 --> 00:54:36,027
She sends her love,
wishes us all the best.

835
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:39,078
Listen. We were talking outside.

836
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:43,349
Yeah, I just... This is really
fucked up, man, you know? It's...

837
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:46,318
- Really fucked up!
- It is. I mean...

838
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:48,554
- I killed your wife.
- I know.

839
00:54:48,654 --> 00:54:51,223
And you guys have all been great,
and especially you, Ward.

840
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:53,358
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

841
00:54:54,553 --> 00:54:58,998
Stacy and I hooked up,
and she got pregnant, but thank God.

842
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:03,169
Although I hate his name. Ramone's the
best thing that's ever happened to me.

843
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:06,805
That name is awful.
It's like a busboy pimp.

844
00:55:06,905 --> 00:55:10,676
- Yeah, it's really bad.
- But it's just a name.

845
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:12,611
At the end of the day, it's just a name.

846
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:16,348
And... she was a not-nice person

847
00:55:16,448 --> 00:55:19,618
whose only happiness
came from her being not-nice.

848
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:25,125
- She was a bad mom, too.
- Yeah. She was selfish, and she was mean.

849
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:29,967
I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
I'm... I'm glad she's...

850
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:36,926
I just want to be happy.

851
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:40,404
Power tools in the garage?

852
00:56:08,634 --> 00:56:10,336
- Really?
- What, what, what?

853
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:12,238
I snapped a blade.

854
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:15,138
All right. I got another one in
the garage. I'll be right back.

855
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,415
You ready? Here we go.

856
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,155
Hey, man. How's it goin' in there?

857
00:56:30,355 --> 00:56:34,348
We snapped a blade, but we're
almost done. How's it goin' here?

858
00:56:34,448 --> 00:56:36,560
- It's good.
- All right.

859
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:49,406
I haven't had a cigarette
in 7 years.

860
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:53,412
I started again last week.

861
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:56,847
- It's my first one.
- Ever?

862
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,420
I feel like Denzel Washington.

863
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,617
All right, okay, all right...

864
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,595
- That tastes so good.
- Tastes so good.

865
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:12,129
Do you guys know what
that shit does to your body?

866
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,198
Fuck it, give me one.

867
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,798
Assholes.

868
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,708
So Amanda and I were talking last night.

869
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:24,541
Yeah?

870
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:29,032
Yeah.

871
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:31,114
Good for you guys.

872
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:35,052
Yeah.

873
00:57:37,055 --> 00:57:38,101
Okay.

874
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:42,094
Tee time is 3:00, that gives us...

875
00:57:42,194 --> 00:57:46,765
a little over 2 hours to find a place,
bury the body, get to the course. Right?

876
00:57:46,865 --> 00:57:49,445
We don't tell each other where we're going.
The less each of us knows, the better.

877
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:51,271
Geena's going to stay with the kids.
Thank you very much.

878
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,341
Ward, when you get home, call the cops.

879
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,974
Say that you came home to find the baby,
but Stacy was gone.

880
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:58,810
Say that she's been gone a day or
two before, but never without Ramone.

881
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,434
Can't file a missing persons
report for 48 hours. So.

882
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:03,015
You guys think this is gonna work?

883
00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:05,284
Yeah. They'll just... they'll just
think that she's left for a little bit.

884
00:58:05,384 --> 00:58:08,320
She doesn't come back, you file it,
police won't make any mention of it.

885
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,589
Hey buddy, I can watch
Ramone whenever you need.

886
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:13,358
Yeah. Me... me too.

887
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,761
- Appreciate it.
- Well, well, well. Howdy, howdy.

888
00:58:15,861 --> 00:58:17,129
Nosey fucker.

889
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:20,599
You guys are already
dressed for golf. Interesting.

890
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:23,464
- I thought we weren't leaving till 3:00.
- Yeah, 3:00.

891
00:58:23,564 --> 00:58:26,305
We just... we came by to help
clean up after the party.

892
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:29,785
Oh, that's right. Yeah, I saw that.

893
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:34,915
So I was thinking maybe,
I'd grab my clubs,

894
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:39,252
throw 'em in your trunk, Ward. The two
of us drive together. Why take two cars?

895
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:42,688
That makes perfect sense,
what with you guys being neighbors.

896
00:58:42,788 --> 00:58:46,358
- That's what I was thinking.
- Yeah. Sure.

897
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:49,261
I got a couple errands I need
to run, but absolutely.

898
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:52,064
- 2:30?
- 2:30. Yeah. Sure. 2:30.

899
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:54,166
- All right. I'll be here.
- See you there.

900
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:55,767
- See you then.
- Okay.

901
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:57,703
- From the tip!
- Yeah!

902
00:58:58,103 --> 00:58:59,771
- What the fuck?
- Don't worry about it.

903
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:02,236
All it means is you gotta
double back and pick him up.

904
00:59:02,736 --> 00:59:05,244
It's fine. Listen to me.
Hey, you'll be fine.

905
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:06,979
Come here.

906
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,812
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Let's do this.

907
00:59:11,182 --> 00:59:13,950
- You wanna fuck?
- Yeah.

908
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,708
Yeah.

909
01:00:20,218 --> 01:00:21,883
Fuck.

910
01:00:22,588 --> 01:00:24,559
Fuck!

911
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,823
Fuck!

912
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:30,093
Stupid...

913
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,963
Piece of shit.

914
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:47,039
- I like the new you.
- All it took was a murder.

915
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:49,747
So where are you gonna bury them?

916
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:55,178
- I was thinking along the Ridge?
- Good idea.

917
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:00,214
Hey. See you later.

918
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:01,586
Yo.

919
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:04,022
- <i>Did you do yours yet?</i>
- Almost. I...

920
01:02:04,122 --> 01:02:06,335
- I just remembered. Do you have the head?
- What?

921
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:07,677
The head. Do you have the beast's head?

922
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:09,462
- We forgot to disfigure it.
- Hold on.

923
01:02:14,499 --> 01:02:18,337
No. I got a torso and an arm. Left arm.

924
01:02:18,437 --> 01:02:22,375
Shit. All right. Damn it.
I gotta call Ronnie. Get it done.

925
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,366
What?

926
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,835
- <i>Yo, do have the head?</i>
- What?

927
01:02:49,935 --> 01:02:53,071
- <i>The head. Do you have the head?</i>
- I don't fucking know.

928
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:57,974
Well, check, all right? We gotta disfigure
the face in case anybody finds it.

929
01:03:00,379 --> 01:03:03,580
<i>What? What's the problem?
Are you crying?</i>

930
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:07,486
This isn't my responsibility, David.

931
01:03:08,086 --> 01:03:10,055
<i>This is not my responsibility.</i>

932
01:03:10,155 --> 01:03:13,525
Okay, look, all right, Ronnie?
Nobody likes this, okay?

933
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,628
But there was a situation here. There was
an accident, kind of, but we can help.

934
01:03:16,728 --> 01:03:19,831
We can help everybody out here.
We can help Tom. We can help Ward.

935
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:21,969
We can help Ramone, all right?
Just check the bag.

936
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:26,805
- <i>Check the fucking bag.</i>
- Okay.

937
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:30,173
Okay, okay. Okay.

938
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,094
Please, please, David,
don't make me do this.

939
01:03:49,194 --> 01:03:52,898
<i>Look... Jesus fucking Christ.
Check the fucking bag.</i>

940
01:03:52,998 --> 01:03:55,115
All right. Fuck!

941
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,276
Fuck.

942
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,632
- Yeah, I have it.
- Okay. All right. Well, you got to...

943
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:17,108
you know.

944
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:19,591
What?

945
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:21,425
You gotta cut her face off
or something, man.

946
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:25,697
Fuck you!

947
01:04:25,797 --> 01:04:27,399
<i>What do you mean?
You have to do this, Ronnie.</i>

948
01:04:27,499 --> 01:04:29,601
- No. No, please!
- <i>You have to do this.</i>

949
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:32,537
- <i>No fucking way, man.</i>
- All right. Where are you?

950
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,206
God! Fuck! I'm not supposed to say.

951
01:04:35,306 --> 01:04:38,643
No. If you did what you were
supposed to do, then you don't say.

952
01:04:38,743 --> 01:04:42,164
If I have to come finish your fucking job,
then you have to say! Now, where are you?

953
01:04:42,464 --> 01:04:46,017
- I'm at the Ridge.
- <i>Great. I'm coming.</i>

954
01:04:46,117 --> 01:04:48,151
The Ridge.

955
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:40,569
No way. I thought for sure
I'd be the only one here.

956
01:05:46,878 --> 01:05:48,521
This is crazy.

957
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:54,884
You okay? What happened?

958
01:05:55,853 --> 01:05:59,355
- I can't fucking do this.
- What are you talking about?

959
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:02,994
What am I talking about?

960
01:06:03,094 --> 01:06:05,330
You killed her.

961
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:09,901
We cut her up into
little fucking pieces.

962
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:13,571
What... what do you mean,
what am I talking about?

963
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:15,674
Yeah. Look, I know this sucks, right?
But we gotta do this.

964
01:06:15,774 --> 01:06:19,669
We have to do this now, okay?
You know what? Look, it's all right.

965
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:22,481
I'll take yours. You already dug a hole.
I'll just put her in and cover it up.

966
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:23,949
- No, you can't.
- Yeah, I can.

967
01:06:24,049 --> 01:06:26,651
No. It's... it's... it's the head.

968
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:28,787
All right. Well,
whatever it is, I'll just...

969
01:06:29,187 --> 01:06:32,257
David said you gotta cut
the fucking face off or something.

970
01:06:32,357 --> 01:06:36,494
Shit. Right. Right. Okay, okay.

971
01:06:38,148 --> 01:06:39,297
Okay.

972
01:06:39,397 --> 01:06:42,200
You know what, man?
This is fucking bullshit.

973
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,370
This is all my fault.

974
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,638
I shouldn't have called
David in the first place.

975
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:55,213
You should've taken it. For all of us.

976
01:06:55,713 --> 01:06:59,951
I didn't do this. I didn't...
I-I didn't fucking do this.

977
01:07:00,051 --> 01:07:03,555
- I have a kid, Ron.
- She had a fucking kid, Tom!

978
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:06,124
Hey, she wasn't doing the right things.

979
01:07:06,224 --> 01:07:08,459
That kid would be a lot
further along developmentally

980
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,695
if she had been a better mother.

981
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:13,031
All right. You don't understand this
because you don't have a kid yet.

982
01:07:13,131 --> 01:07:16,668
But Ramone is almost one,
and he's barely crawling.

983
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:19,446
- What?
- Yeah. She was still breast-feeding.

984
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:23,241
- Exclusively, Ronnie. It's a huge thing.
- What does that even mean?

985
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:26,545
It means she was a shitty mom, not to
mention the kind of wife she was, all right?

986
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:29,047
You said it yourself,
probably more than anyone.

987
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:31,299
But you don't do that to somebody, Tom.

988
01:07:31,399 --> 01:07:34,062
You don't fucking kill somebody
because they're a fucking bitch.

989
01:07:34,162 --> 01:07:37,019
I mean, that doesn't
make any fucking sense.

990
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:39,743
Fuck.

991
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:46,064
Is that why you killed her?
'Cause she's a bitch?

992
01:07:46,164 --> 01:07:49,201
No, I didn't...
I didn't kill her because...

993
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:52,301
That's not it. No.

994
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,448
- Really? You're both here?
- Why'd you kill her?

995
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:00,278
Who gives a shit why you killed her?

996
01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:04,415
Everybody wanted her dead. Ward most of all.
What's fucking done is fucking done.

997
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,449
- This it?
- Yeah.

998
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,355
All right.

999
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:12,488
Oh, here we go.

1000
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,227
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Wait for what, dude?

1001
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:19,298
We got a 3:00 tee time. I gotta tell the
starter that we're gonna play as a five-some.

1002
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:21,833
- I know.
- What...

1003
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:25,753
No fucking way, man.
I am not fucking doing this!

1004
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:28,206
- No, no. We don't have time for this shit.
- No, he's doing it. You're doing it.

1005
01:08:28,306 --> 01:08:31,032
No, just give me the club
and let me beat the bag.

1006
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,978
No. I killed her.

1007
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:37,315
You cut her up. You came up with
the plan. He hasn't done anything.

1008
01:08:37,415 --> 01:08:39,284
Are you crazy?

1009
01:08:39,384 --> 01:08:43,688
I cleaned up blood and fucking cake
for 3 fucking hours last night!

1010
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:46,690
I'm as much of an
accomplice in this as he is.

1011
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:52,061
He's right, man.
You gotta do it, Ronnie.

1012
01:08:57,735 --> 01:09:00,071
I don't know if I can trust you
to keep your mouth shut.

1013
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:02,505
- I got a family, Ron.
- Me too.

1014
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,778
We've been friends for 20 years.

1015
01:09:06,878 --> 01:09:09,478
You really think that I'm...

1016
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,816
Fine. Give it to me.

1017
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,731
You might wanna turn it over
so you get the...

1018
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:29,031
He knows how to hit a 7 iron.

1019
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,739
Fuck!

1020
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:38,575
Oh, no. You gotta... you gotta hit
the bag. Come on. You can do it.

1021
01:09:51,015 --> 01:09:52,121
Okay?

1022
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:55,825
Again, dude.
We really gotta fuck her face up.

1023
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:02,767
Oh, God.

1024
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:05,367
I think it got caught in her mouth.
Just pull it out and do it again.

1025
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:26,391
- That's good, Ronnie. You got it.
- Yeah, that's good.

1026
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:29,728
Ronnie! Ronnie! You're good.

1027
01:10:29,828 --> 01:10:31,769
- Ronnie, you got it. Ronnie?
- No! Fuck!

1028
01:10:32,404 --> 01:10:34,163
That's good.

1029
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:41,838
You owe me.

1030
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,617
I owe you.

1031
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:50,371
- That was dramatic.
- Yeah.

1032
01:10:50,471 --> 01:10:51,750
All right. Let's bury
the rest of this shit.

1033
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:55,753
- Yeah. I'll go get the bags from my car.
- You know what? Give me a couple gloves.

1034
01:10:55,853 --> 01:10:57,255
- I don't have any gloves.
- Golf gloves.

1035
01:10:57,355 --> 01:10:59,355
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1036
01:11:16,592 --> 01:11:17,660
Hey.

1037
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,644
Not a word, you hear me? Not a word.

1038
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,293
We got a real problem here, Ward.

1039
01:11:43,835 --> 01:11:45,428
This is not smart, Ward.

1040
01:11:45,528 --> 01:11:48,505
You are all over this.
Do you understand me?

1041
01:12:07,525 --> 01:12:12,563
Look, I get it, right? You had a party.
Your trash was overflowing.

1042
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:15,324
Right? The trash trucks don't come
for 3 days. I get that.

1043
01:12:15,424 --> 01:12:19,672
But, hey, if somebody wants to look
in here, your name is all over this.

1044
01:12:20,872 --> 01:12:22,805
Is that smart?

1045
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:27,045
It's against the law, Ward.

1046
01:12:27,445 --> 01:12:30,815
Ward, if you need to use some cans,
you can use my cans.

1047
01:12:30,915 --> 01:12:32,180
You and your kinky friends.

1048
01:12:33,918 --> 01:12:35,785
Lesson learned?

1049
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,991
Lesson learned.

1050
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:43,559
All right. That's good cake.

1051
01:12:57,275 --> 01:12:59,708
- Oh, yeah.
- That was...

1052
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:02,578
- Money.
- Yeah.

1053
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:09,020
I'm gonna take a leak.

1054
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,056
Hey, Ward. Come here.

1055
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:14,639
The fucker followed me! He followed me!

1056
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:16,633
- I know, I know, I know. I saw him.
- He pulled the bags...

1057
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:18,663
It's okay. It's okay. Relax. Relax.

1058
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:23,557
<i>He was watching us last night when we
left your house. I think he's a pervert.</i>

1059
01:13:23,957 --> 01:13:27,605
<i>I thought he might... I don't know.
But I got to your place early this morning,</i>

1060
01:13:27,705 --> 01:13:30,508
<i>and just in case, I took a
couple of bags from your trash.</i>

1061
01:13:30,608 --> 01:13:33,278
<i>I switched them out.
I put them in your trunk.</i>

1062
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:36,281
<i>I figured if he tried something,
if he followed one of us,</i>

1063
01:13:36,381 --> 01:13:38,349
<i>it'd most likely be you.</i>

1064
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:40,785
- Where's your phone?
- It's in the cart. I'll go get it.

1065
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,818
Tthat's perfect.

1066
01:13:46,223 --> 01:13:48,626
Hey, it's me. Yeah. Thanks.

1067
01:13:48,726 --> 01:13:51,535
Hey. I'll see you later.

1068
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:53,850
Who the hell was that?

1069
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:02,338
That's Stacy's ringer.

1070
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:06,477
Ward! Your phone's ringing!
It's your wife!

1071
01:14:06,877 --> 01:14:08,479
Tell him to answer it.

1072
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,680
Could you answer that for me?
I'll be right out!

1073
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:14,183
Good.

1074
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:17,708
Much better.

1075
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:22,026
I told her you'd be right out.
She hung up on me.

1076
01:14:22,126 --> 01:14:25,630
- Really?
- Yeah. She sounded pissed too.

1077
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,797
You got your hands full with that one.

1078
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:43,679
I snapped a blade.

1079
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:57,760
There you go. Thanks for doing this.

1080
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,500
Mommy!

1081
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,334
You ready to go eat?

1082
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:15,311
- My ball's back there.
- Sorry.

1083
01:15:19,512 --> 01:15:21,185
Ron hasn't said one word all day.

1084
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:23,721
- He'll be fine.
- He'll be great.

1085
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:25,121
- Take a little time.
- Yeah.

1086
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:30,828
Nice.

1087
01:15:31,228 --> 01:15:32,661
That's tour quality.

1088
01:15:34,798 --> 01:15:37,335
Second best 7 iron he's hit all day.

1089
01:15:40,137 --> 01:15:42,638
- Come on.
- Still hitting!

1090
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:46,811
Great shot, buddy. Great shot.

1091
01:15:47,511 --> 01:15:51,848
Thanks for waiting. I don't think
I'm gonna play from my tips next time.

1092
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,560
When did you, speak to her last?

1093
01:16:04,382 --> 01:16:05,429
Earlier today.

1094
01:16:05,529 --> 01:16:08,866
I think I was actually probably
the last person to speak with her.

1095
01:16:08,966 --> 01:16:12,637
I picked up his phone when we were
on the golf course earlier today.

1096
01:16:12,737 --> 01:16:17,451
- It was a little after 3:00.
- So you spoke to her this afternoon?

1097
01:16:18,209 --> 01:16:20,009
I did.

1098
01:16:35,693 --> 01:16:37,909
I want a cigarette.

1099
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,431
Me too.

1100
01:16:41,031 --> 01:16:43,065
I'll go get 'em.

1101
01:16:51,075 --> 01:16:53,076
You look fucking great.

1102
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:00,351
Okay, just keep your shoulders...

1103
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:03,254
Move your shoulders back.
Hit is straight. Go.

1104
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:04,889
- Hit it. Hit it.
- Hard. Go.

1105
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:06,390
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1106
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:08,192
- Yeah!
- That was awesome.

1107
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:10,027
- See?
- Wait.

1108
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:11,762
Give me 5. Give me 10.

1109
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:18,400
- You're not gonna give me a lesson?
- Sure.

1110
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:28,912
- Yeah.
- You need to... keep your body still.

1111
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:33,584
You guys! Mom, just hit.

1112
01:17:33,684 --> 01:17:36,621
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just hit, just hit.

1113
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:40,131
- Yes! Did you see that?
- No, we missed it.

1114
01:17:40,231 --> 01:17:42,558
- I did it.
- I don't believe you.

1115
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:30,494
There you go.

1116
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,576
Thank you.

1117
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,545
Miss Peters?

1118
01:18:47,825 --> 01:18:48,824
Hi.

1119
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,562
- May I?
- Please.

1120
01:18:51,662 --> 01:18:53,562
Thank you.
