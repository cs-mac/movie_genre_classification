2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,548
(Busy street traffic)

3
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:33,815
(Siren in distance)

4
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,910
(Horn tooting)

5
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,919
WOMAN: Shh.

6
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,761
Mommy and Daddy decided to have you.

7
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,541
Well, we didn't really decide.
It just happened.

8
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,749
When you were born, we were very happy.

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,249
And we still are.

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,499
But separately.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,999
Daddy has his apartment
and Mommy has her apartment.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,719
And Daddy can see Lulu whenever he wants.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,460
Everything is great.

14
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,291
Now your grandpa is coming to visit

15
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,541
and you have to be very cuddly with him

16
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:13,624
because not long ago.

17
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,627
Granny ﬂew away into the sky.

18
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,999
And now Papi is sad and lonely.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,207
But Auntie Rose is coming, too.

20
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,124
It's going to be a par-ty!
Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!

21
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:30,291
TV: Today marks the sixth consecutive day
the man that calls himself the Oak Fairy

22
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:33,874
remains perched and tied
to the oldest oak tree in Central Park,

23
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,791
refusing to come down until officials
bring him written proof

24
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,916
the tree will not be cut down.

25
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,374
No news yet from Mayor Bloomberg's office.

26
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,541
- We'll keep you posted as...
- Save the trees or die!

27
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,957
OAK FAIRY: Save the trees! Save the trees!
I will not come down.

28
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,999
(Cheering and blasts of whistles)

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,374
I'm the Oak Fairy
and I have a message for New York.

30
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:56,707
If I can do it here, I can do it anywhere.
It's up to you, New York.

31
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,249
- That's my heavy bud.
- Time you got in your own bed.

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,082
I have provisions for five months
and I have a device here

33
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,499
that can turn snow into drinking water.

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,628
- We love you!
- I will not come down!

35
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,545
Let's ﬂy!

36
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,710
- It's funny.
- Oh, what?

37
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,957
I always feel way more comfortable
having sex without the kids in bed.

38
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,924
- Me, too. It's crazy.
- It's crazy.

39
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,340
- It's so weird. I don't know why.
- It's so weird.

40
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,999
- We can do all sorts of shit.
- They're kind of in the way.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,666
I know.

42
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,707
- (Phone rings)
- Uh-oh.

43
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,707
- Now, that's...
- No.

44
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,426
- I need to take this.
- Oh, come on.

45
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:35,874
- It's probably my dad. It is my dad. Ow.
- He's a big boy.

46
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,799
(She speaks French)

47
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,635
Oh, God.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,582
OK. He's already up.

49
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,832
OK...hon...

50
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,999
maybe this is a little too much this week.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,957
You've got your family coming to visit,
your exhibit, you're selling your soul...

52
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,207
You're so sweet to worry about me
but I want my dad to be here

53
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,207
because it's very important for me.

54
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,124
It's my biggest exhibit in years.

55
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,999
I just want what's best for you.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,843
- Know what's best for me?
- What?

57
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:16,332
I really want them to meet
my sweet, sweet, little koala bear.

58
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,374
Who's my sweet, little koala bear?

59
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,624
- Is that what I have to say to get laid?
- Yes. Say it. Say it.

60
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,457
I have to say I'm your koala bear?

61
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,999
Yes. You know what koala bears do?

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,749
They go up and down the trees.

63
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,874
You know, like... (Giggles)

64
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,999
No, no, but... Oh, my God.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,749
- No, no. It's a fur ball, sweetie.
- (Meows)

66
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,124
- No!
- No, I gotta take care of that.

67
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,124
It's... Last time, Lulu ate it. I can't.

68
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,124
Plus you're always going down on me
with the glasses. It's weird.

69
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,416
I know. I was gonna take 'em off.

70
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,124
WOMAN: Let me fill you in.

71
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,207
I met Mingus through his sister Elizabeth,

72
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,999
who's been my friend
ever since I moved to New York.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,082
A few years ago, Mingus and I ended up
working together at the Village Voice.

74
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,082
Lulu was about eight months old

75
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:03,374
and things had started to get sort of...
messy with Jack.

76
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,457
Around that time,
Mingus became my confidant of sorts.

77
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,707
What's gonna happen to me if I leave him?

78
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,457
Hey, when things go bad,
it's best to just walk.

79
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,249
- I walked twice and didn't regret it.
- But you're a man. It's easier for you.

80
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,999
Who's gonna want me? OK?
I'm gonna be 38.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,999
- I'm fat and a pain in the ass.
- But you're French.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,624
I have a kid.
I'm struggling with incontinence.

83
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,374
OK? Don't tell anyone.

84
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,374
I can't even sneeze.
But I'm doing my exercise. OK?

85
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,541
I'm squeezing right now.
I'm squeezing everywhere I go.

86
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:35,332
When I'm taking pictures.
I'm squeezing all the time. Right now I am.

87
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,791
Squeezing, squeezing, squeezing,
squeezing, squeezing, squeezing.

88
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,166
OK. I'm letting go.

89
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,419
I'm squeezing again.

90
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,957
Squeezing, squeezing.
I'm squeezing all the time.

91
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,291
Let's face it, my love life is over.

92
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,999
37. We haven't had sex in one year.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,749
- Get outta here!
- He doesn't even want a blow job.

94
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,798
- It was my speciality.
- Oh.

95
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,374
Who is this guy? You're fucked, man.
Just go pump.

96
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,457
I know. I gotta go. Oh, it hurts.

97
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,124
- Pump.
- Yeah, I gotta pump.

98
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,541
OK. I'll see you at the photo shoot.
I'm so sad.

99
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,916
(Sobs)

100
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,749
- Come on, Frenchie. You're gonna be good.
- It's over.

101
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,166
I've known you a while. You'll bounce back.

102
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,249
- You mean like a big ball?
- Like a big beachball.

103
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,877
(She sobs)

104
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,791
- He hates me. He hates me. He hates me.
- No, no, no, no.

105
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,170
Come on, blow.

106
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,957
And the post-baby big ball that I was
bounced right into his arms.

107
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,166
Was it pity? Was it love?

108
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,457
Was it my innocent comment about blow jobs?

109
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,166
I'll never be sure.

110
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:40,207
All I know is that six months later,
baby in hand, I was moving in with Mingus.

111
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,832
And so far, so good.
Actually, things have never been better.

112
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,586
♪ ..On old Delancey Street, you know.

113
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:51,251
♪ The subway charms us so.

114
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:55,041

00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,170

Is that it?

117
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,718
Do I need to look anywhere else, sir?

118
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,666
What the hell is this thing?

119
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,669
(Indian music)

120
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,874
- Oh, New York, we made it, baby! We made it!
- Oh.

121
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,624
If we can make it here,
we can make it anywhere!

122
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,093
Oh la la.

123
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,718
(Piano music)

124
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,166
Hey! Look who's here!

125
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,999
- International sausage smugglers!
- Oh, Mingus!

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,957
Jeannot! Jeannot.

127
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,749
- Pleased to meet you.
- Kiss!

128
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,082
- Kiss! One, two, three.
- Three.

129
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,130
Whoo!

130
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,131
I never got three before.

131
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,499
He had so many presents for us - sausages -
but they took it at Customs.

132
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,749
They took the sausage but not the smell.

133
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,207
So you're giving us
something right now. Whoo!

134
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,124
And you must be the famous sister, Rose.

135
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,874
Er...yes. Famous for what, please?

136
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,469
Uh...pleased to meet you.

137
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,541
Famous Rose.

138
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,874
- And you are?
- Oh, I'm Man...

139
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,549
Super nice meeting you.
I'm Rose's boyfriend.

140
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,212
I used to be Marion's boyfriend
but now I'm with Rose.

141
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,340
Sweet. Sweet. I gotta make a call.

142
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,926
- Don't sweat it. I can sleep anywhere. I'm easy.
- Good for you.

143
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,957
Ming. You like Salt-N-Pepa?

144
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,999
You mean, like seasoning on food?

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,503
No, I mean the rap...the rap band.

146
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,499
You know. "Let's talk about sex, baby.
Let's talk about you and me."

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,457
Anyway... It was a big song in New York.

148
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,374
- You must know that.
- 20 years ago.

149
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,719
- Oh, yeah. Maybe.
- Yeah.

150
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:40,593
My dad...he doesn't want to take a shower.
He thinks it depletes the immune system.

151
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,957
- Depletes it? My God.
- I know. And it's gonna smell...

152
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,707
- I know.
- He smells now.

153
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,332
(Shower running)

154
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,374
Uh... Are you mad at me
for this guy coming?

155
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,582
Sorry. I had no idea my
sister would bring him.

156
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,124
Should I be mad? It's just your ex
camped out in our living room.

157
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,707
My ex? Did he say that?

158
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,332
Yes, he said he's your ex.

159
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,374
He's crazy. He's out of his mind.
He's totally delusional.

160
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,249
We fooled around 100 years ago.

161
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,999
- Barely fooled around.
- I've fooled around with you.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,877
You get serious when you fool around.

163
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:12,291
He's mildly schizophrenic.
He's totally crazy.

164
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,999
You can't be "mildly schizophrenic".

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,874
He hears the nice voices talking to him?
He would have killed Ringo and not John?

166
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,207
OK. Listen. Do you like my dad?
That's way more important.

167
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,207
- Look how cute he is.
- He's very cute.

168
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,457
- We're so alike. We're like twins.
- I know. I just want to fuck him right now.

169
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,124
OK. I'm sorry about the guy.
I'm sorry she brought him.

170
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,584
- It'll work out but I gotta go to work.
- OK. Bye, sweetie.

171
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,551
- I gotta get this call.
- We go.

172
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,342
OK.

173
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,082
If you can find somebody that'll do
a funny show about Haiti, hire 'em.

174
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,166
- Cos I'm not the guy.
- Mingus.

175
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,791
- Mingus, may I have a towel?
- Hold on a second.

176
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,291
Towels, cabinet, bathroom.

177
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,541
- The towels are in the cabinet?
- Yeah. The lower cabinet.

178
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,041
- Oh, OK.
- OK.

179
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,465
Well, who's gonna do it'? Well...

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,832
I gotta call you back.

181
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,677
Yeah. I gotta call you back.
Something just came up.

182
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,586
ROSE: Mingus, are you leaving? Wait!

183
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,124
That's...my robe.

184
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,624
I'm so sorry. I couldn't find the towels.

185
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,423
Do you have a cup of tea? I'm so cold.

186
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,291
Well, the kettle's over there.

187
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:49,832
I hear you take really good care of Jack's kid.
Thank you. From my father and I, thank you.

188
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,291
Lulu's my man.

189
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,624
I have so much admiration for you.

190
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,832
My God, raising the child of another man.

191
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,499
You're so um...

192
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,332
What is the word?

193
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,332
Open-minded? Yes'?

194
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,624
Yeah, but...l have my limits. I gotta.

195
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,499
But the situation must be
difficult for you, no?

196
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,049
- I gotta go. OK? Take care.
- Bye, Mingus.

197
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,590
(Giggles)

198
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,635
My dad.

199
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,752
For once, Manu's right. My father
has always been a very handsome man.

200
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:40,251
He was born in Saigon, Vietnam,
a French colony at the time.

201
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,624
At 18, Jeannot was sent
to fight in Algeria,

202
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,707
but refused to kill
and was shipped back to France...

203
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,541
spending three years cleaning the toilets
of 752 dirty soldiers.

204
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,624
Or, as he likes to put it,

205
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,549
seeing more shit than any human being
has ever seen.

206
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,416
Then Jeannot went to Paris
where he met my mother, Anna,

207
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,916
during May 1968 on a Parisian barricade.

208
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,832
They immediately fell in love

209
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,166
and for 40 years, they
stayed happy together...

210
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,215
until fate separated them.

211
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,207
Why didn't I find someone like my dad
when I was 25?

212
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,624
Someone I would have loved all my life.

213
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,541
Maybe times have changed.

214
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,876
In the 1900s, life
expectancy used to be 45.

215
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,874
Now if you meet the love
of your life at 25,

216
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,173
you get to live with him
for the next 60 years.

217
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,457
That's a lot of sex with the same person.

218
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,086
Or...no sex at all for 60 years.

219
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,082
Hey.

220
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,749
No, no, no, no. What are you talking about?
I guess she needed a robe.

221
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,832
Yo, homes, you're looking parched.

222
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,457
- Have you been waiting...
- I'm in the middle of something.

223
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,957
..Girls to come out of the ocean
in DayGlo bikinis?

224
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,957
I'll talk to you later. Love you.

225
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,166
She sidles up to you and
whispers in your ear,

226
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,291
"“Ay...Papi...Cola."

227
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,291
And we are...back.

228
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:05,874
My girlfriend's family just
got in fresh from Paris.

229
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,666
Well, not exactly fresh.
My father-in-law - or girlfriend's father...

230
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:15,124
was detained at Customs for four hours
for trying to smuggle in 30lb of sausage.

231
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:19,175
We've got people trying to get bombs in
and cocaine.

232
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:24,082
He seems to think that there's
a sausage shortage in America.

233
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,006
You gotta hand it to Homeland Security.

234
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:28,594
You come in here with a sausage,
they will get you.

235
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,624
The vulnerability of man.
But I'm very excited about the soul.

236
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,548
We're gonna sell the soul for $10,000.

237
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,249
Oh, and I forgot to mention,

238
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,707
tomorrow at my gallery opening,
as an attempt to stand out as an artist,

239
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,166
I am selling my soul.

240
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,885
- What?
- Yes, you've heard right.

241
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,624
It is not a figure of speech.

242
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:57,749
Tomorrow I will sign this contract
and it will be sold as a conceptual piece.

243
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,916
- You're selling Marion's soul for $10,000?
- It's gonna go like hotcakes.

244
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,166
OK. I will talk to my
sister for one second.

245
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,707
I am an artist, too.

246
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,335
I'd love to show you a little...

247
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,791
Oh, non, non.

248
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,999
The woman in freeze frame
kind of represents to me

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,041
like the eternal femininity, you know?

250
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,541
- Yes.
- It's pretty French.

251
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,794
Very French.

252
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,707
I'd love to do a show in your gallery.

253
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,832
It's a teeny space but I could use it
and put my stuff in it.

254
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,832
Do inst... I wouldn't do it like that.
I would do installation plus photos.

255
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,957
- It would be a party here.
- We can talk about it.

256
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,999
- You love this one, right?
- Yeah. Oh, I love it. I love it.

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,166
- People like that.
- The garbage one.

258
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,669
No, the one with the titty.

259
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,166
I bring everything at the show.

260
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,046
My photos, my sculptures.
I do stuff also in macramé.

261
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,707
- I love this country. See you.
- Bye.

262
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,426
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Marion.

263
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,919
(Frantic string music)

264
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,916
- Ah.
- On.

265
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:46,332
- Oh, Willow. Oh, sweetie, you're home?
- I got off early and picked up Willow.

266
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,131
- Oh, great.
- Hi, Mingus. Willow.

267
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,207
- Hello, Mingus.
- Willow, this is my family.

268
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,927
My dad, my sister and...a friend.

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,999
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Thank you.

270
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,002
You're an artist just like me.

271
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,874
- You beautiful girl.
- Thank you.

272
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,999
And Dad says you don't speak English.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,502
You can do sign language.

274
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,798
Me? (lmitates engine)

275
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,416
New York, New York!

276
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,964
Oh...

277
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,124
- Thai?
- Sweetie, do you think you can book

278
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,249
an appointment at Thai Hands for my dad?

279
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,999
Yeah, yeah. We can go together.
I could use one myself.

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,791
You all clean?

281
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:36,332
Hey, look at my KKK bunny!

282
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,499
Sweetie.

283
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,207
White power!
He should be proud of his whiteness.

284
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,302
Hello?

285
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,837
Do you know where I can score
some good New York weed?

286
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,718
- I don't smoke, man.
- You don't smoke?

287
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,374
No, I don't smoke.

288
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,999
Don't forget to call your sister
about dinner tonight.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,627
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,666
Here we go.

291
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,874
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm pretty good.

292
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,416
- Nice to see you.
- My father-in-law, Jeannot.

293
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,207
- Nice to meet you.
- Come in, Jeannot.

294
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,999
So, um...

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,999
man or a woman?

296
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,582
- Woman.
- Woman. OK.

297
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,332
Woman. That's good.
I usually take a man but...

298
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,457
- Man?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

299
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,133
My back is really bad and, I mean,
I need a massage.

300
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:31,082
Uh... Would you like it hard or soft?

301
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,130
What?

302
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,374
You know what, just get him a woman.

303
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,424
- And a soft... You know, something soft.
- Sure.

304
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,124
OK. OK. OK.

305
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,957
And then we steam.

306
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,832
We go steam. (Hisses)

307
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,291
- Steam.
- Steam. (Hisses)

308
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,499
- Steams?
- Yeah. It's relaxing.

309
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,082
- You gotta take off your hat, though.
- Hat? No.

310
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,962
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just get the steam all over you.

311
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,457
Yeah, yeah, just come on in.

312
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,499
Enjoy the steam.

313
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,218
Just breathe it in and...

314
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,385
..and um...

315
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,207
You breathe it in and it'll relax you.

316
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,710
It'll relax you.

317
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,965
Very relaxing.

318
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,964
Omar? Omar?

319
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,832
No, no. No crabs here.
This place is spotless.

320
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,624
We're in America.

321
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:33,999
You know, after the steam,
we put our underwear back on, and the robe,

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,541
and we go get our massage.

323
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,089
Massage.

324
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,085
You and Marion good?

325
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,707
Oh... Yeah. We're good. We're good.

326
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,791
Good good?

327
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,510
Jack sex...

328
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,541
Ohh...

329
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,166
Oh, that's...

330
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,291
You want details?

331
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,501
Uh...no, you're not getting details.

332
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,458
Mingus sex...good.

333
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,707
- OK.
- Good sex.

334
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,499
- Good.
- Yes.

335
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,050
- Jeannot, ready?
- Ah, yes. Hot.

336
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,374
Yes. Ooh.

337
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,874
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Jeannot!

338
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,927
Jeannot, no, no, no, no.
You need your robe! Le robe.

339
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,628
Jeannot! Jeannot,
Jeannot, Jeannot, Jeannot.

340
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,502
Full massage.

341
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,794
(Buzzer)

342
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,676
- Hello?
- It's me.

343
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,249
No, not...

344
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,707
Not ad services.

345
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,791
No, repair.

346
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,465
Repair.

347
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,672
Repair!

348
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,957
Yes. That's the right address.
I'm dealing with this broken buzzer.

349
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,707
- Yes.
- I'm Rose.

350
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,957
- I'm Mingus's sister.
- Nice to meet you.

351
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,541
First, I'd like to tell you that your
automated system is not working properly. OK?

352
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,999
Well, don't... Don't have an attitude.

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,166
OK, fine. Fine. OK, yeah, my name.

354
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,832
OK, it's Dupré. Dupré. Dupré.

355
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,707
D...like Dick.

356
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,082
U like Uterus. P like Penis.

357
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,999
(Laughs) No, I'm not being rude.
I'm just spelling my name.

358
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,957
OK, fine. D like Daisies.
U like Unicorn. P like Paradise.

359
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,416
R like Roses.

360
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,260
E like...

361
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,916
..Estrogen. I'm sorry.

362
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:11,541
Well, yeah, you have an accent too.
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:16,291
No. OK, don't get angry. OK?
Are they coming tomorrow? I need to know.

364
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,920
Thank you. I didn't mean to...
Yeah, thank you.

365
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,999
Thank you. Yes.

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,499
- Hi, everyone.
- (Music spills from headphones)

367
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,207
Hey.

368
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,874
Wait. Look at that.

369
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,249
Hup, hup. Hup.

370
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,968
Better, huh?

371
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,551
(Speaks Vietnamese)

372
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,881
Oh, Mingus! Sit down.

373
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,499
Come. Have tea with us.

374
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,957
You know, your father-in-law was born
in the same street as I was.

375
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,835
Jeannot, I had no idea you spoke Thai.

376
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,082
- No. It's Vietnamese.
- Vietnamese.

377
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,374
Oh, Vietnamese. I'm sorry.
I thought, cos the sign said Thai massage.

378
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,416
We're all from Saigon.

379
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:03,207
Saigon. Shit. Still in Saigon.

380
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,677
Apocalypse Now! (Laughs)

381
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,753
It's cool you guys understand each other.

382
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,999
You should use it more often.

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,082
- Mingus, can you help me open this?
- Sure.

384
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,710
No. Let me show her something.

385
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,048
She's not hungry.

386
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:00,832
Did anybody told you
that you look like Beyoncé?

387
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,832
Beyoncé?

388
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:06,124
- A lot, actually.
- Really? That's a first.

389
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,291
Maybe just a little sexier.

390
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,714
Mm.

391
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,877
Cheesecake?

392
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:18,499
So, Jeannot, did you like your massage?

393
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,923
- Who's the creep?
- My sister's boyfriend.

394
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,707
- He says you happy with Obama, man?
- Oh, I'm very happy with Obama.

395
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,124
I mean, there's been a
couple of rough patches,

396
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:46,505
but just because he's a black president
doesn't mean I can't get critical.

397
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,176
That's it?

398
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,457
Do radio?

399
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,624
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

400
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,791
I do a radio show but I also write articles
for the Voice.

401
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,669
That's where I met Marion.

402
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,374
- You have a show, too, right?
- Yeah, I have a few shows.

403
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,174
Two on public radio and one on serious.

404
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,457
Dead! No good.

405
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,541
Air-conditioning no good.

406
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,591
- Yeah, but it comes in handy in the summer.
- True.

407
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,083
- Is everything OK? Are you fighting?
BOTH: No.

408
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,416
Man...you're so lucky to be black.

409
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,207
That's my only regret, you know.

410
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:18,999
Cos I would have been a cool black man.
I'm talking Miles or Prince.

411
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,291
But I'm Jewish, you know.
It's good, too.

412
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:24,457
It's almost the same.
We've both been buked forever. Tough shit.

413
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,382
- Buked?
- Big-time, bro. Open your eyes.

414
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,669
Open your eyes.

415
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,457
(She laughs) I can't.

416
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,631
- You been buked?
- I been buked - apparently.

417
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,457
What's going on here?

418
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,916
Brothers and sisters
should love one another.

419
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,966
It is love, honey.
It's just um...crazy love.

420
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,795
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

421
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:15,794
- Shit.
- Can this thing calm down'?

422
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,666
It's OK. My dad is...

423
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,420
(Laughs) Bad girl.

424
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,885
Marion, can you stop this right now'?

425
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,541
I'm doing nothing wrong.
What am I doing'?

426
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,624
Don't bother. They're sisters.
They're always like that.

427
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,332
I've known them forever.
I gave her her first orgasm.

428
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,832
(Buzzer)

429
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,832
- What is that? Why is it so loud?
- Both of them.

430
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,082
I'm sorry. It's gonna be fixed. Tomorrow.

431
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,461
- Shit, I think it's for me.
- For you?

432
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:57,375
Who the hell's there?
Another sister I don't know about?

433
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,916
I'm sorry. She drives me crazy.

434
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,666
Is there something I should know?

435
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:08,291
When she was a kid, we thought she was
really possessed - like by the devil.

436
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,082
We were worried about her.

437
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,957
- What's going on with you?
- She told me Lulu is autistic. OK?

438
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,999
- Do you think that's acceptable?
- She didn't. You made the jump.

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,457
- You make these jumps.
- Is Marion's dad OK?

440
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,874
He's fine.

441
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,749
- No, I never jump.
- We know Lulu's not autistic.

442
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,082
He's smarter than your whole family.

443
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,916
Who's that?

444
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,624
All right.

445
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,624
Of course. It's what I do. It's my job.

446
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,749
- How you doing?
- Who's that man?

447
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,254
He didn't. No, he did.

448
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,840
- I'm looking for heady stuff.
- OK.

449
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:43,302
- Super strong.
- OK. I got four kinds.

450
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,457
- That's not right.
- There you go.

451
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,957
- What is that man giving to Lulu's uncle?
- Nothing.

452
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:55,957
- He just gave him a little bag.
- It's grass. From the park. Central Park.

453
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,707
Why is he paying money
for grass from the park?

454
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:02,832
Because it's a souvenir that he's planning
on taking back to France.

455
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,499
They don't have grass in France.

456
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,999
I think it's time for
you to go to bed, huh?

457
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,541
- Good night, everybody.
- Let's go, sweetie.

458
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:12,207
Tell her all about...
that there's no grass in France.

459
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,082
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,551
- Please.
- Yes, I know.

461
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:18,374
- Deal with this right now.
- I'm gonna handle it right now.

462
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,377
I'm gonna handle it right now.

463
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,252
Lulu's up. He's asking for you.

464
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,874
Well...

465
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,791
It don't happen again, man.

466
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,666
Don't happen again.

467
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,090
- It don't.
- It don't. Ever.

468
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,416
It better don't.

469
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,886
It don't. I'm serious. It don't.

470
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,210
Papa.

471
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,173
Give me a kiss. Mwah.

472
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,416
What you got for me? Yeah!

473
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,341
All right, guys. Sleep tight.

474
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,791
Don't close the door.
I'm scared of Teddy.

475
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,457
- Teddy who?
- Ted Bundy, Dad.

476
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,207
Oh, he's dead with Hitler.
You don't have to worry about him.

477
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,791
Good grief.

478
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:53,374
Besides, serial killers don't
kill little girls. Good night.

479
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,127
Good night, fake daddy.

480
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:02,249
I can't stand that Willow's mother
doesn't monitor what she watches on TV.

481
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,082
All this fuckin' serial killer shit.

482
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,207
By the way, Lulu called
me "fake daddy“ again."

483
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:13,207
Oh, no. I gotta call Jack.
I can't believe he's still doing this.

484
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,881
(Siren in background)

485
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,332
You know...she was
walking around naked today.

486
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,874
- What?
- I was in my office.

487
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,624
She was walking around naked.
Is that a French thing?

488
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,416
Naked? She was naked-naked?

489
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,999
Naked-naked. I mean...

490
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,166
She's an exhibitionist
and she used to be much worse.

491
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:03,166
She used to be a nympho.
Don't worry, it's nothing personal.

492
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,291
She does it to everybody.
It's like a first contact.

493
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,541
It's like dogs sniffing each other's ass.

494
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,294
(Elevator bell pings)

495
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,082
Oh!

496
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,542
The bloody elevator.
It always does this. Hang on one second.

497
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,631
Of course.

498
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,332
I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here.

499
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,332
Wait a minute. Is that a joint?

500
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,582
Yes. It's OK. I'm a psychiatrist.
It's prescribed for my condition.

501
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,707
- I suffer from panic attacks.
- Me, too. Big ones.

502
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,210
Oh...

503
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,877
(Speaks French)

504
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,631
- Oh!
- (They laugh)

505
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,176
(Kissing)

506
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:10,124
Sweetie, I don't think I can...
with my dad in the living room.

507
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,916
- (Snoring)
- I hear him. He's asleep. Don't you hear him?

508
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,624
He's knocked out.

509
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,627
- He's knocked out.
- OK.

510
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,082
(They moan softly)

511
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,586
(Door opens and closes)

512
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:27,169
- (Giggling)
- Oh...

513
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,916
They're back.

514
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:33,166
It's OK. It's OK.
They're gonna go to sleep.

515
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,794
OK.

516
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,085
(Door shuts)

517
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,416
They're... They're...
They're together in the bathroom.

518
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,291
So?

519
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,916
(Thudding)

520
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,965
(Giggling)

521
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,960
(Repetitive thudding)

522
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,874
- No.
- Oh, my God, no.

523
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,666
No!

524
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,457
- (Sighs)
- OK.

525
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,166
MARION: It's stopped.

526
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,169
- Well, I guess...
- (Low buzzing)

527
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,465
OK. Now they're brushing their teeth.

528
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:22,582
No, no, no! That's my electric toothbrush.

529
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:25,624
That's not yours.
It's probably theirs. They brought it.

530
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:29,749
No, no, no. I know that one. I know the sound.
That's my electric toothbrush.

531
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,374
- (Thudding resumes)
- What's that?

532
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,832
They're brushing their teeth
while they're doing it, I guess.

533
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,666
No, no, no. They're doing something freaky
with my toothbrush.

534
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,635
- No.
- My toothbrush is off limits.

535
00:34:41,636 --> 00:34:43,666
Do something. Go now.

536
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,291
I can't go.
I can't see my sister doing it. OK?

537
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,332
Oh, stop it. It's your sister and your ex.
You've seen them naked.

538
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,999
- Go in there.
- I'm not going. I'm not going in there.

539
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,844
- I'm not going in there.
- I'm supposed to go?

540
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,710
(Manu moans)

541
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,427
OK. They're done.

542
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,169
- They're done now.
- OK.

543
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,457
I think they're done.

544
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,999
- I mean...
- (Grunting)

545
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,082
- Yeah, they're done.
- All right.

546
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,124
- OK. Good night.
- All right.

547
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,791
Tomorrow, can you make it a priority
to find them a place?

548
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,385
Of course, sweetie.

549
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,582
Mm.

550
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,585
(Raucous chatter)

551
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,294
Mm...mm...

552
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:40,791
Mingus...l hug you.

553
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:44,582
I love you, Mingus.

554
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,210
(Gibbering)

555
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,624
Aarrhh!

556
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,124
(Guests chuckling)

557
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,416
(Screams)

558
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,374
Sweetie, what is it?

559
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,423
I'm not a pig. I'm not a pig.

560
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,340
I know you're not a pig.

561
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,707
It was just a bad dream.

562
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,999
JEANNOT: Ha-ha! Mr. le Cowboy...
- Morning, Daddy!

563
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,791
- ..L'lndien va te tuer!
- Hi, Mingus. Good morning.

564
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,341
Hey, Mingus. How are you doing?

565
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:20,667
Food. Um-yum-yum-yum.

566
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,999
Your family's hungry
and it's making me nervous.

567
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,707
They're like a reverse Waiting For Godot.

568
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:30,749
Wherever you look, there's always one
just lurking in the corner.

569
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,218
- I like it.
- It's nice.

570
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,544
(Buzzing)

571
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,209
Mm-hm.

572
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,791
(Rose laughs)

573
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:18,541
Oh, Mingus, please. Coffee.

574
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,332
Yeah. I'll get it. I'll get it.

575
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,791
I love your T-shirt, Mingus.

576
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,796
- (She giggles)
- Me, too, Mingus.

577
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:30,886
- Good?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

578
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,960
No American coffee.

579
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,916
Juice? No?

580
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:40,082
Oh, sausage juice.
Please, no sausage juice. It's bad for you.

581
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,707
You two wife?

582
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:45,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was divorced twice.

583
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,582
Er, marriage...

584
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,499
Marion not good'?

585
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,844
Marion... (Exhales)

586
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,666
Eh...free.

587
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,666
Marion very free.

588
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,791
Easy Rider.

589
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,457
Oh, Easy Rider. Rider, Rider... Like uh...

590
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,291
Yeah. I can see the resemblance
to Peter Fonda.

591
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:05,965
(Laughs)

592
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,207
Good! Peter Fonda.

593
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,749
Very funny.

594
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,791
(Laughs)

595
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,874
You understand my humour?

596
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,416
(Laughs)

597
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:21,707
- You understand me?
- Oh, yes. Marion. Very much...Peter Fonda.

598
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,957
Vroom, vroom, vroom. Vroooom.

599
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,791
OK.

600
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,749
- Is good, eh?
- Yeah.

601
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,548
Lucky me.

602
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,841
- Lucky me?
- I'm lucky...

603
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,502
..fortunate...

604
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,874
..to be with your daughter.

605
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,916
It's a good thing.

606
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,749
What?

607
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,593
Um...

608
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,506
Your daughter nice.

609
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,877
- Nice?
- Nice.

610
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,791
No, not "night". Nice.

611
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,124
- Nice.
- Nice.

612
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,749
Very nice?

613
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,922
Ahh.

614
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,957
I like you, Mingus.

615
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,586
- Good man. Kitty-kitty-kiddee.
- Uh...yeah.

616
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,999
(Mingus laughs nervously)

617
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,791
Mingus.

618
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,875
Yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy...

619
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,966
Kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
(Laughs)

620
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,291
Kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty.

621
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:26,291
Peter Fonda. Peter Fonda.

622
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,874
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

623
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,594
(Laughs nervously) I'll get the coffee.

624
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:51,916
Do you happen to have
French family members visiting?

625
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,957
Yes, my dad and sister.

626
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,374
Well, your sister and some guy
were in the elevator smoking pot.

627
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,957
And they were very rude.

628
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,666
I'm going to call the landlord.

629
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:04,832
All the noise all the time. We've had enough.
The whole building complains about you.

630
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,957
- Cos my kids make too much noise?
- Your son painted the mailbox.

631
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,166
What are you talking about?
He's not even three.

632
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,714
I'm gonna have you evicted.

633
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,082
OK, fine.

634
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,791
I don't give a shit cos
I have nothing to lose.

635
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,635
I have a brain tumour.

636
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,082
- What?
- (Bell pings)

637
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,999
Stage four.

638
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,207
I only have three months left.
My family is visiting to say goodbye.

639
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,874
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
- (Bell pings)

640
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:35,166
Now you know. I only have three weeks left
before I go into a coma, bitch,

641
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,957
but maybe you can have me evicted
while I'm on my deathbed.

642
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,749
Is that what you want?

643
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,207
I am so sorry.

644
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,381
I had no idea.

645
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,874
Is there anything I can do?

646
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,957
My husband is a surgeon at Lennox Hill,
you know.

647
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,962
- (Bell pings)
- Thank you. But it's too late.

648
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,666
- I saved you a croissant.
- Thanks.

649
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,582
Everything OK?

650
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,124
Yeah, but I had a fight
with that neighbour again.

651
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,548
In the elevator, she attacked me.
I had to...

652
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,166
Made up some story to get out of it.
It's like horrible.

653
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:13,999
- What was she mad about?
- That...

654
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,166
The mailboxes again. Believe it or not.

655
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,207
Maybe you shouldn't let Lulu paint them.

656
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,749
It was an art project.

657
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,124
And, on top of it, it was Willow's idea.

658
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,749
- So now it's Willow's fault?
- I'm not saying that.

659
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,124
- You just said it was Willow's fault.
- No, I'm saying it was her idea.

660
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,791
She has a lot of ideas like that.

661
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,332
- Like doing funny things all the time.
- She's a kid.

662
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,707
It's a nice project. It was nice.
It's pretty. I have no problem with it.

663
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,707
But she has a dark side.
She's always having crazy ideas.

664
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,957
- Dark? She's dark now?
- Come on, admit it.

665
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,582
She's got a dark side and I believe
she's gonna end up being goth.

666
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,082
She's borderline goth.

667
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:49,874
- A little black goth girl?
- Yeah. Maybe she'll be the first black goth girl.

668
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,916
I'm sorry. It probably has a lot to do with
how fucked-up your relationship with your...

669
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:56,707
- ex-wife was.
- Wait a minute. How did we get there?

670
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,749
I mean, you act like you and Jack
were just perfect.

671
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,128
- OK...
- You want to go back to Jack? You want that?

672
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:04,332
Do you want the fighting and the bickering?

673
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,832
- Want me to call him?
- Who's the bickerer now'?

674
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,707
- Oh, really?
- Keep it down.

675
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:11,166
- I don't want to fight...
- You came over here.

676
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,832
I love her to death.
I'm just saying she has a few issues.

677
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,832
Maybe she'll be the next Francis Bacon.

678
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:20,499
You recognise yourself that she's always
watching those death shows and all that.

679
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,468
Look who's... Issues. Who's got issues?

680
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:31,335
I'd like to show you some American toys so
next time you come, you can bring me some.

681
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,044
(Trickling)

682
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,707
Negative.

683
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:44,678
Marion? Marion'?

684
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:57,964
(Knocking)

685
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,627
- Who is it?
- No idea.

686
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:09,499
Hi. I'm Ron. I'm Bella's husband.
She asked me to come by.

687
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,874
I'm Mingus. Bella? Why?

688
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:16,085
Well, your girlfriend.
To see if there was anything I could do to help.

689
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,957
- With her condition.
- Condition?

690
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:25,666
I have some very good oncologist friends
at Sloan-Kettering.

691
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:30,374
It's always good to get a second opinion.
A brain tumour is not necessarily fatal.

692
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,127
A brain tumour'?

693
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,551
A brain tumour'?

694
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,582
A brain tumour?
Honey, you have a brain tumour?

695
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,082
Oh, my God! No!

696
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,541
- I'm sorry. You didn't know'?
- I didn't know.

697
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:45,582
I suspected something was wrong.
All the yelling and screaming and bickering.

698
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,166
And her inability to make a decision
about anything.

699
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:51,666
And the forgetfulness and
the ﬂatulence, but...

700
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:56,916
You didn't tell me. You were protecting me?
Just hiding it so I wouldn't be hurt.

701
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:59,582
You're an amazing woman.
And now the limping.

702
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:03,791
I had to. I had to keep it...from you
and the children.

703
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:06,832
- I'm so lucky. You're so amazing.
- I'm sorry, honey.

704
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,130
Oh, hello.

705
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,749
- Partial paralysis?
- Yes.

706
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,749
It's partial. It comes and goes.
It comes and goes.

707
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,416
Oh, I feel so sick.

708
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:18,166
Do you have a CAT scan I could look at
and locate the tumour'?

709
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,707
No. No, they're at the hospital. I'm sorry.

710
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,832
- Sloan-Kettering?
- No, in Paris.

711
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:26,582
Don't they CAT scan you regularly
to monitor the growth?

712
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:30,749
Uh-uh. They don't, because I don't have
health insurance and...

713
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,874
- You don't?
- ..There's no hope, anyway.

714
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,332
I don't have health insurance, sweetie.

715
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:39,332
You know, I could call your friends.
A second opinion is a good idea.

716
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,416
- Yes.
- But right now I feel really weak.

717
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:43,499
- And we need to talk.
- Of course.

718
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,249
Thank you so much.

719
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,624
- I need to relax and talk to him.
- Why don't you have some coffee with us?

720
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:52,582
- No. No, we have a lot of...
- Ron, why don't you come in for some coffee?

721
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,624
My hand, it's back. It's coming back.

722
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,332
Yes. Ron...
Ron, would you like some coffee?

723
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:58,624
- Uh...
- No.

724
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:03,249
- Yeah. Come sit with us. Have some coffee.
- We need to talk, sweetie. Remember'?

725
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,218
Yes. We can have our cancer talk.

726
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:07,957
Ron, would you like some coffee?

727
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:11,624
- I'd love some.
- Great, great, great. Just come this way.

728
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,957
- Right this way.
- But I have a brain tumour.

729
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,460
Yes. We will...

730
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,832
Oh.

731
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:21,291
Oh. Hello. I'm Rose.

732
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,999
- Like a rose.
- I'm Ron.

733
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,249
Like um...

734
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,666
Yeah...coffee's over here, Ron.

735
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:32,749
- Ron.
- Hi, man, I'm Manu. Nice meeting you.

736
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,541
- Right...
- It's so nice your family's here.

737
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,010
- I know.
- Such support.

738
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,541
They're very supportive.

739
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:41,207
You know what?
You do have a CAT scan. Remember?

740
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:45,166
- No, I don't.
- A month ago you slipped in the tub

741
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:49,166
and you insisted that we have a CAT scan
done even though you never hit your head.

742
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:52,374
- It was before the tumour grew.
- I know where it is. Sit tight.

743
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:56,207
- I left them at the hospital.
- You don't have a fever? Follow my finger.

744
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,249
- OK.
- Just with your eyes.

745
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,999
Now turn your head. That's good.

746
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,874
Got your CAT scan.

747
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,999
Let me take a quick...

748
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,874
Uh-huh.

749
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,422
Ah-ha.

750
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,795
Aha.

751
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,374
I can't lose you. I can't lose you.

752
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:19,457
- I don't really see anything at all.
- What about this here?

753
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,124
- No, that's...
- Those holes.

754
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:23,416
That's... That's actually normal.

755
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:28,874
If you didn't have these holes,
you'd be severely retarded.

756
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,344
- They are pretty small.
- Oh, this is interesting.

757
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:32,999
Is it bad?

758
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,879
Oh...actually, nothing. I mean...

759
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,669
- Oh.
- Ron, are you OK?

760
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,666
- No, just keep them.
- No. We're keeping them.

761
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:45,499
- It's... I need to keep them.
- Why can't he keep them?

762
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,174
Because I'm attached to those...

763
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,082
It was before I was sick.
I want to keep them healthy.

764
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,374
- The healthy pictures of me.
- You know what?

765
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,832
Come to Marion's show. It's tonight.
At the Susan Kellner Gallery.

766
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,666
Will the whole family be attending?

767
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,510
Yeah. The whole family will be there.

768
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:04,666
OK. I need to rest now.

769
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,957
- Bye.
- Let me get this, please. OK.

770
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:10,167
- Insane behaviour.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

771
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:17,499
You were so fucking unsupportive.

772
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,332
I had to make up that lie
because of the bitch.

773
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,999
She was gonna call the landlord on us.

774
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,332
Why did you do this to me?

775
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,791
A fucking brain tumour? A tumour?

776
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:30,832
So what? You know what?
I might have a brain tumour.

777
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:34,666
You know'? Because I always have headaches
and I'm throwing up all the time.

778
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,416
I could have a brain tumour!

779
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,546
Do you have to fake your death
for us to keep the apartment'?

780
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,673
Marion, Lulu stinks.

781
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:55,044
(All laugh)

782
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,999
I'm taking them with me to yoga.
They want to see my gym.

783
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,291
- It's OK if we all come for lunch? You're sure?
- Yeah, it's OK.

784
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,874
They want to come uptown
and go to the park after. OK.

785
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,707
- All right.
- I love you.

786
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,756
- And they are gone.
- (Door closes)

787
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,877
(Whistling music)

788
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,416
(Clattering)

789
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:33,582
Uh... Mingus.

790
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:36,332
Mingus. Yes. OK, I'll give it a shot.

791
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,960
I don't know...

792
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,624
No, I'm from Brooklyn.

793
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,548
Well, I'm originally from... No, no, no.

794
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:45,124
When people hear "Brooklyn",
they think “he's tough".

795
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:49,374
No, I'm from Park Slope.
From the punky, bitch side of Brooklyn.

796
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,457
You sure I can call you that'?

797
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,291
Barack.

798
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:56,249
You... You... Hawaii.
That's right. That's right.

799
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,469
So when you were a kid
and you got mad at people,

800
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:03,416
did you go, "Hey, I'm from Hawaii.
Don't fuck with me. I'm from Hawaii."

801
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:06,249
You can't say that, right?
It's the same as Park Slope.

802
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,174
Did the gangs throw coconuts? I mean...

803
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:11,999
Well, don't get sensitive.

804
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,291
Yes, I'm sure Hawaii was rough.

805
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:16,624
I believe you.
There was rocks in your sand.

806
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,999
You write, too?

807
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,207
I'm sure they would love to put
one of your articles in the Voice.

808
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:25,427
What do you write about?

809
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,547
Plants?

810
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,423
INSTRUCTOR: Gazing towards the sky.

811
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,469
And one more.

812
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,710
Coming back the way we came.

813
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,291
Bending the knee. Hands come up.

814
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:51,465
Exhale. Hands to heart centre.

815
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,210
Deep breath in. Rise.

816
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,582
Turn to face the front.

817
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,249
Fingers come down.

818
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,999
Foot comes back.
And let's press right back into Down Dog.

819
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,798
Deep breath in and out.

820
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:11,835
- Rose.
- Quoi?

821
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,217
Two.

822
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:44,916
What are you eating, Mingus?

823
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:47,045
(Rose laughs)

824
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,207
It's a frittata.

825
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,427
I guess it's a funny frittata, huh?

826
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,131
How's your midday wine, Jeannot?

827
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,957
Hey!

828
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:05,082
What you doin' here, man?
I thought we lost you to Washington?

829
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:08,291
- I'm in town doing a radio interview.
- OK. OK.

830
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:10,749
Justin, I want you to meet
my girlfriend, Marion.

831
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,207
Oh! Oh, Justin, so nice
to finally meet you.

832
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,291
And this is her family. Jeannot.

833
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,457
Rose.

834
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,999
- Hello.
- And Rose's boyfriend, Man...

835
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,499
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

836
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,416
Hey, I'm doing my radio show
in about an hour.

837
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:28,546
- Why don't you come on the air?
- I'm catching the 4:20 to DC.

838
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:34,666
Actually, I meant to call you
about Barack's visit to NY.

839
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,260
To have him on my show?

840
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,252
- Slow down there a bit.
- OK, OK.

841
00:54:39,253 --> 00:54:42,291
No, but he's doing a press conference
and I think I can get you in.

842
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,207
Get outta here!

843
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:47,337
- No?
- Oh, sweetie, that's wonderful.

844
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,874
- Good Obama.
- Thanks.

845
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:56,082
He's so good-looking.
So much better looking than Sarkozy.

846
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,585
Sorry.

847
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,131
Obama...

848
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,082
- Not really a socialist.
- No?

849
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,999
Well, if I may say so,

850
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,207
you did a fucking great job
in Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.

851
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,999
That was totally hysterical.

852
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,207
- It was so fucking funny.
- That's not him. Could you sit down?

853
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:15,999
- It's OK.
- Justin, one thing.

854
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,332
I did not think that Obama he deserve
to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

855
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:21,085
Do you agree or not?

856
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:26,374
I'm sorry.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

857
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,291
- No, it's OK.
- I do.

858
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:31,207
It's a free country.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

859
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,087
- Thank you.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry about that.

860
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:40,673
I just met them. You know how it is.
Girlfriend's family's come for the weekend.

861
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,757
- It's crazy.
- It's crazy.

862
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,374
- What the fuck?
- It's crazy, I know.

863
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,969
She's not normally like this.

864
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,794
I've gotta catch my train.

865
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,874
- You know how it is.
- Crazy.

866
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:07,124
- I'm sorry.
- You're gonna call me about this interview'?

867
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,416
Yep. I should really get going.

868
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:10,957
- All right.
- Great to see you.

869
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,960
I'm gonna be waiting by the phone.

870
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,378
- I'm on Facebook.
- Mm-hm.

871
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,460
Bye, Kumar.

872
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,631
It's not fucking Kumar.

873
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,582
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- OK.

874
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,874
- I want 'em out.
- What?

875
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,666
I want 'em out.

876
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:33,582
OK, you want them out?
Yes. I agree. They're out.

877
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:38,499
My sister is out. She's out of her mind.
She's crazy. I don't want to see her and this guy.

878
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,332
- They're out.
- You don't hear me. They all gotta go.

879
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,249
What do you mean? Even my dad?

880
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,582
Even your dad. Yes, your dad.

881
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:49,082
He came all the way from Paris -
he hates ﬂying - to see me and Lulu.

882
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,832
- He can't go.
- Hey, hey.

883
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:53,666
How could you argue with your sister
right there?

884
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:55,542
I get to meet the next black president?

885
00:56:55,543 --> 00:56:58,011
Was I supposed to let her kill me
right on the spot?

886
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:00,791
- Yes.
- No. I don't want to make you look bad.

887
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,082
I'm always a supportive girlfriend.
I've always supported you.

888
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:07,416
What the fuck? Every time somebody comes
from one of your jobs,

889
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:10,416
I'm like, "Hey. How you doing?
Nice to meet you."

890
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:13,249
Let's compromise. OK?
Relationships are about compromise.

891
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:17,749
You always say that. Manu and my sister,
they can, like, fuck themselves

892
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,291
everywhere in New York.

893
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,874
OK? But my dad stays.

894
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:24,755
Please. I can't put him in a hotel.
He'll have a breakdown. He'll die.

895
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,166
Please. My dad. Just my dad.

896
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:32,376
- All right. Your dad can stay. OK.
- Thank you.

897
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,460
(Scraping)

898
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,590
I'm so sorry.

899
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:58,177
Yeah. It'll be fine.

900
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:01,964
- Bye, Ming.
- See you later.

901
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,380
(Message alert)

902
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,220
So, what, you can't make it tonight?

903
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,794
All right. I'll come pick them up.

904
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:30,968
Taxi!

905
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,377
Taxi!

906
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,124
All right. We're back.

907
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:41,999
Sir, can you turn it up?
It's my boyfriend on the radio.

908
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,374
- Thank you.
- You know, when I used to think of the French,

909
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,957
I used to think of Degas, Renoir...

910
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,999
the surrealists.

911
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,832
But now when I think of the French I think
of freaky sex with electric toothbrushes.

912
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,749
Don't ask. They're killing me.
Oh, we've got a call.

913
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,749
Cynthia from Williamsburg.
How's it going, Cynthia?

914
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,832
Hey, I just want to say
I love your show, baby.

915
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,457
I love it so much that my boyfriend
is getting kind of jealous.

916
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:10,874
OK...baby.

917
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,999
Can you turn that up a little more?

918
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,291
- So any thoughts, Cynthia?
- You really wanna know my thoughts?

919
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,499
Maybe not live on the radio.

920
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:23,332
MINGUS: Some X-rated thoughts, huh?
- Mm. Always when I think of you, baby.

921
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:26,749
Nice to know
somebody's thinking X-rated of me.

922
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:31,332
(Cynthia laughs) I was sad to find out that
you have a nice little French girlfriend.

923
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,874
Sad that you're sad, but yes.

924
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:34,791
- Bitch.
- That's how it is.

925
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:39,124
So, Cynthia, do you have anything
you want to share? Any political views.

926
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:42,166
No, but if you ever need a pair
of free jeans, pop into the Gap.

927
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:44,707
You know the one on Klondike?
And ask for Cynthia.

928
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,499
Oh, OK. You know what?
I just might do that.

929
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,999
- Yeah.
- I need some jeans. I need some jeans

930
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,791
I'm not gonna tell you when
but it just might happen.

931
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:55,332
All right. Time for the news.
See you later, Cynthia.

932
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,666
(Growling and stamping)

933
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:01,999
The protester known as the Oak Fairy
has fallen from his tree in Central Park.

934
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,291
Though he could not ﬂy
as many of his supporters believed,

935
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:09,672
he is in a stable condition with a broken
foot and we expect a statement soon.

936
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:17,541
Look, Marion. I have some grass.
Nobody knows it's not from Central Park.

937
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:19,294
What's happening with the costumes?

938
01:00:19,295 --> 01:00:22,832
Their teacher said they asked for blood.
Lulu is a dead bunny.

939
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:26,249
- Guys, no dead anything.
- But I like being a dead princess.

940
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,791
OK, I know you love the dead,
the vampires and stuff,

941
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,832
but being dead is not cool.

942
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:35,374
- Dead people rot, right? OK? Yes.
- Yeah.

943
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:38,749
And vampires - I know a bunch of cute guys
played them in movies,

944
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,374
but I promise you it's not cool, OK?

945
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:45,801
You know what comes out of a vampire's tush?
Rotten digested blood.

946
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,374
- Ew!
- Ew! Yeah, exactly.

947
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:53,926
So you don't want to be a dead person.
Because death is very sad and lonely.

948
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:59,343
And one day you're gonna see your papa die
and you're gonna be very, very sad.

949
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:04,166
All right?
So what's cool is to be alive and happy.

950
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:06,499
OK? OK?

951
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,082
So let's go home and clean this up. OK?

952
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,416
- No dead anything.
- Er...Miss Marion?

953
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,169
- Yes?
- I don't think you should do it.

954
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,332
- What?
- Sell your soul.

955
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,082
Oh, it's OK. It's fine.

956
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:20,666
But suppose the person who buys it
is a really bad man, you know?

957
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,707
(Speaks Spanish)

958
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:25,749
My gallerist's promised me
she's not gonna sell my soul to the devil.

959
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:29,334
Just a rich motherfucker.
And remember, I need some money to pay you.

960
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,707
OK, say no more.

961
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,666
We are all under economic pressure.

962
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,666
- I understand. OK.
- OK.

963
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:37,962
- All right.
- Bye.

964
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:39,835
- Good luck with your uncle.
- Thank you.

965
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:42,794
(Door opens)

966
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,460
- (Knock at door)
- Come in.

967
01:01:56,667 --> 01:02:00,291
- Please don't use my family in your show.
- I was being nice and respectful,

968
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:01,874
all things considered.

969
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:04,378
- You use ex-boyfriends in your show.
- That's different.

970
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,124
Are you an alcoholic?

971
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,791
There's a pair of jeans for
your skinny black ass.

972
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,794
I'm saving you a trip to The Gap.

973
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:16,541
I was never gonna call that girl up.
I was never going by The Gap.

974
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:18,374
But thanks for the jeans.

975
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,416
- OK, you're welcome.
- Appreciate it.

976
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:24,749
You know, I have to find a dress and I
think I still have hives from the yoghurt.

977
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,334
No, no, no hives. But your boobs
have been getting a little bigger.

978
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:32,541
- I know, they hurt. I don't know why.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

979
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,207
- Keep doing that.
- What?

980
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,082
Oh, I like that. I like that.
That's like that...

981
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:43,166
You know what? Why don't you send your dad
with the kids to the park?

982
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:44,965
Give us a little time.

983
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,082
You would let our kids with my dad, who you
were about to evict, just to get some?

984
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,508
- Hell, yeah.
- Er... Well, let me talk to him.

985
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:56,582
No, no, no. Are you kidding me?

986
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:59,587
- I gonna talk to my dad first.
- OK.

987
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:09,010
(Buzzer)

988
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,798
Hello?

989
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:10,707
OK, kids.
Kids, we're going to the Halloween fair.

990
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,207
- Halloween fair'?
- And you know who you're going with?

991
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:14,999
Auntie and Grandpa.

992
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,593
- Bye!
- Au revoir.

993
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,582
- Bye, Mingus.
- Take care. Take care.

994
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:21,460
Have fun.

995
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:26,082
Sweetie,
Manu has been deported back to Paris.

996
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:28,249
You'll never have to see him again, ever.

997
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:31,957
Whoa! How did you do that?

998
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,960
Tomorrow Rose.

999
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:38,544
- You really like me.
- Mm-hm.

1000
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,502
- (Cries out)
- Come on.

1001
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,416
(Buzzer) ' Oh!

1002
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:47,885
Forgot something.

1003
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:51,335
I'm here to fix the buzzer.

1004
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,041
Buzzer. Sweetie.

1005
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:56,082
OK, I'll handle it.

1006
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,124
Could you come back a little later?

1007
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:01,874
No. It won't be possible for
another two weeks, at least.

1008
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,916
No, no, no. We can't wait two weeks.

1009
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:06,832
- It wakes up the kids every time.
- I got... Hold on, I got it.

1010
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:07,880
Please.

1011
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,207
Hiya.

1012
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,374
This system hasn't been updated
since the Prohi-bish.

1013
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:19,499
- How long is it gonna take, do you think?
- About two hours, maybe three.

1014
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,749
- Really?
- You don't want me to do it?

1015
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:25,166
- I just have a great party to attend.
- No, it's OK. Just do it.

1016
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,916
Just do it, it's fine. It's fine.

1017
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:29,624
Looks like my services
are no longer needed here, so...

1018
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,624
OK, I'm gonna go early
so I can check everything's all right.

1019
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,423
- Are you OK bringing everyone?
- Yeah.

1020
01:05:34,424 --> 01:05:36,419
- OK.
- Bye.

1021
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:41,416
- Hey, can I have something to drink?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1022
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:44,457
Chai latte, low-fat milk.

1023
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,460
One sugar.

1024
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:51,041
OK.

1025
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:52,589
(Music and chatter)

1026
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,416
I hope it sells.
These prints cost me a fortune.

1027
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:02,249
I hope so too, or this place will become
a banana republic in no time.

1028
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,957
The good news is
I think we've got a taker for the soul.

1029
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,802
- Really? Who is it?
- Anonymous party.

1030
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:12,249
- Anonymous?
- Anonymous party. A direct deposit to the...

1031
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:15,166
- Whoo-hoo! We're here.
- Everything OK?

1032
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,291
How are you, Mingus? Nice to see you.

1033
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:19,582
- I left a diaper bag in the taxi.
- Oh, no.

1034
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:22,499
- Would your dad ever key a car?
- Of course not. Impossible.

1035
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,041
There's a limo driver outside
who wants to press charges.

1036
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:28,717
Well, that's... Really?
I'll deal with it later.

1037
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:35,957
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

1038
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,256
We'll take any occasion
to see our granddaughter.

1039
01:06:38,257 --> 01:06:40,457
- Hello, Willow.
- Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

1040
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:41,630
Thank you for coming.

1041
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,874
Jeannot, my parents, Carol and Lee.

1042
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,877
Mingus family!

1043
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:54,261
- Kiss.
- You gotta kiss him or he gets mad.

1044
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,177
- That's my mother. No tongue.
- Kiss!

1045
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:01,799
You guys have a lot in common.
You're both involved in the '60s.

1046
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:13,300
- I love Last Poets.
- No way! They were friends of ours.

1047
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:17,045
OK, shall we look at the pictures?

1048
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,511
- It's going well, no?
- I think so, it's crazy.

1049
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,749
- Hello.
- Hello.

1050
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,124
There's somebody important I
need you to meet. Come here.

1051
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:40,041
So you know I'm a psychologist, too.
But my speciality is that I work with children.

1052
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:42,791
Are you familiar with the work
of Françoise Dolto?

1053
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:46,171
Oh, my God. I wrote my dissertation
on Dolto at the Sorbonne.

1054
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:50,082
- What sign are you?
- I'm fish.

1055
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:53,416
Pisces. Insightful,
sensitive to the plights of others.

1056
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:55,457
Oh, my God. So much.

1057
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:58,499
You know, I go to the buffet now
to get something to drink.

1058
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,541
Could I... Do you want something?

1059
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:02,840
- I'd love a glass of white wine.
- Two.

1060
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,457
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

1061
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:13,166
- Her sister's lovely.
- It's hard to believe she's Marion's sister.

1062
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:15,207
Would you back off? This is her night.

1063
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:18,249
Well, clearly she's been very busy
with her nights.

1064
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,832
- It's over ten years of pictures.
JEANNOT: Carol!

1065
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,835
Lee! Come here.

1066
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:25,340
It's funny.

1067
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:30,791
Carol.

1068
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:32,957
- It's going good, no?
- No, no, no, no.

1069
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,832
No, it's not going good.
I can't sell a thing. Nothing has sold.

1070
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:37,999
- What?
- I think with the subject matter,

1071
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,082
people were expecting something sexier.

1072
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,874
Something. I don't know.

1073
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,916
Sexier? But I never sleep naked. Who does?

1074
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:46,666
- Do you sleep naked?
- No.

1075
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:49,416
Oh, this is good.
No, no, no, John Kelly's here.

1076
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,419
I need you to go talk to him.

1077
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,502
- The John Kelly?
- Yes.

1078
01:08:53,503 --> 01:08:56,332
- Oh, my God, he can be so vicious.
- I know. Exactly.

1079
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,335
That's why I need you to bring your A-game.

1080
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,835
I think...

1081
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:05,626
Yes?

1082
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,541
- I like it.
- (Laughs) Great.

1083
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:13,291
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Why did you use yourself as a subject?

1084
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:15,541
I know myself pretty well, first of all.

1085
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:19,416
And I thought through a study of the microcosm
I could start to understand others.

1086
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:24,253
- So you're saying you're universal?
- No, I wouldn't say I'm universal.

1087
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:28,624
You're not writing that, are you?
It's so pretentious. Please don't write that.

1088
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:32,124
What I'm saying is I'm probably too shy
to approach strangers

1089
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:37,332
and I was genuinely interested in
seeing how a relationship evolves

1090
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,291
through time.

1091
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:41,041
That's...

1092
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:44,249
So you're trying to place your work
in the same realm as

1093
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,041
people like Cindy Sherman and Nan Goldin.

1094
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:49,386
- Sophie Calle.
- Well, they're amazing.

1095
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:52,582
- Who wouldn't...'?
- Amazing.

1096
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:54,881
- Amazing.
- Yeah, amazing. Brilliant.

1097
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:59,296
This is...this is so cute.

1098
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:04,544
- I like the theme.
- Great.

1099
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:09,335
More than the execution.

1100
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,999
OK.

1101
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,423
These photos are sort of erm...

1102
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,631
- ..mundane.
- Mundane.

1103
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:23,174
They're mundane,
but at the same time they're pretty.

1104
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,666
- OK. OK.
- Yeah.

1105
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:27,669
That's not bad.

1106
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:30,131
- It was nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

1107
01:10:30,132 --> 01:10:33,550
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm happy you enjoyed the show.

1108
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:43,342
No, it's OK. If you hate the
show you can say it. It's fine.

1109
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,707
I can take it. Totally fine.

1110
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,383
I'm not, you know, one of those people
that can't take criticism.

1111
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:53,791
But you know what?
What's good is for the truth to come out

1112
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:56,416
and you can just say it - you hate it.
You hate my show.

1113
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:59,207
You know what? It's OK,
because I want to tell you something.

1114
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:02,541
Everyone hates you.
In the art world, everyone hates you.

1115
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:06,332
Even outside of the art world everyone
hates you, because you're an asshole.

1116
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:09,541
- Everyone?
- If I didn't have a kid, I would snap your neck.

1117
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:12,457
And if I could I would take every
single picture and shove it...

1118
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,460
Everything OK here?

1119
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,082
- Yeah...
- OK. Thank you.

1120
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:20,085
This is so good.

1121
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:22,627
- All right.
- I'll take care of it.

1122
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,582
I think it's all part of...
It almost becomes performance at this stage.

1123
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,585
- She's insane.
- Oh.

1124
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,378
And that's part of the whole theme.

1125
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:34,965
Bye.

1126
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,423
Text me.

1127
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:42,544
(Speaking Italian)

1128
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:48,541
- Miss?
- Ah.

1129
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:51,207
- Where are you from?
- From Rome in Italy.

1130
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,457
I have some grass from Central Park. Do you
want to bring some back to your country?

1131
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:57,499
- It's only 20 bucks.
- Excuse me.

1132
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,541
No. No, thank you. Where are your parents?

1133
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:03,249
- Excuse me, is she bothering you?
- No. You are the father?

1134
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,957
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Willow, what are you doing?

1135
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:10,249
They're from Europe like Lulu's uncle.
They want some grass to bring back home.

1136
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,582
Could you excuse us?
It's not what you think.

1137
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:15,166
I'm raising money
to have more bunnies at school.

1138
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:18,082
I'll get you bunnies, OK?
I'll get you all the bunnies you want.

1139
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,380
It's a school project.

1140
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,594
- (Speaks Italian)
- School project.

1141
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,499
Are you sure you don't have a battery charger?
The cord thing?

1142
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,343
- Where have you been?
- I was here.

1143
01:12:34,344 --> 01:12:38,166
I found the kids trying to sell grass
from Central Park to some Italian lady.

1144
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:42,416
- Well, so... I'm running out of battery.
- Hey, fuck the battery, OK?

1145
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:44,916
Do you understand that I told the court

1146
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:49,624
that I would provide a life filled
with love, laughter and ﬂuffy animals?

1147
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:53,166
What do you think will happen when
they find out she's imitating drug dealers,

1148
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:56,041
- that your ex invited into our home?
- OK, I'm sorry.

1149
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,457
The guy's on an airplane right now, OK?

1150
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,499
I... There's nothing else I can do.

1151
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,916
Sweetie, this whole evening is turning into
a horrible disaster for me.

1152
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:05,957
I've sold nothing. Nothing.

1153
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:09,332
- It's over.
- Marion? I need you.

1154
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,374
- She's busy.
- I have to go.

1155
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:13,218
I have to go, sweetie.

1156
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,957
- God.
- Very exciting announcement to make.

1157
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,999
- Nothings sold?
- Just the soul.

1158
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,916
Come on. (Rings bell)

1159
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:24,874
Everyone, please step up. Thank you.
I've a very exciting announcement to make.

1160
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:31,963
Tonight we have sold the soul of Marion
Dupré to the highest bidder for $5,000.

1161
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,927
Bravo. Bravissimo.

1162
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:40,131
And date...date it, please.

1163
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:44,916
It's been notarised.

1164
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:50,166
I am delighted to be officially soulless
as of this day of October 31st.

1165
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:54,082
Er...l thought my soul was worth
at least $10,000.

1166
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,124
(Laughter)

1167
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:58,749
But I guess in these times
of economic turmoil I am...

1168
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:02,291
- Lucky, fortunate.
- ..Fortunate, yes, that it's sold at all.

1169
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:04,332
- Yes, exactly.
- Who bought it?

1170
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,999
- Anonymous.
- Wow.

1171
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,968
(Murmuring)

1172
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,041
- Thank you.
- (Cheering)

1173
01:14:12,042 --> 01:14:14,044
The soulless Marion Dupré.

1174
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,916
WOMAN: She's not my...
MAN: It's a failure.

1175
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:23,999
She sold her soul,
but no-one's buying anything else.

1176
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,082
- She's a bad mother.
- Doesn't even show her tits.

1177
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:29,711
I'd rather buy toilet
paper than her pictures.

1178
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:36,666
Oh, Marion. Hi.
Did we miss the show? Are you OK?

1179
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,590
- No.
- Marion, I just want to say,

1180
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:42,332
that you are a talented artist
and you will be remembered.

1181
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,335
I can't breathe. I'm suffocating.

1182
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,416
- Oh.
- Oh, my God. This is it.

1183
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:51,457
We should get in and buy a few pictures.
They're gonna be worth a fortune very soon.

1184
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,552
- Did you hear that? Let's go in.
- Go.

1185
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,085
(Thumping dance beat)

1186
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:03,294
(Chatter)

1187
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,794
(Laughter)

1188
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:29,085
(Whistle blown)

1189
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:38,082
Your father told me about your mom.

1190
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:41,383
- You never told us.
- I don't like to talk about it.

1191
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:47,338
You know, in our village, when we
cannot let go of someone who died...

1192
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:51,633
we need to find a trapped
animal and release it.

1193
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:53,885
Really?

1194
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:57,381
You feel different today.

1195
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:00,957
Different how?

1196
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02,756
Susan, just cut the anonymous crap.

1197
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,624
I don't believe you.
Just give me his number.

1198
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:09,374
Someone picked up the certificate,
so you have something.

1199
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,969
Something for him, like
a number or something.

1200
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:14,332
Just give me his name.

1201
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:17,249
I don't care about the good news.
Give it to me now.

1202
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,843
My phone is running out of battery.

1203
01:16:18,844 --> 01:16:22,041
I'll have to call from a public phone
and catch gonorrhoea of the masses.

1204
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:24,044
Is that what you want?

1205
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:25,999
Give it to me!

1206
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,959
I just wanted to give you instructions
on how my soul works.

1207
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,210
I see. Like er...

1208
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:37,419
Like an instruction manual?

1209
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:41,791
Yeah, to make sure you get
maximum return on your investment.

1210
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:45,124
My soul is quite complicated
and brought me many problems.

1211
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:47,582
- Oh.
- Which is why I was willing to sell it.

1212
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,585
I see.

1213
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:52,707
You're the actor Vincent Gallo, right?

1214
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,999
Yeah, the actor, the director, the poet,

1215
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,124
the fashion model, motorcycle racer,
legend, and the owner of your soul.

1216
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,127
Yes, Vincent Gallo. Me.

1217
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:05,166
Why did you buy my soul?

1218
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,291
Why did you sell your soul?

1219
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:10,751
It's sort of a conceptual statement.

1220
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:14,542
- Because I don't believe in the soul.
- You don't believe?

1221
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:18,999
Then why er...did we
have to meet here today?

1222
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,999
I was just curious to
know why you bought it.

1223
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,674
- I just want to know why.
- That's nice.

1224
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:29,259
And you're sure you don't believe in the soul, right?
You're sure it doesn't exist?

1225
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:30,634
Yes.

1226
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:34,957
Pick up, pick up. You have children!

1227
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:38,082
You have to pick up the phone.
They could be hurt or dead.

1228
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,085
Pick up the phone.

1229
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,086
Goes straight to voice-mail. Where is she?

1230
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:47,999
I can't find her.
I mean, the show was a success.

1231
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,379
She sold everything...suddenly.
It's all gone.

1232
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:56,590
Mingus, do you have ice
for my feet, please?

1233
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:02,332
Mingus... (Laughs) Do you have
ice for my feet? Please, Mingus.

1234
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,957
- Why don't you get it yourself?
- OK.

1235
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:07,632
By the way, why do you laugh
every time you say my name?

1236
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:12,874
Oh, Mingus, please don't be mad.
It was a stupid joke between me and Man...

1237
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:17,082
Your name, it rhymes with cunnilingus.
And in French...

1238
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,085
In English too!

1239
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:20,707
OK.

1240
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:25,384
Thank you, it all makes sense now.
(Laughs) Mingus, cunnilingus!

1241
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,541
- Oh, yeah. Yes.
- Yes!

1242
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:31,457
"Oh, Mingus, can you get me some ice?"

1243
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,499
"Mingus, can you get the ketchup?"

1244
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,468
"“Mingus, can you get my shoe?"

1245
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,253
Can you remind me again
what you do for a living?

1246
01:18:39,254 --> 01:18:40,999
- I...
- You're a shrink.

1247
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,968
For kids.

1248
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:45,426
That is so scary.

1249
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,085
Sick!

1250
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:52,832
If there's a tiny little
chance that it does exist...

1251
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:55,541
I think it's a good idea that
I have a back-up, you know?

1252
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:58,666
A sort of... "in case I need it"...soul.

1253
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,294
Well, let's say the soul does exist,

1254
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:03,957
it's very unlikely you can just sell it
by signing a little piece of paper. Right?

1255
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,960
L...l disagree with you.

1256
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:09,957
The concept of a soul is a little absurd.

1257
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:12,582
But the idea of trading it, selling it,

1258
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:16,633
is no more absurd
than the idea that the soul exists.

1259
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:22,541
- Do you miss your soul?
- Of course not.

1260
01:19:22,542 --> 01:19:24,761
- Prrrh! No.
- "Prrh!" Yeah.

1261
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:31,166
OK, I'm just trying to think if I...
if I lost my soul, how would that feel?

1262
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,207
I mean, that's er...l
couldn't imagine that.

1263
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,210
I...

1264
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,749
I might start to cry.

1265
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,004
Where is er...the contract?

1266
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:46,082
Someone picked it up at
the gallery, so you...

1267
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:48,085
Where is it?

1268
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:52,874
- Why do you ask?
- I need it back. Give it to me back.

1269
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,749
I know you sent the money
already to the bank,

1270
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:59,707
But I can make you a cheque right now,
and you give it back to me.

1271
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:00,749
And...

1272
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,124
It's no big deal, right?

1273
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:06,166
No. It's not for sale.

1274
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:08,624
Not for any price, not for anything.

1275
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,666
- I'm sorry.
- But it's mine.

1276
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,457
No. You decided to sell it.

1277
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:16,999
I decided to buy it and now it's mine.

1278
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,041
Please tell me where it is.
That it's in a safe place.

1279
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:22,457
It's in a safe place, baby.

1280
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,916
It's very safe.
It's in a very, very safe place.

1281
01:20:24,917 --> 01:20:27,045
My favourite place.

1282
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:32,801
It's in a little suede pouch,
in the colour brown.

1283
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,832
Tiny little pouch.
It's rolled up, placed in the pouch.

1284
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,457
And I keep it right here.

1285
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:42,460
In my groin area.

1286
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,252
Safe, protected.

1287
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,002
(Cat meows)

1288
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:05,749
You're not dead.
I said I wasn't gonna get mad.

1289
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,752
But you know what?

1290
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:09,416
Where have you been?

1291
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:11,916
I'm sorry I couldn't call,
my phone ran out of battery.

1292
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:14,796
And then I was trying to
get my soul back, and...

1293
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,627
- He ate it.
- Who ate what?

1294
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,419
Vincent Gallo.

1295
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:26,291
Vincent Gallo? So that's where you've been?

1296
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:29,207
Well, first I got a massage
because I was tense, OK?

1297
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:33,957
And then I finally found out who was
the anonymous person who bought my soul,

1298
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,916
so I called and we had a meeting,
and it was Vincent Gallo.

1299
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:41,332
And then...and then I...
tried to negotiate with him, my soul back.

1300
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,999
And the paper,
he had the certificate that I signed.

1301
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,916
I just want it back,
not because I believe in the soul,

1302
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:50,624
but because I believe something was wrong
with me ever since I signed that paper.

1303
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:56,917
So he had it in a little area he said, like in a
suede pouch, next to his groin area, you know?

1304
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:01,124
I lunged at him and I grabbed the pouch
and I punched him in the face.

1305
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,332
And then he punched me in the stomach,

1306
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:06,374
and then we punched back
and forth and then...

1307
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:10,755
We...we fell to the ﬂoor
and then he grabbed it.

1308
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:14,249
And he ate it. (Sobs)

1309
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:18,999
So you spent all night in Vincent
Gallo's pants, on the ﬂoor?

1310
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,499
- No, that's not what you think...
- That's what you just said!

1311
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,710
No, that's not at all what I just said.
I said he had my soul in his underwear.

1312
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:32,259
- OK? It's very different.
- No, it's not fucking different!

1313
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:37,291
You've gone crazy. Ever since your family
got here you've become another person.

1314
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:41,874
Now, the question is, is this who you really
are and you've been hiding it from me?

1315
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:46,176
Or is this just some isolated incident
that will never happen again?

1316
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:51,752
What is it?
Psycho bitch...not psycho bitch?

1317
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:54,294
I'm not a psycho bitch, sweetie.

1318
01:22:56,333 --> 01:23:01,291
I was really trying to get my soul back
and it was in his underwear.

1319
01:23:01,292 --> 01:23:03,294
(Sniffs)

1320
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:06,090
And I didn't touch his penis.

1321
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:11,544
- How's Lulu?
- You know what?

1322
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,624
Why don't you check yourself?

1323
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:16,666
He was crying, he missed his momma.

1324
01:23:16,667 --> 01:23:19,136
Mommy left without saying anything.

1325
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,249
- He's OK?
- He's fine. He's in our bed.

1326
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,749
I'm gonna go sleep in my office.

1327
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,874
- You don't have to do that. It's stupid.
- No, no, I...

1328
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,754
It's stupid. Nothing happened.
Nothing really...

1329
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:36,005
MARION: In fairy tales, they tell
you they lived happily ever after.

1330
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:40,124
They never tell you the rest of the story
for a very good reason.

1331
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:42,753
No more dragons to slay
after the happy ending.

1332
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:47,084
Life begins, and that's way
harder to handle than any dragon.

1333
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,210
But then again you can end up with
the most precious gift in the whole world.

1334
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:57,707
You know why I don't believe in the soul?

1335
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,666
Because the soul would probably mean
an afterlife.

1336
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:05,343
And if there was something, my mom would
have tried to communicate with me somehow.

1337
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:10,842
Even though she knows better than to
contact me when I'm home alone at night.

1338
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:29,877
- (Knocks)
- Come in.

1339
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,832
Hey, sweetie.
Wanna come with us to Central Park?

1340
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,874
No. Gotta do my taxes.

1341
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,124
Taxes in November?

1342
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,207
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1343
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,210
Could you close the door?

1344
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:15,874
You know what, if we broke up,
I would just wake up in the morning.

1345
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:19,166
I'd get my coffee and I'd be on my way.

1346
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:22,249
No more organic crap. Nothing organic.

1347
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:26,916
The day we break up I'm gonna start
barbecuing at this place, I tell you that.

1348
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:30,499
I can go to the Knick game,
and I could hang with my boys.

1349
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,666
And I could...you know, a few women.

1350
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:36,957
Multiple women.
Hey, you got something on you.

1351
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,835
Somebody needs to help you out there.

1352
01:25:38,836 --> 01:25:42,999
I'd come back and I'd be refreshed
from getting this pussy.

1353
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,210
And then...
You don't mind if I say pussy, right?

1354
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:51,045
I mean, you know, the
options are unbelievable.

1355
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,457
Who am I kidding'?

1356
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:58,507
Girls you meet at bars...

1357
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:02,291
Eating cheeseburgers at two in the morning.

1358
01:26:02,292 --> 01:26:04,636
They wanna talk after sex.

1359
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,416
“What are you thinking?“

1360
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:10,874
"“When you were in me, you were going crazy.
How did it feel?"

1361
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,207
“What's your sign?“.

1362
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:15,207
My sign is, Shut the fuck up.
That's my sign.

1363
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:17,249
I mean...

1364
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:19,252
Marion's difficult...

1365
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:22,332
But I like her.

1366
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,166
She's an animal lover.

1367
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:26,795
Yes, I know Hitler loved
animals too, but...

1368
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:32,249
I mean, she cooks and...
Oh, my God, she gives an amazing...

1369
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,291
You don't even understand it.

1370
01:26:34,292 --> 01:26:37,842
If you ever... If we ever break
up and you get the chance...

1371
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:41,052
You have my blessing.

1372
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:43,499
Not that you need my blessing.

1373
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,926
I'm sure if I left her with you for five
minutes she'd be on her fucking knees.

1374
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:50,957
Was I cold? She hates cold.

1375
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:52,960
You know, I hate cold.

1376
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,791
Marion's a lot of things
but she's never cold.

1377
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:58,794
(Message alert)

1378
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:00,832
Belvedere Castle.

1379
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:03,374
You know, I'm not you.
This is why I'm not the President.

1380
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:07,124
I'm not really big on the public,
romantic reconciliation's, not my thing.

1381
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:11,374
But I'm gonna wait for her to get back,
and then I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

1382
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,999
You know, I gotta go take a piss.

1383
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,832
When I get back I wanna hear about
you and Michelle, OK?

1384
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,835
All right. My man.

1385
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,506
All right. Let's do this.

1386
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:23,877
Lift the seat.

1387
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,207
Shit.

1388
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:33,585
(Zips ﬂies)

1389
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,176
Oh, shit.

1390
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:44,335
(Flutter of bird's wings)

1391
01:27:57,667 --> 01:27:59,385
Papa! Rose!

1392
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:10,467
Er... Miss, you can't do that. Miss!

1393
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,332
- Marion!
- Miss!

1394
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:15,666
- Miss! Miss!
- I just have to free that pigeon.

1395
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:18,011
- What's going on?
- I don't know. The lady's crazy.

1396
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,877
She just started climbing up there.

1397
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,468
- Hey, little guy.
- (Shouting)

1398
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:26,966
- What's going on?
- I can't do it.

1399
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:30,957
It's not you. It's your hormones!

1400
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:34,124
- I'm OK, sweetie.
- We're gonna have a little Obama.

1401
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,874
- What?
- Aah, shit.

1402
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,798
We got a trespasser. I need backup.

1403
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:41,419
Got it! (Screams)

1404
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,798
Ah! No!

1405
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,756
Aaargh! No!

1406
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,332
Oh!

1407
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:56,166
If you live your life with one person only,
one day they'll be gone or you'll be gone.

1408
01:28:56,167 --> 01:28:59,171
And one of you will be left all alone
in the cold world.

1409
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,582
The family we are born
in eventually vanishes.

1410
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:05,712
By then you've created your own family
if you're lucky.

1411
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:09,249
First you have to choose the person
you'll build this family with,

1412
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,291
and stick to it as much as possible.

1413
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:13,966
How many tries do you get
before you strike out?

1414
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:17,791
When my mother died,
just a few hours before the end,

1415
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:20,707
she looked into my eyes
and she had the expression of a little girl

1416
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:23,006
who didn't know what was happening to her.

1417
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:27,004
The same as when Lulu was born -
something totally pure.

1418
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:31,374
So I guess we can do
all the growing up we can...

1419
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:34,499
In the end, at the core, we stay the same.

1420
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,541
(Rattling)

1421
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:37,340
(Gasps)

1422
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:49,091
But before that sad ending
that awaits all of us...

1423
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:53,425
maybe we can share beautiful,
ephemeral moments with the people we love.

1424
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:15,419
(Talking softly into phone)

1425
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:29,332
MARION: So, Mommy, Daddy,
Papi and Auntie ended up in jail.

1426
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:32,792
But not for long.
It all worked out in the end.

1427
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:36,719
Then seven months later...you were born.

1428
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,959
Grandpa moved to New York
so he could be close to all of us,

1429
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,969
and that's also when Auntie Rose
met Uncle Bob.

1430
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:48,177
He was the policeman that
threw us all in jail.

1431
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,969
And luckily, they moved to Paris.

1432
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,626
What you doing'?

1433
01:30:54,627 --> 01:30:58,166
I was just explaining to her
what happened before she was born.

1434
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:00,465
- No crazy stuff, right?
- Of course not.

1435
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,753
Just a love story with a happy ending.
(Laughs)
