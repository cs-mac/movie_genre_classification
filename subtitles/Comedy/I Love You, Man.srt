1
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,004
Looks good, right?

2
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:59,081
So, my plan is to create
this cluster of live/work lofts

3
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,092
all along the perimeter here.
And... Come here.

4
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:06,030
I also am planning this neighborhood-y
kind of dining and retail area

5
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,327
in the central square.

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,868
You know, I even had this thought
that maybe you, Denise and Hailey

7
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,496
could open up a second location
for your store.

8
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,335
Really? Because Denise keeps talking

9
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,068
about wanting to open up
another branch.

10
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,609
Well, it'd be great. Yeah.

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,612
Look, the land is a little pricey,
so I couldn't develop it right away,

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,170
but once I sell the Ferrigno estate,

13
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,546
I figured out I could at least
put a down payment on it

14
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:28,917
and still have enough money left over
for the reception in Santa Barbara.

15
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,817
What are you talking about?
What reception?

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,761
Zooey, I know it's only been
eight months,

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,823
but I am so madly, insanely,
ridiculously in love with you.

18
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,201
Will you marry me?

19
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,469
Yes! It just happened
two minutes ago, Hailey.

20
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,411
- Can you believe it?
- No, I can't. It's amazing.

21
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,506
Oh, my God.
I've been on like 10 million dates,

22
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,346
and you end up marrying
some totally awesome guy

23
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,477
who randomly walks into our store?

24
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,646
It's so cute. She doesn't know
she's on speakerphone.

25
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,849
You do not know how lucky you are.

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,153
It is impossible
to find a good guy in this city.

27
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,695
- I know.
- I thought we were connecting.

28
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,162
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Kind of.

29
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,763
I'm sorry, but not really.

30
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,235
- Hey, will you conference in Denise?
- Oh, my God! You called me first?

31
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,898
- Oh, God.
- Awesome. Yes. Hold on.

32
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,867
Hi.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,136
Hi.

34
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,312
- I love that piece of land. It's perfect.
- I'm glad.

35
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,447
I mean, I know the neighborhood's
a little, you know...

36
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,652
Oh, my God, Zo! I cannot
fucking believe you didn't call me first!

37
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,219
You are such a freak.
Hailey's first on my speed dial.

38
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,356
No, no, no, I'm totally kidding.
I'm so psyched for you.

39
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,592
I feel like I'm gonna puke right now.

40
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,725
Oh, my God, hold on.

41
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,598
Barry hates when I'm in the house
during his poker night.

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,932
Would you give me a second,
you fat douche?

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,495
Get out. Get out of the fucking house...

44
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,097
- Zooey just got engaged!
- To who?

45
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,173
- "To who," are you joking? To Peter.
- To who? To me.

46
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,904
- I don't know Peter.
- I've met the guy like 20 times.

47
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,536
- You've met him like 20 times.
- I don't know Peter.

48
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,410
- You don't know Peter?
- I have no idea who that is.

49
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,744
Okay, we've been on like 20 dates
with him.

50
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,306
- You don't know him?
- I've never met Peter.

51
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,012
You are such an asshole.

52
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,178
Sorry, Zo. Have you set a date?

53
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,017
Yes. June 30th in Santa Barbara.

54
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,489
Peter already booked the place
we went for that long weekend.

55
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,617
So romantic.

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,456
Oh, my God. He is so romantic.

57
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,689
That's the place where you guys
fucked for the first time, right?

58
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,224
No.

59
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,498
No, no, no,
that was the hot tub in Mexico.

60
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,472
That's right.
Santa Barbara was just oral.

61
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,802
- Yeah.
- You guys.

62
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,069
That's right. The hot tub, yeah.

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,872
It was Mexico. You had your period in
Santa Barbara and you wanted to wait.

64
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,580
God, you're so old-fashioned, Zooey.

65
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,577
- You told them about the hot tub?
- Maybe.

66
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,520
- Wow. So, June 30th?
- Yeah, I know. It's soon, but...

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,784
Who cares? Peter's a doll,

68
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,654
and he goes down on you
like six times a week.

69
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,086
- What are you waiting for?
- Wow.

70
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,287
Marry him. Don't wait.

71
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,862
Lock that tongue down, girl.

72
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,329
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

73
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,559
All right, you guys, I'll call you later.
Love you.

74
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:10,080
It is beautiful. It's totally understated,
and it's just... It's perfect.

75
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,312
I know! No, he's the best. I feel so lucky.

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,915
All right. All right, Debbie.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

77
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,386
Honey!
I've been totally hogging the phone.

78
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,189
- Who do you wanna call?
- I'm okay.

79
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,492
My parents are probably asleep,
so I'll just talk to them tomorrow.

80
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,054
You don't wanna tell
any of your friends?

81
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,123
I'll make some calls this weekend.

82
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,793
Really?
Well, what about that guy, Tevin?

83
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,928
You talk to him
like 20 times a day, right?

84
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,098
Well, yeah.
He works two cubicles away from me.

85
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,265
I'll see him Monday morning.

86
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,775
Or what's his name?
The one that you fence with.

87
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,868
- Gil?
- Gil.

88
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,674
Gil. Gilliam.

89
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,872
No, he's not really a "call right away"
kind of friend.

90
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,850
Toasting.

91
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,892
- Hi! Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,229
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mom.

93
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,862
- Excellent meat.
- So good.

94
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,430
- This is delicious. Thank you so much.
- Really is, Mom.

95
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,976
Thank you.

96
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,740
But did Peter have any good friends
growing up?

97
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,078
I honestly don't remember any.

98
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,878
All right, look, Zooey,
just to clarify here,

99
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,976
my dad worked for IBM,
so we moved a lot when I was a kid.

100
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,817
Robbie always managed to have friends.

101
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,823
Of course, he probably wanted
to suck their dicks, but...

102
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,085
Oswald!

103
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,086
No, Mom, it's cool. I totally did.

104
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,254
But he doesn't have to use
that kind of language.

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,388
- Indeed.
- Why?

106
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,490
My son is a gay man,
and I embrace his lifestyle.

107
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,296
It's true. Dad loves the gays.

108
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,600
I actually made him
an honorary homo last month.

109
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:44,232
The point is, Zooey, Peter always
connected better with women.

110
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,507
You know, I can see that
because he's a great boyfriend.

111
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,012
Thank you, fiancée.

112
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,344
Also, you gotta understand, Zooey.

113
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,442
Peter matured sexually
at a very early age.

114
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,510
I remember taking him swimming
when he was 12 years old.

115
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,613
Kid had a bush
like a 40-year-old Serbian.

116
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,482
Come on. Okay.
Dad, please, stop talking.

117
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,085
- Good to know.
- Nice.

118
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,131
Come on. He had a Speedo full of Brillo.
Be proud.

119
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,890
God.

120
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,731
Who invited the stand-up comedian
over here?

121
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,603
Zooey, here's the deal.
Peter's always been a "girlfriend guy."

122
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,268
He put all his focus and energy
into his relationships,

123
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,675
and all his dude friends
just fell by the wayside.

124
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,612
Zooey, don't listen to him, all right?
I mean, we're eight years apart.

125
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,707
Barely grew up together
in the same house.

126
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,275
This is ridiculous.
Why is it weird that I had girlfriends?

127
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,083
Nothing. We're just saying
you never really had a best friend, is all.

128
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,420
- Well, who's your best friend?
- I have two.

129
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,255
Hank Mardukas has been
my closest friend

130
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,521
since our first year at IBM.

131
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,460
- Best man at our wedding. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.

132
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,330
Talk to him two, three times a week
on the phone for 30 years now.

133
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,130
And then there's Robbie.

134
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,494
What's up?

135
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,431
- Robbie is your other best friend?
- Correct. And Hank Mardukas.

136
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,419
What the shit is he looking at?

137
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,427
Davis Dunn Realty,
how may I direct your call? Please hold.

138
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,869
Hold, please. Put him through to Tevin.

139
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,967
It's very close to downtown.
How close do you wanna be?

140
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,206
Thank you, sweetheart.

141
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,609
I can't get you that close.
'Cause the schools are terrible.

142
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,774
The skyscrapers were all lit up.
I got down on one knee.

143
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,513
She was totally surprised.

144
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,387
Well, I'm jealous, Peter,
'cause you never gave me a shot.

145
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,557
But you're gonna
make the best husband.

146
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,789
Stop it. Stop.
All right, you can continue now.

147
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,892
Morning, Trayce.

148
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,065
- Hey, Tevin.
- Hey, man.

149
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,128
What's so funny?

150
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,469
One of the guys
in my fantasy football league

151
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,531
just sent me a QuickTime.

152
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,135
It's a grandma riding a Sybian machine.

153
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,543
What's that?

154
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,104
It's one of those vibrating saddles

155
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,811
that women sit on to give them,
like, super intense orgasms.

156
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,176
Check it out.

157
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,217
- Damn!
- How sick is that?

158
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,452
It's very. That's very sick.

159
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,994
So awesome.

160
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,457
Hey. So, what up, dog?
How's that Ferrigno dealio coming?

161
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,525
It's coming good. Yeah. I'm getting
ready to show in a couple of weeks.

162
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,433
Great.
Dude, I'm just gonna throw this out there

163
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,267
because it's a big piece of house.

164
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,570
If you want a copilot on this,
I'd be happy to team up with you.

165
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,942
No, I know. I feel like I wanna
give myself the challenge

166
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,480
- and just see how it goes...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,812
- I appreciate the offer.
- No sweat.

168
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,351
Hey, anyway, you know,
my girlfriend and I...

169
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,082
Well, we had this very special evening
planned, and I...

170
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:21,183
She's a squirter! She's squirting!
Peter, we got a squirter!

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,753
Old Faithful!

172
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,324
Hello, fiancée.

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,460
Hey, baby. I totally forgot.
It's my turn to host ladies' night.

174
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,170
No prob.
I have fencing practice, anyway.

175
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,107
I'll grab a beer with Gil and the boys
afterward. Hit them with the big news.

176
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,373
- Great! I gotta go. Love you.
- I love you, too.

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,175
Peter! Peter!

178
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,711
I'm sending it to you.

179
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,083
- No. I don't want it.
- You got it.

180
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,782
God!

181
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,814
Wait a minute, I didn't even click...
How does it... I didn't even click it on.

182
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,616
She's got a bush like a porcupine.

183
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,764
I don't wanna know anything
about her bush. Hi, Lynette.

184
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,207
- Suck it!
- Good bout, Gil. Sweet bout!

185
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,706
Good job.

186
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,040
Wow. Way to go, buddy.

187
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,649
- Great bout.
- Fuck off!

188
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,817
Bro, really sorry I lost my shit out there.

189
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,788
I just did not see that
In Quartata coming.

190
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,950
Hey, man, don't worry.

191
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,891
You know, you came in
with a pretty sweet glissade.

192
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,361
Anybody seen my manchette?

193
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,625
Did you look under your plastron,
dick wicker?

194
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,167
- Fuck you, Larry!
- Fuck you, Eugene.

195
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,430
- Classic.
- Thank you, Larry.

196
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,140
Hey, so you guys want to,
like, get some grub

197
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,268
or grab a beer or something?

198
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,972
We're actually heading up
to Joshua Tree tonight.

199
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,674
Oh, yeah? What's going on up there?

200
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,216
We're just doing this thing
for Eugene, you know.

201
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:55,242
Kind of a bachelor party/camping trip
kind of thing, you know.

202
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,518
I didn't even know
you were getting married.

203
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,389
Yeah. Taking the leap next Sunday.

204
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,690
- Great.
- Dirty little slut.

205
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,163
He's gonna lose his virginity finally.

206
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,291
I've fucked my girlfriend. He's kidding.

207
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,804
Right on! Very cool.
Very, very cool. That's cool.

208
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,473
I would've invited you, man.
I just didn't think that you'd be into it.

209
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,635
You never really come out with us
after practice and stuff.

210
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,975
Oh, no, dude... Don't even.

211
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,574
It's so fine. Really.
Thanks, though. Thank you, but...

212
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,142
You know, it's funny, actually.
I just got engaged myself.

213
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,246
- Wow. That's awesome.
- You did? Congratulations.

214
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,915
- Mazel tov.
- That's great.

215
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,653
Good luck with that.

216
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,594
- Thank you. And you, too.
- Thanks.

217
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,224
Yeah.

218
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,261
All right, well,
we should probably hit the road.

219
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,323
- Traffic.
- Yes.

220
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,699
- Have a blast.
- Shotgun.

221
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,260
- We'll be back on Wednesday, right?
- Yeah.

222
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,602
Play a U2 record while you're there.

223
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,575
- Good. 'Cause of Joshua Tree.
- That's right.

224
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,109
It's hilarious, know what I mean?

225
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,487
No, I'm serious.
You know what my favorite nights are?

226
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,220
Hanging out with you girls,
and I can do that guilt-free

227
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,091
because Barry loves hanging out
with his friends, too.

228
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,323
I mean, every weekend,
there's a golf getaway,

229
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,229
a ski trip, a weekend in Vegas.

230
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,860
Wait, Vegas? You're not worried
he's gonna cheat on you?

231
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,804
He's 40 pounds overweight
with a Jewfro and a small dick.

232
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,738
Look, I love the guy to death,
but I'm far and away

233
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,241
the best-looking woman
he's ever gonna get,

234
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,800
and I'm only a 7, so, come on.

235
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,106
Oh, my God. You're not a 7.

236
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,689
Peter's not a freakazoid.

237
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,785
I don't know, Zo.
I mean, I think this is kind of serious.

238
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,387
A guy without friends
can be really clingy.

239
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,830
Like, my brother-in-law
drives my sister crazy.

240
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,868
He's always like,
"When are you gonna be home?

241
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,630
"Where're you going?
Can I come with you?

242
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,467
"But nothing's on TV.
What am I gonna do?"

243
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,734
- That's... No, come on. What the...
- "Be home before midnight."

244
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,368
Peter's not like that. Please.
He's just not like that.

245
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,638
Well, just wait.

246
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,203
But anyway, you've got six bridesmaids
and a maid of honor.

247
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,476
It's gonna be a little weird
if we're walking down the aisle alone.

248
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,211
- Yeah, I know.
- He's great.

249
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,685
- So who's gonna be his best man?
- I have no idea.

250
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,780
I honestly think that his best friend
is his mom.

251
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,587
- Terrible.
- No, no, no. Not like that.

252
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,291
Peter?

253
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,892
Peter?

254
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,829
Honey?

255
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,264
Hey!

256
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,307
- Hey!
- Hey!

257
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,043
I made you guys some root beer floats.

258
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,176
Peter, are those chocolate straws?

259
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,275
Yeah. Pirouettes. Pepperidge Farm.

260
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,116
Thank you so much for the floats, baby.
That was so sweet.

261
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,213
My pleasure. Enjoy.

262
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,282
- Hey, congratulations on the wedding.
- Congratulations!

263
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,787
I know. It's so exciting.
I feel so grown-up.

264
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,196
- All right, sir.
- Okay, ma'am.

265
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,361
Okay.

266
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,032
Shit! Do you think he heard us?

267
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,299
- No.
- No way.

268
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,238
I gotta get some fucking friends.

269
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,713
This is cool.
You're coming to me for help.

270
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,045
Well, the good news is
not only do I know men,

271
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,482
but straight guys are my specialty.

272
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,746
What does that mean?

273
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,983
I get bored pursuing gays.
I like to give myself more of a challenge.

274
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,548
- Yeah!
- Excuse me one second.

275
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,685
There you go, brother.
Dig deep, come on.

276
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,594
Push that shit out. Look at me,
I'm pinkies. I'm barely touching it.

277
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,828
You're clear. Locked it in, dude.
Nice job. Nice lift.

278
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,830
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

279
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,065
All right, I'll see you around.

280
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,629
I hope so.

281
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,878
- That guy was totally flirting with you.
- I told you.

282
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,510
And did you see his wedding ring?
Straight as an arrow.

283
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,611
I'm telling you, hooking up is easy.

284
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,622
Meeting platonic male friends,
not so much.

285
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,681
So, what do I do?
I mean, how do I meet friends?

286
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,317
It's such a weird concept.

287
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,488
Well, I can do some recon
around the gym,

288
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,429
but you're gonna have to be
aggressive about this, man.

289
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,558
- Yeah, yeah.
- Use the Internet to meet guys.

290
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,000
Get Mom to fix you up.

291
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,367
I mean, if you see a cool-looking guy,
strike up a conversation

292
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,372
- and ask him on a man-date.
- A what?

293
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,032
- A man-date.
- Okay.

294
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,337
- You know what I mean?
- No.

295
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,743
By that, I mean a casual lunch
or after-work drinks, okay?

296
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,337
No dinner and no movies.

297
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,542
You're not taking these boys
to see The Devil Wears Prada.

298
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,916
God, I love that movie.

299
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,886
No, I won't. I got you.
I know what you mean.

300
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,389
This is really exciting.
We're gonna find you some friends.

301
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,656
- So I'm gonna... What do I do?
- You don't play much?

302
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,186
- I used to play a lot of Hearts in college.
- This is the same thing.

303
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,029
I don't even know why he called.
This guy hasn't even played poker.

304
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,535
I don't know.
I don't know, but it's Zooey's fiancé,

305
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,037
so just shut the fuck up and be nice.

306
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,665
Well, if I do this, we have sex
with the lights on when you get home.

307
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,209
- Really?
- Yeah. Like in Jamaica.

308
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,542
- Fine.
- All night long.

309
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,042
- Fine. Love you.
- All right.

310
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:55,843
My brother's a great guy, you know?
I mean, he's smart, he's...

311
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,850
Well, actually,
I don't know him that well,

312
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,484
but I'll give you five free sessions
if you take him out.

313
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,184
Go Beckham!

314
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,793
So glad Robbie hooked this up.
This is awesome! This is awesome!

315
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,664
- Me, too. This is really...
- Isn't this great, man? I love soccer!

316
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,569
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

317
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,634
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

318
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,575
Come on, Peter, stand up. Here we go...

319
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,839
Shut the fuck up!

320
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,210
All right, now people are really upset.

321
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,441
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

322
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,346
- You shut up!
- Hey, watch the game!

323
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,317
Honey, he just moved to LA.
He barely knows anyone.

324
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,787
He's an architect.

325
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,586
His mother says
he's so excited to meet you.

326
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,093
Robbie told me not to have dinner
with any of these guys.

327
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,562
Your brother's a crazy person.
One dinner won't kill you.

328
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,566
- Doug?
- Peter?

329
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,402
- Hey.
- Hey.

330
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,572
- So you just moved here, huh?
- I did. Pretty recently.

331
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,577
A couple of weeks.
Fresh off the boat from Chicago.

332
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,275
Chi-Town.

333
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,905
- Windy City.
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,117
Da Bears.

335
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,177
Those sports guys.

336
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,658
You know what else, the other old
Saturday Night Live one I love? The...

337
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,786
What's the one Dana Carvey does
with the old lady who's like...

338
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,160
- Church Lady?
- Yes! Yes!

339
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,096
"Isn't that special?"

340
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,164
"Isn't that special?"

341
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,735
That sounded
kind of more leprechaun-y.

342
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,670
- It did?
- It did a little. Like a leprechaun.

343
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,213
Nice to meet you, too, Mel Stein.

344
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,247
The picture's from
a couple of years back.

345
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,783
Have a seat. I'm so happy
to meet you in person, you know.

346
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,091
Me, too. How long have you been
using the Internet?

347
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,220
Three or four years.

348
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,822
I didn't know anything about it
until a couple of years ago.

349
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,868
- You're good at it now.
- Thank you.

350
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,870
- And the big dog!
- There it is!

351
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,166
Let me ask you guys.
Let me ask you guys.

352
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,673
Beatles, Stones. On a count of three.

353
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,403
- One, two, three. Beatles.
- All in.

354
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,967
- Fuck you.
- I don't care.

355
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,070
- All in.
- You're an idiot.

356
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,239
That's you, pal.

357
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,306
I will call in.

358
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,510
- Too much for me.
- You're in.

359
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,018
- Anybody else? Just me and you?
- Yeah.

360
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,749
That's it? Pot right? Trip queens.

361
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,815
- Nice.
- Three ladies. Three ladies.

362
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,655
- Nice hand.
- Finally. Fucking finally.

363
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,991
- Wait, let's see what he's got.
- Yeah, let's see what he's got.

364
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,089
I have nothing. I have five spades.

365
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,327
- That's a flush.
- Yes, one, two, three...

366
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,835
Flush!

367
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,063
He's a fucking asshole.

368
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,435
- Relax.
- I'm not gonna relax.

369
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,634
- What?
- I said you're an asshole, Peter.

370
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,006
Don't take it too seriously.

371
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,046
What are you staying in
with seven deuce suited?

372
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,312
With a fucking rainbow rag flop!
Take the fucking chips. I'm buying in.

373
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,817
- I'm sorry...
- Just give me some more chips.

374
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,319
I didn't know it was a rainbow.

375
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,083
- Is the wine treating you well?
- It opened up beautifully. Thank you.

376
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,022
- Excellent.
- Come on.

377
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,092
- Hot. Hot.
- Oh, my God.

378
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,393
- She's so hot.
- She's smoking.

379
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,499
All right, Pete,
you done a boat race, right?

380
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,001
- No.
- Just drink the fucking beer,

381
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,970
- and you'll get the hang of it.
- I've got it. I will...

382
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,528
Doesn't matter who's winning.

383
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,596
It comes down to you and me.

384
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,141
- It's gonna be anchors.
- We're the anchors.

385
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,144
- Let's boat... Let's boat race! Race it up!
- Ain't no luck in boat racing.

386
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,806
One! Two! Three! Go!

387
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,715
Come on, Pete! It's all you, Peter!

388
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,251
Go, go, go!

389
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,484
Take him down!

390
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,957
- One more time!
- Let's go!

391
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,727
Come on! Go, Barry!

392
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,858
- Barry! Damn it, Barry!
- Fuck!

393
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,531
Yes! In your face! In your...

394
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,268
Holy shit!

395
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,812
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of my house.

396
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,872
- I'm so sorry.
- Just get out of my fucking house.

397
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,517
- I'm sorry.
- This is not cool! Get the fuck out!

398
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,490
I gotta tell you, Doug,
I really enjoyed this.

399
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,253
You know, I've been out
with so many jerks recently.

400
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,193
It's nice to meet somebody
I can have an actual conversation with.

401
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,695
- Let's do it again.
- I'd love to.

402
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,530
Okay. Tomorrow night. Matsuhisa, 8:00.

403
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,229
- I will see you there, sir.
- Awesome.

404
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,447
You've been so busy.

405
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,357
I've hardly seen you
these past couple weeks.

406
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,321
I know. I've been crazy at work.

407
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,557
I'm happy to see you now.

408
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,834
- Have you been kissing someone?
- No.

409
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,244
Peter, your mouth tastes like an ashtray.

410
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,981
Yes. I went to dinner with this guy,
and he kissed me.

411
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,949
What the fuck are you talking about?

412
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,513
My mom set me up with this guy,

413
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,718
and he thought I was gay,
and it was just...

414
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,385
It was a whole misunderstanding.

415
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,293
- Your mom set you up with a guy?
- Yeah.

416
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,093
You told me you were going to dinner
with a client.

417
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,463
- No.
- What the hell is going on?

418
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,059
Look, I overheard you
talking to the other girls

419
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,002
on your girls' night and...

420
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,130
I knew it.

421
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,176
Look, I know that you're stressed out
that I don't have any close friends,

422
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,734
so I've been trying to meet someone.

423
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,814
Right, you've been...
Okay, so that explains a lot.

424
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,875
I thought it was so weird
that you wanted to hang out with Barry.

425
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,615
- Yeah, exactly. That guy's a dick.
- Yeah.

426
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,953
- I threw up in his face.
- Yeah, I know. Denise told me.

427
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,255
- I threw up in his... A lot.
- Yeah.

428
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,488
- Projectiled.
- Yeah.

429
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,996
- That's a real thing.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,090
Well, I don't think I'm gonna
meet anybody by June 30th,

431
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,227
so our wedding party's
gonna be a little uneven.

432
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,831
Peter, I don't care.
I just want you to be happy

433
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,607
and to stop kissing strange men.

434
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,476
Wow, it's really smoky in there.

435
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,246
Yeah, he got up in there.

436
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,878
- Tongue?
- Oh, yeah.

437
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,888
You wouldn't mind brushing your teeth,
would you?

438
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,789
No. I've already done it
a couple of times.

439
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,784
I'll do the mouthwash again.

440
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:14,195
- There's some Tom's in the top cabinet.
- No, I gotta go with chemicals on this.

441
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,469
- I love you.
- I love you, too. I might use Comet.

442
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,018
It's a pleasure to meet you.

443
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,159
I live down there.

444
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,296
I like it. I'm liking it.

445
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

446
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,523
It's a good space, you know?
It's a good vibe.

447
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,125
- Yeah? Terrific.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,763
Well, when the Santa Anas
come through, it is majestic.

449
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,863
- Thanks.
- I'm excited.

450
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,964
- We'll let you know.
- Okay.

451
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,099
Thank you.

452
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,202
- Hello.
- Hi.

453
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,179
- lf you need any help, just let me know.
- Thanks.

454
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,408
Sure.

455
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,555
Thank you for eating.

456
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,150
- I'm the first one, huh?
- Yeah.

457
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,254
I never understood why people
are so afraid to eat at an open house.

458
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,628
I know.

459
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,726
Why's Ferrigno selling?

460
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,598
He bought a place in Jackson Hole.

461
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,603
Yeah, I think he's tired
of the Hollywood grind.

462
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,695
Right.

463
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,674
You know, I've always wanted a pad
with a giant Lou Ferrigno statue,

464
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,869
so I think I've found it.

465
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,145
He's got one.

466
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,273
You're wasting your time
with that couple. Just FYI.

467
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,346
Why do you say that?

468
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,149
I saw the guy pull in.
He's driving a Saab 9.3,

469
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,554
which, I'm not a snob, it's a great car,
but it costs $30,000.

470
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,958
This house must be,
what, 4, $4.2 million?

471
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,757
Doesn't quite compute, right?

472
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,095
Well, I hope that's not the case.
He told me he was gonna make an offer.

473
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,500
I think he's trying to impress that girl
he hasn't slept with yet.

474
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,231
- The feng shui.
- Yeah.

475
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,069
How do you know that?

476
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,170
Well, it's body language, you know?

477
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,840
Look, that guy needs to fart.

478
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,881
It's pretty clear,
but he doesn't know her well enough

479
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,542
to do it in front of her,
so I assume they haven't slept together.

480
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,053
- I like it. You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm good.

481
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,851
- He does seem to be clenching.
- Yeah, he doesn't wanna fart.

482
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:23,361
Watch. When he gets enough space,
he's gonna let one rip, I guarantee you.

483
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,453
That's a good move.

484
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,794
"Hey, go check out the kitchen, honey.
I'll meet you in there."

485
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,959
- Okay. Yeah.
- Now watch.

486
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,964
He's making his move slowly.
Slowly but surely. Watch the leg.

487
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,475
Wait for it. Wait for it. Fart.

488
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,772
- Boom. That's a fart, motherfucker.
- Oh, my God.

489
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,472
- That's a fucking fart.
- Oh, my God!

490
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,982
Look at him crop-dusting across
your open house. It's a disgrace.

491
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,213
- He farted in my open house.
- He sure did.

492
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,376
You know what, guy?

493
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,720
I like it, but I'm thinking
it might be a little bit small.

494
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,192
Totally, and it smells like fart.

495
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,523
- What?
- Never mind.

496
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,029
Let's take off, baby. Come on.

497
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,964
Roll down the windows
in that car, sweetheart.

498
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,058
You called that.
That was like a play-by-play.

499
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,363
That's amazing. You called that!

500
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,667
- Yeah. Well, I know my farts.
- Unbelievable.

501
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,367
Well, listen, just full disclosure.

502
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,576
I have no interest in buying this house.

503
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,078
Well, then why are you here?

504
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,081
To eat your free food
and to try to meet a divorcée.

505
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,548
- Are you serious?
- I am.

506
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,018
Yeah. I've found
that at the classy open houses,

507
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,555
the spread is usually pretty decent,

508
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,787
and there's a beautiful bevy of attractive
and newly-single women.

509
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,288
I don't know what to say.
Thank you for your honesty.

510
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,262
Thank you for the sun-dried tomato aioli,
because it's a revelation.

511
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,299
- Wow. Hey, thanks for noticing.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,301
All right,
I'm gonna take this panini for the road.

513
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,366
There's an open house in Bel Air that
promises to be replete with cougars.

514
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,434
- You don't wanna miss that.
- No, sir.

515
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,571
- It was nice to meet you. Yeah.
- You, too.

516
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,741
Hey, you know what, here,
let me give you my business card.

517
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,306
- All right.
- In case you're looking for,

518
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,613
you know, a new home or anything.

519
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,780
I actually specialize in smaller houses,
bungalows, that kind of thing.

520
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,916
- Lovely. Let me give you mine, as well.
- Okay.

521
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,757
- "Sydney Fife."
- That is my name.

522
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,886
There you go.

523
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,794
Well, thank you
for the great open house.

524
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,628
- My plezh. Okay.
- All right.

525
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,328
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too, Sydney.

526
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,538
Hello.

527
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,671
I can't just call him.

528
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,008
Why are you being such a chickenshit?

529
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,345
He gave you his card.
It's an open invitation.

530
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,782
Engage your core.

531
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,081
It's beach season. It's beach season.

532
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,452
I hate this.
There's no rules for male friendships.

533
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,718
What are you freaking out about?
You went out with those other guys.

534
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,228
- I'm really nervous about this one.
- 'Cause you really like him.

535
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:41,254
All right, buddy, great set.
Take five, I'll come rub you down.

536
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,896
Look, if he does call,
no more dinners, okay?

537
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,301
- It's sending the wrong message.
- I know, I know.

538
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,364
Hey, Peter! I got an extra ticket
to the Galaxy game tonight!

539
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:55,277
You know what? Thanks, man,
I'm sorry, I can't. I got a function.

540
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,309
I got season ticks.
I'll get you on the flip side. Here we go.

541
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,682
Hey, thanks a lot
for hooking me up with Elmo over there.

542
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,244
- That was a blast.
- What? That guy's cool.

543
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,449
Here we go. Here we go.
Come on, push it out.

544
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,794
Everything you got! Everything you got!
Everything you got!

545
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,632
Yeah.

546
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,472
Just to...

547
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,102
Hey... Pathetic.

548
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,045
Sydney, how you doing?
It's Peter Klaven.

549
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,479
Hey, Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.
We met at the open house last week.

550
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:38,386
Get some guts, would you?
I got some cheese. Give me a break.

551
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,155
No. Oh, my God.

552
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,720
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Carolyn.

553
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,262
Sorry.

554
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,805
Fife. You know what to do.

555
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:58,468
Hey, Peter. It's Sydney Klaven.
No, that's not right.

556
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,610
Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.

557
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,243
I met you last week at an open house,

558
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,914
and I had a showing and...

559
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:18,252
Anyway, I was wondering
if you ever wanted to get together

560
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:23,665
and talk about real estate and whatnot.
Or whatnot. And...

561
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,532
- Hey, sugar.
- Hey.

562
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,978
I'm sorry, I forgot what I was gonna say.
What was I saying?

563
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,950
Yes, the open house and we met...
Anyway, no rush.

564
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:44,751
You call me back
whenever you get a mo. Get a moment.

565
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,725
And we will talk when I talk to you.

566
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,191
All right.
Hope you're having a great day.

567
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,821
Okay. Bye, now.

568
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:04,968
Fuck.

569
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,146
I'm fine with a little mercury poisoning
as long as it means I get to eat raw fish,

570
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,910
'cause I love it so much.

571
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,178
My doctor said it's really bad
if you're trying to get pregnant.

572
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,810
I heard that.

573
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,219
Which Barry and I are doing.

574
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,491
Oh, my God, that's so exciting!

575
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,219
- I'm sorry.
- What?

576
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,888
I'm sorry.
I just pictured you and Barry having sex.

577
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,159
And he's so big and you're so tiny,
and I just...

578
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,827
- Hailey...
- Like, I totally imagined Barry just like...

579
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:31,891
Okay, hold on, wait.

580
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,369
Why are you even imagining us
doing it anyway?

581
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,804
- I'm seeing it again.
- Well, stop! Stop! Cut it!

582
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,171
No, I love Barry.

583
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,539
- Hey!
- Hey!

584
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,475
- Hey! Hey!
- Hi!

585
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,910
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

586
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,279
I just had a meeting downtown
with the owners of the development site,

587
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,841
so thought I'd stop in
and say hi on my way back to the office.

588
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,319
So, Peter,
how's your little manhunt coming?

589
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,549
Really, you told them? Shocking.

590
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,023
Well, I mean, Barry and his friends

591
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,957
said they had a great time with you
the other night.

592
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,584
- Seriously?
- No.

593
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,028
Well, I just...
I don't drink that much and they pound.

594
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,190
They were pounding drinks.

595
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,790
Yeah, you're not used to drinking
that much.

596
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,960
Excuse me just a second.

597
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,529
Peter Klaven.

598
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,872
Excuse me just one...
Hey, Sydney. How are you?

599
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,439
Is that a man or a woman?

600
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,538
I don't know. I've never heard of Sydney.

601
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,615
I could be in Venice by 5:00, yeah.
I can do that.

602
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,788
It's a man-date. It's a man-date.
This is a man-date.

603
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,381
James' Beach Bar and Grill.

604
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,256
I look forward to it. Sounds great.

605
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,756
All right. I'll see you in a jiff.

606
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,234
- "See you in a jiff"?
- I don't know why I said that.

607
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,999
I've never said that expression before
in my life. I just said, "See you in a jiff."

608
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,666
Honey, you're all flustered.
Who was that?

609
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,800
It was just this guy
that I met at my open house.

610
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,869
- Sydney something or other.
- Sydney. I like it.

611
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,883
- Oh, my God. Peter's got a boyfriend.
- And I don't.

612
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,179
Oh, God, why does everything
have to be about you?

613
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,276
Because I'm single.

614
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,063
I'm meeting him right now.

615
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,298
Dude, no dinner.
He'll get the wrong idea.

616
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,864
You don't wanna get another
tongue-fucking at the valet stand.

617
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,876
Yes, Robbie, I promise. No dinner.

618
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,674
Dude, I'm pumped about this.
Call me when you get home.

619
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,907
Yeah!

620
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,109
Thank you, bro.

621
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,113
All right, so you break it off
with your ex-girlfriend...

622
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,157
Yeah, and I met Zooey
the very next day.

623
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,419
Man, no laj between the vag?

624
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,758
- What does that mean?
- No lag time between vaginas.

625
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,657
Yeah, no. I don't...

626
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,361
I mean, I didn't plan for it
to be like that, you know,

627
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,767
with no laj, but it just happened.

628
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,069
All right. How's the sex?

629
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,332
That's a little private, wouldn't you say?

630
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,343
Look, it's something we think about
on a second-to-second basis,

631
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,712
and yet we're not supposed
to talk about it? Why?

632
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,510
Well...

633
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:05,313
I guess no one's ever really asked me
before, but it's good. Sex is good.

634
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,358
- Oh, boy.
- What, "Oh, boy"?

635
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,017
Well, your voice went up
when you said that.

636
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,355
So?

637
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,261
It means you weren't
being entirely truthful.

638
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:17,700
Look, I don't know this girl,
so you can talk to me. What's the deal?

639
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,170
I don't know, I guess maybe sometimes
I wish that she enjoyed, you know...

640
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,678
- Getting it in the tush?
- No. No, no, no.

641
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,872
- That's my bad.
- Oral sex.

642
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,580
She doesn't like to put it in the mouth?

643
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,153
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
I don't even know you. Forget it. Look.

644
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,090
Zooey's awesome,
and we have a great sex life.

645
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,720
We really do. I can't...
I don't even know why I said that.

646
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,857
Because you're speaking honestly,
all right? Relax.

647
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,532
And what about you?

648
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,962
- You ever been married?
- No.

649
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,199
For what I'm looking for,
divorcées are perfect, you know?

650
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,243
They don't want anything serious,
and neither do I.

651
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,177
Well, hey, man.
You know, if it works for you.

652
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,237
Believe me, Pistol, it is the best.

653
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,374
- "Pistol"?
- Yeah. Pistol.

654
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,648
- Because you're Pete. So Pistol Pete.
- Pistol Pete.

655
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,788
Excuse me,
you guys finishing up here soon?

656
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,385
No, sorry, chief,
we're actually staying for dinner.

657
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,123
No, actually, I already have
a dinner plan with my fiancée.

658
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,428
No, dude, this place
has the best fish tacos in the world.

659
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,295
Literally. Ranked.
You gotta have one or two.

660
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,472
It's the pico de gallo, man.
Just use your hands.

661
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,566
We're barbarians after all, men.

662
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,135
Every once in a while,
I go down to the Boardwalk

663
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,274
and I just throw my own feces
like a gorilla.

664
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,215
You all right?

665
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,988
How can you disagree with me on this?
I mean, look, my...

666
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,757
It's bad for the whole world.

667
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,230
My lease is gonna be up and I think...

668
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,699
- Are you talking about hybrid cars?
- Yes. Yes.

669
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,169
I thought you were talking
about hybrid animals.

670
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,637
- Hybrid animals?
- Yeah.

671
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,401
What the fuck is a hybrid animal?

672
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,910
It took Andre the Giant a barrel of beer
to get drunk, sometimes two.

673
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,209
- "Hello, pretty lady."
- "Anybody want a peanut?"

674
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,383
Should we get a third order
of fish tacos?

675
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,186
Hands down,
best fish taco I've ever had in my life.

676
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,882
God, those tortillas were incredible.

677
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:22,255
Yeah, they make them in-house.
It sets up the flavor for the whole dish.

678
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,418
You know what?
I just realized something.

679
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,657
I never even asked you
if you were interested in buying a house.

680
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,097
No. No, why would I be?

681
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,359
Well, it's just when you called me back,

682
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,631
I didn't know if you wanted
to talk about real estate or not.

683
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,932
You just seemed like a good dude.

684
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,237
I thought I'd see if you wanted
to grab a beer. That's all.

685
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,799
I'm glad you called.

686
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,278
- You get home safe, Pistol.
- You got it, Joban.

687
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,944
I'm sorry, what?

688
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,843
Nothing.

689
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,411
- No, what'd you say?
- I don't know.

690
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,056
You... You nicknamed me Pistol,
and I just called you Joban.

691
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,795
It means nothing. I don't...
I'm drunk. I'm gonna call a cab.

692
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,229
All right, man.
You have my number, yeah?

693
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,998
I got you stored in my iPhin.

694
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,871
- All right. If you need me, call, okay?
- Man, I'm golden.

695
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,604
- Yeah. All right, man.
- All right, bud.

696
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,209
Have a good night.

697
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,745
I don't know the number for a taxi.

698
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,893
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

699
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,458
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, we did. Yeah.

700
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,799
Sydney's a cool guy. Got kind of drunk.

701
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,138
- Really?
- Yeah, I had to take a cab home.

702
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,835
- Really? Did you...
- Throw up in his face?

703
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,968
- Yeah.
- No.

704
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,272
- Good.
- So that's good.

705
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,974
That's good. So is he your best man?

706
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:55,079
It's way too early to tell,
but it's very sweet of you to ask.

707
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,578
Go back to sleep.
I'll be in, in a second, all right?

708
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,350
I just wanna see
if I got any hits on Ferrigno.

709
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,549
Okay.

710
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,030
- Whoomp! There he is! There he is!
- Stop it. Stop it.

711
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,398
- Ass, ass and titties.
- Stop it. Fucking stop it.

712
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,905
- Fuck, I'm ticklish, Tevin.
- Okay. Uncle. Uncle.

713
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,599
Hey. How was the open hizzy?

714
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,438
- The what?
- The open house.

715
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,068
The open house. It was great.

716
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,875
- Yeah? Did you flip that bitch yet?
- Yeah.

717
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,143
No. I mean, I've had a few nibbles.
No bites.

718
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,015
Nibbles? Me no likey nibbles.

719
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,987
- Peter, can I talk to you as a friend?
- Sure.

720
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,219
You're dealing with the house
of a major Hollywood celebrity,

721
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,694
Mr. Louis Ferrigno,
The Hulk from television.

722
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,890
Of course. I know that.

723
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,262
How badly
do you wanna sell this house?

724
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,961
- I need to. You know, for...
- I know you need to.

725
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,367
You gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

726
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,962
You gotta network.
You gotta meet a lot of people.

727
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,474
You gotta get them some leave-behinds.

728
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,534
- I have brochures.
- Brochures are totally different, okay?

729
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,876
- How?
- You see this picture right here?

730
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,381
- Yeah.
- Do you know who took it?

731
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,178
- No.
- M. Night Shyamalan,

732
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,651
the director of The Village.

733
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,120
- Okay.
- What's your bus-bench ad situation?

734
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,022
- I don't have any.
- What about urinal cakes?

735
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,583
- How about urinal cakes?
- Do you use them?

736
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,596
- When I pee.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

737
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:17,327
Go into any Olive Garden,
P.F. Chang's Chinese Bistro,

738
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,767
T.G.I. Friday's, Fuddruckers.

739
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,967
What do they have in the bathroom?
Urinal cakes with my face on it.

740
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,741
Does it... I don't see how that would...

741
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,505
I've had people come up to me
on the streets and say,

742
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,045
"I know you from somewhere."

743
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,081
"Yeah, you do.
You pissed on my face, friend."

744
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,616
I don't see how
having somebody piss on my face

745
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,084
is gonna be able to sell
Lou Ferrigno's house.

746
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:40,783
Peter, you got the steak,
but I got the sizzle, my nizzle. Right?

747
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,988
Why don't we split the listing. Okay?

748
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,621
Let me wet my beak on this action.
We'll both be winners.

749
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,661
I appreciate it, but I'd really like to try
and do this myself.

750
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,828
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'm just putting on my friend hat here.

751
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,895
- I appreciate it. All right.
- Whoomp! There he is!

752
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,005
- Oh, jeez.
- Watch yourself, big girl.

753
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,123
- Fife.
- Hey, Sydney. It's the Pistol.

754
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,453
Who?

755
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,556
Peter Klaven from
the James' Beach thing the other night.

756
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,635
Hey, yeah, what's going on, man?

757
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,069
Yeah. Not much. I'm working like a dog.

758
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,068
But, you know, usual... The yoozh stuff.

759
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,635
I was just calling to say, hey,
I had a great time the other night.

760
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,910
Yeah, I had a nice time, man.
Those fish tacos are the tits.

761
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,510
Yeah, you know, if you ever wanna
grab lunch or something, nothing major.

762
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,110
Yeah. Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna take my puggle

763
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,053
for a little jaunt
on the Venice Boardwalk.

764
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:49,388
- You should come meet me.
- All right. Yeah, great.

765
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,985
Cool. Why don't you meet me
at Muscle Beach at like,

766
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,293
- I don't know, in a half an hour?
- Muscle Beach, half an hour.

767
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:58,096
I will see you there,
or I will see you on another time.

768
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,070
That was very confusing.
I don't know if you're gonna come or not.

769
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,630
- No, I'll be there. I'll be there.
- All right, I'll see you then, buddy.

770
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,610
All right. Laters on the menjay.

771
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,846
What did I just say?

772
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,547
He's a cross
between a beagle and a pug.

773
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,783
- The most beautiful dog in the world.
- He's cute. What's his name?

774
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,188
Anwar Sadat,

775
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,352
after Anwar Sadat,
former president of Egypt.

776
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,022
Right.
Because you're a fan of his policies or...

777
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,623
No, because they look exactly alike.

778
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,032
Hey, so how's Ferrigno coming?
You got any offers yet?

779
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,574
Not yet, no.

780
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,779
This guy that I work with, Tevin Downey,
he wants to share the listing with me.

781
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,344
What? And split the commission?

782
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,349
What about the land
you told me you wanted to buy?

783
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:50,649
It would put a delay on that,
but I gotta sell the place, you know?

784
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,588
Tevin's a total cheeseball,
but he markets himself like crazy.

785
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,182
He's on bus-bench ads all over town.

786
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,757
You know,
he says the place is out of my league.

787
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,660
Hey, that is bullshit. All right?

788
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,928
That open house was understated.
It was classy and elegant.

789
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,162
I've been to a million of those things
and nobody,

790
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,865
nobody puts out
rosemary flatbread paninis.

791
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,407
Now hold on, my dog needs to shit.

792
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,636
Well, I'm trying to sell the place,
believe me, but...

793
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:17,374
Hey, no, Pete.
Trying is having the intention to fail.

794
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,780
You gotta scrap that word
from your vocab.

795
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,546
Say you're gonna do it and you will.

796
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,911
Come on, buddy. Good boy.

797
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,715
- You need a plastic bag or...
- No, I don't clean up after my dog.

798
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,557
Dog poop is like a compost.

799
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,563
It's got a ton of nutrients
that enrich the soil.

800
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,859
But we're on pavement.

801
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,992
God damn it!
How about cleaning up after your dog?

802
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,195
You mind your own fuckhole!

803
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,475
What the fuck? Psycho.

804
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,742
What was that?

805
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,942
I'm a man, Peter.

806
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,850
I've got an ocean of testosterone
flowing through my veins.

807
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,650
Society tells us to act civilized,
but the truth is we're animals,

808
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,316
and sometimes you gotta let it out.
Try it.

809
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,457
I'm not gonna start screaming
in the middle of the Venice Boardwalk.

810
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,997
Come with me.

811
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,696
- This is silly.
- Indulge me.

812
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,732
That was really good.

813
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,709
Now gently remove your tampon
and try again.

814
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,277
Respect the process.

815
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,278
Why do you wanna mock the process?

816
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,683
- Because it doesn't do anything.
- No.

817
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,620
If you don't yell,
I'm gonna punch you in your stomach.

818
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,296
That was really good, man.
That was terrifying.

819
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,299
You just scared my dog.

820
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,708
- Yeah? You feel better?
- Yeah.

821
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:55,904
- Want to get a corn dog?
- Yeah!

822
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,277
Let's go.

823
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:07,321
...the span of this, like, I don't know,
30 pages. It's insane. It's crazy.

824
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,485
I know. I read it in college, and I loved it.

825
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,490
What a great house.

826
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,531
Thanks, man.
Yeah, come check out the back.

827
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,792
Yeah.

828
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,932
- This is a bumper car I got on eBay.
- Wow.

829
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,438
I was in a bidding war
with CarnivalKid 32,

830
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,304
so I had to go on the "Buy It Now" price,
but I got it.

831
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,934
- Coolness.
- And you remember Marlena.

832
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,035
Hey, Lenish.

833
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,807
Now let's check out
the pièce de résistance, bitch.

834
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,576
I wanna do it. Separate garage.

835
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,747
- Mr. Klaven.
- Very nice.

836
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,483
Welcome to the Temple of Doom.

837
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,489
Holy shit, Sydney. This place is insane.

838
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,052
Holy fuck. Oh, my God.

839
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,158
- Thanks, man. I try.
- This is amazing.

840
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,255
- Thank you, sir.
- You got some TVs.

841
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,959
I do. I do.

842
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,968
Photographs.

843
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,864
- Beer?
- I'll snake a brew.

844
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,170
- Put on some tunes.
- Is that you?

845
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,173
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me in ninth grade, man.

846
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,941
- Are you that little kid?
- Yeah, I was a late bloomer.

847
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,641
"Wrecking Crew."

848
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,147
- Come and take a load off, bud.
- Oh, man.

849
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,845
Pop a squizz nut.

850
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,618
What's going on over there?

851
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,192
This is where I jerk off.

852
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:24,125
And the condoms?

853
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:28,065
- I wear them when I masturbate.
- Are you kidding me?

854
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,669
I always get this reaction,

855
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,608
but the fact is they decrease sensitivity
so I can last longer.

856
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,373
And there's no sticky mess to clean up.

857
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:42,613
And when your divorcées come over,
you put them away?

858
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,883
Pete, this is the man cave.
There's no women allowed in here.

859
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,687
I got a jerk-off station, for God's sakes.

860
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,250
Sit down, man.

861
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,726
What about when your guy friends
come over? Aren't you embarrassed?

862
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:59,394
Masturbation is a part of life, Pete.
Dudes masturbate. So do chicks.

863
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,467
You never talked about masturbating
with your friends?

864
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,131
- No, I haven't.
- All right.

865
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,199
When was the last time you did it, Pete?

866
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,436
I'm not gonna tell you that.

867
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,241
Hey. Listen, you think of this place
as a Cone of Silence, all right?

868
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,249
I'm not gonna tell anybody
any of the things you say in here.

869
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,978
You have my word.

870
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:23,389
Zooey went to the Pasadena flea market
with her friends last weekend,

871
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,257
and I did it then.

872
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,229
Well, that sounds lovely.

873
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,857
What'd you use? Internet or DVD?

874
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,060
How do you get me
to tell you these things?

875
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,364
Come on.

876
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,963
I used a picture of Zooey in a bikini

877
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,236
that I took when we were on vacation
in Cabo San Lucas.

878
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,437
Wait, you jacked off
to a picture of your own girlfriend?

879
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,004
You... That... Wow. That is sick.

880
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,812
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

881
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:48,943
What's wrong with that?

882
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,513
Pedro, there is so much wrong with that,
I don't even know where to begin. It's...

883
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,628
- That is sick, man.
- Someone's ears were burning.

884
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,722
Heard you say you jacked off
to her picture, sicko.

885
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,130
Hey, babe.

886
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,570
Good. Yeah, I'm over here at Sydney's.
We're just chillaxing.

887
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,572
We're in the chill station.

888
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,438
Yeah, I'm kind of playing hooky
from work.

889
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,709
No, I'll see you at home later on.

890
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,679
Love you, too. Bye-bye.

891
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,514
Hey, why'd you tell her
you bailed from work?

892
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,281
I didn't wanna lie to her.

893
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,016
You're one of the most honest people
I've ever met. You can understand that.

894
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,456
Yeah, I never lie to women,

895
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:32,120
but, I mean, there are some things
I choose not to share with them.

896
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,029
- I don't really see the distinction.
- Really?

897
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,591
So you've told Zooey that you jacked off
to her picture last weekend.

898
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,795
Well, no, but...

899
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,464
All right. Well, you shared
that information with me, didn't you?

900
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,531
So there are dividing lines.
That's all I'm trying to say.

901
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,133
Like, I love to take a girl out to dinner,

902
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,076
but I'm not gonna go golf 18 holes
with her.

903
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,013
You know what? Zooey and I played golf
together a couple of months ago.

904
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,745
- It was really fun.
- That sounds like a fucking nightmare.

905
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,915
What do you play?

906
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:04,118
I play a little bit of everything,
but if I had to narrow it down to one,

907
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,128
I guess I'd say I'm an axman.

908
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,193
- Sweet. Guitar.
- What about you? You play anything?

909
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,930
I used to slap the bass
in a high school jazz band.

910
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,768
- All right.
- Rush. I love Rush.

911
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,968
Dude, Rush is the greatest band
of all time.

912
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:24,139
Yeah, no, how about of all time?
All time.

913
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,581
You know what? We should
jam together sometime, man.

914
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,315
Yeah. Totally.

915
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,517
Totes McGotes. Cool.

916
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,292
Well, you know what?
I should probably hit it to it.

917
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,594
All right, yeah.
I gotta get to bed early, anyway.

918
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,070
I'm doing a big day hike
with my buddies in Malibu tomorrow.

919
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,699
Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. It was a really...
It was a good hang.

920
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,902
- Yeah.
- Sweet, sweet hanging.

921
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,679
- Well, adiós, Pistol.
- Take it easy, Siddy Slicker.

922
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,513
- I'm sorry.
- What?

923
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,683
I called you Siddy Slicker.

924
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,548
- That sucks.
- No, it was pretty close.

925
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,786
It's a lame nickname.

926
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,086
I thought it was good.
It was better than Joban.

927
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,326
Yeah, right. I'm gonna get it.
I'll get a better one.

928
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,197
- Dude, it was fine.
- I'm gonna get you.

929
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,328
- Get out of here. Get out of here.
- I'm gonna get you, sucka.

930
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,202
Later on, my...

931
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:31,241
Peter, I have a Lou Ferrigno for you
on line three.

932
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,913
Put him through.

933
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,022
Mr. Ferrigno. Hey, it's Peter Klaven.

934
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,062
Peter, what the hell's going on?

935
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,893
Yeah. If you just go past the first area
to the left, he's right there.

936
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:52,026
- Sure. What's your name?
- Leanne.

937
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,161
Leanne. That was my mother's name.

938
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,173
- Really?
- I don't know. Was it?

939
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,438
Peter, it's been on the market
for three weeks...

940
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,239
- Yes.
- ... and we haven't gotten one offer.

941
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,304
And that's why we're having another
open house this weekend.

942
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,179
Hello, mystery woman.

943
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,519
I think it was very beneficial,
very beneficial.

944
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,418
Beneficial? It was beneficial?

945
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,423
So you're telling me
we're gonna sell this house?

946
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,187
Absolutely,
and I've gotten many nibbles this week.

947
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,319
- Nibbles?
- Yes, sir.

948
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,987
It's all about food with you, Peter.

949
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,554
No one cares about
the stupid sandwiches you put out.

950
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,568
No, sir. No, I absolutely agree with you.

951
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,571
You want to sell a house
and not a panini.

952
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,470
- Paninis? Paninis?
- Yes, sir.

953
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,598
Don't make him angry.

954
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,666
Enough with the cold cuts,
the condiments.

955
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,406
- You wouldn't like him when he's angry.
- What the hell you think this is?

956
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,176
No, I understand.
It's an open house and not a deli.

957
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:43,379
- Peter? Hello? You need to focus.
- Yeah. Yep. I think...

958
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,318
- I think...
- Let people know my house is for sale.

959
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,552
Forget about the sandwiches
and focus on selling my fucking house.

960
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,616
- Let's do this, okay?
- Yes, sir.

961
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,786
- Okay?
- Okay.

962
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,626
- Goodbye.
- All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

963
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,465
You all right?

964
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,468
- Hulk busting your balls?
- Yeah.

965
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,903
- What are you doing here?
- My blood bank's a few blocks away.

966
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm AB negative. It's extremely rare,
so I try to donate every couple of weeks.

967
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,510
That's really nice, Sydney.

968
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,604
There's also this nurse there
who I wanna fuck so badly.

969
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,651
Oh, boy, here we go.
Should have guessed.

970
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,585
Hey, weren't you supposed to go hiking
with your friends today?

971
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,283
Yeah, a couple of them had to bail,
but we'll reschedule.

972
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,553
Anyway, listen, I got a house full
of leftover Koo Koo Roo,

973
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,561
so I was thinking maybe you
and me could go grab some lunch

974
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,995
and squeeze in a little jam session?

975
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,362
Leftover Koo Koo Roo?

976
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,129
Well, that sounds
about as appetizing as

977
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:36,002
a big pile of...
A plate of dirt, or something.

978
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,774
I'm... I was... I'm kidding.

979
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:42,005
Yeah. I still want to hang out
despite that joke.

980
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,911
- That was a bad joke.
- Yeah. You're better than that.

981
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,152
That's it.

982
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,092
- How's that feel?
- It feels tasty.

983
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,431
- Yeah? You sound pretty good, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

984
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,027
Here we go.

985
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,548
Wow, that's a good one, bud.

986
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,181
Hey, check out these two.

987
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:33,889
I call them bowsers. It's my nickname
for people who look just like their dog.

988
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,022
Good boy.

989
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,032
Bowsers?
Where'd you come up with that?

990
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,658
It sounded right.

991
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:42,262
Shit. Hey, geek!
I just stepped in your dog's shit.

992
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,573
Now I'm gonna make you eat it.

993
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,575
Peter, run!

994
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,143
- Yeah!
- Take it.

995
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,685
It's a bit of a throwback, but it comes
with the built-ins. It's wired for sound.

996
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,917
This is fun.
This is a pair of jeans that he actually...

997
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,983
This house is exquisite.

998
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,020
I'd like to make an offer.

999
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,032
What do you think, hon?

1000
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,441
Yeah, I don't like that,
but for the most part, I mean...

1001
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,875
- Take it.
- Really?

1002
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,440
Yeah, take it.

1003
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,720
Sydney, what's up, man?

1004
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,116
What happened? What?

1005
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,317
Shut up! No.

1006
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,359
Did it smell weird? Is it discolored?

1007
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,832
Shut the fuck up!

1008
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,309
So how long have you guys
known Sydney?

1009
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,675
- It feels like forever.
- What?

1010
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,010
Remember that time
we tripped acid together

1011
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:02,643
- and he made us watch the news?
- That was a remarkable night.

1012
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,744
- Dude. Dude. Don't. Dude.
- Don't be scared.

1013
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,016
- Stop it. Stop it. Drive! Drive!
- Don't lean! Don't lean!

1014
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:11,786
Yeah, Pistol.

1015
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,496
Dude, Peter is on fire.

1016
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,926
- Boo-yah! Yeah!
- Fuck me raw!

1017
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,029
That's what I'm talking about.

1018
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,404
- Sweet lunge, Peter.
- Yeah, Pete.

1019
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,635
Suck it, Gil!

1020
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,545
I love it!

1021
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,708
Marvin Berry.

1022
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:39,049
"You remember
that new sound you were looking for?"

1023
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,759
Pete!

1024
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,535
- Are you all right?
- My fucking ass.

1025
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,594
- Hey, you did great today though, man.
- You did. You made it up.

1026
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,197
- I made it to the top. First time.
- Good job, bro.

1027
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,775
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice meeting you guys.

1028
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,709
- All righty, Syd.
- Wait, where you going?

1029
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,939
It's Sunday night.
Tina's nephews are coming over.

1030
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,142
We're gonna watch
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

1031
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,185
No, it's just, I thought
we were all gonna have dinner together,

1032
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,049
so I ordered us a 6-foot sub.

1033
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,817
But I gotta bolt, too. I promised the kids
I'd take them to Cheeseria.

1034
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:14,948
A little pizza action.

1035
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,357
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna be stuck
at home grading papers tonight,

1036
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,258
but thanks anyway. All right?

1037
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,819
Fun day, guys.

1038
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,024
- Pete?
- Man, you know, on Sunday night,

1039
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,262
Zooey and I usually watch HBO.

1040
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,461
Right. Yeah, yeah, of course. Cool.

1041
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,667
But I can't let you eat
a 6-foot sub all by yourself.

1042
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,199
- Do you want some?
- No,

1043
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,438
I had like a foot and a half
back at Sydney's. I'm golden.

1044
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,210
So, what do you guys do for, like,
seven straight hours?

1045
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,480
Whatever. I mean, like, we'll just
hang out, you know. Shoot the shit.

1046
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,282
Sometimes we jam a little bit.

1047
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,414
- You play an instrument?
- Yeah.

1048
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,355
I can't believe I've never told you.
I play bass.

1049
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,759
- Really?
- Yeah. I slap the bass big time.

1050
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,992
What do you... What is that?
You sound like a leprechaun.

1051
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,795
- No, that's a reggae guy.
- What is that?

1052
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,801
- I just did reggae.
- It doesn't sound...

1053
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,097
- It doesn't sound reggae?
- No.

1054
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,105
- Slap the bass.
- No.

1055
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,043
- How does it...
- It's like, big time, big time.

1056
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,079
- Big time.
- Big time. Slap the bass big time.

1057
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,541
Slap the bass.

1058
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,049
- That sounded like Borat.
- Yeah.

1059
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:17,678
- Slap the bass. Big time.
- That's better. That's better.

1060
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,619
Syd and I have gotten pretty good
at a couple of Rush songs.

1061
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,850
What do you mean, like,
fast-paced rock?

1062
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,587
No, like, Rush. Like the band Rush.

1063
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,060
- I don't know them. The...
- The holy triumvirate.

1064
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,257
- Wait, you don't know Rush?
- No.

1065
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,857
- You don't know Rush, the band?
- No.

1066
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,870
- "Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer"?
- No!

1067
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,138
All right, I'm gonna hit you up
with a little iTunes acción.

1068
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,234
I cannot believe
you've never heard Rush.

1069
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:44,576
So when am I gonna meet this guy
who's stolen you away from me?

1070
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,772
Pretty soon, actually.

1071
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,146
I invited him
to that little engagement party

1072
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,514
my parents are throwing for us.

1073
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,452
Wow, Peter! This is serious.

1074
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,012
It's mellow. Besides,
I wanted to introduce him to Hailey.

1075
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,854
- That's interesting. Yeah, I like that.
- Right?

1076
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,861
Hey, let me ask you something.
Are you ready to get your world rocked?

1077
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,124
Ready! Yes.

1078
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,933
- Are you ready to get your mind blown?
- Do it!

1079
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,435
Do you want to get some Neil Peart
all up in you?

1080
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,937
I don't know.

1081
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:13,502
Well, prepare to be Rushified!

1082
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,814
- Sounds better on big speakers.
- I could see that.

1083
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:30,021
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

1084
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:36,460
- Do you do it that high when you do it?
- Well, in real life, I do it low.

1085
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,331
- But air bass works best up here.
- Right.

1086
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:44,006
This is exactly what I look like
when I jam out, man.

1087
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,042
When I jam with my bass.

1088
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,607
Slap the bass, man.

1089
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,671
- There you go. There you go.
- I'm slapping the bass, man.

1090
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,617
Slap the bass, man. I slap the bass.

1091
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,846
Please don't do that.

1092
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,980
- Slap the bass.
- Please?

1093
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,353
Slap the bass.

1094
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,858
- For the sake of our relationship.
- Slap that bass.

1095
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:07,385
Please stop. Please. Please stop!
Thank you.

1096
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,364
I'm slapping the bass.

1097
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,236
I'm so glad
you're celebrating at my restaurant.

1098
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,208
Of course, Mr. Chu.
We wouldn't go anywhere else.

1099
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,938
Hey, this is my brother, Robbie.
Robbie, this is Sydney.

1100
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,640
- Hey, Bro Namath.
- Nice. Nice to meet you.

1101
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,151
- Peter, you remember Alan.
- From the gym.

1102
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,579
- Yeah, hey, man.
- Hi, good to see you again.

1103
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,521
- Alan, I'm Sydney.
- Sydney, nice to meet you.

1104
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,718
It's a pleasure, man.

1105
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,158
All right.
We're gonna grab some drinks.

1106
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,220
- Cool, sweet.
- All right. Show them your stuff, fellas.

1107
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,162
- Hi.
- Hey.

1108
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,298
Zooey, this is Sydney.
Sydney, this is my fiancée, Zooey.

1109
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,636
Sydney, I'm so happy to meet you.
I've heard so many great things.

1110
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,039
Same here. And let me tell you,

1111
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,272
this guy, he's gaga over you.
It's adorable.

1112
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,404
- Honestly.
- It's true. It's true.

1113
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,812
- It's true.
- Guilty as charged.

1114
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,407
Hailey. Hailey.

1115
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,349
Sydney, this is my oldest friend
in the world, Hailey.

1116
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,617
- All right.
- Hi. I'm good.

1117
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,257
You didn't ask, but I'm good.

1118
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,090
- Nice to meet you, Sydney.
- It's a pleasure.

1119
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,190
Great. I told you we were early.

1120
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,733
- Would you shut up?
- It's supposed to be...

1121
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,393
The minute we get in
you have to start bitching already?

1122
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,697
- You told me it was a drop-by.
- You know what?

1123
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,260
- This isn't a drop-by.
- This is not a drop-by.

1124
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,965
It's a damn engagement party.
What is wrong with you?

1125
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,029
Can I have a Belvedere on the rocks,

1126
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,097
- please?
- You're such an asshole.

1127
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,609
Could you just shut up
and not talk to people tonight?

1128
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:28,735
And something
with sour mix in it for her.

1129
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,473
I'm sorry they didn't cater this to you
and your liking.

1130
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,707
- Hey, guys.
- No...

1131
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,749
- Hi, you look beautiful!
- Hey.

1132
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,409
- Hello, sweetie. How you doing, baby?
- Hi.

1133
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:36,952
- Thanks for coming.
- Hi.

1134
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,612
- You guys know each other.
- How you doing? Yeah, we do.

1135
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,918
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So...

1136
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,783
- What do you got there?
- Sex on the beach. Yeah.

1137
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,228
You never know! Gotta be prepared.

1138
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:49,859
- The possibility.
- Wow.

1139
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,299
I'm just saying, you know.

1140
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,460
- What is going on over there?
- Yeah, let me tell you.

1141
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,970
- Is that her date?
- I'll give you the whole lowdown.

1142
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,472
Should we...

1143
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,441
What's up?

1144
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,580
Hey, I don't remember.
Do you play an instrument?

1145
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,481
- No.
- Because Syd and I, my buddy Sydney,

1146
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:12,851
- we've been jamming a lot...
- I don't play any instruments.

1147
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:16,790
I slap some bass,
and then Sydney's an axman.

1148
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,953
'Cause I was gonna say
if you wanted to jam with us,

1149
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:21,929
you know, that'd be cool.
But you don't have...

1150
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,932
You have a piano in your house, though,
don't you?

1151
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,492
- Yeah, I don't play.
- Really? Why do you have a piano?

1152
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,863
The decorator put it there.

1153
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,705
Your... Does he... I thought...
No one plays?

1154
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,074
- I'm gonna go check on the table.
- All right. Yep.

1155
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:37,737
- Hi. I'm Denise.
- Hi.

1156
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,042
- Denise.
- I'm Zooey's friend.

1157
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,241
I've heard so much about you.

1158
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,511
- It smells like a fucking pet shop in here.
- Hi. How are you? Okay.

1159
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,782
- Mrs. Klaven, the banquet room is ready.
- And who's Mr. Sunshine here?

1160
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,050
Hi. This is my husband, Barry.

1161
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,524
Come on back, everybody.
The banquet room is ready.

1162
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,029
Well, I'm filling myself up.
I need to undo my pants.

1163
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,959
There's a lot of protein, but I love it.

1164
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:05,202
If I may, I think it's only fitting
that we're eating tonight at Hop Louie's

1165
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,902
because this is, after all,

1166
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,877
Peter's favorite restaurant
to bring all of his dates.

1167
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,746
So of course he would bring Zooey here
their first night out.

1168
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:17,013
- Just like the rest of them.
- No.

1169
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,812
I remember that night when Peter
got home, he called me and he said,

1170
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,882
"Mom, this is the girl I'm gonna marry."

1171
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:30,191
And it's not just because she wanted
an extra order of slippery shrimp.

1172
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,790
On the first date?

1173
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,029
- Hey, now.
- Sometimes.

1174
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,234
But the point is,
here we are eight months later.

1175
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,433
Peter, Zooey,

1176
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,843
we love you,

1177
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,510
and we wish only the best for you both.

1178
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,418
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1179
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,977
- To Peter and Zooey.
- Cheers.

1180
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,149
- Cheers.
- Thanks, Mom.

1181
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,551
- Cheers, bro.
- Thanks.

1182
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,618
Well, I promised Denise
we'd be gone after appetizers, so...

1183
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,994
You know what?
I'd actually like to just say a few words

1184
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,556
- if it's cool with the table.
- Wow.

1185
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:12,434
What an honor it is to be sitting here
with Peter and Zooey's friends, family,

1186
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:17,605
Hailey, Robbie's lover,
Robbie, Oz, Joyce.

1187
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,581
Thank you
for hosting this beautiful dinner.

1188
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,614
You got this guy
with the smoking hot wife.

1189
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,981
And finally, we got Zooey.

1190
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,359
Zooey, you are about to marry
one of the most honest,

1191
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:36,330
kind and fun-loving people
I've ever had the honor of knowing.

1192
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,524
The Pistol is a pleasure-giver,
that's for sure.

1193
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,002
Yeah. A fucking puke pistol.

1194
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:45,598
And the thing about a man like that,
a man like Peter,

1195
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,769
is that he never asks
for anything in return,

1196
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,813
and that's why I'm here.

1197
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:55,013
I'm here as Peter's friend,
as Peter's confidant,

1198
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,920
just to say to you, beautiful Zooey,

1199
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,357
give it back. Yeah?

1200
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,426
Return the favor.

1201
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,593
And if you do,

1202
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:20,541
I guarantee that you will have a beautiful
and pleasure-filled union.

1203
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,976
- I don't think she sucks his dick.
- Watch your mouth.

1204
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:26,777
With that, I'd like to raise a glass
to Pete and Zooey.

1205
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,012
Cheers.

1206
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,614
- Peter and Zooey.
- Cheers.

1207
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,290
What the hell did you tell Sydney
about me?

1208
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,591
Nothing.

1209
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,900
I mean, aside from how much I love you.

1210
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,164
So, what was with all that
pleasure-giver stuff?

1211
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,339
I don't...

1212
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,734
I might have mentioned in passing
or something

1213
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:58,042
that you don't like doing oral sex.

1214
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,208
- Peter, that stuff is private.
- Is it? Really?

1215
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,119
And telling Hailey and Denise
about the hot tub in Mexico isn't?

1216
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,817
- That is so different. They're...
- What? How?

1217
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,654
- I've known them forever.
- So?

1218
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,558
Peter, see, Sydney's like a stranger.

1219
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,596
Hardly. He's become
a really good friend of mine,

1220
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,564
and now you know how I feel
when there's no privacy

1221
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,601
- between you and your girlfriends.
- I thought you loved those guys.

1222
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:20,966
I do, I love them, but, you know,

1223
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,200
some things I want to remain
between you and me.

1224
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,407
Okay. Okay.

1225
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,009
By the way,
it's not that I don't like doing it.

1226
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:43,183
It's just that
Rodney just hated getting them.

1227
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,792
Wait, what guy hates getting blowjobs?

1228
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,592
He had some weird
intimacy problems, okay?

1229
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:52,661
By the end of our relationship, he would
literally shiver when I touched him.

1230
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:56,068
But before that, I always liked it.

1231
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,305
I liked it.

1232
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,238
Great. That's great.

1233
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,480
Perfect. I mean, no pressure.
It's not like I'm saying,

1234
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:11,782
"Hey, let's go home tonight
and get some BJs." But, you know...

1235
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,754
Look, if Sydney hadn't asked me
about our sex life,

1236
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,155
we wouldn't even be talking about this.

1237
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,920
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1238
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,461
You're right.

1239
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,858
- And Hailey was really into him.
- She was?

1240
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,162
Yeah, she liked how honest
and direct he was with her.

1241
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:28,567
And, yeah, I know, that's the way he is.
That's his thing.

1242
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:32,705
- The four of us should go out.
- Yeah. That'd be great.

1243
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:33,901
Yeah.

1244
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,440
Sweet.

1245
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,776
- Well, have a good Pilates class.
- I will.

1246
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,411
- Be sure to drink lots of water.
- Yeah.

1247
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

1248
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,417
- Hey, Pete, let's go out back, yeah?
- Yeah.

1249
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,961
- She was very nice-looking.
- Yeah, I fucked her.

1250
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,296
I wonder if my pineapple
matches your pineapple.

1251
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,271
Hey, you want to check?

1252
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:09,369
Nope. Yours is short and fat
and mine is long and skinny.

1253
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:10,838
Yeah.

1254
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:13,905
Pete, can I talk to you about something?

1255
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,448
- Yeah, what's up?
- Will you put down your treat

1256
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,042
for a minute?

1257
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:24,425
I feel really horrible about that toast
I gave at your engagement dinner.

1258
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,017
It was ridonculous.

1259
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,461
I was really excited to meet Zooey
and your family,

1260
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,762
and then I showed up there
and I was just... I got so nervous.

1261
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,563
It wasn't so great.

1262
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:37,368
I want you to know I'm really sorry.
Everybody must hate me.

1263
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,000
No, no, no.
Look, you had good intentions.

1264
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,135
- I did.
- I know one person that didn't hate you.

1265
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:46,147
Was it Benji's wife?
She's a hot piece of ass.

1266
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,082
- No, Hailey.
- Yeah. She was funny.

1267
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,420
I think she likes you.
We should all go out.

1268
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,615
She seems great, Pete, but honestly,
within five minutes of meeting her,

1269
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,126
she was telling me how she can't wait
to get married and have kids.

1270
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,855
Look, she was kidding around.

1271
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,796
I made reservations to play golf
on Sunday for the four of us.

1272
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,163
No, Pete, I told you,
I don't play sports with women.

1273
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,328
Look, man, you told my fiancée
that she needs to give me blowies

1274
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,737
in front of my whole family, all right?
You owe me.

1275
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,032
- You make a valid point.
- It's golf. It's fun!

1276
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,509
I never have a beer until the ninth hole.

1277
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,347
Maybe we can change that rule.

1278
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,946
- Okay. All right.
- Keep your head down and fluid.

1279
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,787
- Okay. Okay.
- Great, come on. You got it.

1280
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,663
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

1281
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,226
- Zooey, that was a great shot.
- Great shot.

1282
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,737
Really, really good. I'm really impressed.

1283
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:46,405
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1284
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:50,138
- Fuck!
- Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry, Sydney. Sorry.

1285
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:55,047
Motherfucker!
Fucking cock in my fucking shit! God!

1286
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,543
- Mary.
- You okay, man?

1287
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,021
- I'm sorry.
- This is my nightmare!

1288
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,293
- Whack it up.
- Whack it, Hails.

1289
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,456
- Beautiful day.
- Yeah, it is. It's really nice.

1290
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,690
It's kind of frustrating.

1291
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,931
Yeah. My shin hurts.

1292
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,096
I didn't realize
my skin could bruise that quickly.

1293
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,367
- You're good.
- Guys, you're killing us here. Seriously.

1294
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,739
- Let's get the ladies moving.
- Listen, just give me a second.

1295
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,507
Rate of play, rate of play, rate of play,
rate of play, rate of play.

1296
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:28,516
Hailey, you know what, why don't we just
pick it up and move down the fairway?

1297
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:29,915
- No, this is fine.
- Because she won't have a chance

1298
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,681
- to practice, right, Peter?
- I got it.

1299
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,222
He's kind of got a point. I mean,
we're really holding these guys up.

1300
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,554
You're being an asshole.
Hailey, just take your time, okay?

1301
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,718
He's really not being an asshole.
There's a protocol.

1302
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,728
The marshals come by,
and there is some time pressure.

1303
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,821
- You know, I'm done. This sucks.
- Hailey, please...

1304
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,297
- I'm out of here.
- Please don't go.

1305
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,595
- Where are you going?
- Come on, Hailey. It's okay.

1306
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,431
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- I mean, we'll... Come on, Hailey.

1307
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,561
- Please come back.
- Where are you going?

1308
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,038
- Did you say something?
- No.

1309
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,678
Thank you.

1310
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,521
- Hey, man.
- Dude Von Dudenstein,

1311
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,958
- what are you doing tonight?
- I just left you half an hour ago.

1312
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,561
I'm watching HBO with Zooey.

1313
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,723
I know, but I just got an e-mail alert
from the Rush fan club.

1314
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,326
The Holy Trinity is playing
a small club gig tonight at the Avalon.

1315
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,430
Dude, it's Sunday night.
I can't bail on her again.

1316
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,837
Dude, you have your whole life

1317
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,068
to sit around
and watch premium cable with Zooey.

1318
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,077
Whatever, it's our ritual. It's HBO.

1319
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,476
It's not TV, it's HBO.

1320
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,980
Have you ever watched Sunday night
programming on HBO? It's spectacular.

1321
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,516
It's fucking Rush.

1322
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,919
I haven't seen them
since the Signals tour.

1323
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,392
Can I invite Zooey?

1324
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:19,522
- Slapping the bass!
- Slapping the bass!

1325
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,296
What the fuck?

1326
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:03,129
Yeah!

1327
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:24,722
My God. We could practice every day
for six months, and I'm planning on it,

1328
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,990
and we'll still suck. Yeah.
I'll give you a call.

1329
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,664
All right. Take it easy, Magooch.

1330
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,464
- Were you spying on me?
- Yeah, I was.

1331
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,006
Because I'm totally weirded out
about what's going on between you two.

1332
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,270
What are you talking about?
We were just going over the set list.

1333
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,542
- I mean, what's the big deal?
- The big deal is

1334
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,743
that we were supposed to have
a date night,

1335
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,048
and you took me to this concert,
which is cool,

1336
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,248
but then we get there
and it's like I don't even exist.

1337
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:59,556
You don't even look at me.
You're licking Sydney's bass guitar.

1338
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:02,426
There were tons of guys
that were licking each other's basses.

1339
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:06,093
I just...
I feel like I'm losing you a little bit.

1340
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:09,598
What? We were just doing
a recap of the set list.

1341
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,568
- What? Zooey.
- Okay.

1342
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:14,204
I was going over the set list.

1343
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,776
So the big day's coming up.
How are you feeling?

1344
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,507
Well, you know,
I was feeling really good,

1345
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:22,676
but Zooey and I have been
fighting a lot recently.

1346
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,515
All right, let me ask you a question.
Why are you marrying her?

1347
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,385
What kind of question is that?

1348
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,448
Well, it seems to me like you've gone
from relationship to relationship,

1349
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,428
so is Zooey the one
or is she just the next one?

1350
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,020
No, she's the one.

1351
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,759
All right, well, how come?

1352
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,061
Because.

1353
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,760
I don't know. We're in love.

1354
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:45,298
And...

1355
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,373
That's a hard question to answer.

1356
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:53,040
Listen, I'm not trying to push you at all.
It's just for me,

1357
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:56,380
sometimes talking this stuff out helps
to clarify things. That's all.

1358
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,883
Let's go try on some penguin suits.

1359
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,585
Thank you, lovely. What's your name?

1360
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,286
- Raquel.
- That was my mother's name.

1361
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:10,856
So I'm thinking about asking Tevin
if he wants in on the Ferrigno house.

1362
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,902
Dude, I pissed on that guy's face
at a Bennigan's.

1363
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,436
You do not need
to be splitting commission

1364
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,029
with that frosty-haired chode.

1365
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,374
I have to face facts, Syd.
I'm a flats guy, you know?

1366
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,380
Tevin's got the flash needed
to sell the place.

1367
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,146
What do you think?

1368
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,582
You look fucking stiff.

1369
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:32,018
We're shopping for tuxedos
for your wedding, man.

1370
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,282
Let's have a good time.
Loosen it up a little bit.

1371
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:37,325
I wanna take a photo.
Now, give me an action pose.

1372
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,020
Like what? What do you mean?

1373
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:42,689
Well, you're wearing a tuxedo.
What do you think I mean?

1374
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,630
When have you ever seen
anyone in a tuxedo do that move?

1375
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,264
Besides Runaway Bride.

1376
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:50,464
The ESPYs.

1377
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,134
You're wearing a tuxedo.
Think James Bond, all right?

1378
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,233
Give me some James Bond.

1379
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:01,640
No.
It just looks like you're pointing at me.

1380
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,680
- You look ridiculous, man.
- What am I... How can I... I can't...

1381
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,317
- Think Timothy Dalton.
- T-Dalt.

1382
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,853
Hey, that's pretty good.

1383
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,530
Tell you what.
Give me your best Bond impression.

1384
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,793
Why don't you get off your board

1385
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:22,394
and get on...
"Get out of my dreams and into my car."

1386
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,229
You looking for your pot of gold?

1387
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:26,365
Why does everything I do
sound like a leprechaun?

1388
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,343
You tell me. He speaks
like the coolest man on earth.

1389
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:32,209
- The name is Bond. Oh, yeah.
- There you go.

1390
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,613
The name is James Bond.

1391
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:37,546
James Bond.

1392
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,847
I'll have a margarita.

1393
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:45,790
Well, hey there, Miss Moneypussy.
Wanna jump on my jetpack?

1394
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,525
All right, enough of that.
Let's just take the picture, all right?

1395
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,190
Arch an eyebrow for me. Other eyebrow.

1396
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,600
No, you just look confused.

1397
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:00,033
Arch your eyebrow up.
No, not both, just one.

1398
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,009
I don't know how...

1399
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:06,142
All right, maybe I was wrong.
Let's see the back.

1400
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,845
You know what?
I'm not sure I'm in love with the drape.

1401
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:12,216
What's wrong with the drape?
Does the vent move funny?

1402
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,050
You should wear something
with a little more pizzazz, right?

1403
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,590
- A little more flash.
- You don't like the split panel?

1404
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,557
- Peacock it out a bit.
- No.

1405
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,753
- Let's try...
- What are those? Checkers?

1406
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,352
- Here. Give this one a try.
- Give me a break.

1407
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,454
- No way, man.
- Come on.

1408
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,726
I can't fricking pull that off. It's blue.

1409
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,824
Look at me.

1410
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,065
You have this image of yourself
as this straight-laced, tight guy,

1411
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,438
but I've seen you cut loose
in the man cave, and it is fantastic.

1412
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,841
Well, yeah. Slap a little bass.

1413
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,004
Yeah, it's the same
with the Ferrigno house.

1414
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,516
You have all of the skills in the world,
and you have no confidence.

1415
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,551
Now, sack up, man.

1416
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,213
Put on the fucking suit.

1417
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,355
I can't believe you just touched my balls.

1418
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,855
Hey, so listen, I also wanted
to talk to you about something.

1419
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:01,926
This investment opportunity
has come up. It's a total winner.

1420
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,302
The only problem is
all my funds are tied up in equities,

1421
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,500
so I'm cash poor right now.

1422
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,706
So I was wondering if you would
consider loaning me a few shekels?

1423
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,515
How much are we talking about?

1424
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,844
You know, 8.

1425
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:27,427
$8,000. That's... That's a lot of...

1426
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:32,859
That's a lot of quiche, you know?
A lot of cake.

1427
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,130
It just... It might be a little tricky,

1428
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,536
just 'cause Zooey's dad
is out of the picture,

1429
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,734
and, you know,
we're paying for the wedding ourselves.

1430
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,071
You know what? Enough said.

1431
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,545
An opportunity came up.
I thought I would ask. No big deal.

1432
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,944
Can you tell me about the investment?

1433
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,713
I can't, actually.
It's confidential in nature, so...

1434
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,447
Okay. Let me think about it.

1435
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,115
Yeah, of course, buddy.

1436
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,282
Hello, Peter.

1437
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,820
Doug!

1438
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,155
- This is my...
- Sydney.

1439
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,963
Sydney. This is Sydney.

1440
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,568
You know, it takes a lot of nerve

1441
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,698
to spend a beautiful evening
with someone

1442
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,106
and then never call them again.

1443
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,172
Doug, I can explain.

1444
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,476
I just wish I could take back that kiss,

1445
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,016
because I felt something
that I haven't felt in years,

1446
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:25,383
and now I know
it was the taste of betrayal.

1447
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,114
It wasn't the taste of betrayal.

1448
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,713
- It was the taste of betrayal.
- No, it really wasn't.

1449
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:32,055
It was the taste of betrayal,
you fucking whore.

1450
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,190
- Doug.
- Good day.

1451
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,788
Doug, wait.

1452
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,863
- I can actually explain what just...
- I would love to hear that.

1453
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:45,002
Wow. I mean, I knew when I got
the nod for the engagement dinner

1454
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:48,509
you didn't have a ton of friends,
but I had no idea it went that far.

1455
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:52,104
Truth is, I never even thought about it
until Zooey and I got engaged.

1456
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,239
It's like,
you were basically just using me

1457
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,216
because you needed
to fill out your wedding party.

1458
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,753
Dude, no. Not it at all.

1459
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,019
I'd actually given up
on meeting someone,

1460
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,392
and then you wandered
into that open house, we hit it off,

1461
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:10,620
and three-quarters of the Rush
songbook later, here we are.

1462
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,668
- I just wish you'd have told me.
- Well, I was embarrassed.

1463
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,761
I mean, you've had a close group
of male friends your whole life. I haven't.

1464
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,500
I started feeling
like some kind of weirdo.

1465
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:24,602
I get it. But I just want you to know
that you're my friend,

1466
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,311
and you can tell me anything.

1467
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,816
Thanks, Sydney. I appreciate that.

1468
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,179
Hey, man, look, about that investment...

1469
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,383
Pete, please,
forget I even brought it up, honestly.

1470
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,857
I've been saving my whole life,

1471
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,791
and you were right.
I'm gonna sell the Ferrigno place.

1472
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,829
Fuck, yeah, you are.

1473
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,133
I'd be happy to lend you the money.
I know you're good for it.

1474
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,562
Pistol, that is great. Thank you.

1475
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,766
It's the least I could do
for the best man at my wedding.

1476
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,168
What are you talking about?

1477
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,606
I want you to stand up there with me.
Are you cool with that?

1478
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:01,979
Am I cool with that?

1479
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,645
Of course I'll be your best man!
That's an honor! It's...

1480
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,058
You're a whore, Peter.

1481
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,932
- I think we're almost there.
- I think we're almost there, too.

1482
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,696
I think it's just about putting
the random people together.

1483
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:22,828
- Yeah.
- We should talk about the main table,

1484
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:26,533
because if Hailey doesn't find a date
before the wedding,

1485
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,805
which, let's be honest,
it seems pretty likely that she won't...

1486
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,345
I know.

1487
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,176
...we have an extra seat at our table.

1488
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:36,706
Well, I was thinking that maybe
Sydney would sit at our table.

1489
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,049
I asked him to be my best man.

1490
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:43,024
Great! That's awesome.
That was the whole thing.

1491
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,889
I'm not an idiot.
You're not psyched about this at all.

1492
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:49,624
No, it's just...
I feel like he has some issue with me.

1493
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:52,394
What? No. You guys just haven't
spent any time together.

1494
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,867
- We've spent some time together.
- I'll talk to him.

1495
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:56,164
Peter, do not talk to him.

1496
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,172
He's gonna think
I'm saying stuff behind his back.

1497
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,472
- You are saying stuff behind his back.
- No. I'm just sharing a feeling with you.

1498
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,909
And I want you to.

1499
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,913
But, Peter,
please don't say anything to him.

1500
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,608
Okay, I won't.

1501
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,145
So, we still have
to pick up the marriage license.

1502
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:14,211
- Can you meet up tomorrow afternoon?
- Totally, yeah. Perfect.

1503
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,055
So, what'd she say
about me being your best man?

1504
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:19,958
She was pumped.
She thought it was awesome.

1505
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,518
Come on, dude.

1506
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:25,293
I'm the worst liar.
I promised her I wouldn't say anything.

1507
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,635
Well, what is it?

1508
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,297
She thinks you don't like her.

1509
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,933
What? That is... No, of course I like her.
Are you...

1510
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,340
We've only hung out a few times,

1511
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,573
but she's gonna be your wife.
Of course I like her.

1512
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,616
This dumb toast
is gonna haunt me forever.

1513
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,108
Oh, man!

1514
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:49,890
Dude, why is Ferrigno eating
with that urinal-cake-faced fuckhead?

1515
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,017
We gotta confront him. Hold this.

1516
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:54,221
No, wait. Sydney, wait, wait.
Wait. Sydney!

1517
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:59,791
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck is going on here?

1518
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,363
- Do I know you?
- No, you don't know me,

1519
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:04,564
but I believe you know
my friend Peter Klaven,

1520
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,869
who has an exclusive listing
on this man's property.

1521
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,069
Lou, you promised Peter
the commission to your house.

1522
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:10,702
I know, but he's not doing shit with it.

1523
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,541
That is total crap, Hulk, all right?

1524
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,844
Listen, this kind of stuff
doesn't happen overnight.

1525
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,042
Peter, who the hell is this guy?

1526
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,018
Hulk, let me tell you something
about Peter...

1527
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,249
Look, please get your hand out of
my face and stop calling me Hulk.

1528
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:22,449
I'm a person, okay?

1529
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:23,889
I'm a person, okay.

1530
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,119
- I warned you.
- You warned me?

1531
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:26,217
- Hello?
- Hey.

1532
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,625
I'm on my way to the marriage bureau.

1533
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,186
Fuck you, Lou Ferrigno!

1534
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,288
Is that Sydney?

1535
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,229
- Hey!
- Fuck you, Hulk!

1536
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,533
Oh, shit.

1537
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,534
What the... What are you doing?

1538
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,970
- What's going on?
- Sydney. He's fighting Lou Ferrigno.

1539
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,133
Peter! He's so strong!

1540
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,607
- Easy. Don't fight it.
- The Hulk has me in a sleeper hold,

1541
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:46,977
- and I don't think I can take him...
- Easy. That's it.

1542
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,242
Peter!

1543
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,178
- Wow.
- Peter!

1544
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,085
Why the fuck would anyone
get in a fight with Lou Ferrigno?

1545
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,646
Sydney's a hothead.
He thought he was standing up for me.

1546
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:57,248
To The Incredible Hulk?

1547
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:02,024
No, that's just a character he played.
In real life, Lou's actually a sweet man.

1548
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,833
So, what does that mean
for your development property?

1549
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,197
It means it's over.

1550
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,099
Without the Ferrigno commission,
I'm not gonna be able to afford it.

1551
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,333
You have some money saved up.

1552
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:16,002
Can't you just write them a check,
you know, to show your good faith?

1553
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:20,446
Between the wedding, and then,
you know, I lent Sydney some money.

1554
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,075
I mean, it's just I'm gonna be short.
That's it.

1555
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,985
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You lent Sydney money?

1556
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,685
For an investment.
All his money's tied up in equities.

1557
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,488
- He's gonna pay me back.
- Peter, that's not the point.

1558
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:36,224
We're getting married. You can't
just keep stuff like this from me.

1559
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:38,323
Can I ask you a question?

1560
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,159
Why do you think we're getting married?

1561
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,172
What are you talking about?

1562
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,299
No, it's just... Sydney asked me
that question, and I couldn't...

1563
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,708
"Well, why Zooey?"
And I didn't know how to answer it.

1564
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:54,408
- Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?
- Yes.

1565
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:56,382
Two weeks before our wedding

1566
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,079
and you don't know
why you're marrying me?

1567
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:02,146
Just forget it. It was a stupid question.
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1568
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:05,887
Just forget... Take it back 10 seconds
before I asked it,

1569
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,360
and let's live in that time.

1570
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:11,058
The thing is, Peter,
I get why you would wonder that. I do.

1571
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:15,330
But I wish you would have answered
the question before you proposed to me.

1572
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:18,065
That's the thing.
Before I didn't even think about it.

1573
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,130
That came out bad, too.
I didn't... I'm so...

1574
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,732
I'm confused.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1575
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,607
Let me just make this
a little simpler for you.

1576
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,805
I'm gonna go stay
with Denise and Barry,

1577
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,681
and you and your bud Sydney
can hang out and beat up Lou Ferrigno

1578
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,082
and go to Rush concerts

1579
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:34,679
and ride a tandem bicycle down
the Venice Boardwalk for all I care.

1580
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:37,418
- We never rode bicycles.
- Goodbye!

1581
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:41,394
Zooey, come on! This is ridiculous!
Zooey! Zooey!

1582
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:14,920
Oh, my God.

1583
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,634
My God.

1584
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:30,743
All right, he put up some billboards.
Put up some billboards.

1585
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:33,113
Oh, my God.

1586
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,244
Oh, God! No!

1587
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:44,819
Fuck me over. Fucking fucking fuck!

1588
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,024
Are you kidding me?

1589
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,560
Come on!

1590
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:00,634
Yeah, it's open.

1591
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:02,200
Hey.

1592
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,677
That's what you borrowed $8,000 for?

1593
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,611
You saw the billboards.
Pretty awesome, right?

1594
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:07,670
Pretty awesome?

1595
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:10,183
My buddy Dave sells ad space,
so he got us a great deal.

1596
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,878
Pretty awesome? They're idiotic.

1597
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:15,286
You put my face on a 10-foot dick
over Santa Monica Boulevard.

1598
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,120
Yeah. It's hilarious.

1599
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:21,060
Well, in one day you managed to screw
my career, you ruined my relationship...

1600
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,222
What are you talking about?
Ruin your relationship?

1601
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:24,322
Zooey walked out on me

1602
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,300
because I asked her
why we were getting married.

1603
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,235
Why would you ask her that?

1604
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:33,365
Pete, that conversation
was between you and me.

1605
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:37,002
You can't have that talk with her. I just...
Look, I assumed you understood that.

1606
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:40,047
God, I am so sick
of your ridiculous rules.

1607
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:42,746
I like it that I can share things
with Zooey.

1608
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,583
I like it that if I can't sleep at night,
she's there to talk to.

1609
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,752
Do you know the best night
I've had in the last five years

1610
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:51,985
is the night
that Zooey and I split a bottle of wine,

1611
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,995
we made a summer salad,
and watched Chocolat together.

1612
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,826
- You mean Chocolate?
- Chocolat.

1613
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,866
- Chocolate with Johnny Depp.
- Chocolat.

1614
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,958
You're not fucking French, Pete.
It's called Chocolate.

1615
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,060
Chocolate has got an "E" on it.

1616
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,502
- That was your favorite night?
- Yes.

1617
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:06,335
Your best night in five years is
watching Chocolate with Johnny Depp?

1618
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,432
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1619
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:10,876
The combination of wine
and summer salad and Chocolat, yeah.

1620
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,003
You should be embarrassed.

1621
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,048
You know, I think you're threatened
by what Zooey and I have

1622
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:16,174
because you're afraid
I won't be able to hang out every night.

1623
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,742
Hey, you know what?
I have a ton of friends, all right?

1624
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,879
Yeah, who are all moving on
with their lives.

1625
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:24,755
They're in relationships. They have kids.
They're growing up.

1626
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,953
Hey, let's not forget.
You were the one using me.

1627
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:29,758
- I think we were using each other.
- Whatever.

1628
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:33,731
I really don't understand
what's going on right now.

1629
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,232
I think we should spend
some time apart.

1630
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:43,937
Okay.

1631
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,079
So if I actually do
wind up having a wedding,

1632
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,676
it's probably best that you not be there.

1633
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,146
Yeah. Sounds good to me, Pete.

1634
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:56,884
And if you could have
those billboards taken down...

1635
01:24:56,958 --> 01:25:00,724
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it'll take
a few days, but I will get on that.

1636
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:04,856
And I'll also make sure you get
your money back as soon as possible.

1637
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,733
Also, I think you have
my season 2 Lost DVDs. If you...

1638
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:14,540
- lf you haven't watched them yet...
- It's fine, Pete. They're right here.

1639
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,501
- Thanks.
- Yep.

1640
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:21,740
It's just Zooey hasn't seen them all yet,

1641
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:24,910
and she's really curious as to what
was going on inside that hatch.

1642
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,112
Yep.

1643
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:32,349
- I wish you the best of luck, Peter.
- You, too, Sydney.

1644
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,492
Bye, Anwar.

1645
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:52,571
- Hey, Denise. Sorry to bother you.
- It's... I'll go get Zooey.

1646
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,706
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1647
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,854
- Hey, Barry.
- Poker night.

1648
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,823
- Full table.
- That's okay.

1649
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,326
I'm here to talk to my fiancée.

1650
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,418
Nice face.

1651
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,020
Thank you.

1652
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:13,229
- On the billboards.
- Right. Yeah.

1653
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:17,429
- Yeah, my friend Sydney, he...
- I don't give a shit.

1654
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:22,265
- Hey.
- Hi.

1655
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:26,211
- Could I talk to you outside?
- Yeah.

1656
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:31,545
- License to sell.
- Yeah.

1657
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:34,053
Look, that's what Sydney borrowed
all that money for.

1658
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:35,817
He thought it would help my career.

1659
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,154
Well, it got your name out there.

1660
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:41,423
Besides, you look pretty cute
with a thick mustache.

1661
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,395
Zooey, look,
I'm so sorry that I asked you

1662
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:47,832
why you thought we should get married.

1663
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,836
It's just that I've been talking
about this stuff with Sydney,

1664
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,929
and, you know, it made me nervous.

1665
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,464
Peter, I'm nervous, too, okay?
It's a big deal.

1666
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:58,603
I couldn't believe actually how sure
you seemed about the whole thing,

1667
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,548
which is why I freaked out when you
all of a sudden started questioning it.

1668
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,211
Well, I'm sure about us
for so many reasons.

1669
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:08,312
Truth is, I've been a girlfriend guy,
but out of all those girls,

1670
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,653
you're the only one
that wanted me to have my own life.

1671
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:14,661
You know? You want me
to have friends for me, not you.

1672
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:18,630
It's, like, one of the most romantic
things I could ever think of.

1673
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,224
What's up?

1674
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,700
Dude, come on.

1675
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:28,033
Zooey, I love you, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

1676
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:30,935
Can we get this engagement
back on track?

1677
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,036
Okay.

1678
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:34,513
- Please?
- Yes. Yes.

1679
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,313
- Come on, it's poker night.
- So?

1680
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,853
So just take her out for a cup of coffee
or something.

1681
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,115
I'm not taking her out for a cup of coffee.

1682
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,487
Why don't you take the boys
to fucking Starbucks and play poker?

1683
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,822
Because it's poker night here.
It's always poker night here.

1684
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:46,917
Yeah, that's my best friend.

1685
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:48,690
I'm not leaving her, ever.
How about that?

1686
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:51,197
She can stay here for five years
if she wants to.

1687
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,427
You're gonna dress up like
a cheerleader tonight for me, all right?

1688
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:54,934
Fine. Get the fuck out of here.

1689
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:58,769
Hey, Zooey, you can stay here as long
as you want. You are always welcome.

1690
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,274
- Thank you.
- Okay? Hey, by the way,

1691
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:04,334
Peter, they've got plenty of room open
on the poker table.

1692
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,437
They were lying.
They'd love to have you play poker.

1693
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:08,414
- I'm not going to.
- Okay.

1694
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,642
Oh, my God.
Barry and Denise fight all the time,

1695
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,619
and then they have really loud,
intense make-up sex.

1696
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:14,712
Please get me out of here, please.

1697
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,381
- Let's get your stuff. Come on.
- Okay.

1698
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,448
By the way, I ended things with Sydney.

1699
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,790
Peter, really?
I hope that's not because of me.

1700
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:25,231
No, no. He can be a great guy. It's just...
It wasn't really working out.

1701
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,262
Then you process your purchase.

1702
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:33,597
That sounds riveting.

1703
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,243
I just stepped
in your dog's crap, asshole!

1704
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:45,117
Aren't you gonna pick up
your dog's shit, shit giant?

1705
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:47,416
Pick up your shit like a man!

1706
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,319
Nice scarf, dickwad!

1707
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:53,517
- Okay, so what should be our last song?
- Into the Mystic.

1708
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:56,093
That's perfect. That is perfect.

1709
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,361
Okay. Okay, so we have to go
through the place cards one more time,

1710
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,425
'cause I'm a little bit...

1711
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:05,201
Why don't you just call him?

1712
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,132
Because guys don't do that.

1713
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:15,944
E, Ethan. What's up, my man?
E. Bone Capone.

1714
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,811
I'm just hanging out, man.

1715
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,285
I wanted to see if you wanted to come
over and watch TV or something.

1716
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:23,118
Again you're gonna watch
the Wonder Emporium?

1717
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:27,256
Dude, what the fuck is there
to do at LEGOLAND

1718
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:29,159
that you take these kids there
every weekend?

1719
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:34,465
I understand that
that's not the point of teaching,

1720
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:35,968
but just give them all B pluses.

1721
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,962
Can I... Could I come with you?

1722
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:43,506
What do you mean,
the kids think I'm creepy?

1723
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:47,205
- Good to see you, Peter.
- You, too, Mel.

1724
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:51,684
You know, I haven't had a real friend
since my wife passed.

1725
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,418
I'm really glad you called.

1726
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,254
Hey, do you have any plans
on June 30th?

1727
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:04,589
I'm 89 years old. What the fuck
kind of plans would I have?

1728
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:11,429
Just needed an adjustment.
I hope it'll be better now.

1729
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:16,170
My mother knew Roux's return
had nothing to do with the silly old door.

1730
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:20,908
So did I.

1731
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:22,839
Stupid.

1732
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,350
My favorite, hot chocolate.

1733
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,344
Davis Dunn, how may I direct your call?

1734
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,446
- Hey, Leanne.
- Peter. Where have you been?

1735
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,821
Well, it's my wedding this weekend,

1736
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:34,350
so I've been helping my fiancée
with all the last-minute preparations.

1737
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,021
They broke the mold
when they made you.

1738
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,086
Yeah.

1739
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:39,326
Go check your voice mail.
You got like a million messages.

1740
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,232
Yeah, is this Pistol Pete?

1741
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,434
I have a home in Los Feliz,
and I've been trying to sell it,

1742
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:51,603
and I saw your billboards.
I'm very impressed with your ads.

1743
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,772
License to sell? That's hysterical!
It's like James Bond.

1744
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:57,010
Hi, I'm interested
in buying the Ferrigno estate.

1745
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:58,449
- lf you could give me a call.
- Oh, my God.

1746
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:02,114
I love the one with you in the bed.
My number is 310...

1747
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:04,286
- My husband and I saw your ad...
- Stop. Slow down.

1748
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:06,956
Hello, Peter. It's Doug.

1749
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:10,261
Saw the billboards. They are wonderful.

1750
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:15,030
Wouldn't expect anything less from you.
And sorry about calling you a whore.

1751
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:17,869
And hello to Sydney
if you guys are still together.

1752
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,907
Otherwise, you can Facebook me.

1753
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,641
Peter, hi. It's Lou Ferrigno.
Wonderful billboards.

1754
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,879
Listen, I'm sorry
if I ever doubted you, man.

1755
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:27,842
I told that douchebag Tevin

1756
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:30,213
that I want you to have
the exclusive back on my house.

1757
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:31,410
- Excuse me, Mr. Ferrigno?
- Yeah.

1758
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,454
- Ten-minute warning.
- Okay. Thank you.

1759
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,853
So just call me or just text me.

1760
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,887
Goodbye, my friend.

1761
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,359
There's my dog!

1762
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:48,095
Hey, me rikey the billboards.

1763
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,637
I completely underestimated you,
my brother.

1764
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:53,299
What say we go down to Houston's,
get a burger and a beer

1765
01:31:53,374 --> 01:31:56,810
and talk about how we can tag-team
the Ferrigno deal?

1766
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,917
Why are you slapping me?

1767
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:07,147
Because I wanted
to cause you some physical pain,

1768
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:10,588
but I have never actually hit anybody
in the face. It freaks me out.

1769
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,126
And I didn't really know what to do.

1770
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,129
Tevin, stay the fuck away
from my listing.

1771
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,097
- Hey, Carolyn.
- Hey, Pete.

1772
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,677
Good luck, Peter.

1773
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:43,587
I'm so excited to see who Peter chose
for his wedding party.

1774
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,148
Yeah. Yeah.

1775
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:06,470
Honestly, that has to be
the most random

1776
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,913
collection of groomsmen
in the history of weddings.

1777
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,244
- I'm great. You know, I just got to...
- Okay.

1778
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:12,616
I'll see you at the wedding.

1779
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:14,712
I'm gonna get another mimosa.

1780
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,155
Do you want to finish the one...

1781
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:39,774
Hello?

1782
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:43,607
Hey. Wow,
I didn't expect to hear from you.

1783
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:47,520
No, I wouldn't want to impose.

1784
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,023
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe if I hurry, I can make the end of it.

1785
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:54,289
Okay, I gotta go.
I gotta find something to wear.

1786
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:08,133
Which one of these men has the ring?

1787
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:12,742
I actually don't have a best man, so...

1788
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:18,148
Robbie, I want you
to hold the ring for me.

1789
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:21,120
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1790
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:27,017
- Okay.
- Unless you don't want to. I mean...

1791
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:30,457
Thanks, Peter.

1792
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,499
So sweet.

1793
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:37,367
Hey, I want you boys to know,
you're both my best friends

1794
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:41,941
and Hank Mardukas.

1795
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:44,534
Hey, Hank.

1796
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:23,911
Awesome tux.

1797
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:27,079
- Thanks. It's blue.
- Yes, it is.

1798
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,418
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1799
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:34,188
Good afternoon.
We are gathered here today

1800
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:37,890
to join Peter Klaven and Zooey Rice
in matrimony.

1801
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:42,329
If anyone can show just cause
why they may not marry...

1802
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:44,463
You son of a bitch!

1803
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,268
No, no, Mr. Ferrigno,
I don't wanna object.

1804
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:50,333
I just wanted to make it in time
for the vows. That's all.

1805
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,140
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1806
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,079
Sydney, come up.

1807
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,877
No, I'm fine back here.

1808
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:58,441
- Please, yes. Yes.
- Are you sure?

1809
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:01,320
I hope you don't mind.

1810
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:03,083
You invited him?

1811
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:12,589
Well, I saw you walking
on the lawn looking all sad,

1812
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:16,898
and I realized I couldn't let you
get married without your best man.

1813
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:23,042
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

1814
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,268
Zooey, thanks so much for inviting me.

1815
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:28,247
Of course. You got here really fast.

1816
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:30,078
Yeah. You know what,
I was on the Vesp,

1817
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:33,382
so I just did the old weaveroo.

1818
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:36,956
Dude, you're lying.
Your voice went up when you said that.

1819
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:38,855
His voice got high.

1820
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:42,191
Look, I was on my way
when Zooey called.

1821
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:45,926
Invite or not, there was no way
I was gonna miss your wedding,

1822
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,332
and I wanted to give you this.

1823
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:53,206
Man, you don't have to do this.

1824
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:54,400
You know what?
I know you don't believe me,

1825
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,137
but I'm actually
a pretty successful investor, so...

1826
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:59,406
Look, the billboards
were my wedding gift to you guys.

1827
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:00,639
Man, they worked.

1828
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:03,547
Yeah, I figured when I saw the Ferrigs
that they must have worked.

1829
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:05,380
- That's great.
- Lou's the best.

1830
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:06,942
I can only imagine.

1831
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:13,317
I put him in a sleeper hold. Out.

1832
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,618
Sydney, I'm really sorry
for all the stuff that I said.

1833
01:37:15,696 --> 01:37:19,655
Pete, you called me
on a lot of my issues. I appreciate it.

1834
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:23,165
And for the record, I saw Chocolat.

1835
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:25,801
Just delightful.

1836
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:27,362
It is, right?

1837
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,065
- I love Chocolat.
- I love that movie.

1838
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:31,972
- Chocolat? What the fuck is that?
- I have no idea.

1839
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,673
It's a beautiful movie.

1840
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:37,050
I'm really glad you're here, Sydney.

1841
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:39,314
Me, too.

1842
01:37:39,386 --> 01:37:42,651
I can't even imagine getting married
without you.

1843
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:47,988
I love you, man.

1844
01:37:48,662 --> 01:37:50,493
I love you, too, bud.

1845
01:37:54,668 --> 01:37:57,068
- I love you, dude.
- I love you, Bro Montana.

1846
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:59,799
- I love you, holmes.
- I love you, Broseph Goebbels.

1847
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,365
- Love you, muchacha.
- I love you, Tycho Brohe.

1848
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:06,311
Okay. Okay. Right. Let's continue here.

1849
01:38:06,814 --> 01:38:08,975
- I so wanna marry you.
- You will.

1850
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,243
I'm going to.

1851
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:11,682
Zooey, repeat after me.

1852
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:14,186
- I, Zooey Rice.
- I, Zooey Rice.

1853
01:38:14,255 --> 01:38:17,247
- Take you, Peter Klaven.
- Take you, Peter Klaven.

1854
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:21,260
- To be my lawfully wedded husband.
- To be my lawfully wedded husband.

1855
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:10,099
I'm really sorry
about that dumb toast I gave.

1856
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:12,764
It was out of line. I got really nervous
to meet you and I'm...

1857
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,740
I don't know what happened to me.
I'm sorry.

1858
01:40:14,808 --> 01:40:18,175
Sydney, it's fine. Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

1859
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:21,772
For the record, I like giving blowjobs.

1860
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,875
Well, that's good to hear. You know,
I was just looking out for my buddy.

1861
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:25,976
I hear you.

1862
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:28,453
I had to make sure that
he's getting blowies on a regular basis.

1863
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:30,922
Yeah, I'm not really comfortable
with this conversation.

1864
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:32,822
- Honey.
- We're all friends now.

1865
01:40:32,893 --> 01:40:34,724
- Friends do this.
- No, they don't.

1866
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:42,834
- Wow, you have a nice singing voice.
- Thanks.

1867
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:45,133
- Are you in a band?
- Not yet.

1868
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:46,399
- Hailey.
- Lonnie.

1869
01:40:46,473 --> 01:40:47,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

1870
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:54,610
That's awesome! That's awesome!

1871
01:40:54,848 --> 01:40:56,543
Excuse me, Peter.

1872
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:02,548
Get my wife on up here!

1873
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:07,360
You've been Rushified!

1874
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:13,566
- You should be...
- You've never called me an asshole?

1875
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:15,261
No, I've said you act like an asshole.

1876
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:17,303
So, you get away with it
because it was the act of.

1877
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:18,497
- That's your behavior.
- Right.

1878
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,540
I'm not saying you're an asshole.

1879
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:21,631
Oh, my God.

1880
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,835
Shit. What?
Do I have a fucking sign on me?

1881
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,471
- No, it's not my fault.
- How is it not your fault?

1882
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:28,412
Because I'm pregnant.

1883
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,750
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1884
01:41:33,687 --> 01:41:36,451
- Are you still mad?
- Try to make it a boy.

1885
01:41:56,243 --> 01:41:58,575
Thank you.
I'd just like to make a quick toast.

1886
01:41:58,645 --> 01:41:59,703
No!
