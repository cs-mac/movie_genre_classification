My name is Joe Mande.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,933
I'm a comedian, and in two weeks,

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,602
I am shooting my first
one-hour comedy special.

[chuckles] That's funny.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,116
It's my life. I eat, breathe,
shit and fuck comedy.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,369
That's why this special
is such a big deal for me.

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,539
I have to get it just right, and I think
if I can live up to my potential...

14
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,041
I can win the American Humour Award.

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,128
It's the most prestigious award in comedy.

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,464
All the legends of this industry
have won it:

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,301
Whoopi Goldberg, Seinfeld, Todd Barry.

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,886
The list goes on on and on.

19
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,557
And as you can see, I made some room
right here on my bookshelf

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,642
for the American Humour Award trophy.

21
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,479
Kind of lonely there right now,
but it'll look good.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,023
Well, thanks for meeting me, guys.

23
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,860
I thought, since we're friends and you
both have won the American Humour Award,

24
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,114
I thought I could get
a little quick advice from you.

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,450
You think you can win an American
Humour Award in your first special?

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,412
- Um, yeah.
- He has the personality, first of all.

27
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,181
When he walks out,
everybody's gonna like him.

28
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,433
The judges are gonna like him.
You're aware there are judges?

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,627
But the judges...
It's not just about him and the material.

30
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,422
It's the set design, it's his wardrobe.

31
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,359
The intro is huge for the judges.
You know the judges are gonna be there?

32
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,345
I just need to know what I need to do
to win. What's the process?

33
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,681
This is what the judges want
out of an intro. For real.

34
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,433
Smart, smart. Yeah.

- Correct.

You and the city and the people
and the traffic and the...

- Yeah.
- All that shit, like hot dog carts.

- Yeah. Taxis.
- Horses.

So really just emphasize
that I'm in New York.

- I am Jewish, yeah.

- Shit.
- All right.

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,952
- You need ten applause breaks.
- At least ten.

44
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,413
- And you cannot space them too close.
- Ten applau...

- Right.
- Oh, my God.

46

- And the most important thing.
- The director.

I was thinking about getting my buddy Dan.

- Who the fuck is Dan?
- Your buddy Dan?

52
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,555
He did a pilot last year.
I heard it was good.

- [Wallace] That's mean.

56

You're gonna need to get
a director that has a name.

57
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,148
Okay, I need a famous director.

58
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,025
- Yeah.
- 1964. I won.

59
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,819
That's the first time I won.
I had a very famous director.

60
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,715
Joel Schumacher.
You might have heard of him.

61
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,419
'Cause I had done <i>Batman Forever</i> with him.

62
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,661
- 1984, Kevin Costner directed it.
- Damn.

And 2004... McG?

- Of course.
- McG, yeah.

- McG directed your special?
- [Burnham] Legendary. Yeah.

Tell you what, working with McG, man,

he lets you do what you wanna do,
has fun, and he just loves to laugh.

68

- Can I get McG, you think?
- You got all you need. You don't need us.

I've asked Ang Lee, Michael Bay.

How do you even, like,
get in contact with those people?

00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,383
So everyone thinks I'm a little Armenian,
which was...

152
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,218
I don't know, that's fine.

153
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,891
One of my best friend in Los Angeles
is a black woman.

154
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,809
[chuckles] Not to brag.

155
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,895
[audience laughing]

156
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,233
We've been coworkers for years,
and she just told me recently

157
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,570
that for the first six months
we worked together,

158
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,156
she thought I was black. [chuckles]

159
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,200
Do you understand?

160
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,994
A black woman was like,

161
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,413
"Yeah, I thought you were
a light-skinned black guy."

162
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,917
And I looked at her, I was like,
"Aisha, for real...

163
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,463
that's the nicest thing anyone
has ever said to me."

164
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,509
I'm a 33-year-old Jewish man.

165
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,970
That's all I've ever wanted in my life

166
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,889
was a candid moment with a black person
where they're confused like,

167
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,225
"What? You're not...
I thought you were black."

168
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,520
Like, confetti cannons went off behind me.

169
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,398
Camp Lo "Luchini" started playing.
[chuckles]

170
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,359
It's a black song.

171
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,866
I got married about a year and a half ago
to a human woman.

172
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,578
Thank you. Did it. Did it.

173
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,539
Um...

174
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,712
The thing is, before we got married,
my wife and I, we dated...

175
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,506
"dated" for over ten years.

176
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,550
Oh, my God. Yeah, I know.

177
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,261
It's too long. I was told that's too long.

178
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,550
I don't know what my deal was.
I was dragging my feet.

179
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,352
I don't really have an excuse other than
I tend to overintellectualize things,

180
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,355
and whenever she brought up marriage
in conversation,

181
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,941
I would sort of be like,
"Well, why does the government

182
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,402
have any say if we love each other?"

183
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,987
I was, like, that asshole.

184
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,615
But then I woke up one morning
couple years ago,

185
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,826
I looked at her, I was like,
"I love this person.

186
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,870
I want to spend
the rest of my life with her,

187
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,124
and I don't want to risk losing her
and go back to wearing a condom."

188
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,084
[audience laughing]

189
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,045
No. Absolutely no.

190
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,842
So that was my proposal. [chuckles]

191
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,719
She said yes.

192
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,223
One of our favorite things to do
when we first started dating years ago

193
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,310
was that we would go home
and watch dating shows.

194
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,520
It was, like, our thing, and, uh,

195
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,416
I think my favorite TV show of all time,
I don't know if anyone remembers it,

196
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,068
was a dating show on MTV called <i>Next</i>.

197
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,819
- [cheering]
- Yeah.

198
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,529
Some <i>Next</i>-heads in the crowd.

199
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,448
[laughing]

200
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,784
Not only, to me, is that
the best TV show of all time,

201
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,369
I think, for real,
it was the peak of humanity.

202
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,248
Like, you can't tell me that things have
gotten better since <i>Next</i> was canceled.

203
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,334
It's all gone, like,
straight to the toilet.

204
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,669
<i>Next</i> was the best. If you're not famil...

205
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,257
<i>Next</i> was a dating show
on Music Television...

206
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,468
and the way it worked was

207
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,637
MTV would find, like,
a young 19-year-old girl.

208
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,555
She'd be like, "Hi, my name is Crystal.

209
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,974
I'm 19 years old,
and I'm looking for a husband."

210
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,272
And MTV would be like,
"Crystal, great news.

211
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,359
We found three guys.
They're perfect husband material.

212
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,361
They're all deejays from San Diego."

213
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,696
[audience laughing]

214
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,698
"And they've all been pounding
flavored vodka

215
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,409
in the back of this party bus
all afternoon."

216
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,162
And the party bus would pull up,

217
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,474
and the first deejay
would come down the stairs and be like,

218
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,750
"What up? I wear flip-flops." [laughs]

219
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,548
And then Crystal and Deejay Flip-Flops,

220
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,675
uh, they would go on a date, right?

221
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,303
And a date on <i>Next</i>, it'd be, like, 3 p.m.,

222
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,055
Van Nuys, California.

223
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,725
These two idiots
would walk into a candy store.

224
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,770
Right? And make, like,
anal beads out of Skittles.

225
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,063
[audience laughing]

226
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,648
You know, like a date.

227
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,279
What usually happened is that Crystal
and Deejay Flip-Flops,

228
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,197
there's no connection,
she doesn't like him,

229
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,491
he's using too many yellow Skittles.

230
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,831
And at any point, she could stand up,
get right into his face and go, "Next!"

231
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,335
It's fucking humiliating, right?

232
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,296
This poor guy would have to get up,

233
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,592
like, stoically walk back on the party bus
and be like, "I got ‘nexted.'"

234
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,095
Then the second deejay would jump up,
go down the stairs and be like,

235
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
"What up? I wear cargo shorts."

236
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,812
And then Crystal and Deejay Cargo Shorts
would go on an entirely different date.

237
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,983
It'd be, like, 4:30 p.m.,
Van Nuys, California.

238
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,403
They'd go across the street
to, like, a day spa

239
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,530
and, like, wax each other's pubic hair.

240
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,532
A date.

241
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,827
What made the show amazing though

242
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,582
was sometimes Crystal
would catch feelings for the deejay,

243
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,168
and instead of yelling "Next"
into his face,

244
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,646
she would go like this, she'd be like,
"Um, Deejay Cargo Shorts,

245
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
I just feel like we have
a really strong connection.

246
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,927
So I'm gonna stop this date,
and you have a decision to make.

247
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,678
You can either leave right now

248
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,098
with one dollar
for every minute we've been together...

249
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,686
So you can leave with, literally, $37."

250
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,772
[laughing]

251
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,737
"Or you can come home with me
and go on a second date."

252
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,490
That's when shit got good,

253
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,825
'cause suddenly the perspective
of the whole show

254
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,079
flips to Deejay Cargo Shorts's
perspective and his conundrum,

255
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,748
like, "Shit, do I take $37...

256
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,043
or try to get my dick wet?"

257
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,631
Best show of all time. No question.

258
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,887
Like I said, I was dating my wife...
my now wife...

259
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,598
I was dating her for over ten years.

260
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,369
She didn't know this,
but the whole time we were dating,

261
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:53,606
I was pretending in my head we were on
just an endless episode of <i>Next</i>, right?

262
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,317
And at any point,
we were gonna be on a date,

263
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,569
like somewhere fancy like Chipotle, right?

264
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,448
And I'd just be like, "Kylie, look.
I love the way you're eating...

265
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,911
that burrito bowl,
so I'm gonna stop this date right now.

266
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,496
You have a decision to make.

267
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,374
You can either leave right now

268
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,168
with one dollar for every minute
we've been together...

269
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:19,048
which at this point is, literally,
five and a half million dollars."

270
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,134
[audience laughing]

271
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,224
"Or you can come home with me,
watch me have nightly panic attacks."

272
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,310
[audience laughing]

273
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,189
Tough choice.

274
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,652
My wife's cool. She, uh...

275
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,781
We live in LA, but she comes here
to New York a lot for work,

276
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,825
and, uh, couple years ago,

277
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:50,788
she was here in New York working,
and I was in Los Angeles waking up.

278
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,210
I was home alone, I get out of bed,
I look down,

279
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,590
and I had the most powerful
morning wood I've ever had in my life.

280
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,342
It was crazy. You should have seen it.
Out loud... I looked down...

281
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,428
I was like, out loud, "What?

282
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,847
Like, that's as good as it gets.

283
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,016
That's my Helen Hunt."

284
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,146
And so... I've never done this,

285
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,982
but I ran over, I grabbed my phone,
I took a picture of it.

286
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,859
I took a few pictures of it.

287
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,779
Never done that. Never sent a dick pic.

288
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,281
Never...
You know, I don't know the etiquette.

289
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,075
And it's crazy in retrospect.

290
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,745
What I did is I closed my camera
and then called my wife at work.

291
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,873
It was, like, 1 p.m. New York time.

292
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,001
She's in her office, her phone rings,
she picks it up, she's like, "Hello?"

293
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,420
And I'm in LA like, "What's up?

294
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:44,092
Uh, hey, so, big news. Uh...

295
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,805
Look, I'm gonna send you
a picture of my dick... my hard dick."

296
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,976
And there was this long pause,
and she was like...

297
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,271
"Don't."

298
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,357
[audience laughs]

299
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,112
And I was like, "Right.

300
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,656
Right."

301
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,164
So that... That's just a little peek
into our relationship.

302
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,708
Married life.

303
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,256
I was at a party not too long ago
in Los Angeles,

304
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,092
and, uh, this guy walked into the party

305
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,094
who was a classmate of mine
from high school.

306
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,471
I hadn't seen him in, like, ten years,
so I got up.

307
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,449
We started talking about high school,
reconnecting,

308
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,892
talking about, like, teachers
and girls and stuff.

309
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,521
And then out of nowhere,
he switched the "convo" to dogs.

310
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,364
He started talking about
this dog he rescued,

311
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,608
and I was fucking on board, right?

312
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,026
'Cause I love dogs.

313
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,654
I got a little overexcited,
'cause I was like,

314
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,377
"Dude, what? I love dogs. I've got a dog.

315
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,533
I got a big white dog.
A beautiful big white dog."

316
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,085
He was like, "That's dope.
Can I see a photo?"

317
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,956
And I was like, "Uh, yeah." No duh, right?

318
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,292
So I pulled my phone out of my pocket.

319
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,169
- [audience groans]
- Yep. And...

320
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,254
[audience laughing]

321
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,673
I swipe it open.

322
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,426
And, as most of you have already surmised,

323
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,846
the last photo I had taken
was of my hard dick.

324
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,348
It was the same day. My Helen Hunt, right?

325
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,394
This really happened.
It was a fucking living nightmare.

326
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,706
That was verbatim too.
He's like, "Can I see your big white dog?"

327
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,690
I was like, "Uh, yeah, bruh."

328
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,567
And then I show him my dick.

329
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,987
Then I completely panicked

330
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,448
and started tapping on the screen
to make it go away...

331
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,619
forgetting that just makes things bigger,
like more detailed.

332
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,790
So then I jam the phone back in my pocket,
I look at him,

333
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,044
and my impulse in the moment,
I was about to yell, at a party,

334
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,756
I was about to yell, "No! That's my dick!"

335
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,011
Right?
'Cause all I cared about in that moment

336
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,599
was that I didn't want him to think I had
some other dude's hard dick on my phone.

337
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,268
Like when I opened it,
it was my wallpaper.

338
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,482
But then that seemed, like, unnecessary.

339
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,192
So I was just standing there stammering.

340
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,571
And then I could see from his eyes
that he could tell I was spiraling, right?

341
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,449
And it just shows you
how cool this dude is.

342
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,743
He completely took control
of the situation,

343
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,121
calmly put his hand on my shoulder,
and he was like...

344
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,040
"Cool dick, bro."

345
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,840
I was like, "Well, thank you." You know?

346
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,553
That's all I'm looking for, really,
is some validation for my cool dick.

347
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,516
Do you guys watch <i>Shark Tank</i>?

348
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,810
- Whoo!
- That's my crowd.

349
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>Shark Tank's</i> the best show since <i>Next</i>.

350
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,692
I'm obsessed with <i>Shark</i>...
I watch so much <i>Shark Tank</i>

351
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,777
that I don't really think of myself
as a comedian,

352
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,030
'cause in my heart I know
I'm an undiscovered entrepreneur.

353
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,115
You know?

354
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,994
This is real. I came home from that party
where I showed that guy my dick.

355
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079
Not a joke.
I came up with a business idea.

356
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,041
I was just like, "That was so shitty,
but I can't be the only person.

357
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,627
This must be universal.
How do I monetize this?"

358
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,317
My dream is to go on <i>Shark Tank</i>.
This is a real business idea.

359
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,926
I'm looking for investors.

360
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,346
I want to come out,
"Hello, Sharks, my name is Joe Mande.

361
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,891
I have a very exciting idea
for a website and mobile app.

362
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,101
It's gonna change the world.

363
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,270
Basically, the way it works is, uh,

364
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,148
every adult in the United States,
anyone over 18 years old,

365
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,733
will have to legally...

366
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,861
be forced to put a picture
of their dick or tits

367
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,446
uh, onto my website."

368
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,327
I mean, that's basically it.
That's the elevator pitch.

369
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,204
I don't have all night
to, like, tell you the details, but...

370
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,809
I'm also not getting the response
I'm looking for, so I'm gonna keep going.

371
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,294
I will convince you
this is a good idea, um...

372
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,714
Essentially, I mean, we're gonna have to
get the government involved

373
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,882
in some respect.

374
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,884
I imagine it would be like going
to the DMV.

375
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,636
You go in, take your clothes off.

376
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,139
It's a full frontal naked photo
of your body,

377
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,391
and that's put onto my website, right?

378
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,852
What's important to know
is no one can see this photo.

379
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,064
It's password-protected,
it's encrypted, it's un-hackable.

380
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,316
No one can see the photo
of your naked body,

381
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,234
um, unless they pay 99 cents.

382
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,490
Right? Someone pays 99 cents,
types in your name.

383
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,034
They can look at your naked body
for, like, 20 minutes.

384
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,834
All right, I'm still...
Like I feel some tension. I...

385
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,128
Here's the thing.

386
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,839
It's not pornography. Okay? I get so...

387
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,051
Every time I try to describe
or explain this idea to my friends,

388
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,011
they're like,
"You're describing pornography."

389
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,931
And I go, "No, I'm not.
It's not pornography if everyone's on it.

390
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,808
This is a paradigm shift.
I'm a visionary."

391
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,892
Okay?

392
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,812
It's not pornography. It's a new world.

393
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,401
You just need an example. Okay.
I will win you over, I swear to God.

394
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,044
- Like, sir, what's your name?
- Alexis.

395
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,862
Alexis. What's your last name?

396
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,823
- Strong.
- Strong?

397
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,408
That is cool. Okay.

398
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,201
[audience laughing]

399
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,413
Great name for this product.
Okay, so Alexis Strong.

400
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,083
So let's say this website already exists,
right?

401
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,962
Everyone could go home after the show,
type in "Alexis Strong,"

402
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
pay 99 cents...

403
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,383
look at your dick for 20 minutes...

404
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,054
[Mande] I mean, I haven't even gotten
to the exciting part yet,

405
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,056
but, like, goddamn, that's cool.

406
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,349
All right.

407
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,851
But, Alexis, say someone does that.

408
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,061
Someone pays 99 cents
to look at your dick.

409
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,439
Get this.

410
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,650
You get that money!

411
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,069
[mimics confetti cannons firing]

412
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,489
- [woman] Whoo!
- Yeah, that's right.

413
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,074
[applause]

414
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,078
Don't even patronize me.
Fucking think about that for a minute.

415
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,706
Think about a world where this exists.

416
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,792
It would change everything.
It would revitalize the economy.

417
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,462
It would end obesity as we know it.
[chuckles]

418
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,217
And I'm not being facetious
when I say this:

419
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,595
It's great for women. Great for women.

420
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,888
It's a feminist idea.

421
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,016
- Whoo!
- Every woman in the United States

422
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,185
would make at least $20 a day.

423
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,353
And that's basement.
It shoots up from there.

424
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,898
But every woman in the United States

425
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,066
has at least 20 creeps in her life
that are like...

426
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,194
"It's only 99 cents."

427
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,157
And it's not weird. It's not porn.

428
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,702
It's great for women.

429
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,706
It would equalize dating for women too.
I think that's important.

430
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,626
Because I couldn't imagine
being a woman...

431
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,964
I can't imagine, like,
you meet a nice guy,

432
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,425
you go on a few dates with him,
he seems cool,

433
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,344
and you're finally comfortable,
be intimate.

434
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,638
Meanwhile, you have no idea
what his dick looks like?

435
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,182
What? How is that fair?
That's what the app is for.

436
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,577
You meet a guy. You're like,
"What's your name? What's your last name?

437
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,102
How do you spell that?"

438
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,815
You go to the bathroom,
type his name, pay 99 cents.

439
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,984
You're like, "Yeah.
I could suck that dick." Or whatever.

440
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,654
It's like you know
if he has a cool dick or not.

441
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,241
I think that's awesome.

442
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,535
It's great for women, great for gay dudes.

443
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,829
Uh, it's great for guys with big dicks.

444
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,832
Everything's great for us. [chuckles]

445
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,084
- For us. Uh...
- [laughing]

446
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,002
Yeah, that's convincing. "For us."

447
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,966
It's great for guys with tiny dicks.

448
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,302
I'll explain.

449
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,763
Uh, imagine you're at work, right?

450
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,449
Someone comes in your office,
and they're like,

451
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,308
"Did you hear about Gary in Accounting?"

452
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,060
You're like, "No, what happened to Gary?"

453
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,021
Coworker's like,
"Uh, Gary has a micro-penis."

454
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,150
You'd be like, "Shut the fuck up!
Get in here!" Right?

455
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,861
He walks in.
Twelve more coworkers come in.

456
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,114
You close the door to your office,
you lock it.

457
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,033
Everyone crowds around your computer.
You type in Gary's name.

458
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,743
You pay 99 cents.

459
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,580
Gary's micro-penis pops up on the screen.

460
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,164
Everyone's cracking up.

461
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,210
Gary gets that money.

462
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,797
See? Yeah, fuck it.

463
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,758
Think about Gary for a minute,
how much better his life is.

464
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,931
So it's called "Dickstarter." That's the...

465
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,267
Dickstarter.biz.

466
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,064
It's my dream to go on <i>Shark Tank</i>,
prime-time TV, pitch that.

467
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,482
All the Sharks are horrified.

468
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,568
They're like,
"I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out."

469
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,157
That's stupid though.
I do have a real business idea.

470
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,619
This one's for real.
I'm looking for investors.

471
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,997
So I come out, be like,
"Hello, Sharks, my name's Joe Mande.

472
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,791
I have a product
that I know will change the world.

473
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,586
Before I even get into it, uh,
let me ask you, Sharks,

474
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,256
what's the best feeling in the world?

475
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,217
Coming. Right, it is coming.

476
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,969
And, uh, yeah.

477
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,888
What's the best form of coming?

478
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,933
It has to be autoerotic asphyxiation,
right?

479
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,144
It has to be.
Scientifically, it has to be.

480
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,855
Why else would you put
your life at risk to feel that rush

481
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,940
if it wasn't the best kind of rush?

482
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,735
I wouldn't know for sure.
I've never done it.

483
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,988
I'm way too big of a pussy
to ever autoerotic asphyxiate myself.

484
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,614
Until today."

485
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,370
And I take off my belt and go,
"Sharks, I present the Air Belt.

486
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:19,375
It's a great... It's gonna change life...
Everyone's gonna feel that rush.

487
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,461
The way it works, it's like
any other belt, keeps your pants up.

488
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,798
But when you feel the urge, man or woman,

489
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,550
to jack off to the ultimate extreme,
right?

490
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,012
You put the belt around your neck,
get it as tight as you can

491
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,556
so now no oxygen flow can hit your brain.

492
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,643
And then you just jack off
as fast as you can.

493
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,978
It's a pretty simple two-step process."

494
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,357
I'm the only one onstage,
so I have to do it.

495
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,110
I put the belt around my neck,
I'm, like, jacking off.

496
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,071
Looking right at Mark Cuban,
like, "Uh!" [chuckles]

497
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,031
"Lori, lick your lips."

498
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,455
What makes this belt special
is right here on the belt

499
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,082
there is a heart monitor.

500
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,710
Right?

501
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,296
When the belt senses that your heart rate
is down to a dangerously low level,

502
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,173
it automatically loosens up

503
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,635
so you don't fucking die
with a belt around your neck jacking off.

504
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,429
The worst way to die.

505
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,825
And I'm like handing out the belts
to the Sharks.

506
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,809
They're all just like,
"Oh, yeah, it works."

507
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,189
And I'm like, "So which one of you Sharks
wants to join the Air Belt movement

508
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,399
and come alive?"

509
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,818
[audience laughing]

510
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,779
- Banner falls down. "Come alive."
- [applause]

511
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,491
That's pretty good.

512
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,206
My parents saw me do stand-up recently.
[laughs]

513
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,084
They were not into it.
Not their cup of tea.

514
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,882
My dad's job when I was growing up,
he was a juvenile prosecutor.

515
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,511
I don't know if you know what that means.
He put kids in jail.

516
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,266
That's what my dad did when I was a kid.

517
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,644
Needless to say,
it wasn't, like, the chillest vibe

518
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,104
in the Mande household...

519
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,773
growing up.

520
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,735
My dad retired recently.
That's very weird.

521
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,071
He's become a totally different person.
He's, like, really softened.

522
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,991
He's become very sentimental.
He's, like, a total pussy and...

523
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,577
I don't know how to handle
that energy at all.

524
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,871
I was home for Thanksgiving
a couple years ago,

525
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,664
and we were watching football on TV.

526
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,500
It's just me and him in the living room.

527
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,795
When the game ended, he turned the TV off
and he looked at me, he went,

528
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,590
"Uh, Joseph, have I ever told you
about my happiest memory?"

529
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,512
I was like, "Uh, no.

530
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,680
No."

531
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,810
He goes, "I want to share this with you.
I don't know if you remember this.

532
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,937
When you were nine years old, Joseph,

533
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,856
your mother and I, we bought you
a Sega Genesis for Hanukkah.

534
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,149
Do you remember that?

535
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,570
And you wanted that Sega so badly,
you kept asking for it for months.

536
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,906
And we told you
you were never getting a Sega.

537
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,092
That first night of Hanukkah,
you opened up that gift,

538
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,118
and I've never seen anything like it.

539
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,288
You started jumping up and down
and screaming.

540
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,957
You kissed me on the cheek.

541
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,545
And to know that I could bring
another person that kind of joy"...

542
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,963
He was getting all emotional.

543
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,965
"If I could freeze my life at any moment,

544
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,300
it would be right there
when you opened that Sega."

545
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,681
And I was sitting there like,
"Damn, Dad, thank you.

546
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,058
Thank you so much for sharing that.
That was beautiful."

547
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,854
But in my head, I was like,
"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"

548
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,691
So, little backstory. Uh...

549
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,144
Here's what you need to know.

550
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,445
When I was nine years old,
I was a little piece of shit,

551
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,906
and I knew where my parents hid presents,
right?

552
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,242
And so one day,
my parents went to the grocery store.

553
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,035
I saw them pull out of the driveway.

554
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,705
And I locked the door,
I ran into my dad's closet...

555
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,165
looked under this big pile of sweaters.

556
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,919
There was a giant,
wrapped rectangular present.

557
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,631
And like a little spy, I got down and
carefully opened up the Scotch tape

558
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,050
and revealed the words "Sega Genesis."

559
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,220
And, obviously, out loud I was like,
"Fucking finally!"

560
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,055
[scoffs] "Goddamn it."

561
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,227
So I got back down and I started
to close the present back up,

562
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,897
and as I did,
I tore the corner of the wrapping paper.

563
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,524
It wasn't severe, but, you know,

564
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,711
maybe if you imagine
that your dad worked closely with,

565
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,778
I don't know, like, forensic scientists,

566
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,948
it was, like, super noticeable,
and for the next six weeks,

567
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,951
I can't even convey to you
the sheer terror I lived under

568
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,038
that at any point,
my dad was gonna get chilly,

569
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,458
put on his sweater,
see this tampered present...

570
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,044
and then send me to jail.

571
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,173
Like, the stakes were so high.

572
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,258
It was like a true Hanukkah miracle.

573
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,678
The first night, my parents put out
all the presents for my sister and I.

574
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,096
No one noticed the tear.

575
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,517
We went over to the table, we started
lighting candles, all that bullshit.

576
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,729
And then, before anyone had a chance
to look at the presents,

577
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,731
I ran over, I tore it open,

578
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,943
and just, like, wildly overcompensated.

579
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,153
You know? Like a bad actor.

580
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,864
I was like, "What? A Sega!"

581
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,159
And I started, like,
jumping up and down and screaming.

582
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,245
I kissed my dad on the cheek.

583
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,084
At one point, I did a cartwheel.

584
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,503
That's how crazy...

585
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,089
In my head, I was, like...
I knew it was effeminate,

586
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,676
but I was like, "I gotta sell this!
I gotta sell this! I gotta sell this!"

587
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,973
I guess I sold it.
It's my dad's happiest memory.

588
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,480
Are there any Jews here, by the way?
Any Jews?

589
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,232
- [cheering, scattered applause]
- Nice.

590
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,858
Round them up! [laughs]

591
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,487
[audience laughing]

592
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,947
JK.

593
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,346
It's funny now. That's gonna be
a real thing in, like, a year.

594
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,455
There's a weird thing
about Jews in America.

595
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,916
We all go to summer camp. All of us.

596
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,418
I don't know what that's about.

597
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,713
It's like when you turn 11 or 12,
your parents have a meeting,

598
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,967
just the two of them in the living room,
they're like, "Well, our son is 11 now.

599
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,722
So it's probably time
he got hand jobs in the woods? Right?"

600
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,642
My mom's like, "Yes, yes, yes."

601
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,312
Lotion-less.

602
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,194
I didn't want to go. I was not on board
for this Jewish summer camp thing.

603
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,239
Driving to Wisconsin...
The whole drive to Wisconsin,

604
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,123
I was in the back seat
of our minivan yelling,

605
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,660
"I don't want to go!
I don't want to do this! I'm scared!

606
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,662
I've never been away from home before!"

607
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,332
My mom turned around and calmed me down.
She's like, "Joseph.

608
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:37,002
It's gonna be fine. You're gonna find God,
and you have nothing to worry about.

609
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,546
I wrote your name
inside all your socks and underwear."

610
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,008
Right?
As if that was what I was worried about.

611
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,694
Like, "Oh, I didn't know about
this underwear thing.

612
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,219
Fucking hit it. Let's go."

613
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,766
First day of camp is weird.

614
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,142
You get out of the minivan,

615
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,144
and all you have in common
with these people

616
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,645
is that you're Jewish, right?

617
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,148
You're meeting kids.
You're like, "Hey, I'm Joe. I'm Jewish."

618
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,484
And it's like,
"Hey, I'm Seth. I'm Jewish."

619
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,154
[snorts] "All right.
Guess we're best friends."

620
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,824
And then this, uh,
particular night of camp,

621
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,743
uh, it was also Shabbat.

622
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,146
I don't know if you know Shabbat.

623
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,038
Shabbat's like the baller night
in Judaism.

624
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,040
You, like, eat bread.

625
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,543
So we did that.
We lit candles, we ate bread.

626
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,837
I ate a lot of chicken.
Like, too much chicken.

627
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,299
And then right after Shabbat dinner,
there was Israeli dancing.

628
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,427
So I went, danced my Israeli ass off
for a couple hours.

629
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,763
Just let everything really churn,
you know?

630
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,766
And... then at 10 p.m.,
our counselor was like,

631
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,851
"All right, kids, get to bed."

632
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,353
I got all cozy in my bunk.

633
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,648
And I remember thinking,
"Um, I think I'm gonna like it here."

634
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,149
[mimics switch clicking]

635
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,570
Went to bed.

636
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,325
Couple hours later, I woke up.
I don't know if this is a universal thing.

637
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,245
Has anyone woken up in the middle
of the night and known you had

638
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,746
ten seconds...

639
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,416
before you just shit all over yourself?

640
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,583
You? Yeah.

641
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,377
It's a horrible feeling.

642
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,563
I was jolted awake
and felt this countdown in my head.

643
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,006
Like, "Ten, nine, eight."

644
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,301
And I was in the top bunk,
so I was going down the ladder.

645
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,303
"Seven, six, five."

646
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,305
I put on my flip-flops. "Four."

647
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,349
Kick open the door to my cabin.

648
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,642
"Three."

649
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,937
And at three, I just exploded.

650
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,149
Like, full-on exploded.

651
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,860
I know this is disgusting.
I'm just going for accuracy.

652
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,236
It was ten feet in front of me.

653
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,780
You all would have been covered,
like a Gallagher show.

654
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,867
It was, like, ten feet in front of me,
ten feet behind me.

655
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,787
I got shit all over the grass,
all over the steps of my cabin.

656
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,790
I'd never been away from home before.

657
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,710
I was standing there like,
"Okay. What do you do now?

658
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,212
Do you just wait for someone to find you?

659
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,673
That seems foolish."

660
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:52,429
So what I did instead is I just ran
into the woods, like, in the dark.

661
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,891
I was running and getting hit in the face
with tree branches and shit.

662
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,518
I ran top speed for, like, three minutes

663
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,896
until I got to this big structure
at my camp

664
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,023
that housed all the toilets and showers.

665
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,608
It's called Noah's Ark.

666
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,489
Run in Noah's Ark. First thing,
I threw away all my shit-covered clothes.

667
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,907
Grabbed all this hand soap

668
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,659
and then just took
the most shameful shower of my life.

669
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:15,994
Just, like, weeping.

670
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,955
But I was still, like, violently ill.

671
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,792
So then I would run from the shower
to the toilet, like, shit my brains out,

672
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,002
and then shower again,

673
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,672
and just did that over and over again for
hours, you know, like a living nightmare.

674
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:33,053
And... it took so long that, like,
the sun started to rise.

675
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:38,099
After, like, my 12th shower, I was
finally, like, empty and clean, right?

676
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,685
But then that just meant
I was just naked and wet

677
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,230
and had to get back to my cabin somehow.

678
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,607
And, I mean... I wish I had seen...

679
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,528
I must have looked like the tiniest,
most shy little Bigfoot.

680
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,614
Like, running at dawn
back though the woods.

681
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,409
Like, hiding behind trees and, like,
picking up leaves to cover myself.

682
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,040
But no one saw me. I get back to my cabin.
I jump over my own shit explosion.

683
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,086
Crawl back into bed, cry myself to sleep.

684
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,631
Like, an hour later,
my bunkmate Seth wakes me up.

685
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,260
He's like, "Joe, wake up. Did you hear?
Did you hear about the bear?"

686
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,223
"What is it?"

687
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,602
I go outside. Everyone else in my cabin
is awake and standing in a semicircle

688
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,105
around my crime scene.

689
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,944
And Seth grabs me, and to this day,
I've never seen anyone more excited

690
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,279
about anything in my life.

691
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:36,241
He grabbed me and he was like, "Dude,
a bear shit on our cabin last night!"

692
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,623
And I looked back at my cabinmates,
all these little liars.

693
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,792
They're like, "I saw it. I saw it.

694
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,961
I saw the bear."

695
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,344
I stood there for a minute and I realized,
I was like, "Holy shit.

696
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:01,182
My mom was right. God is real.
God <i>is</i> real. God is good."

697
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,728
Yeah, like...

698
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,063
But for, like...

699
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,357
How else do you explain
the night I just had?

700
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,069
And here I am, mere hours later
in the daylight, redeemed.

701
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,739
All these idiots think a bear
shit on our cabin.

702
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,885
I remember my counselor standing off
to the side trying to figure it out.

703
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,412
He was like,
"It must have been a tiny bear."

704
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,335
But look, we all find faith
in different ways, right?

705
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,087
And that's my story,
and that feeling of faith

706
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,215
propelled me in my Jewish life
for, like, another...

707
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,303
30 minutes, 35 minutes.

708
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,305
So we went, we ate breakfast.

709
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,558
And then, um,
we were told to go brush our teeth.

710
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:48,063
So we all went to the Noah's Ark.
Started brushing our teeth.

711
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,190
And this kid Mike looked in the trash can,

712
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:54,277
found a shit-covered pair of boxer shorts
with my name written on the inside.

713
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,113
Yeah.

714
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,948
That happened.

715
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,869
So ever since then I've sort of been like,
"Well, fuck God. God can suck my dick.

716
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,454
God's a cock."

717
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,250
And, you know, now we're here.

718
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,794
Cool.

719
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,421
Look, all that was bullshit, okay?

720
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,650
This is... We're getting to the part
of the show that I...

721
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,010
I only want to talk about this next thing.
How exciting is that?

722
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,012
Can you imagine that
that was all bullshit?

723
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,475
Look, don't.

724
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,522
All I want to talk about with any...
I'm so happy I have a job

725
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,316
where I have a microphone
and can force people to listen to me.

726
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,152
'Cause all I want to talk about
is this one documentary

727
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,404
I've become obsessed with.

728
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,280
It's an HBO doc called

729
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,867
<i>Thought Crimes:
True Story of the Cannibal Cop.</i>

730
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:47,664
All right. Okay.
Four people know what I'm talking about.

731
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,834
It's a real question
if I even do stand-up anymore.

732
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,504
Honestly, it feels like I just get onstage
and recommend documentaries.

733
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,630
But it's a good one.

734
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,717
It's a really smart, nuanced look
at the life of the Cannibal Cop.

735
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,406
Cannibal Cop, this guy...
I don't know if you remember him.

736
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,100
He was kind of a big figure in New York
like ten years ago.

737
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,060
Uh, a real tragic figure actually.

738
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,895
Uh, here's what
you need to know about him.

739
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,023
He was a cop. He was a NYPD officer.

740
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,110
And two, uh, he was not a cannibal.

741
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,029
Twist, right?

742
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,909
Cannibal Cop never ate human flesh
once ever in his whole life.

743
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,347
And I don't know if this is
a hot take in terms of cannibalism,

744
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,499
but to me, till you actually
put a knife and fork into a human being

745
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,544
and, like, eat their flesh,
you're just a dude.

746
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,129
You're just a dude.

747
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,926
So Cannibal Cop, his name was Gilberto.

748
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,513
Right? And Gilberto, uh... Look,
before I can tell you about Gilberto,

749
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,600
let's just all admit right now
we all have our things.

750
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,396
Sexually, right? We all have our quirks.

751
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,680
None of us are saints. We all end up with
some weird shit. We're all some freaks.

752
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,445
So Gilberto's thing was
that he was sexually attracted

753
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,864
to the notion of cannibalism.

754
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,866
Whatever. Who cares? Truly, who cares?

755
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,120
So Gilberto...

756
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:13,416
I'm not saying Gilberto was smart.
I mean, he was a NYPD officer, okay?

757
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,296
Idiot. He's a fucking idiot,
and he came to work one day,

758
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,925
he went into the precinct
and used his police computer,

759
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,721
and he logged on to a fetish cannibal
message board post, right?

760
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,182
Like a website
where he and like-minded men

761
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,309
could swap fantasy stories

762
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,896
about, you know,
eating human flesh and then jacking off.

763
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,943
So Gilberto,
he logs into his police computer

764
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,862
and starts writing, like, this long,
eloquent story

765
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,323
about how he wants to kidnap his wife,

766
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,284
drive her up to a cabin,
throw her into an oven

767
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,161
and, like, eat her titties or whatever.

768
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,874
I'm not saying he's cool, by the way.
I don't think that's cool.

769
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,793
I just think that doesn't
make you a cannibal.

770
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,604
Just 'cause you're horny
and intellectually curious.

771
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,213
That doesn't make you a cannibal.

772
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,883
So what happens next to Gilberto
is fucking crazy.

773
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:08,137
It's a travesty of justice, right?
He is fired from the police force.

774
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,682
He is put under house arrest.
He has to live with his mother.

775
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,561
It sucks. It's humiliating.
His wife leaves him, obviously.

776
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:18,565
It was like front-page news that he
looks at her like a Slim Jim or whatever.

777
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,323
And this is when shit gets crazy. He is
then put on trial for attempted murder.

778
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,660
And the evidence used against him
is his fucking message board post.

779
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,120
His literature.

780
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:36,124
Some <i>Minority Report</i> shit, you know.

781
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,837
You all should be as upset as I am now!
I am fucking heated!

782
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,547
I've seen this documentary seven times.

783
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,591
I get so crazy upset.

784
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,469
Every time it's over, I'm just pacing
around my house, yelling at my dogs.

785
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,055
Just like, "Do you hear this?
Gilberto, the Cannibal Cop"...

786
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,893
First of all, to call him the Cannibal Cop
is an insult to cannibals...

787
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,728
who put the fucking work in.

788
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,271
This guy never ate...

789
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,232
He's just an artist. He's a poet.
He's a her... He's a hero.

790
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,817
He's a hero of the First Amendment.

791
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,154
I'm yelling that at my dog,
"Gilberto's my hero!

792
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,739
The Cannibal Cop's my hero."

793
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,578
Last time I watched this documentary,
I was so worked up and stoned

794
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,915
that I sat down at my desk at my computer

795
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:22,295
and I started doing, like, pro bono legal
advocacy work for the Cannibal Cop.

796
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,422
I was like,
"I'm going to save you, Gilberto."

797
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,132
I started researching.

798
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,968
I didn't go to law school.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

799
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,430
Four hours go by, and I realize
I've just stayed up all night

800
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,934
reading fetish cannibal
message board posts.

801
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,393
No.

802
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,020
You don't want to be that guy.

803
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,817
'Cause you watch the documentary, like,
if we're just basing stuff on web history,

804
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,862
I'm just as much of a cannibal
as the Cannibal Cop.

805
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,282
And I'm not.

806
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,826
I'm not a cannibal.

807
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,208
Although I will admit, right,

808
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,544
if you read enough
fetish cannibal message board posts,

809
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,715
like it does like get in your...
I can't stop thinking about cannibalism.

810
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,176
I think about it all day long.
It doesn't make me horny.

811
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,844
I don't get that part of it.

812
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,012
But like...

813
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,724
Here's the thing I can't stop
thinking about is, like,

814
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:20,061
becoming a cannibal is like such a leap
for a human being.

815
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,605
When you're like,
"Fuck it. I'm a cannibal."

816
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,858
What's that first day like? That's all
I think about. "What's for breakfast?"

817
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,029
I'm always asking my friends,

818
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,448
"What's the first thing you eat
on a human body?"

819
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:36,160
They're always just like, "Well,
I don't know why we hang out with you.

820
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,621
This isn't fun for us."

821
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,042
But I've gotten a lot of answers.
Some people have said "leg."

822
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,169
Other people have said "butt." Lol.

823
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,674
And it makes me so angry,
'cause it's just so illogical.

824
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,969
I'm like, "You've never eaten human flesh
and you're gonna chomp down on a leg?"

825
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,179
Give me a fucking break. Use your head.

826
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,558
You're gonna start small
and then work your way up to a leg.

827
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,726
Like, that's...

828
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,231
I probably put too much thought into this.

829
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,611
I think the right answer is...
Adam's apple.

830
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,991
Don't groan.
There's no right answer, all right?

831
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,701
But hear me out.

832
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,411
Got a lot going for it.

833
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,414
Sounds like a food. [scoffs]
Right? You're halfway there.

834
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,585
Small. It's bite-sized.
It's like an amuse-bouche or whatever.

835
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,920
You can pop it back.
You don't even have to chew it.

836
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,425
And three, I feel if you
prepared it right, which I would...

837
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,553
slow-roasted, cinnamon, nutmeg,
a little caramel sauce...

838
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,514
like you could convince yourself
it was... an apple.

839
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,058
Like a tiny...

840
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,809
All right.

841
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,856
I'm being cute right now.
We all know that's not the right answer.

842
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:52,195
It's pussy. It is pussy. It had, like...

843
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,739
I've eaten pussy my whole life.

844
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,365
Not my whole... I wasn't, like, four.

845
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,785
I was... the correct age.

846
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,204
Like... ten? Uh, no.

847
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:09,337
I love eating pussy. Love it.
It's one of my favorite pastimes.

848
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,256
My only complaint...

849
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,176
It's a misnomer. You don't eat pussy.

850
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,512
If anything,
it's like an Everlasting Gobstopper.

851
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,473
You just like lick it and lick it
and lick it and lick it.

852
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,558
You don't, like, get any.

853
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,649
Fuck you. This is smart,
what I'm talking about right now.

854
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,400
This is smart.

855
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,194
This is a thought experiment.

856
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,488
I'm just asking, like, hypothetically.

857
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,302
Think about it like this, all right?
Imagine this.

858
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,788
Imagine going your whole life
just smelling coffee.

859
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,124
[scoffs]

860
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,835
It's frustrating, right?
That's frustrating.

861
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,295
Now imagine the act of smelling coffee

862
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,798
for some reason is called
"drinking coffee."

863
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,762
Right?
At a certain point, you're gonna be like,

864
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,639
"Fuck this. I'm drinking some coffee."

865
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,313
Anyway, it's a great documentary.
You should...

866
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,941
You should check it out.

867
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,569
Thank you.

868
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,073
It's very cool you're clapping for that.

869
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,496
I don't even know
if I should do this next part. Uh...

870
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,914
[man] Do it!

871
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,960
I will. I mean, it's... It's a facade.
Obviously I'm gonna do it.

872
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,567
No, but, okay, here's the thing.
I'll tell you the real...

873
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,135
I could give a fuck about Gilberto.
Fuck that dude.

874
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,345
I don't give a shit about that guy.

875
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,307
I'll tell you the real reason why

876
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,309
<i>Thought Crimes:
True Story of the Cannibal Cop</i>

877
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,728
fucks me up so hard every time I watch it.

878
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,521
Before I even get into this next thing,

879
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,440
I need everyone here
to promise me right now

880
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,400
that you're gonna be fucking cool.

881
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,238
Can we do that? Can we just be adults?
All right?

882
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,575
'Cause I tried to do this next thing
in Seattle a few nights ago,

883
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,119
and they were straight-up bitches
about it, all right?

884
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,830
And I expect more from New York.
So let's just be fucking cool.

885
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,999
Can we do that, please, for me? All right.

886
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,960
Thank you. I'm gonna trust you.

887
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,672
All right.

888
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,219
So I've seen every ISIS video.

889
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,849
All of them.

890
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,060
Seen every ISIS propaganda video,

891
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,187
recruitment video, hostage video.

892
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,772
I seek them out.

893
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,818
I wouldn't say I'm a fan. Right?
I wouldn't go that far.

894
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,780
But what I will say,
I work in the television industry.

895
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,989
I work in Hollywood.

896
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,233
And there's an undeniable fact
about these ISIS videos.

897
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,160
They're fucking well made.

898
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,829
The production value
on these ISIS videos is...

899
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,834
All right, I feel super alone up here,

900
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,419
uh, to be quite honest.

901
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,172
It's like, I'm the only one
who watches a bunch of ISIS videos?

902
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,636
That's fine. I get it. No one watches
these videos 'cause ISIS is scary.

903
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,513
You can quote me on that.

904
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,974
Hot take: ISIS is scary.

905
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,562
No one watches these videos. I think there
is a misconception in the United States

906
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:18,401
that ISIS videos are like Al-Qaeda videos.

907
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,070
No, how dare you. Like, for real.

908
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,781
Al-Qaeda videos? You remember that shit?

909
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,992
It was, like, 15 years ago.

910
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,952
It was, like, Osama bin Laden in a cave

911
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,205
with, like, a Dell laptop,
external webcam.

912
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,333
There was, like, no narrative.
No, shit has changed.

913
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,043
These ISIS dudes, they have every...

914
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,879
They have, like, Final Cut Pro,
After Effects,

915
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,924
multi-language narration,
the score is tight.

916
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,056
I was watching this ISIS video
the other night...

917
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,308
and they had a drone.

918
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,312
Right? Like a drone with a camera on it.

919
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:59,316
And this drone was just flying over
some shithole in Syria somewhere.

920
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,902
Crisp HD footage, right?

921
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,323
And at one point,
the camera kind of tilted.

922
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:09,368
There was a lens flare,
and out loud I was like... [gasps]

923
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,664
"Who is the DP on this ISIS video?"

924
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,499
That shit was stunning.

925
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,424
And I know ISIS...
I'm not trying to be glib about ISIS.

926
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,884
I know ISIS is scary.

927
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,945
You know what scares me about ISIS?
This is the scariest thing.

928
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,305
ISIS can just say you're in ISIS.

929
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,727
I mean, that shit is bone-chilling.
Do you know what I'm saying?

930
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,065
'Cause, like, I'm convinced there's only,
like, nine actual members of ISIS,

931
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,650
and they're all fucking, like,
video editors, you know?

932
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,526
'Cause what always happens?
What's always the case?

933
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,282
It's a young, ambitious,
unaffiliated terrorist goes out,

934
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,494
lone wolf, kills a bunch of people,
kills himself.

935
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,288
And then the next day,
ISIS releases a statement.

936
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:58,209
They're like,
"Um, yeah. That guy was in ISIS." Send.

937
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:02,296
The news is like, "He was in ISIS.
Can you believe that?" He wasn't in ISIS.

938
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,590
But now he's in ISIS.

939
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,551
That's, like, my deepest worry in life,

940
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,137
is that, at some point,
I'm gonna get arrested,

941
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,473
probably for doing this joke, right?

942
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,562
Cops are gonna raid my house,
seize my computer,

943
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,439
look through the search history.

944
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,735
It's, like, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS,
Cannibal Cop, pussy, ISIS, ISIS, you know.

945
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,029
Nightmare.

946
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,365
Cops throw me in jail.

947
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,576
ISIS finds out about it.
They release a statement the next day.

948
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,663
They're like, "Um,
Joe Mande is the official comic of ISIS.

949
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,833
We love that guy. Total ISIS.
Signed, ISIS."

950
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:45,840
What do I do then? I can't be in jail,
"Fuck you, ISIS! I'm not in ISIS!"

951
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,593
They'll just be like, "Actually, that is
textbook ISIS humor. You are in ISIS."

952
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,470
Send.

953
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,684
I'm saying I don't want to
get cannibal-copped by ISIS.

954
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,936
That is my general fear in life.

955
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,606
'Cause I'm not in ISIS.

956
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,991
Although, let's say I joined ISIS, right?

957
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,869
I was thinking about this the other day.
Let's say I joined ISIS.

958
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,370
I say with confidence,

959
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,165
I think I'd be the best fucking thing
to ever happened to ISIS.

960
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,378
They're crushing it, but what's
their biggest problem right now?

961
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,590
No star power, right? None.

962
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,884
Like, can anyone here
name the leader of ISIS?

963
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,555
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

964
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,349
May the Prophet protect him.

965
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,147
How crazy is that?

966
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,709
He's supposed to be the leader of
the scariest terrorist group in the world,

967
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,610
and no one here knows his name.

968
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,487
How the fuck you gonna run a caliphate
when no one knows your name,

969
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,031
you unfamous bitch?

970
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,245
That's what I'm saying, when I...
If and when I join ISIS, right...

971
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,790
day one I'm bigger than Baghdadi.

972
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,293
I'm way more famous than that dude.
They have no one like me.

973
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,755
I'm a successful American Jew.
I've been on <i>Modern Family</i>.

974
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,299
It'd be great for them.

975
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,760
I could, like,
run their Twitter for a day or whatever.

976
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,929
It'd be, like, refreshing. Honestly.

977
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,514
'Cause they're not perfect.

978
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,436
I'm not standing onstage
saying ISIS is perfect.

979
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,064
No, I got some constructive criticisms.

980
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,358
Got some notes.

981
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,944
First of all, that flag.
What is that flag?

982
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,446
Y'all seen that ISIS flag? What is that?

983
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,741
It's like Arabic Comic Sans.

984
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,493
It's like...

985
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,829
You have the best video editors in
the game, and look at your graphic design.

986
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,123
That's offensive to me. That's offensive.

987
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,127
And I'm not proposing, like, a new font.

988
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,672
My question is, like,
why do you all have words on your flag?

989
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,174
Your whole MO is to recruit illiterates.

990
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,512
Am I wrong?

991
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,472
Get rid of the words.

992
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:02,351
In fact, just take the pirate flag.
That shit is public domain.

993
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,315
I've been in the organization
five minutes, dope new flag.

994
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,986
Then we got to talk about these videos,
like, you know.

995
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,989
Let's be honest. They're too long.
They're repetitive.

996
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,283
They are grim as fuck.

997
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,788
That's where I think I'd be helpful.

998
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,624
Like, if you've seen one beheading,
you've seen a million, right?

999
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,459
So before the second one, I pop up,

1000
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,962
and then it's, like,
ISIS bloopers with Joe Mande.

1001
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:33,465
Like, show they have a sense of humor,
bring some levity to the organization.

1002
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,178
I could be their Tosh.

1003
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,933
"Ta'esh".0, whatever.

1004
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,520
I'm not... Fuck ISIS.

1005
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,690
Fuck ISIS, fuck Russia, fuck Trump.

1006
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,209
- Like, when...
- [cheering, applauding]

1007
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,568
Thank you.

1008
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,131
I'm just...
I'm glad we're getting this on film.

1009
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:59,616
Because I want it... I want it on record
when World War III starts,

1010
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,369
I am Team China, China's my squad.

1011
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,372
That's my squad.
I'm rollin' hard with China.

1012
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,791
China, I love you.

1013
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,127
Uh, I just want to say
to my Chinese fans...

1014
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,879
This is just for my Chinese fans.

1015
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,590
[speaking Chinese]

1016
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,474
[speaking Chinese]

1017
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,603
Don't worry. That's not for you.

1018
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,903
Thought I won you guys back.

1019
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,863
It was a real journey.

1020
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,284
How do you get out of an ISIS hole?
You know, that's a real...

1021
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,038
It's a great question.

1022
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:51,418
Y'all smoke weed? [laughs]
Y'all smoke a little weed?

1023
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,755
Gotcha. Got 'em back. I got 'em back. Yes!

1024
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:01,345
Is weed legal in New York yet?
How's that working out for everyone?

1025
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,638
No? [clicks tongue]

1026
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,558
Uh... Okay, just so I get
a sense of the crowd tonight,

1027
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,103
uh, clap if you support
legalized marijuana.

1028
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,188
Just so I can... All right.

1029
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,441
That's most of the room. Okay. Thank you.

1030
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,985
I think I'm against it.

1031
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,613
Right?

1032
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,949
I smoked weed for more than half my life.

1033
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,326
And I live in California.
It's legal there now.

1034
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,622
And, um, what I've learned is that
the more marijuana becomes legal,

1035
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,165
the stronger it gets.

1036
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,795
To the point that in Los Angeles, weed is
essentially a hard drug at this point.

1037
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,340
Like, I can't smoke weed anymore.
It's heartbreaking for me.

1038
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,803
Like, now when I go to a party in LA
and I share a joint with a friend,

1039
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,889
like, 30 seconds go by
and I lose my fucking mind.

1040
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,891
Like it's not even fun.
Like I lose my mind.

1041
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,395
I'll look at my friend and be like,
"Uh, yo. Yo, can I ask you something?

1042
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,524
Uh, does air go in your nose
and out your mouth,

1043
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,776
or in your mouth and out your nose?

1044
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,529
I don't remember how to do it."

1045
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,783
"Don't worry. Don't worry.
I just won't do either."

1046
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,955
Sometimes I get so high
that if I'm around too many people,

1047
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,584
I'll lock myself in a bathroom
and interrogate myself in a mirror

1048
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,670
like a fucking murder detective
on a TV show.

1049
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,797
Right? I'll, like, slam the door, lock it.

1050
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:22,468
Be like, "Joe, what the fuck, shit bird?
Why the fuck do you feel so crazy?

1051
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,279
You came to the party normal,
now you're crazy.

1052
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,929
Why you feel so crazy, asshole?"

1053
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,557
And I'll be like, "Oh, I don't know, man.

1054
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,685
Like, I came to the party,
and then I was normal,

1055
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,271
and then we went outside, and then...

1056
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:38,108
Oh, I remember. Oh.
Then we smoked cancer medicine."

1057
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:44,406
That's what it is. It's medical marijuana.
That's its intent.

1058
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,302
Have you ever gotten so high that you're,
"You know what would be dope?

1059
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,163
If I was in a hospital bed right now...
with cancer...

1060
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,377
instead of trying not to cry
at an R. Kelly concert."

1061
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,172
[laughs] True story.

1062
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,428
But I don't want you to think I hate weed.

1063
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,223
I love weed.
I'm gonna get high in, like, five minutes.

1064
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:16,188
Here's the thing. I'm not, like, smart.
I haven't done a lot with my life.

1065
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:19,983
But one thing I know for sure,
if I have any wisdom, it's this.

1066
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:24,571
One of the greatest joys in life is to
get really high and go to a TV taping.

1067
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,241
It's the best. I've done it so many times.

1068
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,701
I used to be an intern
at the <i>Maury Povich Show</i>.

1069
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:34,164
I would just get blazed every day and go
to tapings like, "Yes. Paternity tests."

1070
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,127
No, I knew the answer already.

1071
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,256
The best.

1072
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,552
Here's the thing. It's always fun. You
live in New York. Do it once. It's great.

1073
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,679
It's always fun. Unless it's not.

1074
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,975
'Cause when it's not fun,
it's <i>really</i> not fun.

1075
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,895
I had an experience about five years ago
when I lived here in New York.

1076
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,481
My best friend Noah and I,
we ate pot brownies,

1077
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:03,986
and then we went to a taping
of the Fox News talk show <i>Huckabee</i>.

1078
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,073
Yeah. Hosted by former Arkansas governor,

1079
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:12,869
and probably, like, future ambassador
to Chick-fil-A, Mike Huckabee.

1080
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,293
So I got the tickets
through my spam folder, right?

1081
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,045
And I hit "print."

1082
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,256
Noah came over to my apartment
in Brooklyn.

1083
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,259
We both ate these pot brownies,
uh, that I made.

1084
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,470
We waited an hour for them to kick in.

1085
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:33,348
And as we were leaving my apartment,
Noah stopped me and he was like,

1086
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,059
"No, we can't go. They're gonna think
we're up to something."

1087
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,813
And I knew what he meant. I was like,
"Fuck, you're right. What do we do?"

1088
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,524
He thought for a minute and he went...

1089
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,902
"It'll be okay.
We just have to dress like Republicans."

1090
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,613
Right?

1091
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,824
So we go back into my apartment,
into my closet,

1092
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,784
we both put on suits and ties.

1093
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,369
That's it.

1094
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,332
We took the train into Midtown Manhattan

1095
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,500
into Fox News headquarters...

1096
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,628
and we tried to blend in.

1097
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,273
We were, like, shaking people's hands,
just strangers, being like,

1098
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,549
"Excuse me, sir.
Drill. Drill, baby, drill."

1099
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,469
Just, like, so eager and weird.

1100
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,389
We got in line for the <i>Huckabee</i> taping,

1101
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:19,686
and it became very clear that we were...
completely overdressed, right?

1102
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,189
Like no one had put as much thought
into it as we did.

1103
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,318
Everyone there to see the <i>Huckabee Show</i>
was like a slob in sweatpants.

1104
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:30,197
And then this one Asian family
that saw a line and got into it.

1105
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,953
But I'm saying, by comparison,
we looked fucking amazing.

1106
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,289
And as we're walking into the studio,
this production assistant sees us,

1107
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,292
"You guys in the suits, please,
right here. Sit in the front row.

1108
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,670
Right here in the front row. Right there."

1109
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:48,840
Me and Noah sit down, and we're looking
at all these cameras facing the audience.

1110
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:52,803
And we are fucked up. Like, not okay.

1111
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,222
Like, we were on edibles.

1112
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,808
No one's ever done edibles,
then afterwards was like,

1113
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,227
"You know what?
That was really a good idea.

1114
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,938
That was fun the whole time,

1115
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:06,733
and I felt in control of myself
and my surroundings.

1116
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,819
It was cool. It was cool the whole time."

1117
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,406
Like, no. Like, we shouldn't
have been in public. We were fucked up.

1118
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,867
We're grinding our teeth and sweating.
We looked fucking crazy.

1119
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,167
And, uh, eventually Mike Huckabee's
house band started playing.

1120
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,294
He had a house band
called The Little Rockers.

1121
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,630
[imitates gunshot] Right?

1122
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,969
So Little Rockers start playing, like,
"Mustang Sally" or some fucking bullshit.

1123
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,347
The curtains open,
Mike Huckabee comes out.

1124
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,641
He waddles out right in front of us.

1125
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,854
And as he walks by,
Noah and I lose our shit.

1126
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,732
We just lose it. We are hyperventilating
we're laughing so hard.

1127
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:50,235
We, like, can't breathe.
Like, snot rolling down our faces.

1128
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,697
'Cause we realized where we were, right?

1129
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,116
And it's a talk show.

1130
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,594
So Mike Huckabee, he's standing
as close as I am to you guys, right?

1131
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:03,373
And he starts performing monologue jokes.
Right? About, like, current events.

1132
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:08,170
And from his perspective,
he is crushing, right?

1133
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,048
'Cause these two demon-eyed Republicans
in the front row

1134
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,718
are just laughing at everything
he's saying, like, high-fiving each other.

1135
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,892
So then Mike Huckabee sits down
at his desk, and he's like,

1136
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,854
"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this is
a very special episode of <i>Huckabee</i>.

1137
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,731
I have a celebrity cohost.

1138
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,317
You may know her
as Miss Las Vegas herself.

1139
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,695
Give it up for Rita Rudner!"

1140
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,198
The curtains open again.

1141
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,867
Rita Rudner comes, like,
clip-clopping out in these high heels.

1142
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,577
She walks right in front of us.

1143
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,456
Um, I don't know why this happens,
but I burst into tears.

1144
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,084
I just... I'm completely overwhelmed.

1145
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,297
Don't know what's happening.
So I'm crying.

1146
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,218
I look to my left.
Noah is dry heaving, right?

1147
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,012
'Cause he... he got drunk too.
Forgot to mention that.

1148
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,431
He got drunk as well as high.

1149
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,768
We are a mess.

1150
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:09,481
We sit there.
The taping is four hours long, right?

1151
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,525
We're there all fucking day.

1152
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,569
I've never been more bored and scared
in my life.

1153
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:19,324
And about three hours into the taping,
I'm sitting there, and I look over

1154
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,244
and I make eye contact
with this cameraman.

1155
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,663
And this cameraman is just glaring at me.

1156
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,458
And I just got to keep looking at him.
I don't know what his fucking problem is.

1157
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,295
Eventually,
he walks away from his fancy camera.

1158
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,340
He, uh, taps me on the shoulder.

1159
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:39,803
And he whispers in my ear. He goes,
"Uh, you know I called the cops, right?"

1160
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,765
Yeah, and guess what.
Didn't handle that well.

1161
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,767
I did not handle that well at all.

1162
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:48,371
I was like, "No, sir. Please don't call
the cops. We don't belong here.

1163
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,581
We know we don't belong here.
We'll leave on our own volition.

1164
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,245
Please. We'll leave on our own volition."
I kept saying "volition."

1165
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,657
And the cameraman is, like, freaked out.
He doesn't know what I'm talking about.

1166
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,411
So he bends back down
and he slowly repeats himself.

1167
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:09,916
He goes, "Uh, no.
I said my camera's coming through here.

1168
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,963
Just... I have to move my camera."

1169
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,427
Right?
I had a complete auditory hallucination.

1170
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,557
I tried to cover. I was like, "Yeah.
Whatever. Don't call the cops, man.

1171
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,226
Just do your job. Volition, you know."

1172
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,858
But somehow we get out of there unscathed.

1173
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,503
Then Noah and I spend the next, like,
three or four hours just, like,

1174
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,655
wandering around Manhattan
trying to sober up.

1175
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,325
We get back to Brooklyn,
we sit down on my couch,

1176
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,619
uh, we get high again.

1177
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:50,248
And I turn on my TV to <i>Huckabee</i>.
I taped <i>Huckabee</i>.

1178
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,667
We wanted to watch the show
we just watched.

1179
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,128
So Noah and I, we got high

1180
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:58,381
and we watched the full one-hour
edited version of <i>Huckabee</i>,

1181
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,676
and to this day,
I've never seen anything more fucked-up.

1182
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:06,348
Like I said, we were in the front row,
all these cameras facing us.

1183
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,142
Yet whenever one of us
was about to enter frame,

1184
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,145
it would, like,
quick switch to a different camera angle.

1185
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:16,733
Like, for a full hour. It took an editor,
like, a lot of work to splice us out.

1186
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,156
And when it ended,
I looked at Noah and I was like,

1187
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,800
"Dude, you know what that means, right?

1188
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,994
Either we were so fucked-up-looking today

1189
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,665
that Fox News didn't feel comfortable
putting us on television...

1190
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,668
or we got so high this morning...

1191
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,963
we never even went to
a Mike Huckabee taping."

1192
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,385

<i>for Nick Kroll, Chelsea Peretti,

Almost all of you won!

1217
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,509
- That's fantastic!
- My Dad! Yes!

1218
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,428
- [Richter] Congratulations!
- Yes!

1219
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,805
- Oh.
- Oh.

1220
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,476
[Schaal] Um, thank you.

1221
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,854
Uh, but seriously, we just want to thank
all the managers and agents and lawyers

1222
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,206
- who make this possible.
- [applause]

1223
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,442
And the fans. We're so grateful for
the laughter and the support. Love you.

1224
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,111
- Thank you so much.
- [Peretti] We are the final four!

1225
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:29,783
They always say it's a pleasure
just to be nominated, but it is not!

1226
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,577
- Yes!
- This is where it's at!

1227
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,288
[Mande] <i>You know, no one likes to lose.</i>

1228
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,498
Uh...

1229
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,959
I think it was...
I think it was good for me. Honestly.

1230
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:44,255
I've learned a lot over the last few weeks
since... since the show.

1231
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:49,302
And, um, I've learned that it really
is the journey, not the destination.

1232
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:53,473
I don't need a trophy to tell me
whether or not I'm a good comedian.

1233
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,016
- 'Cause I know...
- [knocking]

1234
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,393
Sorry.

1235
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,687
I should have put a sign on the door
or something.

1236
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,482
This is really...
It's really unprofessional.

1237
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,110
Hello? Oh, hi.

1238
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,530
Cool. Thank you.

1239
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,950
Package. [chuckles]

1240
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:30,510
"Dear Joe, As I watched <i>The American</i>
<i>Humour Awards</i> on TV the other night,

1241
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,264
I was shocked and saddened to see that
you did not end up the chosen winner.

1242
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,684
In my humble opinion, you were robbed!
You did everything right:

1243
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,519
<i>the intro,</i>

1244
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,104
<i>the outfit,</i>

1245
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,439
<i>the applause breaks.</i>

1246
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,731
<i>Your special was perfect!</i>

1247
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:46,234
<i>It breaks my heart
you did not go home with the trophy.</i>

1248
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,861
So if it's any consolation...

1249
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:53,491
I've decided to send you
my American Humour Award from 1983.

1250
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,285
All the best.

1251
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,581
Your friend, Dr. Bill Cosby."
