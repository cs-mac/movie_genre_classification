1
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:48,020
Oopsie.

2
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,489
Decaf double tall
nonfat capp for Bruce.

3
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,052
You got it, buddy.

4
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:58,894
That's a wonderful choice,
Bruce.

5
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,958
- Thank you, Sam. Take care.
- It certainly is.

6
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:06,530
One Caramel Macchiato.
It's very hot.

7
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,473
Good morning.

8
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,408
Vanilla grande no-foam latte.

9
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,105
That's a wonderful choice.

10
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:14,306
- Thanks, Sam.
- Yeah.

11
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,910
Hey, Sam. They called.
It's time for you to go.

12
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:20,545
Oh, yeah, it's time.

13
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:21,554
It's time, buddy.

14
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:25,615
It's time for me to go now.

15
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,526
It's time for me to go now,
George!

16
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,722
Good luck.

17
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:32,061
It's time.

18
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:36,963
It's time now.

19
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,009
Hurry up. The first floor
is two more floors.

20
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,417
Hurry up.

21
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:56,854
The second floor..
one more floor.

22
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,485
I have to go to Room 324
on the third floor.

23
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,189
Rebecca!

24
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,997
You the one responsible
for this?

25
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,502
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,903
Too late for sorries.
Get over here and hold her hand.

27
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,100
Are you OK?

28
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,110
Got a live one, Gert.

29
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,343
Good. Come on.
Focus and breathe.

30
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,407
This is it.

31
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:27,909
This is it.

32
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:31,913
This is it.

33
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,289
And it's a girl!

34
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,238
It's OK.

35
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,545
What's her name?

36
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:11,430
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

37
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:15,992
Lucy Diamond Dawson.

38
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:28,370
You're my daughter.
I'm your father.

39
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:38,986
Get them to make the bus stay.
They're leaving.

40
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,016
- I'll get them.
- They're leaving.

41
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:44,326
Excuse me.
Hang on one second, please.

42
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:51,164
Becca!

43
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,468
Becca! The bus is going!

44
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,041
Uh-oh.

45
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:45,387
Didn't you just go to sleep?

46
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,025
Let me see.

47
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,492
OK.

48
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:01,030
Lucy, you look beautiful
this morning.

49
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,602
You look very beautiful.

50
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,723
Look at that, Lucy. Nose.

51
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:21,090
OK. Yeah, I..

52
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,095
Oopsie.

53
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,473
What the hell are you
doing to that baby?

54
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,876
What's the matter
with the baby, Sam?

55
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:21,580
Everything
is just so tiny, tiny.

56
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,249
Will you come over here
and help me?

57
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,748
You know I can't do that.
What does her mother say?

58
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:30,695
Her mother said,
"This isn't my life.."

59
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,096
"and I didn't want
a baby with you."

60
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,499
"I just needed
a place to sleep."

61
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,504
What if the baby's sick?

62
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:41,336
Bring her over here.

63
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:45,674
Sam, babies need food
every two hours.

64
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,019
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Lucy in the sky.

65
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,215
You know..

66
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,851
critics and fools said that
that song..

67
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:03,420
had some mysterious meaning,
but John always said..

68
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:06,728
it came from a picture
his son Julian drew..

69
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,826
of his friend Lucy O'Connell.

70
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:14,131
So I made a good choice?

71
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:19,908
You made
an excellent choice, Sam.

72
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:23,507
Now, what time does
this little diamond wake up?

73
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:29,150
What time does
this little diamond wake up?

74
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,419
She wakes up all the time.

75
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:38,486
Let's just assume
she wakes up at 6:00.

76
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:43,628
Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.

77
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,297
I want you to feed her first..

78
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:49,274
when "Hogan's Heroes"
comes on.

79
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:56,215
And then again.
Wait until "I Dream of Jeannie."

80
00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:02,245
And then, feed her
when "I Love Lucy" comes on.

81
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,381
We have to be quiet.

82
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,120
I've seen nothing.
I know nothing!

83
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:12,588
Such a nice man for an officer.

84
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,205
What are you doing?

85
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,269
I'm just getting Lucy asleep..

86
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,041
and you're making noise
and everything.

87
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,276
- Oh, sorry.
- We're here for video night.

88
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,747
Eight years every Thursday
video night, and you forgot?

89
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:37,949
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:42,951
It's always every first Thursday
of every month..

91
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:48,400
video night at Sam's house.
And I forgot.

92
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,061
Yeah, and I forgot.

93
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:53,072
Becca's gone.
"Gone with the Wind."

94
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,131
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

95
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,801
That was a very sad movie.

96
00:09:56,843 --> 00:10:01,576
Here we go.
Everything changes now.

97
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:04,344
Soon you'll forget about
Wednesday night at IHOP..

98
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,852
and then Friday night
at karaoke..

99
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:10,322
and I got hit by a car today.

100
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,449
You did?

101
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,655
It was probably that guy
from the V.A.

102
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:19,096
Did you bring
"Kramer vs. Kramer"?

103
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:24,126
I see what's happening here.
I see.

104
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,660
So this is all my fault now.

105
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,366
Don't tell me you forgot again.

106
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,335
I broke a date with
a daydream to come here.

107
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,346
It's your mother.

108
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,373
Hi, Robert. Hello, boys.
It's me, Estelle.

109
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:42,081
Ma, I told you.
Video night's over at 9:00.

110
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,112
It's only 6:30.

111
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:50,926
Well, I guess
I'll just wait downstairs.

112
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:52,625
Sure there isn't anything
I can get you?

113
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:55,657
No, Ma. You can wait downstairs.
That's fine.

114
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:58,227
OK. See you later, Rob.

115
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,966
Bye, Estelle.

116
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:04,971
What a pretty baby.
Hi, little baby.

117
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,571
- Doesn't she look smart?
- She does.

118
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,376
She looks smart.

119
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,679
That baby looks so darn smart.

120
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:15,085
It's amazing how smart she is.

121
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,679
She's very smart.

122
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:20,022
She really does.
I think she's really beautiful.

123
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,924
Of course she looks smart.

124
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,122
She's already reading the paper.

125
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:43,677
Double Macchiato,
low fat, low foam.

126
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,445
That's a wonderful choice.

127
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,749
Oh, my God!

128
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,191
An ice cube went down..

129
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,058
Thank you. Oh, my God.

130
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:57,221
Can I get another drink, please?

131
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,892
Iced cappuccino.
That's a wonderful choice.

132
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:01,957
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,561
Annie, I can't take her
to work anymore..

134
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,697
because she's too big now.

135
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,230
- Annie.
- That was her first word.

136
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,800
- Annie.
- See?

137
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:14,972
People worry you're not smart.

138
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,412
Papa.

139
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:23,055
Yes. Oh, you smell so good.

140
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:26,650
You can tell a lot about people
by the way they smell.

141
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,670
Daddy, why does the snow flake?

142
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,804
Because snow..
because snow flakes.

143
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,281
Daddy, what is mustard made of?

144
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,479
Because it's yellow ketchup.

145
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,749
Daddy, why are men bald?

146
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,689
Sometimes they're bald
because their head is shiny..

147
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,555
and they don't have hair on it.

148
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:03,790
So their head
is just more of their face.

149
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,695
Daddy,
are ladybugs only girls..

150
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,358
or are there boys, too?

151
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,028
And if there are,
what are they called?

152
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:11,832
Yeah, the Beatles.

153
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:14,965
Daddy, where does the sky end?

154
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:16,872
Why does the moon
follow me home?

155
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,206
Why is the sun orange?

156
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,644
Where does the hour go
in Daylight Savings?

157
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,207
Daddy, do I look more
like you or Mommy?

158
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:29,344
Daddy..

159
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,218
Do you think
she'll ever come back?

160
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:43,925
Paul McCartney lost
his mother when he was little.

161
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,669
And John Lennon lost his mother
when he was little.

162
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:53,839
Annie says that sometimes
God picks the special people.

163
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,905
That's what Annie says.

164
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:01,553
Daddy, did God mean for you
to be like this..

165
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,555
or was it an accident?

166
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,821
What do you mean?

167
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,351
I mean you're different.

168
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,865
But what do you mean?

169
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,532
You're not like other daddies.

170
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:28,045
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

171
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,277
Yeah, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,252
It's OK, Daddy.

173
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:39,088
Don't be sorry. I'm lucky.

174
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,253
Nobody else's daddy
ever comes to the park.

175
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:55,263
Yeah, we are lucky.
Aren't we lucky?

176
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,707
Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.

177
00:14:56,742 --> 00:15:00,371
Sunnyside up, not too runny.
Two sausage links.

178
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,938
French pancakes
instead of buttermilk.

179
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,075
Fruit topping on the side.

180
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:06,607
The Funny Face special.

181
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,815
I think it's funny when
you say "Funny Face special."

182
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,983
French, not buttermilk.
Fruit topping on the side.

183
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,287
Not on top.

184
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,887
You're getting a funny face.

185
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:24,693
That's a wonderful choice.
Thank you, Grace.

186
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,898
Thank you
very, very, very, very much.

187
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,065
You got it, Sam.

188
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,597
Is that too big?

189
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,337
I think that's a little too big.

190
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:34,107
You need a pair of
good, sturdy school shoes.

191
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,272
These are sturdy.

192
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,578
The arches
are very important.

193
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,949
No. Sturdy is boring, Sam.

194
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:44,616
These shoes light up, OK?

195
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:49,219
These are really good shoes
for school.

196
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:50,456
I know. I love them.

197
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,930
I found the most perfect shoes.

198
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:56,128
They look like the shoes
that Dorothy wore..

199
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,602
played by Judy Garland
in "The Wizard of Oz"..

200
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,698
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

201
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:05,677
These are pink.
These are also Velcro.

202
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:09,647
They might have
a little arch in there, too.

203
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,378
Sam, these are
probably too big..

204
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,615
but I thought maybe
Lucy would like those.

205
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:20,319
When we were at the zoo,
she liked the animal prints.

206
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,589
But these are for adults.

207
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,722
But when we went..
I don't know you.

208
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:26,891
I don't know who you are.

209
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,729
I like these, Daddy.

210
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,534
She knows what she likes.
That's why she likes these.

211
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,131
- Black goes with everything.
- How much are these?

212
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:37,472
$16.19 with tax.

213
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:43,006
Because I have $6.25.

214
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,516
That's all you have?

215
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,849
I didn't get my whole check
because I had to go..

216
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,220
to the parent and teacher
meeting this week.

217
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:54,920
I'm sorry. It's $16.19.

218
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,396
I couldn't go to work
all day that day.

219
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,594
It's OK, Sam, because
I have $3.00 to contribute.

220
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:05,502
Sam, I've only got
two plus two..

221
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:11,033
but I need one for stamps,
so 1..2..3.

222
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:12,908
Joe's got $1.50.

223
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:17,848
Yeah. So, is that enough?

224
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,408
If there's a God.
I'll count it.

225
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,445
Do we get a balloon with these?

226
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:29,219
All of us, or just her?

227
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,133
"And I will eat them
here and there."

228
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,567
"I will eat them anywhere."

229
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:15,666
"I do so like
green eggs and ham."

230
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,074
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

231
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,874
One more time?

232
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,973
- Yeah.
- OK.

233
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:27,417
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

234
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,478
"I will eat them with a mouse."

235
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,490
"And I will eat them
here and there."

236
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,355
"Say, I will
eat them anywhere."

237
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:36,361
"I do so like
green eggs and ham."

238
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,989
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

239
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,357
One more time?

240
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:45,234
Daddy, it's my first day
of school tomorrow.

241
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:48,729
I don't want to be too sleepy.

242
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:56,075
Everybody says Bob's Big Boy
has the best hamburgers.

243
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:59,312
Can we go there Wednesday
instead of IHOP?

244
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,842
But Wednesday is IHOP.

245
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,321
Just one time?

246
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:07,154
Yeah, but Wednesday is IHOP.

247
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,527
Can I read just the beginning?

248
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,536
Just the beginning.

249
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,562
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

250
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,843
There are four stages
of a butterfly's life.

251
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:31,282
The first three stages are
from egg to larva to cocoon.

252
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:35,686
Last..

253
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:39,316
They're hard to remember
because there's so many stages.

254
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,826
It's hard to remember.

255
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,921
33 days. It lasts 33 days.

256
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:49,401
Spiders and insects
are members of the ants..

257
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:51,699
ants.. anthro..

258
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:55,104
Conner. Anthropod class.

259
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,233
Anthropod class.

260
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:01,440
However, spiders and insects
are very different.

261
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,643
- Spiders have six legs..
- Eight legs.

262
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:08,744
Eight legs and two body parts,
and they're called..

263
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:11,449
Conner. What are you doing?
You know this stuff.

264
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,787
- No, I don't.
- You do know it.

265
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,259
You wrote that part,
remember?

266
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:18,388
I wanted to do potato bugs
anyway. Oh, forget it.

267
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,558
I think he can make
that boy feel better.

268
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:24,959
Sorry, Mr. Egg.

269
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,699
What's wrong with your father?

270
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,730
Why's he acts like a retard?

271
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,435
He is.

272
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:33,070
- Are you?
- No.

273
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:35,171
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

274
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,203
How do you know?

275
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:37,545
He told me.

276
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,948
He's a retard.

277
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,214
Well, it takes one to know one.

278
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:45,417
It's wonderful to have you
for company tonight.

279
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,756
Isn't it wonderful to have
Conner for company, Lucy?

280
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:53,520
Yeah. "Sorry, Mr. Egg."

281
00:20:56,368 --> 00:21:00,031
"They per.."

282
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:05,703
"They perched in..

283
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,905
"Si..

284
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,380
silen.."

285
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,609
Silence.

286
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:16,450
Yeah. Silence.

287
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:21,425
"They perched in silence
for a long time."

288
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,556
Your teacher gave you
a really hard book this time.

289
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,192
That's really
a hard book to read.

290
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:33,899
"How can we be so.."

291
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,805
Differ..

292
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,004
Different.

293
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,980
Oh, yeah. OK.

294
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:49,944
"How can we be so different
and feel so much alike?"

295
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,479
I don't like that book.

296
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,014
Let's read
"Green Eggs and Ham."

297
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:57,688
Yeah! OK.

298
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,097
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

299
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:08,068
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

300
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,302
"I am Sam."

301
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:19,207
Hey, you.

302
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,719
Hey, handsome.

303
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:28,952
"Premature baby
claims he's Cupid.

304
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:32,657
"Has arrow to prove it."
You believe that?

305
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:37,158
But if he has the arrow,
that's the only thing.

306
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:39,602
You got a good point.

307
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:43,904
This is the international
House of Pancakes quiz.

308
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:46,877
And Lucy found the word "beet."

309
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:50,814
I want to surprise her
and find the word "carrot"..

310
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:52,248
but it's hiding.

311
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:54,184
Carrot!

312
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:57,211
- Where?
- C-a-r-r.. carrot.

313
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,020
Carrot. It's right there.

314
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,253
And you're smart.
You would be a good mother.

315
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:09,433
Do you tell good stories?

316
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,460
- I got stories up the wazoo.
- Really?

317
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:13,630
You come with me and relax..

318
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,072
and I'll tell you
some nice stories.

319
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:19,407
Lily, what did I tell you
about selling on my beat?

320
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,608
Put it down on the table.

321
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,446
It's the international
House of Pancakes quiz.

322
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:26,815
Put your hands behind your head.

323
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:27,944
What did I..

324
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:29,544
Do you have any weapons on you?

325
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:35,451
He touched me
on my private place.

326
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:41,992
At such a time as this,
Annie's the boss.

327
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,867
First time in 19 years
I actually believe a guy..

328
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:46,632
when he says he didn't know
she was a hooker.

329
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,503
You say that like
it's a good thing.

330
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,667
Did you brush your teeth?

331
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:53,701
They don't sound
like they were brushed.

332
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,411
She forgot to brush her teeth.

333
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,475
Let him go.

334
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,646
Says he never spent
the night away from his kid.

335
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:10,051
Trouble. Oh, boy,
I'm really in trouble.

336
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:15,994
Are you in trouble, too?

337
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:21,232
Are you in trouble, too?

338
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:24,003
Yeah, I'm in trouble, too.

339
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,113
It gives us great insight
into what she must be feeling.

340
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,482
Mr. Dawson,
it's becoming clear..

341
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,977
that she's holding herself
back in the classroom.

342
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:40,549
It's as if she's literally
afraid to learn.

343
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:43,720
No one doubts
that you love your daughter.

344
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:48,590
But the Department
of Child and Family Services..

345
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,158
contacted us.

346
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,329
They shared with us
that your records show..

347
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:55,306
that your
intellectual capacity..

348
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,740
is around that of a 7-year-old.

349
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:05,215
Our concern is what happens
when Lucy turns 8.

350
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,011
Mr. Dawson,
do you understand..

351
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,319
what Ms. Wright is trying
to tell you about Lucy?

352
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:28,605
John wanted to try new things.

353
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:34,438
And it wasn't Yoko's fault.

354
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:37,243
No, it wasn't Yoko's fault.

355
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,117
Annie says you can hear it
on The White Album.

356
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,227
Because John wanted
to try new things.

357
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:04,475
"They perched in silence.
How can we be so diff.."

358
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:09,845
Diff.. diff..
I don't know that word.

359
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:18,284
Yes, you do. That's the word
that starts with a "D."

360
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,883
I'm tired.

361
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:23,224
I don't believe you.

362
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:26,493
Are you calling me a liar?

363
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:30,228
Yes. I think
you have to read the word.

364
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:31,930
No.

365
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,369
Yeah, you have to read
that word.

366
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:34,565
No.

367
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:36,233
Yeah. Here it is.

368
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:39,073
There's the picture
where they're all perched.

369
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,238
- Now read the word.
- No!

370
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:46,777
I won't read the word!

371
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:49,412
I'm your father..

372
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,753
and I'm telling you
to read the word.

373
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:56,955
I can tell you to
because I'm your father.

374
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:59,589
I'm stupid.

375
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:02,828
- You are not stupid.
- Yes, I am.

376
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:07,066
You are not stupid,
because you can read that word.

377
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,368
I don't want to read it
if you can't.

378
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:18,975
No, because it makes me happy.

379
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:21,884
It makes me happy
hearing you read.

380
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:32,758
Yeah. It makes me happy
when you're reading.

381
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,502
"They perched in silence
for a long time."

382
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,030
'How can we be so different..

383
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,703
and feel so much alike?'
mused Flitter.

384
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,735
'How can we feel
so different..

385
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,373
and be so much alike?'
wondered Pip.

386
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:52,781
'I think
this is quite a mystery."'

387
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,350
Keep going.

388
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,913
They have Oreo
ice cream mud pie.

389
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,424
This is so great.

390
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,950
Yeah, this is so great.

391
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,798
And the menu says..

392
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:10,199
you can have your
favorite breakfast all day.

393
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:12,669
That's so great, too, you know.

394
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,969
Because you wanted
to come to a new place..

395
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,739
so we came
to a different place.

396
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,943
Hey, guys.
Can I get you coffee?

397
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:30,519
No, I don't drink coffee.

398
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:33,922
OK. What can I get you guys?

399
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,757
I'd like the Super Big Boy
with a root beer float, please.

400
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:39,263
OK. What about you?

401
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:48,535
I would like to have
two eggs, sunnyside up.

402
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,973
But not runny, OK?

403
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:52,203
Not runny.

404
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:55,179
And then I would like
to have French pancakes..

405
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,909
with the fruit topping
on the side.

406
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:01,385
We don't have French pancakes.

407
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,409
We have French toast.

408
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:03,819
No, I don't want French toast.

409
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,483
I want French pancakes,
like at IHOP.

410
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:10,552
Just the same kind
like they have at IHOP.

411
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,927
That's what my favorite
breakfast is, OK?

412
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,431
They're those thin pancakes.

413
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,196
The crepe pancakes?

414
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,532
I don't even want crepes.

415
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,629
I want to have
French pancakes..

416
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:22,299
with the fruit topping
on the side.

417
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,605
That's what
I want to have, please.

418
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:26,702
Thank you.

419
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,339
We don't have that, though, sir.

420
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:31,611
Do you want
regular pancakes and jam..

421
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,813
I don't want something else!
Why did you ask me that?

422
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:37,413
I'll see.
Maybe they have something..

423
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:40,448
- Yeah, ask Bob!
- OK.

424
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,483
Ask Bob's Big Boy.

425
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:44,825
Because the customer's
always right.

426
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,558
I understand that..

427
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:49,032
The customer's always right.

428
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,351
Because when Lucy comes
through the door..

429
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,881
everybody says, "surprise!"

430
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,486
You gotta stop bouncing
for a second.

431
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,759
You'll say, "surprise!"

432
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:54,094
Can we keep bouncing?

433
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:56,623
You'll have to come down.

434
00:30:56,668 --> 00:31:00,297
After Lucy gets here
and we say, "surprise."

435
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:02,932
So you have to assume
surprise position.

436
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,772
Should we rehearse it
one more time?

437
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,409
Assume the surprise position.

438
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,939
Annie was supposed to warn us.

439
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:15,009
Brad, hit the light.

440
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:19,946
Surprise!

441
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,652
It's not her.

442
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,684
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

443
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:25,753
I'm Margaret Calgrove..

444
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:28,129
Department of
Child and Family Services.

445
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,100
We met at the police station.

446
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,602
Put the present there.

447
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:33,729
You have to hurry,
because Lucy's coming.

448
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,239
Come on, hide with us.

449
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:36,900
Come on, over here.

450
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,810
Annie said Lucy's coming up
the stairs right now.

451
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:47,750
So you have to assume
the surprise position.

452
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:49,117
I bet she already knows.

453
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,952
Why are you being
a party pooper?

454
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,457
She's coming now.

455
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:55,482
You have to assume
the surprise position.

456
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:58,257
Don't touch me.
I've got cooties!

457
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,627
It's contagious!

458
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:02,497
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your hands off him.

459
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:03,501
What are you doing
touching my kid?

460
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,265
- Surprise!
- Leave him alone!

461
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:09,068
Happy birthday.

462
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,472
Daddy?

463
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:11,736
You don't
have to call him Daddy.

464
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,176
She said you're not
her real father anyway.

465
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:16,772
She said she was adopted.

466
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,414
Lucy!

467
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,085
Given the fact
that the father..

468
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,356
was arrested
for solicitation..

469
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,158
couldn't control
his emotions..

470
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,324
endangering other children.

471
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:38,962
No, you can't!
It's her birthday!

472
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,234
Ms. Calgrove also cites..

473
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:44,265
Mr. Dawson's mental delays
which raise serious questions..

474
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,675
about his ability
to properly parent.

475
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,440
Run!

476
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,175
I find at this time..

477
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,877
it's not in the best interest of
the child to remain in the home.

478
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,578
And I order her detained..

479
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:58,077
until a formal
jurisdictional hearing.

480
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:00,614
Mr. Dawson.

481
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,423
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

482
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:10,162
I wanted to make it
a really special surprise party.

483
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:14,035
So I went, and I got plates
at the Pic 'n' Save..

484
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:19,203
in yellow and in pink..
Like a princess.

485
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:21,735
And then I went
to the toy store..

486
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,045
and I got balloons
with the helium in them.

487
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,311
- Mr. Dawson?
- Yeah.

488
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:30,754
It sounds like you gave her
such a lovely party.

489
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,552
Yes, I'm sure it was.

490
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,993
Right now, I want to talk to you
about your legal rights.

491
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:38,859
OK. There's room
at this table..

492
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:42,264
if anybody wants
to sit next to me.

493
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,165
I just want to talk to you
about your legal rights..

494
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:48,298
so if you have not already
retained legal counsel..

495
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,638
the court will appoint
someone for you..

496
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:54,907
to present your case
on January 5. OK?

497
00:33:57,882 --> 00:33:59,679
That's a month from now..

498
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:03,279
so I come back here
in one month with Lucy.

499
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:07,849
No, Mr. Dawson. You will have
monitored visits..

500
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:12,556
two times a week
for two hours.

501
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:16,055
And now we're moving on
to 4-D, Parker..

502
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:18,729
What do you mean?

503
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:24,231
You will see Lucy
two times a week for two hours.

504
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:27,608
Why isn't Lucy
going home with me?

505
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:31,911
I want her to go home with me.

506
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,817
Not today.
Thank you, Mr. Dawson.

507
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:38,812
4-D. Parker vs. Van Wert.
Thank you.

508
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,724
Of course the judge
picked the lawyer.

509
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,252
For God's sake,
put it together.

510
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:47,025
She's the one who took
Lucy away from you..

511
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:49,397
so it's time that
you get your own lawyer now.

512
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:51,334
You guys think I'm guilty?

513
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:53,837
- No, Sam.
- You didn't kill anybody.

514
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:55,601
I miss Lucy, Sam.

515
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,335
Me, too.

516
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,002
You need
a personal injury lawyer..

517
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,807
because you have been
personally injured.

518
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:05,646
When Dustin Hoffman
was trying to keep Billy..

519
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,651
from going back
to Meryl Streep..

520
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,119
his lawyer told him that
it would cost him $15,000..

521
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:11,554
and that's if we win.

522
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:14,649
- $15,000!
- And that's if we win.

523
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:17,354
Don't worry about money, Sam.

524
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:22,230
Get the best. Century City.
Here. Look at that.

525
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,894
Let me show you
what it looks like.

526
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:26,768
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, and Williams.

527
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,999
This is one of the best ads
I've seen in the Yellow Pages.

528
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,271
So maybe we're going to win.

529
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:37,441
- We're gonna win.
- One of the best ads I've seen.

530
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:39,609
With Rothman and Glenn
and Harrison and Williams..

531
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,448
we're gonna win.

532
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:47,750
Did Fred Kimble call?
I'm already 20 minutes late.

533
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,522
What did Michelle Kresge say?
Was she defensive?

534
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:51,961
That's ridiculous.

535
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,691
What happened with my car?
Because it wasn't my fault.

536
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,995
Oh, I know.

537
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,962
This is Mr. Dawson.

538
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,837
There was some confusion
with the temp last week..

539
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,273
How do you do? I'm Sam.

540
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,277
Mr. Dawson. It's a pleasure.

541
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:08,779
Since somebody made a mistake..

542
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,576
unfortunately
we only have a little time.

543
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:13,015
Hold my calls
unless it's my kid.

544
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,187
That's a wonderful choice.

545
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:20,186
Can we get you something
to drink?

546
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:21,852
Is it for free?

547
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:29,164
- My treat.
- OK. Thank you.

548
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,668
Yeah, I would like
a glass of milk.

549
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:34,399
Did you get that, Patricia?

550
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,430
Yes.

551
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:40,677
And Lucy
had an ice cream cake..

552
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:44,307
with pink flowers..
not white..

553
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:47,750
and she likes
cherry vanilla because..

554
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:49,946
If that's Jake Hiller,
put him through.

555
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,515
Jake, no.

556
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,082
So I got cherry..

557
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:57,594
- Your son's on line two.
- Did you get that?

558
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,119
Tell him to hold
for just one second.

559
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:00,721
I have to go. The what?

560
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,233
Melted together as orange.

561
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:05,793
No. Have a nice weekend.

562
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:08,738
And Brad wanted
a princess on top..

563
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,606
with little pink shoes.

564
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,042
I think there's a..

565
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:14,738
I think your son's on line two.

566
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:18,078
Oh, my God. Willy?

567
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:20,107
Patricia, get Willy back.

568
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,415
Well, keep trying.

569
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:26,913
Mr. Dawson, quite bluntly,
you can't afford to hire me.

570
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:31,986
Yeah, because I make
$8.00 an hour at Starbucks.

571
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,726
Per hour. It's an hourly rate.

572
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,495
I could pay you per hour.

573
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,229
Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry,
but I have..

574
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:42,831
I have to be in court in
eight minutes with the Kresges.

575
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:46,901
But good luck to you.
Don't give up.

576
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm not giving up.
Where am I going?

577
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,313
I can show you out.

578
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:56,118
Patricia, where are my keys?

579
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:59,021
This is her
on her first birthday.

580
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:02,390
December 6.
That's her birthday.

581
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:04,793
And this is Lucy two years old.

582
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:08,959
This is Lucy seven years old
on her birthday..

583
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,332
the day they took her away.

584
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:12,336
Your son's on line two.

585
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,032
Willy, hi.

586
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,974
Jackson told Wyatt he wasn't
my best friend anymore.

587
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:20,307
Could we possibly talk
about this when I get home?

588
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:25,373
Willy? Come on, you're
not gonna talk to me now?

589
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:29,716
I bought a bag of your favorite
lemonade jellybeans.

590
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:47,870
God!

591
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:50,499
I hate that stupid coffee table.

592
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,975
How many times, Patricia,
have I told you..

593
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:55,241
to get rid of
that crappy coffee table?

594
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:04,351
It's OK.

595
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:19,560
You have a son, Rita Rothman
Glenn Harrison Williams.

596
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:23,472
If they took him
away from you..

597
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,442
would you do what
Robert said and got..

598
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:29,708
the fastest-talking,
four-name lawyer you could?

599
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,717
I may know someone who handles
these kinds of cases.

600
00:39:35,753 --> 00:39:39,621
I'll see if she can help you.
Leave your number with Patricia.

601
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,591
Your therapist
is on line one.

602
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,856
Tell him you can't find me.

603
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:50,593
I'm gonna leave my number
with you, OK?

604
00:39:54,772 --> 00:40:00,733
I'm ready to make coffee.
Decaf nonfat latte.

605
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:05,806
It's coffee up to here,
nonfat milk up to here..

606
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,787
and chocolate
or cinnamon sprinkles.

607
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,380
That's pretty good, Sam.
I'll think about it.

608
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:14,914
We'll come up with a promotion
that's good for you.

609
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,890
But I know what that means.

610
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:27,166
When I worked as a janitor
at the La Reina Theater..

611
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:31,073
I asked Mr. Jenkins
if I could be a ticket-taker..

612
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,942
and he said
he would think about it.

613
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:38,108
And Jimmy Peters got the job.

614
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:41,118
And he let his friends
in for free.

615
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:42,949
I promise you, Sam.

616
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:44,147
We'll come up
with something for you.

617
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:45,985
You have my word.

618
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,287
Word, words, words.
I need more than that.

619
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:51,318
I need to make coffee.

620
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:54,229
I need to pay my lawyer.

621
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,598
I am celebrating
congratulations to us.

622
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:01,833
These are the moments.
Good night.

623
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,146
By any chance,
did you call your friend?

624
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:16,278
The one
that does this kind of work?

625
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:21,450
I don't have her number anymore.

626
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:24,017
We lost touch.

627
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:26,723
Yeah, that happens.

628
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:28,755
If you get
back in touch with her..

629
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,292
and you find her number,
will you call me?

630
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:34,270
I'm just in the middle of..

631
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:36,205
It's a special..

632
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,332
Yeah, I'll call you.

633
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,469
OK. Yeah.

634
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:41,637
Is that the new janitor?

635
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,479
Oh, it's a..

636
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:47,313
a case I'm helping out with..

637
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,285
sort of a pro bono thing.

638
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:52,686
What's that supposed to mean?

639
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:56,853
Cracker went down
the wrong pipe.

640
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:59,021
You think I don't do pro bono?

641
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:01,793
Have another glass, please.
On me.

642
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,132
No, on you. It's pro bono.

643
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,103
I do pro bono.

644
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,504
I know. You go, girl.

645
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,168
You just spread that love.
Spread it all around.

646
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:26,780
Stop. Driver, stop the bus.

647
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,951
Stop the bus.

648
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:41,797
Wait for me. I got it.

649
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,808
Lucy, he's an hour
and 45 minutes late.

650
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:47,333
You'll only have
a few minutes left.

651
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:50,973
You can leave if you want.

652
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,210
- Lucy!
- Daddy?

653
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,344
I'm here. I'm here.

654
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:57,513
It's Daddy. I told you!

655
00:42:57,555 --> 00:42:58,647
Oh, shoot!

656
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,283
I spilled it all. Hi.

657
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,891
And guess her name is.

658
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,626
Her name is Rita Harrison.

659
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,998
Lovely Rita Meter Maid?

660
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:14,766
Yeah, and Harrison like George.

661
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,274
Is she going to help us?

662
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:28,376
She can't help us..

663
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,979
but if she ever finds
her friend's number..

664
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:36,483
who does this kind of cases,
she's gonna call me.

665
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:42,493
You've grown.

666
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:43,966
Have I?

667
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:46,469
Yeah. Because your ears
are bigger..

668
00:43:46,504 --> 00:43:48,495
and your eyes are older.

669
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:59,339
Guess what I'm gonna get
when I get my next paycheck?

670
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,681
I'm gonna get
an answering machine..

671
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:04,552
because then you can call
and leave a message.

672
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:08,388
You can say,
"Hi. This is Lucy."

673
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:10,360
We can't afford
an answering machine.

674
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:13,522
Yeah, because
I'm gonna get a big promotion..

675
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:16,294
a promotion that's big.

676
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,461
They'll let you make coffee?

677
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:23,303
Always set
your dreams high, Lucy.

678
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:28,040
I'm sorry, Daddy.

679
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,842
It was all my fault.

680
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,611
Don't say that.

681
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:36,347
It was not all your fault,
so don't say that.

682
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:40,153
I wouldn't want
any daddy but you.

683
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:48,624
Did you hear that?

684
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,100
I said I was sorry!

685
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,729
I said I didn't want
any daddy but him.

686
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:56,433
Why don't you write that down?

687
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:02,706
Let me make sure
that I'm clear here.

688
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:04,874
Are you telling me
neither of you..

689
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:06,405
wants custody of your child?

690
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,884
He has created a monster.

691
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:10,580
He is exactly like him.

692
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,419
Here we go again.
It's the same old story.

693
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,618
The tears and the tears.

694
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:18,093
Oh, my God.
Are you really..

695
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:19,596
You cannot stand emotion.

696
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,292
I'm right here with you.
Excuse me.

697
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,059
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:29,300
Hi! Did you get in touch
with your friend?

699
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,900
Because I need legal advice now.

700
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:34,706
You said
I couldn't afford you..

701
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:37,077
so I have to talk to somebody.

702
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:47,822
That's why I told you
I would be your lawyer pro bono.

703
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:52,557
I don't understand
exactly what you mean.

704
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:55,156
You told me
that you would be my lawyer?

705
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:56,325
Sam, I'm your..

706
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:59,302
Golly, because
I must have misunderstood.

707
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,429
I told you that
when we first met.

708
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:04,236
You said
you would be my lawyer?

709
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:05,902
Yes. Sam..

710
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:09,674
You're my lawyer!

711
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,578
That's right. I'm your lawyer.

712
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:13,583
And I can pay you per hour.

713
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:15,642
- No, no, no.
- On the hour.

714
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:17,517
Pro bono. It's free.

715
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:21,316
My lawyer for free.

716
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:23,622
Now, you.. God.

717
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:27,688
Thank you.
Because I have to get this.

718
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,427
It's "Urgent, open immediately"

719
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:32,527
For my lawyer for free!

720
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:37,169
They want to have you
evaluated by a shrink..

721
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:41,110
and your appointment is today!
At 3:00.

722
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:42,669
It's today! It's now.

723
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:44,647
I don't actually
want to go to a shrink.

724
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:46,240
Sam, you don't actually
have a choice.

725
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,341
It's court-ordered.

726
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:50,842
The lady in your office
is crying.

727
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,318
Patricia,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

728
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,690
Can you get him out of here?

729
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:59,025
Don't feel bad.

730
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:00,997
Sam, come with me.

731
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:02,430
Don't feel bad.

732
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:04,058
We'll get through this.
Will you excuse us?

733
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:08,595
It's their turn now, not yours.
Theirs.

734
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,039
If you leave now,
you can make this..

735
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:12,599
and you have to make it.

736
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:16,272
But I have to take
the number 13..

737
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:20,977
downtown Wilshire express
to Grand Street..

738
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:26,456
then I transfer to the number 34
at Cesar Chavez Avenue..

739
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,152
because that used
to be Brooklyn Avenue..

740
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:32,026
and my grandfather
had a bakery on it..

741
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:33,962
when it was Brooklyn Avenue.

742
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:37,331
I don't think I can get there
at the time I'm supposed to.

743
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:41,361
Go, for Christ sakes!
Green means "Go."

744
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:43,771
I don't like to go to shrinks.

745
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:46,002
You and me both.

746
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:48,136
Right or left?

747
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:51,012
Which is it gonna be,
bonehead?

748
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,538
Right turn ahead.

749
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:53,607
Right on Vermont?

750
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,915
That'll be another 20 minutes,
you idiot!

751
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:01,786
Did your mommy make you
go to a shrink, too?

752
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:05,317
No. Well, sort of.

753
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:07,262
I spent the whole time
talking about her.

754
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:09,960
Well, that's nice.

755
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:14,029
- Office.
- Dialing home.

756
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:16,539
Office! God damn it!

757
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:21,104
You're going much faster
than everybody else.

758
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:24,410
I wonder if you noticed that,
because I noticed that.

759
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:26,245
Go!

760
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:38,120
No more shrinks.

761
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:41,529
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dawson..

762
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:45,126
but if I were you, I wouldn't
waste any more of my time.

763
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:50,903
Sorry, Mrs. Dawson, but I think
you should put Sam in a home.

764
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:54,240
Sam in a home.

765
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:56,371
Mr. Dawson,
you do understand..

766
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,779
that since I'm a
court-appointed psychologist..

767
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:01,842
the traditional client-therapist
confidentiality..

768
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:04,183
will be waived.

769
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:05,916
Do you understand that?

770
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:08,254
That the confidentiality
will be waived.

771
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:15,625
Good. Let's begin.

772
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:20,228
I went to a doctor one time
who had an orange office.

773
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:25,402
All the walls
were painted orange.

774
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:29,003
Do you know her?
She has an orange office..

775
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:31,446
and she's in Van Nuys.

776
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,382
I wanted to ask you about Lucy.

777
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:34,714
How old is she now?

778
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:37,983
She's six. She's seven.

779
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:40,456
She just had a birthday,
I think.

780
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:44,688
How was that party?

781
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:49,962
"Before you read
your message.."

782
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,969
"press the red button
for record."

783
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:56,905
Let's start with the O.G.M.

784
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,373
What? I don't know.
I don't think it's working.

785
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:06,212
I think it's because
it's a used machine.

786
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,913
It's not used. It's pre-owned.

787
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:13,047
A guy bought it
for his auto shop..

788
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,751
and then he got a secretary.

789
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,350
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

790
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:18,918
That's a good code.

791
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:22,693
I can remember that.. 1, 2, 3.

792
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:23,995
4, 5, 6.

793
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:26,002
7, 8, 9.

794
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:28,266
9, 10, 11, 12.

795
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:29,738
Quick. You're recording.

796
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:33,576
Hi. This is..

797
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,511
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not home.

798
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:39,015
No, you really
don't want to say that..

799
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:42,985
because you don't want
to tell them you're not home.

800
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,682
- Then I'm lying.
- Everybody's lying.

801
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:47,782
Sam, you are on the air.

802
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:50,123
Hi. How are you?

803
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,857
Maybe you sound
a little bit too excited.

804
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:57,890
And maybe you might think
about lowering your voice..

805
00:50:57,935 --> 00:50:59,698
so maybe Lucy can hear you.

806
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:01,261
Go, Sam.

807
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:07,039
Hi, Lucy.
Thank you for calling me.

808
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:09,568
That was good.

809
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:12,548
But did I sound like
a good father?

810
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:17,646
But it's an outgoing message..

811
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:21,283
so I think you need to sound
a little more outgoing.

812
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:24,419
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not ho.. Shoot.

813
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,759
Hi. This is Sam!

814
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:32,235
I think you should
sound like a normal person.

815
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:35,432
From the heart.

816
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:37,064
From the heart.

817
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:40,133
This is.. Hello.
Thank you for calling.

818
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,042
This is Sam.

819
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,410
Wow.

820
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:47,781
I feel that was a very touching
moment right there.

821
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,911
I felt that one.

822
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,922
High-five.

823
00:51:54,124 --> 00:51:57,890
We have a lot to go over,
and I have five minutes.

824
00:51:57,928 --> 00:52:00,522
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, Williams..

825
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,259
is on the 29th floor.

826
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:03,823
That's 29 floors up..

827
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:06,631
and the elevators
are actually over there.

828
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:10,162
Keep up.
Got to do my cardio. 120.

829
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:12,266
Got to get to 125
to make it count.

830
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:15,506
I need that list of names
from you..

831
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:17,537
people who can testify
that you're a good father..

832
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:18,878
despite your handicap.

833
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:22,374
Just my husband.
I didn't mean your handicap.

834
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:24,444
I meant your disability.

835
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:27,150
The fact that you're retarded..
that's not the right word.

836
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:28,715
I don't know what to call you.

837
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:33,127
Sam. You can call me Sam.

838
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:37,725
All right! Hello. Hi, Todd.

839
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:40,328
I was out of range.
How you doing?

840
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:44,570
What do you mean,
what's that supposed to mean?

841
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:49,209
You're supposed
to be taking him to karate.

842
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:52,409
Are you eating?
No, I will not hold on.

843
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:53,575
Go pick him up.

844
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:56,518
I can't hear you.
I'm in the car.

845
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:58,953
They put you through to me.

846
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:01,253
I'm losing you.

847
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:06,059
What makes Sam a good father?

848
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:10,556
The important thing is for
Sam to be a very good father..

849
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:13,161
is to be there for her..

850
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:19,540
because the smarter Lucy is,
the smarter she will get.

851
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:24,377
So what makes Sam a good father?

852
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:27,178
Lucy's first word was "Annie.."

853
00:53:27,217 --> 00:53:31,210
and her fifth word was "Joe."

854
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:32,620
And I'm Joe.

855
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:39,495
Sam is a very good father..

856
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,022
because he likes green things..

857
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,795
Like I like green things
very much.

858
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:47,167
I like green peas.

859
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,604
My cousin Luke works for
the organization..

860
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,904
environmental organization
Greenpeace..

861
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:54,001
and they like
to save the whales.

862
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:55,534
I like whales.

863
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:58,013
"Moby Dick" was one of my
all-time favorite classics..

864
00:53:58,048 --> 00:53:59,276
by Herman Melville.

865
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,784
Wait.
Why are you recording this?

866
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:03,877
It's often necessary..

867
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:05,479
You didn't say anything
about a tape recorder.

868
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:08,491
- Who's listening?
- Me.

869
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:10,686
What is that supposed to mean?

870
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:11,887
Nothing.

871
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:14,454
Who are you really?

872
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,394
I need to speak
to my lawyer now.

873
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,954
I don't think you realize
what you're up against.

874
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:44,256
We have to be in court
in three days..

875
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:45,989
and we don't have
a decent witness.

876
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:48,429
Now, you've got to know
someone who can testify..

877
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:49,796
who's been to college..

878
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,267
or has a degree of some kind..

879
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:55,294
or has some way
of expressing themselves..

880
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:58,172
that will make the court
believe you deserve..

881
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,175
to get your daughter back.

882
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:02,770
I need coffee. Big, tall.

883
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:04,804
Tall is the smallest.

884
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,372
Yeah, of course.

885
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,316
Once you think of this person..

886
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:13,483
and there has to be one person,
call me at work.

887
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:16,424
Because
I'm going back there now..

888
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,988
to my seven other cases. What?

889
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:24,489
Mrs. Robeck. I'm on the 405.

890
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,001
The traffic is horrible.

891
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:28,630
You want this
for here or to go?

892
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:30,435
Dorothy?

893
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:32,965
Oh, no. No.

894
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:36,138
Tow truck is towing your car.

895
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:38,010
Son of a bitch.

896
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:39,845
It's towing your car.

897
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:44,013
No, wait! Stop!
It's my car. Stop.

898
00:55:44,054 --> 00:55:46,386
But, Annie, it's just one day.

899
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:50,154
And Lucy needs you
because you went to college..

900
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:54,562
and you can
give the right answers.

901
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,441
And we can't lose her.

902
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:11,746
I'd make it worse for you.

903
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:14,250
I can't do it.

904
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:17,117
Don't you think I would
if I could?

905
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:24,122
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Phillip McNeilly.

906
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:31,864
Hi, guys.

907
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:33,631
Hi, Sam.

908
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,763
Boy, you did a wonderful job
making those signs.

909
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:38,604
You're welcome, Sam.
Good luck, buddy.

910
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:40,200
Go get 'em.

911
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:44,376
Although,
at her birthday party..

912
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:48,475
I believe her true feelings
about her father were revealed.

913
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:50,884
Objection.
"True feelings revealed"?

914
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,980
Your Honor,
Ms. Davis is an expert..

915
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:55,218
appointed by the court
for her opinion.

916
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:56,350
I'll allow it.

917
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:58,327
Then every child who rages..

918
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:00,352
because they
didn't get to stay up..

919
00:57:00,397 --> 00:57:02,422
that extra hour to watch TV..

920
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:03,956
Any child who said
they hated their parents..

921
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,262
because
they didn't want a bath..

922
00:57:05,302 --> 00:57:07,270
would be a prime candidate
for foster care?

923
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,932
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

924
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:12,066
I think they want you to stop.

925
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,304
Really?

926
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:16,403
Thank you, Sam.

927
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:18,846
Yeah, OK.
Brad's wearing a tie today..

928
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:21,908
and I think the tie
looks wonderful on you, Brad.

929
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:23,817
You look great, too.

930
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:29,649
There's a lady..
she's writing everything down.

931
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:32,753
Watch what you say.

932
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:35,663
I have the best friends
in the whole world.

933
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:39,328
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

934
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:42,805
Ms. Davis, I assume
in your therapy session..

935
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:46,502
that Mr. Dawson extolled
his parenting ability.

936
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,101
On the contrary.

937
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:54,209
Mr. Dawson admitted
he felt very confused at times.

938
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,310
Actually,
that he felt terrified..

939
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:59,789
that he'd made and would
continue to make..

940
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:03,691
and I can quote here..

941
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:06,059
"Huge mistakes,
huge mistakes.."

942
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:07,563
"mistakes that are huge."

943
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:11,795
Thank you.
No further questions.

944
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:13,393
You're a mother,
aren't you, Ms. Davis?

945
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:15,336
Yes, I am.

946
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:19,433
Would it be fair to say that..

947
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:22,843
as a parent, you've been
confused from time to time..

948
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:25,177
possibly overwhelmed
on occasion..

949
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:26,648
even though
you're a wonderful mother?

950
00:58:26,683 --> 00:58:29,174
If Ms. Davis
has never had a moment..

951
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:30,481
where she's been confused
as a mother..

952
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,353
it would bias
her expert opinion.

953
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:36,223
I know that I have
many moments as a parent..

954
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:38,784
where I felt
I've made huge mistakes.

955
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:40,524
Objection.

956
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:42,589
Get to the relevant point,
Ms. Harrison.

957
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,691
The point is, you've never
had those moments..

958
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,258
have you, Ms. Davis?

959
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:49,431
Moments that every parent
I've ever spoken to has.

960
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:52,930
Moments where the task is
so unbelievably challenging..

961
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:54,841
that you feel retarded..

962
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,743
disabled in some way.

963
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,238
Moments where everyone seems
to have the key but you.

964
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:01,807
Really, to be honest..

965
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:03,717
Yes or no?
Please answer the question.

966
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:05,778
I didn't really
feel right now..

967
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,255
Let me rephrase the question.

968
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,554
- When your son O.D.'d..
- Objection.

969
00:59:09,593 --> 00:59:11,959
If Ms. Davis didn't feel
she had made mistakes..

970
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:13,223
mistakes that were huge..

971
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:15,458
it might bias her opinion
toward Mr. Dawson.

972
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:17,227
I'll allow it.

973
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:20,395
Ms. Davis,
when your son O.D.'d..

974
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:24,874
did you feel that you
might have made mistakes..

975
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:26,842
mistakes that were huge?

976
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,171
Yes.

977
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:35,210
Yes.

978
00:59:35,252 --> 00:59:37,152
No further questions.

979
00:59:41,491 --> 00:59:43,425
You made her cry.

980
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,518
I got lucky.

981
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:46,995
Oh, no.
That's not nice to make her cry.

982
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,156
Only in there.

983
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:51,998
And your secretary
when you hated your desk.

984
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,669
Green and yellow
on the same plate.

985
00:59:56,706 --> 00:59:59,470
Could you separate
the lima beans..

986
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:01,443
from the corn, please?

987
01:00:01,478 --> 01:00:04,242
Sam, don't be impossible.

988
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:06,841
Can I have
the spinach omelette..

989
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:09,010
only egg whites,
no fat, no oil, no butter.

990
01:00:09,052 --> 01:00:11,077
- And extra mushrooms?
- Absolutely.

991
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:15,122
My treat.

992
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:16,819
- No, no, no..
- My treat.

993
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,350
My pro bono.

994
01:00:18,395 --> 01:00:22,456
That means she doesn't
have to pay. I pay.

995
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:28,371
Sam, do you really
want to get this..

996
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:31,431
or are you just trying to..

997
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:34,932
trying to act like a..

998
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:38,471
What do you mean?

999
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:43,684
You know, like.. Never mind.

1000
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,711
I'm a grownup.

1001
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:48,019
I didn't say that.

1002
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:49,389
You think what they think.

1003
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:52,827
You're my lawyer,
and you think what they think?

1004
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:54,329
I don't have a chance.

1005
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:57,231
I think..

1006
01:00:57,267 --> 01:00:58,962
you deserve a fair trial.

1007
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,993
Do you think what they think?

1008
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:04,370
Sam can't order food
or Sam can't pay a check.

1009
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:06,307
Sam can't take care of Lucy?

1010
01:01:06,343 --> 01:01:09,005
It doesn't matter what I think.
It matters that we win.

1011
01:01:09,045 --> 01:01:10,740
It matters what you think.

1012
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,874
It doesn't matter to them
what I think.

1013
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:16,351
It matters to me!

1014
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:20,255
It matters to me!

1015
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:32,128
$14.33.
That's five ones..

1016
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:38,498
Two quarters. 14.33.

1017
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:41,032
Five ones and two quarters.

1018
01:01:46,516 --> 01:01:51,112
And 17 cents less than 20.

1019
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:58,283
Dr. Blake, what would you say
kept you going..

1020
01:01:58,328 --> 01:02:01,855
the 12 years
you were in medical school?

1021
01:02:01,898 --> 01:02:04,560
Caffeine and doughnuts..

1022
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:08,401
and my mother's belief in me.

1023
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:10,269
I wish I had a mother like that.

1024
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:11,500
She must have been smart.

1025
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,441
She had great instincts.

1026
01:02:13,476 --> 01:02:16,968
Do you happen to know
what her I.Q. was?

1027
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:21,917
In the lower ranges.
About 70.

1028
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:25,387
So your mother..

1029
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:27,890
this woman who had
the mind of a 9-year-old..

1030
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:30,722
had the wisdom to recognize
you would be a great doctor.

1031
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,992
Yes. I can't say
it was always easy..

1032
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:39,400
but she taught me the things
they can't teach.

1033
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:42,405
Patience and compassion.

1034
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:44,805
Traits most doctors
have in spades.

1035
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:46,706
Mr. Dawson.

1036
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:50,144
You've become
a wonderful girl..

1037
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,909
and we're proud of you.

1038
01:02:51,948 --> 01:02:56,317
Lucy will be, too.
She'll be wonderful.

1039
01:02:56,352 --> 01:02:58,445
He's very enthusiastic.
Thank you, Doctor.

1040
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,581
No further questions.
Come on, come on.

1041
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:03,353
How'd you get through medical
school? Where'd you live?

1042
01:03:03,393 --> 01:03:05,020
We lived with
my mother's parents.

1043
01:03:05,061 --> 01:03:09,020
- Grandma and Grandpa.
- Yes.

1044
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:10,760
Would it be fair to say
that Grandma and Grandpa..

1045
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,462
were of normal intelligence?

1046
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:14,868
And so,
would it be fair to say..

1047
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:17,065
that Grandma and Grandpa
of normal intelligence..

1048
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,335
had the real responsibilities?

1049
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:22,868
Objection. Mr. Turner's
mother-in-law lives with him.

1050
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:25,676
Motion to strike. Irrelevant,
immaterial, and immature.

1051
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:27,205
I warn you, Ms. Harrison..

1052
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,185
stick to the relevant
issues of the case.

1053
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,619
Your Honor, the relevancy
is that every parent..

1054
01:03:31,654 --> 01:03:33,121
has a right
to a support system.

1055
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:34,487
I'm not talking about
the rights of the parents.

1056
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:36,321
I'm talking about
the rights of the child.

1057
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:38,788
Please let the record show..

1058
01:03:38,828 --> 01:03:40,090
Excuse me. Your Honor..

1059
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,791
I'm talking about entrusting
an 8-year-old's welfare..

1060
01:03:41,831 --> 01:03:44,231
in the hands of someone
whose record shows..

1061
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,633
has been diagnosed
with autistic tendencies..

1062
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:47,795
mental retardation..

1063
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,397
Objection. Move to
strike that from the record.

1064
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,567
It is clear that
one's intellectual capacity..

1065
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:55,169
has no bearing
on their ability to love.

1066
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:57,771
Your Honor, would you
please instruct counsel..

1067
01:03:57,814 --> 01:04:00,612
to proceed with
a modicum of sensitivity?

1068
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,083
I'm very sensitive..

1069
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:03,676
especially when
I see someone like you..

1070
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,813
walk in here and try
to give meaning to your life..

1071
01:04:05,855 --> 01:04:07,083
by screwing up somebody else's.

1072
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:09,057
That's enough. Ms. Harrison,
approach the bench.

1073
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:10,525
My mother raised me..

1074
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,687
Tearing apart a family
is truly noble work, Mr. Turner.

1075
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:14,663
That's enough.

1076
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:16,187
This is an award for you
at some luncheon..

1077
01:04:16,232 --> 01:04:17,859
but I'm here every day.

1078
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:19,664
You win, you're out the door.

1079
01:04:19,702 --> 01:04:24,105
You know who I see come back?
The child.

1080
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,574
Only this time, it's too late.

1081
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:30,306
So am I sensitive?
Yeah, I'm a little sensitive.

1082
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:32,337
You can't even touch that area.

1083
01:04:32,382 --> 01:04:36,318
Your Honor,
please let the record show..

1084
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:38,411
my mother raised me.

1085
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:49,029
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt

1086
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:52,159
His name is my name, too

1087
01:04:52,202 --> 01:04:55,535
Whenever we go out,
the people always shout

1088
01:04:55,572 --> 01:04:58,234
They say, "John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt"

1089
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,605
Excuse me. Time is up.

1090
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:09,049
Please, just a little more.

1091
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:11,383
No. I have another case at 2:30.

1092
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:13,753
I need to go to the bathroom.

1093
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:20,428
Daddy!

1094
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:22,192
Daddy!

1095
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:23,460
She said we could
go to the park.

1096
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:26,935
What happened?
What made her change her mind?

1097
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,130
I started
crying in the bathroom..

1098
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:30,298
so she thought
we needed more time.

1099
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:33,503
There's the park.

1100
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:36,808
Let's not get off.
Let's keep going.

1101
01:05:36,846 --> 01:05:40,282
No, Lucy, that would be wrong.

1102
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,250
Tamara's mommy lost her case..

1103
01:05:42,285 --> 01:05:44,583
and she hasn't seen her
in six years.

1104
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:48,216
She had five different mommies,
and one of them hit her.

1105
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:51,125
I would never
let that happen to you.

1106
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,094
That's what
her real mommy said..

1107
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:56,360
and now they won't even
let her talk to her.

1108
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:57,866
Daddy.

1109
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:02,496
It's the only way
to be together.

1110
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:04,369
We'll start a new life..

1111
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:07,968
get new names,
live in a new apartment..

1112
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:10,172
and they'll never find us.

1113
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:07,664
That's Rita. Hi!

1114
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:11,997
It's 3:00 in the morning. Hi!

1115
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,168
What were you thinking?

1116
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:16,007
What were you possibly thinking?

1117
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:17,376
I wanted to be with Lucy.

1118
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:18,880
That's ridiculous!

1119
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:20,678
Willy, stay here with me.

1120
01:07:20,717 --> 01:07:23,515
What could you possibly gain
by kidnapping your kid..

1121
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:24,850
in the middle
of a custody hearing?

1122
01:07:24,887 --> 01:07:26,912
- Lucy told me..
- I don't want to hear it!

1123
01:07:26,956 --> 01:07:28,753
Can you possibly
explain this to me?

1124
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:32,454
- Who is the goddamn parent?
- Me.

1125
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:34,622
Willy, stay in the hallway.

1126
01:07:34,664 --> 01:07:36,564
I am deeply disturbed by this.

1127
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,898
Lucy, I would have
expected more from you.

1128
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:42,734
I can imagine
what you're thinking..

1129
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:44,137
but I ask you this..

1130
01:07:44,173 --> 01:07:45,697
What parent
in their right mind..

1131
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:49,007
seeing their child's pain,
their yearning for contact..

1132
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:50,945
wouldn't take them
in an effort to comfort them?

1133
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,277
You need to understand..

1134
01:07:52,315 --> 01:07:54,283
something very important
about the father..

1135
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:55,750
Yes, and if I were you..

1136
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:58,447
I'd look at my conscience
long and hard..

1137
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:00,319
before I tried
to use this in court.

1138
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:02,415
Is that a threat?

1139
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:07,828
No! It's.. a plea.

1140
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:09,525
Give him a break.

1141
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:14,798
Just give him one goddamn break.

1142
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:20,571
Lucy, say your good-byes.
It's time to go.

1143
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:24,841
Willy, it's time to go home.

1144
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:30,384
Goddamn it, Willy!

1145
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:35,386
Please don't fire us.

1146
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:37,552
It was all my idea.

1147
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:40,824
Please don't.

1148
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:42,125
Please.

1149
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:52,138
Raise your right hand.

1150
01:08:52,175 --> 01:08:54,905
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth..

1151
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:57,378
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1152
01:08:57,413 --> 01:08:59,176
So help me God.

1153
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,120
I heard you turned seven
this year.

1154
01:09:06,155 --> 01:09:07,622
That's pretty exciting.

1155
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:10,490
Everybody gets older.
It's not that big a deal.

1156
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:13,290
What'd you get
for your birthday?

1157
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:15,627
I haven't opened
my presents yet.

1158
01:09:15,665 --> 01:09:18,498
Really? That's odd. Why?

1159
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:24,805
Actually, I opened my presents.

1160
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:28,333
I got the "Help" album,
limited edition.

1161
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:35,644
I'm sorry. I'm very confused.

1162
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:38,620
I thought you didn't
open your presents..

1163
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:40,622
because you ran away
from your own party..

1164
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:43,523
because your best friend
told everyone..

1165
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:44,719
that you said you were adopted.

1166
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,092
I never said that.
Why would I say that?

1167
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:49,029
Why would your friend say that?

1168
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:51,033
Kids lie all the time.

1169
01:09:52,668 --> 01:09:56,627
- Remember you're under oath.
- I know.

1170
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,335
- And you know what that means?
- I do.

1171
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:04,538
Now that we have all agreed
to tell the truth..

1172
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,140
where were you sleeping
last night?

1173
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:11,109
In my bed at the foster home.

1174
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:15,388
If you're not going to
tell the truth, I am.

1175
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:16,789
Your dad kidnapped you
last night.

1176
01:10:16,826 --> 01:10:18,919
- Objection. Kidnapped?
- Sustained.

1177
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:23,625
Young lady,
you have to tell the truth.

1178
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:24,928
You're lying
because you're afraid.

1179
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:26,798
Objection.
He's putting words in her mouth.

1180
01:10:26,836 --> 01:10:28,360
Sustained.

1181
01:10:28,404 --> 01:10:30,565
Please limit yourself
to questions, Mr. Turner.

1182
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:32,699
You have to tell the truth.

1183
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:34,710
Lucy, are you
afraid to tell the truth..

1184
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,575
because you'll hurt
your Daddy's feelings?

1185
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:40,309
Daddy's right here.
You can tell the truth.

1186
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:43,978
Isn't it true
that very deep down inside..

1187
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,285
you know you need much more
than your daddy can give you?

1188
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:00,963
All you need is love.

1189
01:11:06,242 --> 01:11:08,301
Where did she go?

1190
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:14,907
Please, God.

1191
01:11:14,951 --> 01:11:18,352
Please, God.

1192
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:21,982
Please, God.

1193
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:23,582
These responsibilities
include..

1194
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:25,958
busing tables, replenishing
the Sweet 'n Lows..

1195
01:11:25,995 --> 01:11:28,395
sweeping up the place?

1196
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:29,523
Yes.

1197
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:31,430
Aren't these Mr. Dawson's
only responsibilities?

1198
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,901
Because he doesn't have
the mental capacity..

1199
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:38,771
to run a cash register
or even make a cup of coffee.

1200
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:40,105
As a matter of fact..

1201
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:41,541
Sam and I were
discussing a promotion..

1202
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:43,272
we were going to put
into effect next week.

1203
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:46,770
Hooray for me!
Thank you, George.

1204
01:11:46,816 --> 01:11:48,283
Thank you, George.
That's very nice.

1205
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:51,115
After eight years,
Sam can make a cup of coffee..

1206
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,553
and he can certainly
help Lucy with her geometry.

1207
01:11:53,589 --> 01:11:54,556
Objection.

1208
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,320
And when I ask
another question..

1209
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,590
- I answer in one sentence.
- Short and sweet.

1210
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:02,894
Yes. One sentence.
Short and sweet.

1211
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:04,866
Tim Curry was
a sweet transvestite..

1212
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,868
in
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show."

1213
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:09,166
Let's try one word.

1214
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:11,139
Annie!

1215
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:16,076
You're here! You're here!

1216
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:17,909
Susan Sarandon is also
one of my favorite actresses.

1217
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:20,006
Besides being
Lucy's godmother..

1218
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:21,846
aren't you also
her piano teacher?

1219
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:23,476
Yes.

1220
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:25,680
Annie plays the piano
beautifully.

1221
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,689
You really do, Annie.

1222
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:30,556
Sam, it's Annie's turn now.

1223
01:12:30,593 --> 01:12:33,027
And didn't you graduate
magna cum laude..

1224
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:34,893
from the
Juillard School of Music?

1225
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,363
Summa cum laude.

1226
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,562
Excuse me.

1227
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:42,264
Ms. Cassell, in all the time
you've known them..

1228
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:46,604
have you ever questioned
Sam's ability as a father?

1229
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:49,907
- Never.
- Never?

1230
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:52,573
Look at Lucy. She's strong.

1231
01:12:52,615 --> 01:12:55,982
She displays true empathy
for people..

1232
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:58,179
all kinds of people.

1233
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,778
I know that you all think..

1234
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:03,121
she's as smart as she is
despite him..

1235
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:05,593
but it's because of him.

1236
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:07,186
So, what you're saying is..

1237
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:09,424
you don't worry
about Lucy's future.

1238
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:11,126
No. I do.

1239
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:16,705
I..

1240
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:19,902
I worry all the time.

1241
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:26,644
If they take Lucy
away from her father..

1242
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:30,948
they will take away
an enormous piece of her..

1243
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:36,549
and I worry that she will spend
the rest of her life..

1244
01:13:36,592 --> 01:13:40,653
trying to fill that hole.

1245
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:44,397
Thank you, Ms. Cassell.

1246
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:46,128
No further questions.

1247
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:51,097
Thank you for coming here
today, Annie.

1248
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:55,600
You're welcome, Sam.

1249
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:57,305
Can Sam add?

1250
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:59,814
Yes.

1251
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:02,044
What about multiplication?

1252
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:03,483
He's learning.

1253
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:06,852
What does that mean?
He can't multiply two times two?

1254
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:10,518
I don't know about you,
Mr. Turner..

1255
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,959
but my memories of my parents..

1256
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:16,123
have nothing to do with
the times table..

1257
01:14:16,165 --> 01:14:18,633
or with state capitals.

1258
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:21,397
A truck ran into
the state capital building..

1259
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:24,463
and it went on fire
on television.

1260
01:14:24,507 --> 01:14:27,305
I saw that on the news with
the reporter with the toupee..

1261
01:14:27,343 --> 01:14:29,538
and Mr. Turner lost his toupee.

1262
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:32,274
Thank you, Mr. Wali.

1263
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:38,817
I bet
he's knocking on your door..

1264
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:40,185
asking questions all the time.

1265
01:14:40,222 --> 01:14:42,986
Yes. All the time.

1266
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:46,290
Let's see.
The last question..

1267
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:49,661
was whether to use
Biz or Clorox..

1268
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:52,826
to get the grass stains
out of Lucy's soccer uniform.

1269
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:59,204
Eventually,
Lucy will go through puberty.

1270
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:01,539
How much insight or know-how..

1271
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:05,035
will he bring to
those sensitive subjects..

1272
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,775
of a young girl's development?

1273
01:15:06,816 --> 01:15:08,181
I can only imagine how much..

1274
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:10,651
insight and sensitivity
you yourself would bring..

1275
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:12,881
to that delicate area,
Mr. Turner..

1276
01:15:12,922 --> 01:15:14,856
or any father, for that matter.

1277
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:19,089
And you've had plenty
of opportunity..

1278
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:20,152
to observe fathers,
haven't you?

1279
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:21,595
Objection.

1280
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:24,531
The fact that Ms. Cassell
hasn't left her room in..

1281
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:26,694
I don't know
how many years..

1282
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,532
must have some effect
on her perception.

1283
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:32,564
I'll allow it.
Please answer the question.

1284
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:37,437
I have had 28 years
in the real world..

1285
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:40,073
and..

1286
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:43,881
I have been able to observe
all kinds of fathers.

1287
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,615
What about your father?

1288
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:51,917
Ms. Cassell..

1289
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:53,724
since you seem to be
such an expert..

1290
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:55,559
on father-daughter
relationships.

1291
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:11,936
I'm sorry, Ms. Cassell.
I need to hear your response.

1292
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:15,246
What about your father?

1293
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:22,489
What about your father?

1294
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:24,014
Objection to that.

1295
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:25,617
Excuse me, Mr. Dawson. Please.

1296
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:29,324
- Overruled.
- That's overruled.

1297
01:16:29,365 --> 01:16:32,493
Mr. Dawson, please sit down.

1298
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,900
Overruled.

1299
01:16:34,937 --> 01:16:37,405
Mr. Dawson, sit down!

1300
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,408
Annie's father was a meanie.

1301
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:44,742
Sam has his big day
on the stand tomorrow..

1302
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,714
and we need to do
a little bit of work..

1303
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:48,649
so he's as effective
as you were.

1304
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:53,178
I want to be as effective
as you were, Annie.

1305
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:56,089
On the Porsche,
the door handle..

1306
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,958
is a little hidden
by that thingamajig.

1307
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:00,655
So, if you're having
trouble finding it..

1308
01:17:00,696 --> 01:17:02,254
No!

1309
01:17:02,298 --> 01:17:07,565
I think maybe Annie's
not exactly ready to go yet.

1310
01:17:07,603 --> 01:17:09,366
We'll just take our time.

1311
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:14,201
- Home.
- Dialing office.

1312
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:17,906
- Home.
- Dialing office.

1313
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:20,347
Home, god damn it!

1314
01:17:20,382 --> 01:17:22,612
I'm ready now.

1315
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:24,551
Good. Fine.

1316
01:17:24,586 --> 01:17:27,054
Sam, Annie's ready.

1317
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:49,707
Wow!

1318
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,813
Let's work in the den.
It's down here.

1319
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,763
Hey, Willy. Where's your dad?

1320
01:18:14,803 --> 01:18:16,566
Guess.

1321
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:18,129
I don't want to guess.
Where is he?

1322
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:20,607
Where was he last night?

1323
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:22,303
Working. Late.

1324
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:23,709
There. You guessed it.

1325
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:25,839
Did he say who was
supposed to take care of you?

1326
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,611
You. But you said
you were working late, too.

1327
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,675
I am working late.

1328
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:34,781
How was your day?

1329
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:36,814
You have to work. Go work.

1330
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:38,554
How was your..

1331
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:42,220
Hello? Where are you?

1332
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:44,323
I've been waiting here an hour.

1333
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:54,407
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1334
01:18:54,443 --> 01:18:57,037
You were on line two.

1335
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:58,671
You don't sound
like you're on the freeway.

1336
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:08,188
Danger, Will Robinson. Danger.

1337
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:15,629
There you are.

1338
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:18,929
You gonna come see the movie?
It's the best part.

1339
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:21,800
It's getting late.
We better get to work.

1340
01:19:26,308 --> 01:19:27,935
It's time to get ready for bed.

1341
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:33,908
Willy, it's time for bed.

1342
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,151
Our strategy is..

1343
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:41,247
we're aggressively pursuing
a support system.

1344
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:42,621
I'm going to ask you..

1345
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:45,422
"How are you prepared
to help Lucy at school?"

1346
01:19:45,461 --> 01:19:48,362
Let me see. Let me see.

1347
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:50,763
Sam, I told you,
you have to stop saying that.

1348
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,461
It makes you look stupid.

1349
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:56,903
OK, try again.

1350
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,475
You say
you will find her a tutor.

1351
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:01,976
Then I say,
"How will you pay for it?"

1352
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,343
Could you slow down?

1353
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:08,349
Why do you eat so fast?

1354
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:10,351
We have been over this
a million times.

1355
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:12,615
Yeah.

1356
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:15,953
You found her a free
tutoring service at the YWCA.

1357
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:18,585
But I didn't. You did.

1358
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:28,131
Can you grasp the concept of..

1359
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,933
manipulating the truth?

1360
01:20:29,972 --> 01:20:31,439
Not lying.

1361
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:34,909
Just a little tweak
here and there.

1362
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:38,813
No.

1363
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:44,916
You're so lucky.

1364
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:48,354
You get to play with Willy
any time you want.

1365
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:53,053
He doesn't
want to play with me.

1366
01:20:54,963 --> 01:20:57,761
Yes, he does.

1367
01:20:57,799 --> 01:21:00,063
Yes, he does. He does.

1368
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:02,798
He thinks
you don't want to play, maybe.

1369
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:04,863
That's ridiculous.
Of course I do.

1370
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:07,669
Tweak.

1371
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,145
I drove around after work
yesterday till 9:30..

1372
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:15,276
looking for
that frigging Raptor scooter!

1373
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,462
So, what made you harass
that young boy at your house?

1374
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:35,527
I didn't harass that boy,
and you know it, Rita.

1375
01:21:35,571 --> 01:21:39,098
I'm pretending to be Mr. Turner.
Remember?

1376
01:21:45,147 --> 01:21:49,243
If I look at you,
I'm gonna laugh again.

1377
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:56,355
OK, Mr. Turner.

1378
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:58,825
I'm Mr. Turner. All right?

1379
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:02,159
Isn't Lucy already
smarter than you?

1380
01:22:02,197 --> 01:22:04,597
You buried yourself.
You've got to do better.

1381
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:08,626
I kind of think
we're the same smart.

1382
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:09,728
What does that mean?

1383
01:22:09,771 --> 01:22:12,467
I know the bus routes
better than she does.

1384
01:22:12,507 --> 01:22:15,203
How does that make you
the same smart?

1385
01:22:17,446 --> 01:22:19,971
Doesn't every parent
want their kid to be smart?

1386
01:22:20,015 --> 01:22:22,882
That's true,
but the issue here is that..

1387
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:26,479
at the age of seven,
Lucy is smarter than you.

1388
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:31,458
But in some ways,
I'm smarter than she is.

1389
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:33,825
You got to be firm on this.

1390
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:43,402
In some ways, she's..

1391
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:46,305
In some ways,
I'm smarter than her.

1392
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:49,538
In some ways, I'm smarter
than you, Mr. Turner.

1393
01:22:49,578 --> 01:22:53,309
In some ways, I'm smarter
than you, Judge McNeilly.

1394
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:57,045
Whoa. Take it down.

1395
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:06,160
Want some marshmallows?

1396
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:08,822
This is my husband's.
He'll never notice.

1397
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:10,832
He has ten more just like it.

1398
01:23:13,402 --> 01:23:14,630
Try it on.

1399
01:23:16,805 --> 01:23:18,432
Will you look that way?

1400
01:23:18,473 --> 01:23:19,963
In there.

1401
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:29,040
I wasn't exactly sure
how to tie this.

1402
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:31,018
Does it look bad?

1403
01:23:35,757 --> 01:23:38,590
No. Very, very good.

1404
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:47,791
Cross over once.

1405
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:51,795
And loop this around..

1406
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,868
and up inside of the neck.

1407
01:23:56,912 --> 01:24:02,077
And then pull up
on the skinny part.

1408
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:06,214
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1409
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:21,767
Today's your big day, buddy.
Making coffee.

1410
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:30,002
- You ready?
- Thank you, George.

1411
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:31,205
What time
you got to be in court?

1412
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:35,148
I have to be
on the stand at 2:00.

1413
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:39,916
Two venti Caramel Macchiatos.
That's a wonderful choice.

1414
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:44,153
Two cappuccinos
and a Hazelnut Frappuccino.

1415
01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:46,752
Two Orange Mocha Chip
Frappucinos.

1416
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:50,162
Two Caramel Frappucinos and a..

1417
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:53,292
I'm sorry. Can you
tell me that one more time?

1418
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:56,099
Everybody's very thirsty today.

1419
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,663
Oh, boy.

1420
01:24:58,707 --> 01:25:01,801
I'm going as fast as I can.
That's the only thing.

1421
01:25:01,843 --> 01:25:03,674
But I don't have all day.

1422
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:06,510
No, just another
couple of minutes.

1423
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:07,572
Not all day.

1424
01:25:07,616 --> 01:25:10,084
You know what? Fine.
Forget it. Thank you.

1425
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:15,618
Sam, I need that tall decaf
vanilla drip right away.

1426
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:19,787
A vanilla drip. Sorry.

1427
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:22,523
Sorry.

1428
01:25:24,232 --> 01:25:27,395
I really have to hurry, though.

1429
01:25:27,436 --> 01:25:29,495
Is that enough? Oh, shoot.

1430
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:31,472
Maybe you want something else.

1431
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:34,634
Sam, I need
a grande soy latte..

1432
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:36,507
but don't put any whipped cream
or foam on it.

1433
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:39,139
I'm just trying to go
really fast.

1434
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:45,250
- Oh, no!
- Sam, you'll be late.

1435
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:51,419
Your Honor, I'm sure
he'll be here any moment.

1436
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:54,486
This is an extremely
important day to Mr. Dawson.

1437
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:56,997
I'm here!

1438
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:58,499
Sorry.

1439
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:01,001
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to confer with my client?

1440
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:02,333
Make it brief, Ms. Harrison.

1441
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,895
What the hell happened to you?

1442
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,965
- I'm late.
- What's that smell? Mint?

1443
01:26:07,008 --> 01:26:10,205
No, no. The blender exploded.

1444
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:11,212
Look at me.

1445
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:13,544
Slow down,
because Lucy needs you.

1446
01:26:13,582 --> 01:26:15,209
Yeah, Lucy needs me.

1447
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,740
We need you, Ms. Harrison.

1448
01:26:16,785 --> 01:26:19,811
I go in there now,
because it's my turn.

1449
01:26:19,855 --> 01:26:21,482
Go sit.

1450
01:26:24,826 --> 01:26:28,159
How will you be able
to pay for private tutoring?

1451
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:33,657
There's a free program
at the YWCA..

1452
01:26:33,702 --> 01:26:37,661
and Lucy can go to that program.

1453
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:39,901
Don't you ever think
it would be better for Lucy..

1454
01:26:39,941 --> 01:26:43,342
if she lived with
a permanent foster family..

1455
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:44,675
and you could visit
whenever you wanted?

1456
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:49,650
No, I don't think
that's a very good idea, see.

1457
01:26:49,684 --> 01:26:54,678
Because the Fosters,
they don't know Lucy.

1458
01:26:54,723 --> 01:26:57,783
And I know Lucy
because I'm her father.

1459
01:26:57,826 --> 01:27:02,024
So, I think
if they want to see her..

1460
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:07,091
then the Fosters can come over
to our house to visit her.

1461
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:10,070
And I'm very firm on this.

1462
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:17,637
I'm very firm on this idea,
because Lucy belongs with me.

1463
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:19,841
Why?

1464
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:33,553
Remember when Paul McCartney
wrote the song "Michelle"..

1465
01:27:33,595 --> 01:27:37,429
and then he only wrote
the first part, Annie said.

1466
01:27:37,465 --> 01:27:40,298
And then he gave
that part to John Lennon..

1467
01:27:40,335 --> 01:27:42,098
and he wrote the part
that said..

1468
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:44,901
"I love you,
I love you, I love you."

1469
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,374
Annie said
that it wouldn't have been..

1470
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,502
the same song without that..

1471
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:52,274
and that's why
the whole world cried..

1472
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:56,910
when the Beatles broke up
on April 10, 1970.

1473
01:28:02,457 --> 01:28:05,017
No further questions.

1474
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:08,960
So, your parents put you
in an institution.

1475
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:14,758
My mother got sick, see..

1476
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:16,862
so I had to go in
an institution..

1477
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,930
when my mother got sick.

1478
01:28:18,974 --> 01:28:21,340
What about your father?
Where was he?

1479
01:28:21,376 --> 01:28:24,868
He was gone when I was born.

1480
01:28:24,913 --> 01:28:28,872
He went away when I was born.

1481
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:32,375
So the people at the institution
were your parents.

1482
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,910
Were they nice to you?

1483
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:37,220
Some, yes. Some, no.

1484
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:38,691
Did they hit you?

1485
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:41,628
Sometimes they did hit me.
Yeah.

1486
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:44,325
Like you hit Lucy's friend
at her birthday party?

1487
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:46,027
Objection. Mistakes
the facts and evidence.

1488
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:47,329
Nobody hit anybody.

1489
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:49,337
I'll rephrase that.
Strong-armed.

1490
01:28:50,905 --> 01:28:54,432
So, who do you look up to?

1491
01:28:54,476 --> 01:28:55,841
Who do you want to be like..

1492
01:28:55,877 --> 01:28:59,210
as a father
when parenting Lucy?

1493
01:28:59,247 --> 01:29:01,477
The head of the institution?
The principal? The warden?

1494
01:29:01,516 --> 01:29:05,748
Not Mr. Whitehead. Not him.

1495
01:29:05,787 --> 01:29:07,550
Then who?

1496
01:29:10,759 --> 01:29:12,021
Who?

1497
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:17,987
Myself.

1498
01:29:18,033 --> 01:29:22,766
I look up to myself as a father.

1499
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:28,037
Mr. Dawson, you have
the capacity of a 7-year-old.

1500
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:30,806
What makes you think you have
the ability to be a father?

1501
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:32,403
Your background, your IQ..

1502
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:34,210
your friends
who can't even testify..

1503
01:29:34,249 --> 01:29:36,717
Objection.
Compound questions.

1504
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:38,446
- Objection!
- Sustained.

1505
01:29:38,486 --> 01:29:40,477
They love Lucy, see.

1506
01:29:40,522 --> 01:29:43,980
Even if Rita didn't think
they were smart enough..

1507
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:46,858
to testify, they love Lucy.

1508
01:29:46,895 --> 01:29:49,455
Yeah. I love Lucy.

1509
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:52,295
Even if Rita thought
you'd wipe the floor with them.

1510
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:54,961
Mr. Dawson,
your lawyer just objected.

1511
01:29:55,003 --> 01:29:57,403
You didn't have to answer
that question.

1512
01:29:57,439 --> 01:29:58,599
You can't even follow
simple rules..

1513
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,403
you've been observing
day after day.

1514
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:02,603
- Objection. Your Honor..
- Overruled.

1515
01:30:02,644 --> 01:30:06,136
What makes you think
you can raise a 7-year-old?

1516
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:07,944
A 10-year-old? A 13-year-old?

1517
01:30:07,982 --> 01:30:09,540
You know what that means?

1518
01:30:09,584 --> 01:30:13,418
She'll be six years
more advanced than you.

1519
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:16,419
What makes you think
you can do that?

1520
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:20,918
What makes you think
you can do that?

1521
01:30:20,962 --> 01:30:22,452
What makes you think
you can do that?

1522
01:30:25,366 --> 01:30:28,631
I..

1523
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:32,902
have had a lot
of time, see, to..

1524
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:35,307
think about what it is..

1525
01:30:35,343 --> 01:30:39,336
that makes somebody
a good parent..

1526
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:43,578
and it's about constancy..

1527
01:30:43,618 --> 01:30:45,745
and it's about..

1528
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:54,887
patience,
and it's about listening..

1529
01:30:54,929 --> 01:30:58,490
and it's about
pretending to listen..

1530
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:02,629
even when
you can't listen anymore.

1531
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:06,197
And it's about love,
like she said.

1532
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:09,369
See, Billy has a home with me..

1533
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:12,641
and I made it the best I could.

1534
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,341
And it's not perfect..

1535
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:17,579
and I'm not a perfect parent..

1536
01:31:17,619 --> 01:31:20,850
and sometimes I don't have
enough patience..

1537
01:31:20,889 --> 01:31:24,825
and I forget
he's just a little kid..

1538
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:29,023
but we built a life
together..

1539
01:31:29,063 --> 01:31:31,861
and we love each other.

1540
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,596
And if you destroy that..

1541
01:31:34,636 --> 01:31:39,938
it'll be irre.. irrep..

1542
01:31:39,974 --> 01:31:41,498
Let me see. Let me see.

1543
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:49,708
- Irreparable.
- Yep!

1544
01:31:49,751 --> 01:31:50,911
Yes. Yes.

1545
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:53,318
Joanne, don't do that, please.

1546
01:31:53,354 --> 01:31:55,879
Don't do it twice.
Not to him.

1547
01:31:55,924 --> 01:31:59,826
Meryl Streep can't even look
at Dustin Hoffman after that.

1548
01:32:02,864 --> 01:32:04,491
"Kramer vs. Kramer."

1549
01:32:06,601 --> 01:32:08,899
Thank you, Mr. Wali,
for that commentary.

1550
01:32:08,937 --> 01:32:12,566
Your Honor, my client
is understandably upset.

1551
01:32:12,607 --> 01:32:13,665
Motion to recess.

1552
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:16,836
I don't exactly
like recess very much.

1553
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:19,108
Motion denied.

1554
01:32:19,147 --> 01:32:21,047
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

1555
01:32:21,082 --> 01:32:23,482
Mr. Dawson.. it's hard.

1556
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:27,420
I know it's hard to know what
to say to Lucy half the time.

1557
01:32:27,455 --> 01:32:29,889
Right? Is it?

1558
01:32:29,924 --> 01:32:31,186
No.

1559
01:32:31,226 --> 01:32:33,524
No? Was that a no?

1560
01:32:33,561 --> 01:32:35,461
No what?

1561
01:32:35,496 --> 01:32:37,555
Let me see.

1562
01:32:39,934 --> 01:32:42,402
I don't know exactly.

1563
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:44,132
I'm sorry, Mr. Dawson.
You don't know what?

1564
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:46,470
I don't.. yeah.

1565
01:32:46,507 --> 01:32:47,804
OK. Yeah.

1566
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:49,139
Yes? Yes, you don't know.

1567
01:32:49,177 --> 01:32:51,372
Right? You don't know..

1568
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:54,040
what it takes
to raise your daughter.

1569
01:32:54,082 --> 01:32:55,106
Objection.

1570
01:32:55,149 --> 01:32:57,117
These are not questions.
This is an attack.

1571
01:32:57,151 --> 01:32:58,118
Overruled.

1572
01:32:58,152 --> 01:33:00,950
I'm Lucy's father.

1573
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:03,253
- I'm her father.
- Are you really?

1574
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:04,588
I'm not talking
about the fact..

1575
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:06,924
that you got
some homeless woman pregnant.

1576
01:33:06,961 --> 01:33:08,326
Objection, Your Honor!

1577
01:33:08,363 --> 01:33:11,230
Get to the question, Mr. Turner.

1578
01:33:11,266 --> 01:33:16,329
The question is,
if you love your daughter..

1579
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:18,464
as much as you say you do..

1580
01:33:18,506 --> 01:33:20,770
and I know that you do..

1581
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:23,174
don't you think
she deserves more?

1582
01:33:24,512 --> 01:33:25,570
Don't you
in your heart of hearts..

1583
01:33:25,613 --> 01:33:28,514
secretly question yourself
every day?

1584
01:33:28,549 --> 01:33:30,176
Objection. Compound questions.

1585
01:33:30,218 --> 01:33:32,152
OK, yeah!

1586
01:33:32,186 --> 01:33:33,585
I'm sorry. Was that a yes?

1587
01:33:33,621 --> 01:33:36,454
I think
Lucy deserves everything.

1588
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:40,450
In my heart of hearts,
I think she deserves everything.

1589
01:33:40,495 --> 01:33:41,587
Yes, she does.

1590
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:44,462
- Yeah, OK.
- Yes, she does.

1591
01:33:44,499 --> 01:33:46,524
And you agree
with everyone here..

1592
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:49,934
that you can't give her that.

1593
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:53,099
Maybe everybody's right, see.

1594
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:56,269
Maybe everybody's right
about that, see.

1595
01:33:56,311 --> 01:33:58,802
So no more now, OK?

1596
01:33:58,846 --> 01:34:03,010
No more now. No more.

1597
01:34:03,051 --> 01:34:08,887
I want to stop right now!

1598
01:34:08,923 --> 01:34:12,324
This is the end of this for me.

1599
01:36:48,316 --> 01:36:51,444
Your teacher told me
you're a wonderful artist.

1600
01:36:51,486 --> 01:36:54,319
So I was thinking maybe..

1601
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:56,220
Daddy's coming today.

1602
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,885
We're going to open
my birthday presents.

1603
01:36:59,927 --> 01:37:02,327
You must be so excited.

1604
01:37:02,363 --> 01:37:04,524
Why don't you just go
and do something?

1605
01:38:30,051 --> 01:38:33,578
Sam, it's me. Open up.

1606
01:38:33,621 --> 01:38:36,283
I don't have time for this.

1607
01:38:36,324 --> 01:38:39,725
You were supposed to show up
to your first evaluation..

1608
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,694
and I leave work early
to be there..

1609
01:38:41,729 --> 01:38:44,562
and where the hell are you?
Open the door!

1610
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,995
Sam, open the goddamn door.

1611
01:38:49,837 --> 01:38:52,465
If you don't care enough to
open the door, I'm out of here.

1612
01:38:52,506 --> 01:38:56,306
I've ruined my practice.
I've alienated my colleagues.

1613
01:38:56,344 --> 01:38:58,539
I sent my kid off on a fishing
trip with his father..

1614
01:38:58,579 --> 01:39:00,069
so that I could work with you..

1615
01:39:00,114 --> 01:39:03,049
and you won't open
the goddamn door for me!

1616
01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:04,881
Fine! That's it! I've had it!

1617
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:30,636
Sam, can I come in?

1618
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:37,448
Not really room here.

1619
01:39:37,485 --> 01:39:40,113
There's no room here.

1620
01:39:40,154 --> 01:39:44,215
Yeah, well, I lived
in the East Village.

1621
01:39:44,258 --> 01:39:45,657
I don't need a lot of room.

1622
01:39:45,693 --> 01:39:46,853
Because I make things..

1623
01:39:46,894 --> 01:39:49,454
everything is too hard
on everybody.

1624
01:39:49,497 --> 01:39:53,331
I make everything hard
on everybody.

1625
01:39:53,367 --> 01:39:55,267
I can go..

1626
01:39:57,271 --> 01:40:00,001
at least another nine rounds.

1627
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:01,531
But you gotta let me in.

1628
01:40:04,111 --> 01:40:06,875
Please. Sam.

1629
01:40:13,254 --> 01:40:14,482
There you are.

1630
01:40:17,658 --> 01:40:20,718
Now I can see those kind eyes.

1631
01:40:22,897 --> 01:40:28,028
So, George says that
you needed a break from work.

1632
01:40:28,069 --> 01:40:31,470
I don't really want
to work there anymore..

1633
01:40:31,505 --> 01:40:33,132
because there's too many people.

1634
01:40:33,174 --> 01:40:40,410
Then maybe we can find you
a quieter job, because..

1635
01:40:40,448 --> 01:40:43,042
Remember that was one of
the judge's conditions..

1636
01:40:43,084 --> 01:40:44,415
that you earn more money.

1637
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:47,080
You have to keep
earning more money..

1638
01:40:47,121 --> 01:40:48,918
so that you can
get a new apartment..

1639
01:40:48,956 --> 01:40:50,924
and Lucy can have
her own room..

1640
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:52,550
for when you get her back.

1641
01:40:52,593 --> 01:40:56,791
Yeah, except that
Lucy doesn't need me anymore.

1642
01:40:56,831 --> 01:41:00,927
She has a new family now..

1643
01:41:00,968 --> 01:41:03,266
and she doesn't need me anymore.

1644
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:04,464
Is that what she said?

1645
01:41:04,505 --> 01:41:07,030
It's because I know that.

1646
01:41:07,074 --> 01:41:09,406
Because I just know that.

1647
01:41:09,443 --> 01:41:11,843
Well.

1648
01:41:11,879 --> 01:41:14,541
That's the first stupid thing
I've ever heard you say.

1649
01:41:17,284 --> 01:41:20,378
Sam, you can get Lucy back.

1650
01:41:20,421 --> 01:41:23,822
The court favors reunification.

1651
01:41:23,858 --> 01:41:27,885
But, Sam,
you have to fight for her.

1652
01:41:27,928 --> 01:41:30,795
Yeah, but I tried!
I tried hard!

1653
01:41:30,831 --> 01:41:34,597
- Try harder!
- Yeah, but you don't know!

1654
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:35,966
I don't know what?

1655
01:41:36,003 --> 01:41:38,301
You don't know
what it's like when you try..

1656
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:42,776
and you try and you try
and you don't ever get there!

1657
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:47,770
Because you were born perfect,
and I was born like this!

1658
01:41:47,815 --> 01:41:49,339
And you're perfect!

1659
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:50,611
Is that right?

1660
01:41:50,651 --> 01:41:53,279
- People like you don't know.
- People like me?

1661
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:56,153
You don't know what it's like
to get hurted..

1662
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:59,216
because you don't have feelings.

1663
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:03,060
People like you
don't feel anything.

1664
01:42:08,369 --> 01:42:12,863
You think you got the market
cornered on human suffering?

1665
01:42:12,907 --> 01:42:15,205
Let me tell you something
about people like me.

1666
01:42:15,242 --> 01:42:22,307
People like me feel lost
and little and ugly..

1667
01:42:22,349 --> 01:42:24,840
and dispensable.

1668
01:42:24,885 --> 01:42:27,752
People like me have husbands..

1669
01:42:27,788 --> 01:42:32,782
screwing someone else
far more perfect than me.

1670
01:42:32,827 --> 01:42:37,526
People like me
have sons who hate them.

1671
01:42:40,935 --> 01:42:45,770
And I've screamed
horrible things to him..

1672
01:42:45,806 --> 01:42:47,740
a seven-year-old,
because he doesn't want..

1673
01:42:47,775 --> 01:42:51,006
to get in the car
at the end of the day.

1674
01:42:51,045 --> 01:42:56,950
And then he looks at me
with such anger..

1675
01:42:56,984 --> 01:43:01,216
and I hate him then.

1676
01:43:01,255 --> 01:43:04,850
I know I'm failing you.
I know I'm disappointing you.

1677
01:43:04,892 --> 01:43:08,419
I know you deserve better,
but get in the fucking car!

1678
01:43:13,534 --> 01:43:19,234
Every morning,
I wake up and I fail.

1679
01:43:19,273 --> 01:43:23,437
And I look around, and everybody
seems to be pulling it off..

1680
01:43:23,477 --> 01:43:27,573
but somehow I can't..

1681
01:43:27,615 --> 01:43:29,674
no matter how hard I try.

1682
01:43:31,986 --> 01:43:36,252
Somehow.. I'll never be enough.

1683
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:37,780
You're enough.

1684
01:43:37,825 --> 01:43:42,660
Yeah, you're much more
than enough.

1685
01:43:42,696 --> 01:43:44,664
Lovely Rita.

1686
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:19,862
Get off the grass, Dino.

1687
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:26,834
OK, come on.

1688
01:44:26,874 --> 01:44:30,332
Be careful,
because you're gonna get hurt.

1689
01:44:30,377 --> 01:44:32,811
Guys, be careful
of the pictures.

1690
01:44:32,846 --> 01:44:34,370
Be careful
of the pretty pictures.

1691
01:44:34,415 --> 01:44:35,382
Sam, you're early.

1692
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:37,646
All the lights were green.

1693
01:44:37,685 --> 01:44:40,620
When I was walking here,
all the lights were green.

1694
01:44:40,654 --> 01:44:42,679
There's a reason
for the court schedule.

1695
01:44:42,723 --> 01:44:44,486
You stopped showing up.

1696
01:44:45,826 --> 01:44:48,522
Lucy's had to rebuild
her whole life, Sam.

1697
01:44:48,562 --> 01:44:51,622
I want her back.
I know I can get her back.

1698
01:44:51,665 --> 01:44:53,929
That's not up to me.

1699
01:44:53,968 --> 01:44:56,436
But I'm just gonna tell you..

1700
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:58,267
I'm gonna do everything
in my power..

1701
01:44:58,305 --> 01:45:00,899
to protect that little girl
from getting hurt again.

1702
01:45:04,445 --> 01:45:06,879
Whose dogs are these?

1703
01:45:06,914 --> 01:45:09,109
These are supplemental income.

1704
01:45:09,149 --> 01:45:13,950
Because I wash and I walk
and I feed the dogs.

1705
01:45:13,988 --> 01:45:17,583
Sam Dawson has everything
for your canine needs.

1706
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:21,052
Let me go get your daughter.

1707
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:24,629
Everybody behave
like a gentleman..

1708
01:45:24,665 --> 01:45:27,361
because Lucy's
gonna come out here..

1709
01:45:27,401 --> 01:45:31,030
and first impressions
are very important.

1710
01:45:34,942 --> 01:45:36,773
You never even came!

1711
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:39,278
You never called!

1712
01:45:39,313 --> 01:45:42,544
You forgot about me!
How could you forget me?

1713
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:45,814
No, I didn't forget you!
I would never forget you!

1714
01:45:45,853 --> 01:45:48,083
I hate you!

1715
01:45:48,122 --> 01:45:51,057
Will you not be mad at me
for one second?

1716
01:45:51,091 --> 01:45:54,185
Because I want to
tell you one thing, OK?

1717
01:45:54,228 --> 01:45:58,062
Because last night,
I was writing you a letter..

1718
01:45:58,098 --> 01:46:02,694
and then the words,
they got too big.

1719
01:46:02,736 --> 01:46:05,534
Gesundheit, Floppy.
Floppy has a cold.

1720
01:46:05,572 --> 01:46:07,733
And then I said..

1721
01:46:07,775 --> 01:46:12,371
"Dear Lucy, I'm sorry
I maybe hurt your feelings.."

1722
01:46:12,413 --> 01:46:17,146
"and I was thinking
about you all the time."

1723
01:46:17,184 --> 01:46:20,585
"Lucy on a hammock.."

1724
01:46:20,621 --> 01:46:22,213
"and Lucy at school.."

1725
01:46:22,256 --> 01:46:25,987
"and Lucy in the sky
and kisses and hugs, Daddy."

1726
01:46:26,026 --> 01:46:29,325
"And P.S. I love you,
like the song."

1727
01:46:29,363 --> 01:46:32,730
"P.S. I love you,
like in the song."

1728
01:46:52,252 --> 01:46:54,083
Hello, Mr. Dawson.

1729
01:46:54,121 --> 01:46:57,750
Yeah. Hello, lawyer.

1730
01:47:01,462 --> 01:47:02,429
Shall we?

1731
01:47:02,463 --> 01:47:04,294
And in these next months..

1732
01:47:04,331 --> 01:47:07,494
Mr. Dawson will be expanding
his support system..

1733
01:47:07,534 --> 01:47:11,436
to include regional service
programs, tutors, and..

1734
01:47:11,472 --> 01:47:13,702
I think it's very important
that you know..

1735
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:18,201
that the foster family is
pushing forward toward adoption.

1736
01:47:18,245 --> 01:47:21,112
The Department of Child
and Family Services and I..

1737
01:47:21,148 --> 01:47:23,378
fully support their request.

1738
01:47:28,989 --> 01:47:31,514
Darn it.

1739
01:47:31,558 --> 01:47:39,294
Sam, there's one option
we've never talked about.

1740
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:42,393
I know what you went through..

1741
01:47:42,436 --> 01:47:44,927
the last time
you took the stand.

1742
01:47:44,972 --> 01:47:47,532
I didn't like that at all.

1743
01:47:47,574 --> 01:47:52,238
We could give the foster parents
guardianship..

1744
01:47:52,279 --> 01:47:53,906
and then we could try..

1745
01:47:53,947 --> 01:47:56,745
for the most incredible
visitation rights..

1746
01:47:56,784 --> 01:48:00,720
and it would almost seem
like joint custody.

1747
01:48:03,557 --> 01:48:06,185
You're saying
I don't have a chance.

1748
01:48:06,226 --> 01:48:07,488
That's what you're saying.

1749
01:48:07,528 --> 01:48:09,621
No. I'm not saying
you don't have a chance.

1750
01:48:09,663 --> 01:48:14,066
That's what you said last time
and now look where he is.

1751
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:16,968
But she's not saying
that I don't have a chance.

1752
01:48:17,004 --> 01:48:19,905
So tell me that I have a chance.

1753
01:48:22,676 --> 01:48:24,200
Oh, my God. Sam, you guys..

1754
01:48:24,244 --> 01:48:27,008
it's video night at my house,
and I'm not even there.

1755
01:48:27,047 --> 01:48:30,107
- Check.
- Sam, get your dessert to go.

1756
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:34,314
Because, OK.

1757
01:48:34,354 --> 01:48:37,152
Wait.
This is really hard to say.

1758
01:48:37,191 --> 01:48:40,183
For me, this is
a very hard thing to say..

1759
01:48:40,227 --> 01:48:43,890
but I'm gonna stay and have
my dessert here with Rita..

1760
01:48:43,931 --> 01:48:47,992
and I'm not gonna go
to video night tonight.

1761
01:48:49,102 --> 01:48:50,262
What?

1762
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,329
Gee, that figures.
I knew that was coming.

1763
01:48:52,372 --> 01:48:54,203
Sam, you can go if you..

1764
01:48:54,241 --> 01:48:56,801
- I said no, Rita.
- But if you want to go..

1765
01:48:56,844 --> 01:48:58,141
Do you want me to go?

1766
01:48:58,178 --> 01:49:01,773
No, I don't want you to go,
but you can go if you want.

1767
01:49:08,155 --> 01:49:10,123
- Fine.
- Fine.

1768
01:49:11,258 --> 01:49:12,850
Good-bye, Rita.

1769
01:49:12,893 --> 01:49:16,886
If you want to come to
video night, you're welcome to.

1770
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:19,626
Thank you, Joe.

1771
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:21,293
Bye, Joe.

1772
01:49:28,775 --> 01:49:32,711
Because you're eating slower.
That's good.

1773
01:49:32,746 --> 01:49:36,079
Because it's good to chew.

1774
01:49:36,116 --> 01:49:38,744
Buttermilk pancakes.

1775
01:49:38,785 --> 01:49:42,915
OK. Let me see.

1776
01:49:42,956 --> 01:49:45,982
OK, sidebar.

1777
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:55,163
Because you..
you need to leave your husband.

1778
01:50:01,108 --> 01:50:04,669
And I need to get Lucy back.

1779
01:50:10,951 --> 01:50:12,441
We need..

1780
01:50:12,486 --> 01:50:17,651
When dealing with the customer,
always be friendly..

1781
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:23,493
and not familiar.

1782
01:50:27,534 --> 01:50:29,399
Because I can be your friend.

1783
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:37,174
Thank you.

1784
01:50:39,646 --> 01:50:41,807
But you still need
to leave your husband.

1785
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:48,413
My marriage isn't so bad.

1786
01:50:52,659 --> 01:50:55,423
It's just that..

1787
01:50:55,462 --> 01:50:56,861
it's just..

1788
01:51:01,134 --> 01:51:03,796
I've never lost at anything.

1789
01:52:03,096 --> 01:52:05,690
- Daddy?
- Hi.

1790
01:52:05,732 --> 01:52:06,699
What are you doing here?

1791
01:52:06,733 --> 01:52:08,701
I live here.

1792
01:52:08,735 --> 01:52:09,759
What do you mean you live here?

1793
01:52:09,803 --> 01:52:11,202
Actually, I live here.

1794
01:52:11,238 --> 01:52:13,433
This is where you live?

1795
01:52:13,473 --> 01:52:15,100
So close to me?

1796
01:52:15,142 --> 01:52:17,736
Yeah, because I wanted
to be close.

1797
01:52:17,778 --> 01:52:20,303
I wanted to be closer to you..

1798
01:52:20,347 --> 01:52:24,408
so I live here
in that apartment.

1799
01:52:24,451 --> 01:52:25,850
It's number nine.

1800
01:52:25,886 --> 01:52:28,150
And number nine
is like October 9..

1801
01:52:28,188 --> 01:52:29,280
when John Lennon was born..

1802
01:52:29,322 --> 01:52:31,847
and his son was born
on October 9, too.

1803
01:52:31,892 --> 01:52:33,757
John met Yoko on November 9.

1804
01:52:33,794 --> 01:52:35,591
Yeah, and his mother lived..

1805
01:52:35,629 --> 01:52:39,725
at number nine Newcastle
in Liverpool.

1806
01:52:39,766 --> 01:52:42,166
Newcastle, nine letters.
Liverpool, nine letters.

1807
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:47,070
Maybe I can talk to Daddy
for a minute?

1808
01:52:47,107 --> 01:52:48,734
Come over here, Dino.

1809
01:52:48,775 --> 01:52:51,869
You're a Girl Scout now!

1810
01:52:51,912 --> 01:52:53,277
Is that OK?

1811
01:52:53,313 --> 01:52:55,645
Yeah, that's really good.

1812
01:52:55,682 --> 01:52:56,944
Look at my pins.

1813
01:52:56,983 --> 01:53:00,578
- It looks very good on you.
- Thank you.

1814
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,952
You'll be
a very good Girl Scout.

1815
01:53:02,989 --> 01:53:04,752
Sam, we need to talk.

1816
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:06,315
What are you doing?

1817
01:53:06,359 --> 01:53:08,554
Trying to get closer to her
by moving closer?

1818
01:53:08,595 --> 01:53:10,893
We're supposed
to give her consistency.

1819
01:53:10,931 --> 01:53:12,694
We've got a week
till we go to court.

1820
01:53:16,303 --> 01:53:22,902
Because every time I came down
to see her on a bus..

1821
01:53:22,943 --> 01:53:25,810
I was always every time
wasting time on a bus.

1822
01:53:25,846 --> 01:53:28,178
I really do understand.

1823
01:53:28,215 --> 01:53:31,343
But we have to make it about her
and what's best for her.

1824
01:53:31,384 --> 01:53:33,818
Yeah, what's best for her
is what's most important.

1825
01:53:33,854 --> 01:53:36,288
- Right.
- Yeah.

1826
01:53:36,323 --> 01:53:37,915
Does Floppy still have his cold?

1827
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:40,984
Yeah, but Floppy's
getting much better.

1828
01:53:41,027 --> 01:53:42,119
That's good.

1829
01:53:42,162 --> 01:53:44,960
Can I buy some cookies from you?

1830
01:53:44,998 --> 01:53:48,490
That'll be 3.25.

1831
01:53:48,535 --> 01:53:49,832
We can get it
from you later.

1832
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:52,065
We really should get going.

1833
01:53:52,105 --> 01:53:54,335
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1834
01:53:54,374 --> 01:53:56,740
Can I hug her bye-bye?

1835
01:53:56,776 --> 01:53:58,767
Of course you can hug her.

1836
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:05,177
Good-bye.

1837
01:54:05,218 --> 01:54:08,585
Really very good to see you.

1838
01:55:10,283 --> 01:55:12,649
Daddy!

1839
01:55:12,686 --> 01:55:14,381
Did you know
that Warren G. Harding..

1840
01:55:14,421 --> 01:55:18,255
was the 29th president
of the United States?

1841
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:21,158
Remember, the 29th president..

1842
01:55:21,194 --> 01:55:23,685
in case the judge asks.

1843
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:25,197
What are you doing out here?

1844
01:55:25,232 --> 01:55:26,563
I missed you.

1845
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,364
You could get really hurted.

1846
01:55:29,402 --> 01:55:30,699
And it's really cold..

1847
01:55:30,737 --> 01:55:33,706
and you don't have enough on
to keep you warm.

1848
01:55:34,908 --> 01:55:36,398
What..?

1849
01:55:36,443 --> 01:55:40,607
She couldn't sleep,
so she came to my house.

1850
01:55:40,647 --> 01:55:43,844
Give me my daughter.
Give us Lucy. Come here.

1851
01:55:43,883 --> 01:55:47,011
Easy, Sam.
Thank you.

1852
01:55:47,053 --> 01:55:49,521
Sometimes
if you rub her belly..

1853
01:55:49,556 --> 01:55:52,184
and then if you
tell her two stories..

1854
01:55:52,225 --> 01:55:55,922
and give her half
an IHOP corn muffin..

1855
01:55:55,962 --> 01:55:57,896
then sometimes she sleeps.

1856
01:55:57,931 --> 01:55:59,592
When she can't sleep.

1857
01:55:59,633 --> 01:56:03,194
We'll be fine, Sam.
Good night.

1858
01:56:03,236 --> 01:56:05,295
Good night.

1859
01:56:05,338 --> 01:56:07,806
You can go home now.

1860
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:31,094
Yeah, a personal
pepperoni pan pizza.

1861
01:56:31,131 --> 01:56:32,894
That's a wonderful choice.

1862
01:56:47,714 --> 01:56:49,375
Daddy?

1863
01:56:52,152 --> 01:56:53,380
Daddy?

1864
01:57:20,347 --> 01:57:22,076
Lucy, come here.

1865
01:57:25,652 --> 01:57:27,517
Hi, sweetie.

1866
01:57:27,554 --> 01:57:29,954
I made us a midnight snack.

1867
01:57:29,989 --> 01:57:31,980
Half an IHOP corn cake.

1868
01:57:34,527 --> 01:57:36,995
I understand that
you want to see your daddy.

1869
01:57:39,399 --> 01:57:42,163
And I really don't want
to keep you from him.

1870
01:57:42,202 --> 01:57:44,466
I really honestly don't.

1871
01:57:44,504 --> 01:57:47,132
I want you to know that.

1872
01:57:47,173 --> 01:57:49,232
So whenever you want
to see him, you just tell me.

1873
01:57:49,275 --> 01:57:53,177
Any time you want
to see him is fine..

1874
01:57:53,213 --> 01:57:56,808
but we kind of need
to work it out first.

1875
01:57:56,850 --> 01:57:58,215
So how about a snack?

1876
01:58:05,892 --> 01:58:07,257
Thank you.

1877
01:58:07,293 --> 01:58:08,658
Good night.

1878
01:58:08,695 --> 01:58:10,287
Good night.

1879
01:58:21,307 --> 01:58:24,174
Everybody behave yourself.

1880
01:58:27,347 --> 01:58:29,212
Oh, how wonderful.
You brought Willy.

1881
01:58:29,249 --> 01:58:31,911
- Hi, Willy.
- Hi, Sam.

1882
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:33,418
It's good to see you.

1883
01:58:34,654 --> 01:58:37,953
We have to close the door
because the dogs go out.

1884
01:58:45,064 --> 01:58:47,931
My husband left this
when he moved out.

1885
01:58:50,069 --> 01:58:52,594
Lovely Rita.

1886
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:56,769
OK, let me see.

1887
01:58:56,810 --> 01:59:01,440
They're going to put Randy
on the stand tomorrow first..

1888
01:59:01,481 --> 01:59:03,449
and then you.

1889
01:59:05,552 --> 01:59:08,146
They're a very nice couple.

1890
01:59:08,188 --> 01:59:11,123
And she's pretty,
and they have a nice house..

1891
01:59:11,157 --> 01:59:13,148
and she's smart, too.

1892
01:59:13,193 --> 01:59:17,391
Sam, I worry.
I worry sometimes.

1893
01:59:19,833 --> 01:59:23,234
Do you worry
that you did something wrong?

1894
01:59:30,777 --> 01:59:32,074
I worry that I've gotten..

1895
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:34,602
more out of this relationship
than you.

1896
01:59:48,228 --> 01:59:53,996
I have the lawyer
that never loses.

1897
01:59:54,033 --> 01:59:56,661
That's me.

1898
01:59:59,272 --> 02:00:03,231
And the manager at
the Pizza Hut's gonna testify..

1899
02:00:03,276 --> 02:00:04,607
and that's good.

1900
02:00:04,644 --> 02:00:06,111
Absolutely.

1901
02:00:09,249 --> 02:00:15,711
And Annie said
that George thinks..

1902
02:00:15,755 --> 02:00:17,382
that George Harrison
couldn't..

1903
02:00:17,423 --> 02:00:21,325
maybe, he couldn't
write a song..

1904
02:00:21,361 --> 02:00:25,263
but then he wrote
"Here Comes the Sun"..

1905
02:00:25,298 --> 02:00:33,103
and she said that it was one of
the best songs on "Abbey Road."

1906
02:00:35,942 --> 02:00:38,843
George was always
my favorite Beatle.

1907
02:01:01,334 --> 02:01:04,633
She's OK. Sorry.

1908
02:01:04,671 --> 02:01:06,263
She fell asleep in the car.

1909
02:01:07,874 --> 02:01:16,111
I was gonna turn back
and tuck her in.. in her room.

1910
02:01:16,149 --> 02:01:20,313
You know, that I..
in her room that I made for her.

1911
02:01:22,455 --> 02:01:25,686
Because I tried to make
a really nice room for her.

1912
02:01:25,725 --> 02:01:28,023
But I was afraid
she'd wake up at our house..

1913
02:01:30,063 --> 02:01:32,588
and want to come home.

1914
02:01:35,568 --> 02:01:37,001
That's a girl.

1915
02:01:46,412 --> 02:01:50,280
I have to apologize to you..

1916
02:01:50,316 --> 02:01:54,275
because I was gonna
tell that judge..

1917
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,780
that I could give Lucy
the kind of love she never had.

1918
02:01:58,825 --> 02:02:02,989
But I can't say that,
because I'd be lying.

1919
02:02:04,497 --> 02:02:06,795
I hope..

1920
02:02:06,833 --> 02:02:11,930
I hope you're saying
what I think you're saying.

1921
02:02:11,971 --> 02:02:15,065
I hope you're saying
what I think you're saying.

1922
02:02:16,476 --> 02:02:17,773
I am.

1923
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:23,011
Bye.

1924
02:02:25,118 --> 02:02:26,915
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

1925
02:02:28,855 --> 02:02:30,880
Save me a seat, Sam.

1926
02:02:30,923 --> 02:02:33,824
On your side. OK?

1927
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:38,763
Yeah. I'll save you a seat
on my side.

1928
02:02:38,798 --> 02:02:40,993
- Bye.
- Bye.

1929
02:02:42,802 --> 02:02:45,430
Randy?

1930
02:02:45,471 --> 02:02:48,065
If I tell you a secret..

1931
02:02:48,107 --> 02:02:51,907
that I can't do it by myself..

1932
02:02:51,944 --> 02:02:53,673
will you tell the judge on me?

1933
02:02:55,415 --> 02:02:56,609
No, Sam.

1934
02:02:58,151 --> 02:02:59,846
Promise?

1935
02:02:59,886 --> 02:03:01,444
I promise.

1936
02:03:03,923 --> 02:03:09,452
Because I always wanted
Lucy to have a mother.

1937
02:03:09,495 --> 02:03:11,793
I always wanted her
to have a mother.

1938
02:03:11,831 --> 02:03:15,323
Help. I need somebody.

1939
02:03:15,368 --> 02:03:19,668
Help. Not just anyone.

1940
02:03:22,909 --> 02:03:26,845
And you're the red
in her painting.

1941
02:03:26,879 --> 02:03:30,178
Because I think
you're the red in her painting.

1942
02:03:39,092 --> 02:03:40,650
Thank you, Sam.

1943
02:04:06,986 --> 02:04:08,510
Play ball!

1944
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:12,621
Get it, Lucy!

1945
02:04:18,131 --> 02:04:19,462
Go, Lucy!

1946
02:04:31,811 --> 02:04:33,574
Lucy got a goal!

1947
02:04:38,117 --> 02:04:40,585
Lucy got a goal, Rita!

1948
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
