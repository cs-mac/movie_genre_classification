1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Didn't you see the man ahead?

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Speed up, full gear

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Stop the car!

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't do this!

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,993
I am talking to you
stop right now!

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
God, I was shot

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Damn, I am so stupid!

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Am I still going to live?

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You won't die, it's not gonna hurt

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I said this is not gonna hurt

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But my blood is running out

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Damn, let me have a look

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,991
Let me take a look!

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can hold on a little longer, it's not too severe

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The bullet is not deep inside

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You can't stay here

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No no, I want to go back to the prison

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't you forget, you will stay there for 
the rest of your life if you ever go back

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you named Gilbert?

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Two friends of us have died
for this single matter

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No matter what
I don't believe

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think we'd better divide from here

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll go first, see you

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,993
Why are you going that way?
Got a plan? MG! Wait for me!

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,989
It hurts, it hurts!

26
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,991
Mama!

27
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, MG!

28
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mama!

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,991
MG!

30
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How did you get into this?

31
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Didn't you put on any isinglass cream?

32
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You've got blood on the clothes

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
God, how did I get it on the shirt

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's still new

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I brought it out just to have it basked

36
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Look at what your father did

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He always put his razors everywhere

38
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and said he will tidy them up

39
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's just to help you,
he thought he could do it well

40
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't forget he is going to celebrate
the Mother's day for you

42
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,991
Yeah

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But now what shall I put on?

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is so unexpected!
Look at that!

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh! Those glair almond cookies!

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,993
Hurry up, Magali, turn off the oven!

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Look, I've got my finger cut 
and only shed a few dropes of blood

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How could this happen?

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It seems that someone else had got into our home

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,991
I swear

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This reminds people of woods of Autumn in Paris

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There are many orange trees on the roadside

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This alcohol is about 13 degrees
and it's easy to get drunk

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Alcohol from 98 is not so crusted for me

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Believe me,
the longer the alcohol is stocked

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the more exalted it becomes

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's exactly the opposite to me

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How much is it?

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Tax not included, 7.6

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Such a delicious alcohol rarely
sells for price like this

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,991
I hope so

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,991
It's okay

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Make it a little cheaper
Give me a reasonable price tag

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,993
Price?
If you insist to compare

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Ah, you are so lucky
Daniel

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's very obvious, she's a terpsichorean

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
People can tell from her upright waistline

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
She wanted to be a star in her childhood

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Perhaps in one or two years

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,993
Shit, what's wrong?

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,991
So stupid!

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hurry up!

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,993
Do you want to be like this?
Got any plan?

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What kind of luck this is!

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn't get in the way of nobody!

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Shut up! Come on!

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't you be quick!

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I wanna pick the lock
I am an expert

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,991
Expert?

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,993
You wanna get caught?

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wait, I can't walk

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can walk no more

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You try breaking your leg! Try it!

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I really can't walk

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,991
Cannot walk

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,993
You are right
We can't be like this any more

87
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go, it must be after us

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You have brains, you have intelligence

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
MG, aren't you smart?

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then get me out of here!

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In conditions like this

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Can I think of what to do?

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
With handcuffs!

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But this doesn't prevent you from thinking!

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We need to find a quiet place to have a break

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Let's play to the score when we settle down a bit 

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,993
Is this your plan?

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,993
The geckos here remind me of my grandfather

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The owners of this home must be as kind as him

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,993
Geckos are guardians of homes
Let's go

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,993
Wait, wait for me

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,993
This door is not automatic

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look, just as I said

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,993
Geckos are bring us good luck

105
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,991
Come and help me a bit

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,991
Come on

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,991
Mama!

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,991
Mama!

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,991
Hey! MG!

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We can hold them as hostage

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's the point to take this household hostage?

112
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know either
We can negotiate with the daughter

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In the past

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You ask the hostages to get downstairs one by one

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You ought to do this

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I never did that

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They will cooperate with you

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You also need to find an empty room

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,993
and make them stay there

120
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,993
Which way are you going
for your wound's sake

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Door, door!

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Seems that somebody had been here

123
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then I need to find this thing out

124
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,993
You go look at the glair almond cookies

125
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you looking for?

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, excuse us, we were going the wrong way

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He was hit by a car

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
accidentally

129
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is there such a person?

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, actually we are looking for a doctor

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We heard that the number is 15
and we went in

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But we don't know how we ended up here

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Excuse us, madam

134
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Never mind

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But this is 3, not 15

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And that is his house, but it's not a clinic

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Please come in, I'll find some

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, don't bother

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, okay

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Please come in, you can't stay like this forever

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,991
Please

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Monsieur

143
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you are very painful, please have a seat first

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, Magali

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Bring the chair from the dining room for this gentleman

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Are we causing any trouble to you?

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Your are too courteous to think this way

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll call a doctor

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Doctor Buwaik is very warmhearted

150
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's an emergency, madam

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think you'd better not call a doctor

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How can I not do that?

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is nothing

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't make this happen in my wedding anniversary

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We won't bother you for too long

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have nothing to worry about

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We just need some rest

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you have anything to bind up a wound?

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Like isinglass cream or bandage

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,993
Shall we? Borrow some

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The glair almond cookies are baked ready

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,991
Yes?

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Are you going to

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
rape and kill us?

166
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Right?

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We just want to take breath here

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Everything here is yours to take

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,991
And then please go

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Smells good

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's my specialty

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Twenty years of marriage, do you understand?

173
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There are guests tonight
And I need to get the supper ready

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And my husband and son will be back in a while

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I also need to change

176
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's not that your are not welcome

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I very much understand your problem

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But it's for sure that you can't have supper here

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't worry

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We won't face you to do anything

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
May I watch television?

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There are no interesting programs now

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They are all for children

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do you like watch cartoons?

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We want to know whether our breakout is be talked about

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Ah, sure

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Did you break out of prison?

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can say that

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,993
How come I can find anything

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you don't mind

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to go on with preparing the supper

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,993
Otherwise I wouldn't be able to make it

194
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,993
Don't worry, it's the automatic door to the garage

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,993
Okay, the door is open

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hi, Daniel

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hi

198
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you have anything on your mind?

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah

200
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Did you see my dog in your garage?

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's lost again

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Probably it ran from that end of the fence

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The fence needs to be fixed

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We talked about this
but we haven't set any date

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You decide the time

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You just approve a refit plan

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll see to the rest

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have a catalog, how about a little chat?

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,993
I will be right there

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Freeze there

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,991
Let me go

213
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,991
Papa

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I am really sorry

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,993
The garage door was blocked

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Excuse me

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There's something

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
My mother is preparing for the wedding anniversary

219
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, you are such a lucky guy

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's all right

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll be back later

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are there many guests already?

223
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No, only two
Just breakout prisoners

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,991
No matter who they are

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
My dear

226
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The supper is not ready yet

227
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We have something unexpected

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,991
What is that?

229
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Did he shoot you?

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Where did you hurt? Where?

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I did this to myself
Relax

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They agreed to not having supper here 

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think he's even kinder than us

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They are not ferocious at all

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Two dangerous prisoners escaped during their transfer

236
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,993
Us? They are talking about us

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The incident happened at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's on the interprovincial highway crossing the Flurhay-Prizans Forest

239
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
According to several witnesses

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's estimated that this breakout has neither complicity

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
nor premeditation

242
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
One of the prisoner, Gilbert

243
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
for involving in a small lawsuit

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
was sentenced to two years in prison.
His term of imprisonment is nearing its end

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You are so foolish

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And another one
Michel Garmay

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is an unexcused prisoner

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
His nickname is MG

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,991
Possibly referring to intelligence

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
To me, MG always refer to edible oil

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He was the ringleader

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
of the notorious armed robbery 9 years ago

253
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They robbed a bank in Saint Bursan that provides loans for growing grapes

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
During the course there are hostages hold

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And the case ended up with the death of an employee

256
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Mr. Garmay was sentenced to 20 years in prison

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
His confession in the courtroom didn't convince the jury

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
because he woundn't plead guilty

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's not my fault

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You tell them
That's not my fault!

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You are an reporter

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Tell them I was not wrong!

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Above is the office statement

264
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Since I am not the reporter investigating this case

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,993
I don't know if you would be satisfied with this report

266
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Mr. Garmay

267
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In fact, you were only an accomplice

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You were an employee of the robbed bank

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You only provided the criminals with

270
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
some information on the security monitoring system 
in the robbed bank

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right, right, that's the truth

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The reward was three months of salary

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Mr. Sharl Greynach

274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Are you the lawyer for Mr. Garmay?

275
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
At that time

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The real ringleader of that case contacted Mr. Garmay

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is that true?

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes, but I didn't ever know who he was

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
As to me

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We investigated his identity

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
not for any professional secrets

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The reason is very simple

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We wanted to understand this person

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's him who instigated me to do those things

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He also promised to save me if I got into trouble

288
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,993
Therefore we can't turn our back upon this

289
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Someone saw the two escaped criminals

290
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in and around the Flurhay-Prizans Forest

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
From now on

292
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Every trunk road in this region is under police' control

293
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,993
Now I know the whole thing

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No matter how

295
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If you'd like to stay for supper

296
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll prepare some more dishes

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Which dishes do you prefer?

298
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,993
Got any plans? We are doomed to death

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Surely you have, right, Mr. MG?

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Very sorry

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I am very sorry to bother you in your weeding anniversary

302
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,993
This reminds me of the time when my wife and I were together

303
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Pull yourself together
You haven't lost anything

304
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Look

305
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
At least you need to take away all the telephones

306
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
excluding the one in the living room

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We'll give our cellphones to you also

308
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, yes
I insist to do so

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No one would know what's gonna happen
Try it

310
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And cellphones are not as valuable as wedding rings

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Magali

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Put the cellphones upstairs with Mr. Gilbert

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Is you name Gilbert?

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Bring all of them upstairs?

315
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,991
Right

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, what about those guests?

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Louis Dovick is returning from school soon

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Can I make a phone call to him?

319
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I will find an excuse

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and ask him to stay over night at his schoolmates'

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
In the meantime

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You can cancel the invitations to our friends

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll try
But this is so tricky

324
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Let me explain this to you

325
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I work in a daytime hospital for psychopathic children

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
as a part-time social welfare personnel

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you know hysteria?

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hysteria, yes, I know that

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Great!

330
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Those children are very mysterious and arresting

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The Mearlow's

332
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
are both supervisor to the hospital

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and psychiatrist there

334
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We are friends, very good friends

335
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But it's still hard to explain to him

336
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,993
Don't worry
He will understand

337
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Dr. Mearlow

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is the Bermariyan Hospital

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,991
What can I do for you

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,993
Béatrice, wait a second

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, excuse me

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I have been studying the case of Alexander Jr.

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,993
Now he has entered the phase of self-controlled mutilation

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
At one time he broke his head

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
At the other time he thrashed his arms

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,993
In the last two days he struggled to
bump his back against everywhere

347
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
How about you, Béatrice

348
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,991
Are you okay?

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Damn flies!

350
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ah, yes

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,993
Your twentieth wedding anniversary

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Does your daughter suffer from mental stress?

353
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Since a long time ago

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
She is good, very good

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
People like to stay together with her

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Frankly speaking

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Probably some kind of blasphemy

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
make her go down with such a psychological disease

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I treated her with psychotherapies

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But this is too slow

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
She strongly opposed it

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She felt that she still belonged to Satan

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now it worked

364
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
thanks to Mr. President

365
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
When Louis Dovick came to attend the chastenment committee yesterday

366
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
mentioned to us your fondness for poems

367
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Can we have our poem club now?

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,991
Yes

369
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please wait

370
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Hello?

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Papa!

372
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I will be right back, don't worry

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah
The meeting was longer than expected

374
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But don't be afraid

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's your wedding anniversary, I won't

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ah? Yes?

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's up to you

378
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay

379
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes

380
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Say hello to mama

381
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Enjoy your time in Leedur

382
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do you wanna come to my home to learn some art?

383
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, damn you

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Give me a break

385
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Give me the stuff

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,993
What are you talking about

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There's a beautiful girl, are you not going for her?

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,993
Got something to do today
I'll leave her alone for now

389
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,991
Stop that

390
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't wanna go at all
I am scared

391
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I think I will feel uneasy all over

392
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you find them to be old-fashioned

393
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
it's not too late to leave at that time

394
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Magali is a very good friend of mine

395
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You understand that, don't you?

396
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
She wouldn't wanna see me drinking with her uncle all the time

397
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can have a lot of decious food there

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,991
especially sweets

399
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Mrs. Roze makes first-class glair almond cookies

400
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You choose
me or those cookies

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay, okay
I give up to go there

402
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But we'd better say hello to her family

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
There are still many things to do

404
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, your are right

405
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's the reason why I ask you to choose

406
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't be curmudgeonly, I am only staying there for two minutes

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes

408
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But when Magali sees me together with you

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
she will ask you what's going on

410
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No, I don't want it, you have to hide me

411
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Where?

412
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't know either, anywhere

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Only two minutes

414
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Say yes, dear uncle!

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We have no way to contact him
He is not taking his cellphone

416
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He must be on his way
He is always early

417
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
When he arrives

418
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
you go out

419
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
find an excuse and ask him to leave

420
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You don't know him

421
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He's as stubborn as a mule

422
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
There's absolutely no way to persuade him

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,991
You know

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,991
He's always like that

425
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,991
Look, here he is

426
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Ask him to leave

427
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This is good for everybody

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He won't listen to me, never

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think Magali can give it a try

430
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He likes you

431
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
As to me, he knows too much

432
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,993
He can tell immediately that I am lying

433
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Hello, uncle

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Ah, Magali, how are you?

435
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
There's a small incident, sorry

436
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Do you want to say something?

437
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No, No please

438
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You tell your parents that I am sorry

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Please tell them I can't be their guest today

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I have to something unexpected to deal with

441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Sometimes it happens

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There's something wrong with the cultural center
I have to be there

443
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Is it for your next performance?

444
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah

445
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Is there an 18-year-old girl?

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah

447
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I will like her

448
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Really

449
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Get in

450
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
This is my home!

451
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What are you going to do?

452
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You are so unsympathetic
He just came home

453
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
This is the point

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Someone self-invited goes everywhere

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Is this normal?

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And he found such a pretext to reject an invitation

457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You can check if he has a cellphone with him

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't kill me

459
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Please

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,993
Don't kill me, I am a patient

461
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Anybody? I can't stand any more

462
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
She will suffocate in the trunk

463
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't care

464
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
May I go?
She looks quiet

465
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It would be a pity if she dies

466
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't you know that in a time like this

467
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
there are things more important than the girl?

468
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What else do you like?
Shotgun?

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
No no, I guarantee to you that

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
it's gardenia

471
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
My wife loves gardenia a lot

472
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Please let me go, please

473
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I will give you anything you want

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,993
I have a heart problem and have to take medicines on schedule

475
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll tell you the names of those medicines

476
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I need anti-heart-failures drugs

477
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I need anti-convulsion drugs, anti

478
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This fellow needs anti-everything drugs

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Be patient
It'll be better, uncle

480
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Think for him
He wants to release you also

481
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But he can't

482
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You know
They are having a hard time too

483
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Come and try my glair almond cookies

484
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It happened so sudden today

485
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that I didn't have time to prepare some little cakes

486
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Never mind, madam

487
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Thank you

488
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They look very delicious

489
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
This is all natural

490
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Authentic glair almond cookies are all natural

491
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
They are only made from almond powder

492
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
If you don't mind
I'll go change upstairs

493
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hold it
Help yourself

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's my pleasure

495
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What do you two want to drink?

496
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Here I have champagne

497
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But in this kind of situation
probably you would prefer

498
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I just want to think it over

499
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,993
How about your wound?

500
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What suprised me is

501
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Perhaps it's stupid to think this way

502
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But aren't you going to be set free soon?

503
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah
It can be even more unrestricted than home

504
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Why did you still want to escape?

505
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Is the prison that unbearable?

506
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Right

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That is the most unbearable place

508
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I didn't want to escape

509
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
This was an accident

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Magali, your question might get people bored

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And you've also interrupted Mr. MG's thoughts

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
In this way he won't be able to find a solution

513
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,993
Look, we've brought trouble to others

514
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,991
There is someone in the garage

515
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's police!

516
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
God, we are finished!

517
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They have found here

518
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They are so fast

519
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The worst moment is coming

520
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We could only fight!

521
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We are dying
I am telling you!

522
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We are dying without even any belongings

523
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's so ridiculous

524
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Madam, it's me

525
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We totally forgot there is she

526
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's Marsanne, Marsanne
I'll talk to her

527
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Are you sure?

528
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah, she came just to help me prepare the supper

529
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
She always comes in through the garage

530
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't worry
I know how to send her away

531
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Gugu, Marsanne!

532
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I have to come in here
The door is blocked

533
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Look at my clothes
It became so dirty

534
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Damn!

535
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You can wash it clean with ease

536
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Washing the clothes is even more expensive 
than buying a new one!

537
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You always exaggerate, Marsanne

538
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's gonna be fine
There's something wrong with the door, I admit

539
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I am feeling better

540
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I will tidy it up

541
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and you don't have to work here tonight

542
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
As compensation

543
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I will make this clear to the guests

544
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I will tell them

545
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You mean I came here and had nothing to do?

546
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's true

547
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But I will pay you as I promised

548
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Did I ride one hour of bus for nothing?

549
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'll say it again

550
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I will compensate you for all your time

551
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and dry clean your clothes

552
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
plus the fare for the public traffic

553
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yes, yes

554
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,993
I left my daughter with 49 degrees fever for here

555
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You are exaggerating again

556
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Such a young child would have already died of 49 degrees

557
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah, she is dying

558
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
but I came here for nothing?

559
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Frankly speaking, Marsanne

560
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Okay, I am willing to pay the medical treatment as goodwill

561
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Please don't demand for more

562
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Pay, pay
I am fed up with that

563
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Do you think this is the panacea for everything?

564
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Do you think by paying me you will live in peace?

565
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Narcissism

566
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you know what narcissism is?

567
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You are so darkminded!

568
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Marsanne
Don't bring me any more trouble!

569
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Do you think I have no trouble at all?

570
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,993
I came to prepare the supper
and I will do that

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No

572
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's see

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Marsanne
We have enough maids already

574
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Mrs. Roze
It's you who likes to exaggerate

575
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You are fired!

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Great
But after the supper

577
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Get out of my home! Get out!

578
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Shut up! Stupid woman!

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Stupid woman!

580
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I will throw this immediately!

581
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,991
Stupid woman!

582
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,991
Stupid woman!

583
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,993
I think we can't bring her through

584
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No matter how
it's me who wanted to get rid of her

585
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
She never knows where he is

586
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I told her one hundred times
to put the vacuum under the bed

587
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,991
One hundred times!

588
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you have a plan?

589
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What are we going to do?

590
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Magali, please go back to your room

591
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In fact
this is not a big deal

592
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If you hadn't come here
it wouldn't have happened

593
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I think you killed a number of people

594
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
including the two policemen died recently

595
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It shouldn't be a problem if adding one more

596
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I didn't do nothing

597
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I never killed anyone

598
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
If you set me free
I'd like to testify for you

599
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
How I admire your family value!

600
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Jean-Louis

601
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I am telling the truth
Daniel

602
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Daniel is right

603
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
If you do not hesitate to betray your family

604
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
it's hard to ensure you don't spread the word

605
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I can't take this risk

606
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I just wanted to live the 6 months quietly

607
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know what you are going to do, MG

608
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But I am going

609
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'd rahter go elsewhere to find opportunities

610
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Very sorry to disturb you

611
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Thank you for your cookies, madam

612
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Too hotheaded, Gilbert

613
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And it's too late to go now

614
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Think about it

615
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Look at Mr. MG

616
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
He knows how to think

617
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and he's a smart guy

618
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He knows that he shouldn't be caught
after escaping five hunred meters

619
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The moment when you step out of this doorsill

620
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
it's likely that you are recognized

621
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And what Jean-Louis did

622
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
have made us closer to this family

623
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He's my only uncle

624
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
a little flabby

625
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,993
but we still love him very much

626
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Is Mr. Roze there?

627
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I am his neighbour

628
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
My name is Flaunsova Clavih

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,993
Ah, he's right there

630
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Hello, this is a surprise

631
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What surprise?

632
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Didn't your wife give you a surprise?

633
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,993
I will be out explaining this to you

634
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is he your cousin from Chile?

635
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Is he coming for your wedding anniversary?

636
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I know there is a kind of soft alcohol in Chile

637
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Sorry, Flaunsova

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You won't be interested here

639
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Go that way

640
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'll leave the catalog behind

641
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Cross the one you are satisfied with

642
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,993
Does tomorrow night work?
If you would agree

643
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Is there a room in the house with no windows?

644
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And can be locked with a key?

645
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
There is a darkroom

646
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
There is only a louver window inside for ventilation

647
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,991
It can be locked from inside

648
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That sounds good

649
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,993
I am sure you have a plan already

650
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Gilbert

651
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Go find that girl upstairs

652
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You go to the darkroom

653
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Madam will be there soon

654
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You keep the key

655
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I need to make a phone call

656
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
If you don't mind
I want to stay here

657
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I have claustrophobia

658
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and I have rheumatism, no humidity

659
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I didn't have anti-rheumatism drugs with me

660
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But I won't wreck your plan

661
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Don't you think you have baffled others?

662
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,993
Leave him alone, he's always up with something

663
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,991
Jean-Louis!

664
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Hold this
It can be locked inside

665
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
This doesn't look so good

666
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I gotta tell you probably I can't stay long

667
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Sorry to bother you

668
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But you don't have to stay very long

669
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
This is nothing

670
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
This is good for everyone

671
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We can have a rest

672
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You stay reassured
We won't escape

673
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
There are no exits here

674
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You can do a check

675
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Since you said it, I believe

676
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Don't worry about us

677
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
No matter how

678
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I still have a washing machine here

679
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
If you have any needs

680
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Give us your pants

681
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We'll put it in the machine and wash it

682
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Thank you, I can put up with it

683
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I don't wanna bother you

684
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
She is right
You can't dress this way

685
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And there's a spot that needs to be sewn

686
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
since I am here

687
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We are not gonna run away

688
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Go to my son's room

689
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,993
His pants might fit you

690
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,993
Listen, no matter what you did has nothing to do with me

691
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Michel
it's not necessary

692
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't care
This I don't care at all

693
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Don't you think so?

694
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Let's forget everything in the past

695
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I remarried

696
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and have a son

697
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You have a child?

698
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's great

699
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You decided not to write me because of these?

700
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Eight years, Sophia

701
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Eight years

702
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
No see for eight years
No call

703
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Nothing at all

704
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I won't die

705
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You can tell them

706
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I will wait for you

707
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,993
Sophia! Sophia!

708
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Hello, is Mr. Gilbert speaking?

709
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm Michelle.Game

710
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you remember me?

711
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Remember our trade?

712
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
No, after that

713
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,993
Is half an hour ok?

714
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't think you can conquer me

715
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Today I have no taste to see you

716
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,991
Come

717
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Come to see what's this

718
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Two murderer ran away

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,993
It happened when changing the prison this afternoon

720
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I have only six months
don't know where to go

721
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,991
I'm Gilbert

722
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Next crossing
otherwise it's easy to jam

723
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Necessary?

724
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We need to produce ID card in the crossing of highway

725
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's routine

726
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Are you MG?

727
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
What's your crime?

728
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,991
Is it serious?

729
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I lacerated finger

730
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I intended

731
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Sometimes you can get a conditional freedom by doing this

732
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Sometimes can't

733
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We don't go our planed route
I'm nervous

734
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We pass through Fleury woods

735
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
so we can save time

736
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,993
And road conditions there is much better

737
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I will take advantage of curing my hand

738
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to cut my foreskin

739
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Too tight

740
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,991
I felt pain at that time

741
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't like not to go according to planed route

742
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I never do this

743
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Don't quarrel, listen

744
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I am very familiar with this district

745
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We go through this province road

746
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
At least we should inform jail, shouldn't we?

747
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
No need, don't doubt me

748
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's legal

749
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,991
I decide

750
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,993
Aren't you punished enough by jail?

751
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,993
Go that way, I said

752
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,991
Turn left

753
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Seems you are right

754
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,993
The road is more comfortable

755
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Stop!

756
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's cozy driving here

757
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But what's matter with you?

758
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Stop! I said!

759
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,991
Ok, ok

760
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Don't be silly, guy

761
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
they quarrel

762
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Don't you know why I do like that?

763
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I think I know, but

764
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I listen!

765
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Alright

766
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I kissed your wife

767
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Say it again!

768
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I kissed your wife
I kissed your wife

769
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I kissed your wife

770
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You kissed her many times!

771
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Alright, yes, many times

772
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
How could I don't know like a stupid pig!

773
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Don't be like that, it will mess up

774
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What's on earth the problem?

775
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
How bold are you

776
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Even offend my wife!

777
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This will change nothing

778
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you think that will be alright killing me?

779
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Your wife will accompany you?

780
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,993
It's you who leave me the chance!

781
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Get off, you are free!

782
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I said you are free!

783
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Go quickly!

784
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Goodbye, good luck to you

785
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I can't run away, only 6 months left

786
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,993
Don't blather! I will shoot!

787
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,993
He is so stupid! Fool! Fool!

788
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,993
It's murder for love?

789
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Don't be staleness
You will struggle out

790
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you will
I can negotiate with police

791
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
as a social welfare people

792
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I usually negotiate with manage department

793
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
If hand in the materials to them honestly

794
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
they will allow for you

795
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
No one will believe

796
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's a 30 year trial to kill two supercargos

797
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
no including your handmaid

798
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
If another 7 year trial

799
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I can't be out

800
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,991
It's headache

801
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I can't believe

802
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Are you a tough guy?

803
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes, yes

804
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
All the people said so

805
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
My husband won't know

806
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I clearly understand what attracts you

807
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Ardour, something you want to do but can't do

808
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's part of human nature

809
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,993
People can only do sometimes all his life

810
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Do you know I never see your heartthrob in the prison

811
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,993
It's only agony accompaning me

812
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,993
Feel me

813
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Please allow me to conciliate you

814
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,993
Till tonight, I feel what a wonderful time

815
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
MG is

816
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Do you know M,G
are just the acronyms of my name

817
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
no other meaning

818
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Michelle.Game

819
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
When they beat prisoner running away

820
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I lacerated my wrist

821
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,991
I try to suicide

822
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Ok, I have to go back to dark room

823
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I have to see the washing machine

824
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,991
I accompany you

825
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Alright, ok

826
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
No, no
I won't tell you address

827
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It will bring them trouble

828
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
No, no, it's alright

829
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
They admitted, mine is true

830
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,993
thank you, sir, thanks

831
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Your plan is nothing to me

832
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,991
What?

833
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Can you find another way to wash his clothes

834
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,991
She is busy

835
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Why should I run away?

836
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Just now you implored them to let you go

837
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Now you don't want to go?

838
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I don't want to be utterly isolated

839
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's my only chance
Jean-Louis

840
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,993
I have to stay to look after my family

841
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Any good news?

842
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,993
Very good news

843
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Aren't you care about me?

844
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You'd better go to have a look

845
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, no, do what?

846
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I can't hear the sound of washing machine

847
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,991
Maybe it's finished

848
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
All these will be over soon

849
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You have plan finnally?

850
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
After 11 tomorrow morning

851
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
only bad memory left

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
no bad

853
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Anyway, that's it

854
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Do you have local wine?

855
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes, but

856
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I don't want to dinner ourselvies

857
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Should prepare for them

858
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's a pity to say goodbye

859
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
There are many good wines

860
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It was my job

861
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I was keeping bodega

862
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Quick

863
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You two can drink one cup 

864
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Isn't it, Jean-Louis ?

865
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So see you later

866
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Ok, ok, see you later

867
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,993
So you can enjoy the wine here quietly

868
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Aren't you really hungry?

869
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I never ate such a wonderful food

870
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I usually think of my home town

871
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,993
Many friends gathered in a house like yours

872
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Gilbert,
We are going

873
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I have got a plan

874
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Say it tomorrow,
Now is resting time

875
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,993
can't you leave your stomach empty

876
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I want to drink a small cup

877
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You got the right place

878
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I go to choose several bottles of good wine

879
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,993
Let you full of human kindness

880
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Pity can't go to have a look

881
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's by nose tasting the wine, not liver

882
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It makes me think of the scent in the dyewoods

883
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a scent with violet

884
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
aftertaste is filbert

885
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The child is talent
have a good smell

886
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,993
You are totally right
We should taste wine like that

887
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
keeping a kind of rhythm

888
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,993
Otherwise we will confuse the taste of wine

889
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Isn't it our first wine tasted?

890
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Only

891
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
a bit thick

892
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Maybe deposited more 5 years

893
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
How could you guess?

894
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,993
Just feeling, of course experience, too

895
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The thicker woods's scent

896
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
the harder to fidget

897
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's too suprised

898
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
How striking the child is!

899
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Wonder child!

900
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,993
What if my customers like you

901
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This wine comes from

902
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Chile

903
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
My cousin brought to me there

904
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
If I'm not wrong, It's famous

905
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm pleased not to worry about child's study

906
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Come, quickly
Daniel is keeping there

907
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Don't you want to go?

908
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,993
We should be away from crime, especially for youth

909
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Good luck, uncle

910
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
No!

911
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Stay here will be hapless

912
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Shit! Don't be lah-de-dah

913
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,991
I don't

914
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,991
Quickly!

915
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What's wrong?

916
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Could you please turn on the lamp of hallway?

917
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
No

918
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Are you mixing things up?

919
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's too dark

920
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I will drop downstairs

921
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Then I go first

922
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You take care of yourselvies

923
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,991
Go quickly!

924
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Come

925
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Enjoy the poetic wine

926
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Enjoy it

927
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Poet Beaudelaire!

928
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
My son complied a poem about wine

929
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He likes poem

930
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Politics is like a wine

931
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
on changing the world

932
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,993
If fancy even in an old age

933
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
it's the thing I mostly want

934
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
beside wife

935
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Do you see her ass?

936
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,993
Don't be like that
It's normal to say that

937
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I was mad for it

938
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Round, stout, smooth

939
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Lure me like a forbidden fruit

940
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,993
Even after 20's marriage
I still love

941
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Look, so strange

942
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Light outside are on

943
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Maybe some birds fly through

944
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,993
I must keep the door clean

945
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You are not fool, come in

946
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Don't force me to shoot

947
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,993
Not me, I didn't want to, it's

948
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Damn!

949
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
How to do?

950
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,991
Let's show our hands

951
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
He will trouble us sooner or later

952
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
This guy is too selfish

953
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Never think of others

954
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
But can't kill for this reason

955
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Only you say that

956
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If he bring the police

957
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Who will say you don't kill anybody in my home

958
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,993
You are right
Whatever we can't let police come

959
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,993
I think he has been after handmaid

960
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
maybe it's the sound of fireworks

961
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,993
Nothing, sleep, dear

962
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Before morning today

963
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I never see the dead man

964
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Ah, drag his leg
drag him in

965
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
To an actor

966
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,993
It's a beautiful way

967
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Think creeper stems, you will be better

968
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I never meet lucky

969
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Meet one thing like this

970
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
will suffer from it

971
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I just want to protect family

972
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
What you protected is yours

973
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's from my mother

974
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
This room and store are both my uncle's

975
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
We take charge of his aged

976
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Now he is dead, need nothing

977
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That's what I just said

978
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm protecting my family

979
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,993
You are too young to understand

980
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
How is your leg?

981
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Fine, thanks

982
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Go upstairs, child

983
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,993
It's what you premediate, too?

984
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
What have you done to my daughter?

985
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
She became so treasonable

986
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Forgive her

987
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
She is too excited celebrating our marriage anniversaty

988
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Now we can talk

989
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
All will be the same soon

990
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Now, listen to Mr. MG to tell his plan

991
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
If you do as I say

992
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
After tomorrow noon

993
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You can do whatever you want

994
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
All are arranged well

995
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's he who planed!

996
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
He owe me

997
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Great

998
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
An hour later

999
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You go to receive our false passports

1000
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
and our merited money

1001
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Then your wife will take you to the exit of the city

1002
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Let's bet

1003
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Police will only check two men

1004
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
won't pay attention to a couple

1005
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You let him alight first

1006
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
then come back to see us

1007
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
bring me

1008
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I can go with you any place you want

1009
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Which car?

1010
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Uncle's

1011
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's because of you

1012
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
he needn't the car any more

1013
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Don't say like that

1014
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
My honey

1015
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Aren't these all because of me?

1016
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
If you could listen to my suggestion

1017
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I wouldn't not say a word

1018
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I have encountered your jugglery one year before

1019
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
pity! Child

1020
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
When did you become so capable?

1021
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
If nothing else, dad, I go upstairs

1022
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I can't endure any more

1023
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Look at you

1024
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Hold forth

1025
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Clear and logical on educating me

1026
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And hug me smarmy

1027
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I hate this kind of life

1028
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You no heart!

1029
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
We are come from this age

1030
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's youth at 18 

1031
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
If I can't go with you
I'll suicide

1032
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Go, Bring something to me to eat

1033
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Enough

1034
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I don't want to stay here without doing anything

1035
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Look, so interesting!

1036
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Don't be mistake, impossible!

1037
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's all true!

1038
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But it's meaningless of realistic things

1039
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hasn't Picasso a realistic attitude?

1040
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Say true thing to a dog

1041
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
To a flea which makes it scratchy
maybe it's not true

1042
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Ah, is it?

1043
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Can't you see
it will become worse?

1044
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,993
I can't manage too much

1045
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Do you decorate room to red?

1046
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I'm here waiting for you

1047
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,993
But you needn't wait outside

1048
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You can have a look

1049
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm not feeling galling

1050
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
On the contrary

1051
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I think show my body to you

1052
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,993
like show insider a paint

1053
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
What do you think of me?

1054
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,991
Closer

1055
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,993
I even write a word

1056
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Do you want me?

1057
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,993
I will disappoint you
It's my first time

1058
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
No real

1059
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Although have, I don't know

1060
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
To be honest, I really don't know 

1061
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
When I know my chaperon is prostitute

1062
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I left her

1063
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
She asked me to do 

1064
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,991
That's all

1065
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
But now
all are finished

1066
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Since then
I never touch other girl

1067
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Do you like boy?

1068
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If you will

1069
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
let me lean you like this

1070
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
no

1071
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
What I want to do now is to be a gardener

1072
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Better own a garden somewhere

1073
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But far away from here

1074
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,991
Don't you?

1075
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,993
I think we are far away, far away

1076
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm afraid of myself, I want to die

1077
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I hate myself

1078
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Do you know?

1079
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
How I hate myself!

1080
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I always think that I'm competent for anything

1081
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,991
even fly to the sky

1082
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It's you

1083
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Daniel

1084
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Where do you go with that dress?

1085
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,991
Fishing

1086
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,991
Me, too

1087
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
To some extent

1088
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm fishing, a big fish

1089
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,993
Don't you see any person doubtful in the street?

1090
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Don't you hear any news?

1091
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Don't you know anything?

1092
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
There is something around

1093
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I am busy with 20 anniversary

1094
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Two persons killed their two colleagues with their weapons

1095
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It deserves consideration

1096
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
If you see
somebody doubtful

1097
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Don't forget to inform me

1098
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,993
After making contribution, I can enjoy my life

1099
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's difficult to be a police.

1100
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Can I go?

1101
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,991
Goodbye

1102
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,993
What can I do now?

1103
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,993
There is a vacant for a fisher

1104
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
There is a stool there

1105
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Cloth bag

1106
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,993
and fishing rod, for sea fish

1107
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
This person is Nobel whom you are looking for

1108
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,993
I knew nothing

1109
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You go closer,and will see a basket in the water

1110
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There is a big crab inside

1111
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
You should check whether there is or not

1112
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Remember, don't  be mistake

1113
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It's so complicated

1114
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But can get effect instantly

1115
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You exchange the cloth bags

1116
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,991
Then leave

1117
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Somebody nearby will inspect you

1118
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Ensure that you have done what you need to

1119
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,991
He will leave

1120
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's your mobile phone

1121
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,993
Phone me after finishing

1122
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Do you fish many fishes?

1123
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,991
Many, many

1124
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Hello?

1125
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Is that Mrs. Roze

1126
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yes

1127
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
For two years

1128
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
My son can't go to school for children of psychosis

1129
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Two years

1130
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
This is delayed from your first meeting to now

1131
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Shall we talk about this in my office

1132
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
How about the day after tomorrow

1133
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's just a misunderstanding

1134
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You won't have any loss

1135
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I know you won't solve the problem

1136
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Bad woman!
I curse you! Damn it!

1137
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,993
Who gives you my mobile phone number?

1138
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Such trivias bother me too much

1139
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I hear her complain because we are friend

1140
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Just nearby

1141
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Retired soon

1142
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And I think these words are not blithering

1143
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
there was a child

1144
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Chance is so small, isn't it

1145
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
My cousin got the similiar disease

1146
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Sorry, I forget

1147
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,993
I have to phone him agian

1148
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
What happened to him?

1149
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
He won't come back

1150
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I know him, real

1151
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
He must be go away with money

1152
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It's the best gift in the marriage anniversary

1153
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
He leaves daughter and you alone?

1154
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
He have been waiting for the day for a long time

1155
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Me, too

1156
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You won't kill me, will you?

1157
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
There is any kind of person in your family

1158
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,993
It's normal, normal

1159
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,993
Gilbert said right, shouldn't let him go

1160
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,991
He is back

1161
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Hi

1162
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,991
It's for you

1163
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,991
Please sigh in

1164
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,991
Ok

1165
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Ah, ba careful, don't fall over yourself

1166
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Wish you happy

1167
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Stupid pig!

1168
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I told him to take the passport, but cheated by him

1169
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Shit!

1170
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It's from elder brother's wife

1171
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I guess is a gift for our marriage anniversary

1172
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,993
can I take apart it?

1173
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I hate her all the time, too jealous

1174
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Go, go to find my husband

1175
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Don't worry
I don't intent to do that

1176
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
My his mistress occupies his money,
it's too abnormal

1177
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Do you know where is he?

1178
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
20 year's marriage
I know him clearly

1179
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,991
Let's go

1180
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You husband went like this?

1181
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
He is cozy

1182
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
From now on

1183
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
He keep the money without going out

1184
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
No one will know

1185
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Who will say it out?

1186
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Better not stay in the frame house alone

1187
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Don't you thank me?

1188
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
What did I do recently?

1189
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Attracted by a girl and neglect MG?

1190
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Thank you for your trust on me

1191
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You should wear a neckcloth
but it's ok

1192
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
We have no other choice

1193
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's our last chance

1194
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I will come back to find you

1195
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Quickly

1196
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
If he has arrive in his mistress's home

1197
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We are late

1198
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Can you be here?

1199
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,991
Can

1200
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
see you later, dear

1201
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Magali, forgive me

1202
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I know you hate me

1203
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I never want to hurt you

1204
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's all for you

1205
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Close the water pipe

1206
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
If Daniel came back, give me a call

1207
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,993
MG! Take care!

1208
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,993
He did something silly

1209
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Drive Jean-Louis 's car?

1210
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
No, that will be attention-getting and troublesome

1211
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,991
Frive my car

1212
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Cheat me

1213
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
They all cheat me

1214
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Believe my mother

1215
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
She is a dirty woman, too

1216
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
She must find my father, and money

1217
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,991
Especially money

1218
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Without me, MG will lose

1219
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I can't understand

1220
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Why does he risk to be here?

1221
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
My mother won't let him fiddle

1222
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Let's see, I will protect my family when he comes 

1223
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I won't refuse you

1224
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I will share all these with you

1225
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Like your chaperon

1226
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Let his brains down to the blanket

1227
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Pong!

1228
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Many prisoner will do anything for running away

1229
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Are you forced?

1230
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I, I don't want to run away

1231
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I just don't know what should I do

1232
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
How can I run away

1233
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
How can I killed two policemen

1234
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You should know clearly

1235
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
If I tell them, they will understand

1236
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,993
But I'm not your princess yet

1237
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
If I said, nothing good to me

1238
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,993
Protect me, it's a fair trade, too

1239
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Shut up!

1240
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I think

1241
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Before going to his mistress, we come here to have a look

1242
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,993
I think he will take away the money in the shop counter first

1243
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You will sleep well here

1244
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,993
It's for you

1245
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
What wine?

1246
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
A kind of black tea wine

1247
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You make me happy, dear

1248
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
His only lover is me

1249
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
We are still sweet like first love

1250
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Do yo understand?

1251
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Do you want to not be found by police when urgent?

1252
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,993
Stay there

1253
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Oh, no,he took my bag away

1254
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Don't you lock the door?

1255
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Don't be dumbstruck
Dear, hurry up

1256
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Anyway, he can't go far

1257
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
and wounded

1258
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Don't you think I destroy the thing?

1259
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,993
No, dear

1260
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
We can live in luxury hotel for two weeks with the money

1261
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I'm proud of you

1262
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,993
I want, Sophia

1263
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,993
You are the strongest
You are the most powerful

1264
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,991
Don't touch me!

1265
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Stupid pig!

1266
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Stop! Cheat!
I know no one respects on you

1267
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Stupid! Cheat!

1268
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You are nothing
Like a shit!

1269
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,993
What the use of you
Dally woman?

1270
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Leave her alone

1271
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You can do whatever you want

1272
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
No one will pay attention to you!

1273
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,993
I'm leaving
Run wild yourself

1274
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,993
Louis! Jean-Louis !

1275
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Am I mistake, I

1276
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Jean-Louis !

1277
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Ah, there is somebody in the backup box

1278
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
No, how could it be true

1279
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
There is somebody in the backup box!

1280
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Someone?

1281
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
How could I do?

1282
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,991
Let me out!

1283
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Ok,ok

1284
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,993
Wait a minute, I look around

1285
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,991
Who are you?

1286
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I ask you to let me out! Please!

1287
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Don't speak!

1288
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,993
Better not speak if don't want to die

1289
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,991
Daniel!

1290
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,993
Even no one here!

1291
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,991
Are you here?

1292
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Daniel, it's me, Francois

1293
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,991
Oh, sorry

1294
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,991
Marsanne!

1295
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,991
Bad

1296
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm sorry

1297
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,993
That's alright, sorry

1298
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I come to find a thing

1299
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
you know my dog

1300
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You dog always relieve itself in our garden

1301
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yes, right

1302
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Because there is gap in the fense, so it can be there

1303
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I come for this

1304
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Some materials are on sale

1305
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Maybe

1306
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I don't know, either

1307
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I remembered some

1308
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But maybe we souldn't talk about this

1309
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Then talk later, I come several days later

1310
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Kill him, dear

1311
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Shoot

1312
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Shoot for me

1313
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Please do it for me

1314
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Do you know
You are nothing

1315
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,993
We have no responsibility at all
really

1316
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Mr. Roze
Why you changed to this

1317
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,993
Gilbert, where are you
All are over

1318
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Hello?

1319
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I'm locked in the backup box of Jean-Louis's car

1320
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Do you have anything?

1321
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,993
No, I'm coming, I'm coming

1322
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,993
Keep for the cleaning of the room

1323
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What we did?
We did?

1324
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Nothing, dear
nothing

1325
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,993
We love each other, that's important

1326
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,991
I can't endure

1327
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,993
You look out, I go to the toilet

1328
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,993
I think they lose many things

1329
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It's me, let's go

1330
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Let me go first

1331
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Not now, after go out of the city

1332
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
How can
I have to keep in touch with you

1333
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
How can in the backup box

1334
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,993
You are good at talking

1335
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,991
Wait a minute, sorry

1336
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
What happened

1337
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,993
I have a better way

1338
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Hello, yes

1339
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,993
I'm beside a garage of Floricans(pronunciation)

1340
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You know, Daniel won't do anything

1341
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Look, dear
All are coming

1342
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
All neighbours are coming

1343
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It will be a beautiful memory
All are kind

1344
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Yes, they are kind
kind really

1345
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,991
I'm grateful

1346
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Don't worry, that's only a mistake

1347
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
We'll be back soon

1348
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Now it's time to go

1349
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Don't let them wait

1350
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
The earlier we go, the earlier we return

1351
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,991
See you later!

1352
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,993
Sorry, daniel

1353
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Don't you forget to turn off the hydrant

1354
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Béatrice is my wife's friend
Alter ego

1355
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
my cooperative fellow, too

1356
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I observed early

1357
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Feel of frustration mentally probably

1358
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
disturb people's attitude on things

1359
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
As for hostage
I want to say

1360
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Those who captured hostage need status identity

1361
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,993
Then they will release hostage

1362
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Of course, hostage problem is a social problem deserve consideration

1363
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Need further analysis

1364
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Now

1365
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
A publisher has negotiated with us

1366
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
to publish a scribble corpus about this problem

1367
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Is there a fly on it?

1368
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,993
No, I don't want to talk things about Mr. Roze in public

1369
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
He is good businessman

1370
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Loves family, especially his daughter

1371
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
When I get them out of the dark room

1372
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,993
She is dowdy, tried to suicide once, I think

1373
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Web address is:
www.two-rozes.com

1374
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
two means Secondary_two in english

1375
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It's about this family's video archive on the site

1376
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,993
remember the address
www.two-rozes.com

1377
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Are you clear? Welcome

1378
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Is there any problem between neighbourhood?

1379
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Two escaped criminal now is still away

1380
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,993
Magali Rozes's best friend:
Agnes disappeared from yesterday

1381
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It is said that the last time people saw her

1382
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
She is with Magali's uncle

1383
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,993
who is one of the casualties of the case

1384
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Where shall we go now?

1385
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
MG?

1386
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Don't call me that way
I'm not wise

1387
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I don't care where to go
because I 'm free already

1388
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
How do you spend the money?

1389
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Buy your uncle's house?

1390
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,993
I have no home
but will buy it at last

1391
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,993
Alright
Jump out of the car here

1392
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,993
Look, she is really so unlucky

1393
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Do you plan to open a garden?

1394
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I studied the problem carefully

1395
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
However fragrant the flower is, it will fade at last

1396
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
What about your friend Béatrice?

1397
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
You can help him!

1398
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
He is dealing in other places

1399
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's said seedlings of flowers and woods are not expensive

1400
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You can look for his brother-in-law

1401
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
He is looking for investor

1402
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,991
Look, you are not silly
