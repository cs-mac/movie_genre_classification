FABER COLLEGE - 1962

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
(Bell tolling)

4
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
Take off that beanie.

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,700
-We're meant to wear them to homecoming.
-Don't be a fruit, okay?

6
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,200
(Sniffing)

7
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,600
(Exhales and sniffs)

8
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Okay.

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,500
(Knocking on door)

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
Doug Neidermeyer,
Omega membership chairman.

11
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,300
Larry Kroger.

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,700
This is my roommate, Kent Dorfman.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,700
Hi there. Doug Neidermeyer.

14
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,600
These are our name-tag hostesses,
Mandy Pepperidge and Babs Jansen.

15
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,100
BABS: Hi there, Kent. Hi, Larry.

16
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
-Welcome to Omega house.
-Thank you.

17
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,800
-Nice to--
-Why don't we go meet some of the guys?

18
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,500
(Piano playing)

19
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,100
(Babs and Mandy laughing)

20
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,100
A wimp and a blimp.

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
(Piano playing grows louder)

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,600
There are many great guys here,
so don't feel you have to meet everyone.

23
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,600
We just want you to enjoy yourselves
while you're here.

24
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,300
OMEGA: ...Omega house has more
activities...

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,500
than most campus fraternities,
is far superior....

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,100
-Mandy.
-Hi.

27
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Right there.

28
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,900
Hi there, fellows. Meet Ken and Lonny.

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
Larry.

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Ken, Lonny, l'd like you to meet...

31
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,200
Mohammet...

32
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,600
Jugdish, Sidney and Clayton.

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Grab a seat and make yourselves at home.

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,700
Don't be shy about helping yourselves
to punch and cookies.

35
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,100
(Guests chatting)

36
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,500
(Piano continues playing)

37
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,900
GREG: l'm not going to say Omega's
the best house on campus...

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,300
but a lot of outstanding guys figure
they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.

39
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,700
We do have more than our share
of campus leaders...

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,800
something that never looks bad
on your permanent record.

41
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,100
Sure. Everybody says
Omega's the best, but...

42
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
I hate to seem...

43
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,500
you know, pushy.

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,700
Let the unacceptable candidates worry,
because after tonight, they're....

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,100
...you are...Kent!

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm Greg Marmalard,
president of Omega House.

47
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,500
Meet my friends, Mandy Pepperidge...

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
We already met.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
GREG: ...and Chip Diller.
CHIP: How are you?

50
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,200
How are you?

51
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,900
Over there is Terry Auerback,
captain of the swim team.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,800
That's Carl Phillips,
editor of the Daily Faberian.

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
And...

54
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,200
Clayton.

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,800
Sidney.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Jugdish, Mohammet, Lonny--

57
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
-We already met.
-Super!

58
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,200
Then you'll have lots to talk about.

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,900
-I don't think you're trying very hard.
-I hate this.

60
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,200
No sweat. My brother Fred was a Delta
That makes me a legacy.

61
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,700
They have to take me. It's their law.
Don't worry. I'll put in a good word for you.

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Great. I heard Delta's
the worst house on campus.

63
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,800
(Rock and roll music)

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,000
(Urinating)

65
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,700
Excuse me, sir. Is this the Delta house?

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sure.

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Come on in.

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,800
(Students screaming)

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,900
(Rock music)

70
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,300
(Crashing)

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,500
Grab a brew.

72
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,600
Don't cost nothing.

73
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,900
See you later.

74
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,000
(Students chatting)

75
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,500
(Glass shattering)

76
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,000
CARD PLAYER: And bump you $20.

77
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,700
Hi, guys.

78
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,000
You guys playing cards?

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,700
KATY: You want another beer?

80
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Hi.

81
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,200
-You want a beer, Larry?
-Sure.

82
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
KATY: Nice fish.

83
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,500
-I'm Robert Hoover, chapter president.
-Hi, Robert.

84
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,900
HOOVER: Have you seen Boon?
KATY: He disappeared when we got here.

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
He's probably upstairs talking to Otter.

86
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
No doubt.

87
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
They're well-known homosexuals.

88
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,300
Have another beer. She's just kidding.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
HOOVER: Right, Bluto?

90
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,400
(Otter whistling)

91
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
You going out tonight, Otter?

92
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,100
Norma?

93
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,400
No. Let me give you a hint.
She's got a couple of major-league yabos.

94
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,300
BOON: Beverly!
OTTER: No.

95
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,900
But you're getting warmer.

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,900
Let me give you another hint.
Does this ring a bell?

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,200
-(Effeminately) "Oh, God. Oh, God!"
-Marlene.

98
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,200
You're going to pork Marlene Desmond?

99
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,100
-Pork?
-You're gonna hump her brains out.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,900
I anticipate a deeply religious experience.

101
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Why the interest in my social life?
Where's Katy?

102
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,900
Downstairs, pissed off about something.

103
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,200
She thinks you're an immature jerk?

104
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Yeah.

105
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
I don't take anything seriously.

106
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,200
She'll take this seriously.

107
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Try it.

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,300
-You guys coming down?
-This thing talk?

109
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,800
HOOVER: There are 50 people
trying to get into this fraternity.

110
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,000
Otter, you are the rush chairman.
You should be present at the rush party.

111
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman.

112
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,800
OTTER: Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

113
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,500
BOON: D-Day!

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,300
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

115
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,000
That was Eric Stratton.
He was damn glad to meet you.

116
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,000
Larry, l see you've met D-Day.
You're having a nice time. That's good.

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,900
(Plays upbeat tune by tapping on his throat)

118
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,700
Eric Stratton. Damn glad to meet you.

119
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice tie!

120
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,000
Is that a clip-on?
Boon, come check this out.

121
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Excuse me. Pardon me.

122
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,300
Ninety percent rayon! Very nice.

123
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,300
Hi, boys. Having a good time, l hope?

124
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Excuse me.

125
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,700
-Did your mother buy that?
-Yes.

126
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,500
Kent is a legacy, Otter.
His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman.

127
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,500
He said legacies
get asked to pledge automatically.

128
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,000
Usually, unless the pledge in question
is a real closet case, like Fred.

129
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,100
-My brother.
-Kent, come over here.

130
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
-I liked the tie.
-Great tie.

131
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,600
BOON: Katy.

132
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,700
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

133
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,800
Katy!

134
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,400
(Romantic instrumental music)

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,300
-Where are you going?
-Home.

136
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,600
-We just got here!
-No, you just got here.

137
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,900
I've been downstairs entertaining some kid
from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas.

138
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,500
Maybe we could drive
to your folks' place this weekend.

139
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,500
Fabulous.

140
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,100
My car filled with your beer buddies going
up to empty my parents' liquor cabinet?

141
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,500
It's too depressing to think about.

142
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Just you and me, and Otter and another girl.

143
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,700
Is this what you're going to do
for the rest of your life?

144
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
BOON: What do you mean?

145
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,500
Hanging around with animals,
getting drunk every weekend?

146
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,800
BOON: No.

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
After l graduate...

148
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm going to get drunk every night.

149
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,800
(Boon humming)

150
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,900
I think l'm in love with a retard.

151
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,600
Is he bigger than me?

152
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,800
(Solemn instrumental music)

153
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,100
WORMER: Greg...

154
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,800
what is the worst fraternity on this campus?

155
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,000
That would be hard to say, sir.
They're each outstanding in their own way--

156
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Cut the horseshit, son.
I've got their disciplinary files here.

157
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies
into the swim meet?

158
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,500
Who delivered the medical-school cadavers
to the alumni dinner?

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,700
Every Halloween,
the trees are filled with underwear.

160
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,600
Every spring, the toilets explode.

161
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,700
You're talking about Delta, sir.

162
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,700
Of course l'm talking about Delta,
you twerp!

163
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
This year, it's gonna be different.

164
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,700
This year we'll grab the bull by the balls...

165
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,400
and kick those punks off campus!

166
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,200
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

167
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,900
WORMER: They are?
GREG: Yes, sir.

168
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Oh....

169
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,400
Then as of now,
they're on double secret probation!

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
Double secret probation, sir?

171
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,000
There is a little-known codicil
in the Faber College Constitution...

172
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,600
which gives the Dean
unlimited power to preserve order...

173
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,800
in time of campus emergency.

174
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,100
Find me a way to revoke Delta's charter.

175
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
You live next door.

176
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Put Neidermeyer on it.
He's a sneaky little shit just like you, right?

177
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down.

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,300
And that foot is me.

179
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,300
Larry Kroger. All in favour.

180
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,100
(All cheering)

181
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,700
DELTA: We need the dues.

182
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,000
Good. Larry Kroger is now a pledge
to Delta Next slide, please.

183
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
(Projector clicks)

184
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,300
(All screaming)

185
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,900
(All booing)

186
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,500
Just a minute! Just settle down!

187
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,600
This is Kent Dorfman.
He's a legacy from Harrisburg.

188
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,000
(All screaming)

189
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Now wait a minute!

190
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,200
Okay, this guy is a real zero. That's true.

191
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Think back to when you were freshmen.

192
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,600
HOOVER: Boon, you had a face
like a pepperoni pizza, right?

193
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,900
And Stork here. Everybody thought
that Stork was brain damaged.

194
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,600
I myself was so obnoxious...

195
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,300
the seniors beat me up once a week.

196
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,700
So this guy is a total loser?

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Let me tell you the story of another loser.

198
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,900
(All screaming)

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,200
(Clock ticking)

200
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,900
OTTER: Get up!

201
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,300
(Screaming)

202
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
OTTER: (Screaming) Let's go! On your feet!

203
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,000
(All screaming excitedly)

204
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
"l...." State your name.

205
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,900
ALL: l...state your name.

206
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,000
"...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat."

207
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat.

208
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,500
"With liberty and fraternity for all."

209
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Amen.

210
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
Sergeant at Arms...

211
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,300
do your duty.

212
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,800
From now on,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel.

213
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
From now on your name is Mothball.

214
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,200
Kroger, your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto.

215
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,400
-Why Pinto?
-Why not?

216
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,800
What's my Delta Tau Chi name?

217
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,900
Dorfman, l've given this a lot of thought.

218
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,200
From now on...

219
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,700
your name is Flounder.

220
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,900
Flounder?

221
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
(All screaming)

222
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
(Rock and roll music)

223
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
(Singing along with rock and roll song)

224
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,000
(Laughing)

225
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

226
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,900
DOUG: We now consecrate
the bond of obedience.

227
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
Assume the position.

228
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,700
Thank you, sir. May l have another?

229
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,700
Thank you, sir. May l have another?

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,300
Thank you, sir. May l have another?

231
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,900
Now, what can we say...

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,700
of John Milton's...

233
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,300
Paradise Lost?

234
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,900
It's a Iong poem, written...

235
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
a Iong time ago, and l'm sure...

236
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,100
a Iot ofyou have difficulty understanding...

237
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,600
exactly what Milton was trying to say.

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
Certainly we know that he was trying to...

239
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,400
describe the struggle
between good and evil, right?

240
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Okay.

241
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,200
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

242
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Satan.

243
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,000
Now was Milton trying to tell us...

244
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,100
that being bad was more fun
than being good?

245
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay.

246
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't write this down,
but l find Milton probably...

247
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,800
as boring as you find Milton.

248
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,600
Mrs. Milton found him boring, too.

249
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,000
He's a little bit long-winded...

250
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,100
he doesn't translate very well into
our generation, and his jokes are terrible.

251
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
(Bell rings)

252
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,800
But that doesn't relieve you
from your responsibility for this materiaI.

253
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm waiting for reports from some of you.

254
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm not joking! This is my job.

255
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,800
Come on, Mandy, l would tell you.

256
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Are you and Greg doing the dirty deed?

257
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,500
Greg doesn't believe
in premarital intercourse.

258
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,400
Too bad.

259
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
I think he's just dreamy.

260
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,600
CHIP: And one, two, three, four....

261
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,300
(Chip continues counting cadence)

262
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,900
Company, halt!

263
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,900
(Dramatic instrumental music)

264
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,600
(Horse snorting)

265
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,200
DOUG: Dress that line.

266
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Dress that line, mister!

267
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,700
Dress that line, soldier.

268
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,800
Mister, hold my mount.

269
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,900
You fat, disgusting slob!

270
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,800
You're a goddamned disgrace!

271
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
A vicious mother, isn't he?

272
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,700
He can't do that to our pledges.

273
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,100
Only we can do that to our pledges.

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
Redo those buttons!

275
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,700
Dress that belt buckle!

276
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,800
Straighten that cap!

277
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
And goddamn it, tuck up those pyjamas!

278
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,900
Attention! Eyes front!

279
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,100
What's that on your chest, mister?

280
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,700
-It's a pledge pin, sir.
-A pledge pin!

281
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,200
On your uniform?

282
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Hooked it. Shit.

283
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,200
Just tell me, mister,
what fraternity would pledge...

284
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
a man like you?

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
It's a Delta pin, sir.

286
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,300
Slice!

287
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,900
Report to the stable tonight
and every night at 1900 hours.

288
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,100
Without that pledge pin!

289
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,700
Do you understand?

290
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
Your left arm is straight...

291
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,500
but you're not keeping your head down.

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
DOUG: You're all worthless and weak!

293
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,500
Now drop and give me 20!

294
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,600
(Horse snorting)

295
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,900
(Horse neighing)

296
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Get back in ranks!

297
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,900
Always try to hit through the ball.

298
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,400
(Shouting)

299
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,300
(Metal helmet clangs)

300
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,700
(Doug screaming)

301
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,000
I've gotta work on my game.

302
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,500
Don't think of it as work.
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself.

303
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,000
BOON: l want you to fix Pinto up,
but it has to be a very special girl.

304
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,100
She should be decent-looking,
but we'll trade looks for...

305
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,200
a certain kind of morally casual attitude.

306
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,900
Somebody he can screw on the first date.

307
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Well put. You see, Pinto's never been laid.
What did l say?

308
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,200
Don't embarrass me in front of Dave.
He's the only professor l like.

309
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,000
Mr. Jennings is a wonderful teacher.

310
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,500
Teaching pays the rent till l finish my novel.

311
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,900
How long have you been working on it?

312
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,700
Four and a half years.

313
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,400
Must be very good.

314
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,200
It's a piece of shit.

315
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,800
(Soft instrumental music)

316
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,300
Would anybody like to smoke some pot?

317
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,500
Yeah.

318
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,800
You ever smoked before?

319
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,700
Sure.

320
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
When did you ever smoke pot?

321
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,700
I've done a lot of things
you don't know about.

322
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,000
I won't go schizo, will l?

323
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
There's a distinct possibility.

324
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
Is this right?

325
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,400
Try not to drool quite so much
on the end of it.

326
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,800
(Coughing)

327
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,900
(Singing) Hey, Paula

328
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,000
I wanna marry you

329
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,800
Hey, Paula

330
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,100
Nobody else could ever do

331
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,100
I've waited so long

332
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,200
For school to be through

333
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I can't wait no more for you

334
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Okay.

335
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
That means that...

336
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,600
our whole solar system...

337
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
could be, like...

338
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,800
one tiny atom in the fingernail
of some other giant being.

339
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,300
This is too much!

340
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,200
That means...

341
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,400
-one tiny atom in my fingernail could be--
-Could be one little...

342
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,100
tiny universe.

343
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,400
Could l buy some pot from you?

344
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,900
(Snorting loudly)

345
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
(Horse neighing)

346
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,900
DOUG: Give me that.

347
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,600
Yeah, baby.

348
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,100
Good baby. It's all right. You stupid....

349
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,300
Dorfman! What kind of man
hits a defenceless animal?

350
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,100
I've got a good mind to smash your fat face.

351
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,100
Listen up, you nauseating pile of blubber.

352
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,100
Your days are numbered at Faber.
You and all your sick Delta buddies.

353
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,000
Meantime, your ass belongs to me.

354
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,100
Now, drop and give me 20.

355
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,400
FLOUNDER: But....

356
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,200
Hit it!

357
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
Trooper, baby.

358
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,800

(Comical instrumental music)

360
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
DOUG: Come here, baby.

361
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Cutie-pie.

362
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I want these quarters standing taIl
by 0900 tomorrow.

363
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,100
DOUG: You got that?
FLOUNDER: Yes, sir.

364
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,200
Brother D-Day, brother Bluto.

365
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,800
You hate that ying-yang?

366
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,200
-Who?
-Neidermeyer. You hate his guts?

367
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,500
-I guess so.
-You guess so?

368
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,800
Yes, l hate him! l hate his guts!

369
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,400
We have an old saying in Delta

370
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,900
"Don't get mad, get even."

371

373

FLOUNDER: Nice horsey. Good. Let's go.

374
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,100
He's in there!

375
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
Boy, is this great!

376
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,000
Now finish it, Flounder.

377
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,100
Are you kidding?
l never shot anything before in my life.

378
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
-I thought you hated Neidermeyer's guts.
-I do.

379
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,100
And the horse? ls there anything in
the world you hate as much as that horse?

380
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Get it over with.

381
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,600
(Cocks pistol)

382
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,100
(Dramatic instrumental music)

383
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,600
-Just blanks, right?
-Right.

384
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,300
(Dramatic instrumental music continues)

(Horse collapses)

388
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,500
-Holy shit!
-There were blanks in that gun!

389
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,300
-I didn't even point the gun at him!
-Holy shit!

390
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,300
There were blanks.

391
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,800
-Maybe he had a heart attack.
-Holy shit!

392
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,300
(Screaming)

393
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,400
If you want the homecoming parade
in my town...

394
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,300
you have to pay.

395
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Carmine, l think it's wrong
to extort money from the college.

396
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100
Look...

397
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,000
as the mayor of Faber,
l've got big responsibilities.

398
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,700
These parades are very expensive.

399
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,700
You're using my police...

400
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,800
my sanitation people, my free Oldsmobiles.

401
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,500
If you mention extortion again...

402
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
I'll have your legs broken.

403
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
(Chuckling)

404
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,300
I'm sure l can arrange a nice honorarium
from the student fund.

405
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
Another thing.

406
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,600
You better sit
on that zoo fraternity of yours.

407
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
I don't want no drunken riots in my town.

408
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,100
Don't worry. I've got those boys
just where l want them.

409
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,900
We'll have the best homecoming parade
Faber's ever had.

410
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,500
(Chainsaw roars)

411

(Rock and roll music)

OTTER: Mandy!

413
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,500
-I haven't seen you since we--
-Go away.

414
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I can only stay a minute.

415
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,800
Let me buy you lunch.

416
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,600
You've got your lunch.
How about some milk?

417
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,200
You got your milk, too.

418
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,500
Can l just massage your thighs
while you eat?

419
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,300
Do l have to leave?

420
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,200
Is this any way to treat an intimate friend?

421
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,000
(Rock and roll music continues)

422
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,500
(Murmuring in appreciation)

423
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,700
I asked you never to speak to me again.
Will you go away?

424
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,100
(Bluto imitates horse)

425
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,300
(Screams)

426
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,400
I do hope we're not interrupting anything.

427
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,600
OTTER: lf you must know--

428
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
-Eric was just leaving.
-I wasn't.

429
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I could make you leave, if you....

430
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,400
OTTER: Bluto!

431
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,000
I think you know everybody here.

432
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,700
Greg, can't you--

433
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,000
Don't worry. Just keep your hands and feet
away from his mouth.

434
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,300
Don't you have any respect for yourself?

435
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,100
BABS: This is absolutely gross!

436
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,300
That boy is a P-l-G, pig!

437
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,400
See if you can guess...

438
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,300
what l am now.

439
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,300
(Babs yells)

440
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm a zit. Get it?

441
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,400
All right, you bastard. Let's go, right here!

442
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,900
(Rock and roll music)

443
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,600
(All screaming)

444
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,800
Why don't we go out tonight?

445
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,800
Don't flatter yourself. It wasn't that great.

446
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
(Mouthing)

447
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Food fight!

MANDY: Oh, Greg.

451
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,800
Look. It's a star.

452
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,800
Let's make a wish.

453
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,600
-"Star light, star bright--"
-Wait a minute. That's not a star.

454
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,700
It's moving too fast.

455
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,900
It's probably a 707. Those babies really
can move across the sky.

456
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,500
Is anything happening yet? My arm's tired.

457
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,500
I'm sorry, Mandy.

458
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,700
That thing with the Deltas
has me a little distracted.

459
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,600
God knows how they've molested women.

460
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,400
Anything?

461
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Maybe a little faster.

462
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Yeah.

463
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,100
-How's that?
-Yes.

464
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,400
That Eric Stratton's lucky he's not in jail.

465
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,700
I'll say.

466
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,600
What?

467
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
You'll say what?

468
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,500
I'll say what?

469
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,700
You said, "l'll say," when l said,
"He should be in jail." l'm trying to figure--

470
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,400
If you're not even going to try,
l'm going to stop.

471

And not your boyfriend?

482

GIRL: Speaking of boyfriends,
how was your date with Greg?

483

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,000
(Tense instrumental music)

491
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,800
That's it.

492
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,600
(Tense instrumental music)

493
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
She broke our date.

494
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,200
-Washing her hair?
-Dead mother.

495
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,800
HOOVER: We're in trouble.

496
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The Jewish guys said
our test answers were wrong.

497
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,900
Every one?

498
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,000
Those assholes must have stolen
the wrong fucking exam!

499
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,800
(Tense instrumental music)

500
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,700
God, look what just creeped in.

501
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,000
Well, well, well.

502
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Looks like somebody forgot
there's a rule against aIcoholic beverages...

503
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
in fraternities on probation.

504
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,000
What a tool!

505
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,500
What was that?

506
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,100
I said...

507
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,600
what a shame...

508
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,100
that a few bad apples
have to spoil a good time...

509
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,500
-for everyone by breaking the rules.
-Put a sock in it...

510
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,600
or you'll be out like shit through a goose.

511
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Yes, sir.

512
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,100
Have you boys seen
your grade point average yet?

513
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,300
-Have you?
-I have, sir. It's a little below par--

514
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,800
WORMER: lt's more than a little below par.

515
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,800
It stinks!

516
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,600
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history.

517
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,800
HOOVER: Well, sir...

518
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,300
we're hoping that our midterm grades
will help our average.

519
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,600
(Laughs mockingly)

520
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,000
Laugh now...

521
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,700
because you clowns have been
on double secret probation all semester.

522
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,900
-Double secret probation?
-That means one more slip-up...

523
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,600
one more mistake...

524
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,600
and this fraternity of yours has had it...

525
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,500
at Faber.

526
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,400
(Dramatic instrumental music)

527
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,500
That was pleasant. Nice of him to stop by.

528
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,300
We must do something. He's serious this
time. I think he knows about the exams.

529
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,000
-He's right.
-You're right. We got to do something.

530
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,000
-Absolutely.
-Know what we gotta do?

531
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,300
Toga party.

532
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,900
We're on double secret probation.
We can't afford to have a toga party.

533
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,600
-You guys up for a toga party?
-Toga! Toga!

534
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,000
-They like the idea
-Otter, please don't do this.

535
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,600
I've got news for you, pal. They're
going to nail us, no matter what we do.

536
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,400
So we might as well have a good time.

537
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,300
Toga! Toga! Toga!

538
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,000
(Chanting louder and louder)

539
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,200
(All chanting)

540
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,700
It's not going to be an orgy.
It's a toga party.

541
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,800
Honestly, you're 21 years old.
In six months, you graduate.

542
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,700
Tomorrow night, you'll wrap yourself in a
sheet, pour grain alcohol all over your head.

543
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,100
-Cute, but l think l'll pass this time.
-Want me to go alone?

544
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,100
I don't want you to go at all.

545
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,200
It's a fraternity party.

546
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,300
I'm in the fraternity. How can l miss it?

547
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,500
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

548
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,200
It's funny.

549
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,100
Very funny.

550
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,900
(Sighs)

551
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,500
(Boon hooting)

552
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,400
BOON: Where did he get the wheels?
PINTO: From his brother.

553
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,400
He's letting him use it for a week.

554
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,400
Flounder's bringing his girlfriend up
for the weekend.

555
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,100
I am appointing you...

556
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,100
pledge representative
to the social committee.

557
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,400
Gee, thanks!

558
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,100
FLOUNDER: What do l do?
OTTER: Drive us to the Food King!

559
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,700
(All yelling excitedly)

560
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,500
OTTER: Food King!

561
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,700
(Whistling)

562
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,900
Otter, please.

563
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,100
-What are you doing?
-Fixing your sweater. There you go.

564
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
Keep them under there,
and keep your sweater closed.

565
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,900
-I could get in trouble.
-That's right, so...

566
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,400
be cool.

567
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,700
Mine's bigger than that.

568
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,800
-I beg your pardon?
-My cucumber, it's bigger.

569
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,200
OTTER: Vegetables can be really sensuous,
don't you think?

570
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,000
No.

571
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,800
Vegetables are sensuaI.

572
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,400
People are sensuous.

573
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,500
Right. "Sensual." That's what l meant.

574
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,700
My name is Eric Stratton. They call me Otter.

575
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,900
My name's Marion.
They call me Mrs. Wormer.

576
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,800
We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.

577
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,100
What a coincidence. I have a husband
named Dean Wormer at Faber.

578
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,100
You still want to show me your cucumber?

579
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
(Sighs)

580
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,400
Nothing for me today, thanks.

581
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,400
It looks like you gained some weight
since you came in.

582
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,200
-It's a prank. I'm pledging a fraternity.
-Don't sweat it. I won't tell.

583
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,700
The Delta Tau Chi house is having a party
tonight, and you are cordially invited.

584
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,300
I'm old enough to be your mother, almost.

585
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,600
Besides, l have to go to the goddamn
senior honours dinner tonight.

586
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,300
Oh, well....

587
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,500
Maybe some other time.

588
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,800
Doubtful.

589
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,700
Maybe?

590
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,200
So if you're not busy,
you want to go to a fraternity party?

591
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,400
-Will l be home by 1 2:00?
-Any time you want. I'll pick you up--

592
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,100
My dad would kill me
if he knew l was going to a frat house.

593
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,700
Okay if l meet you there?

594
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,400
Is it okay? lt's terrific!

595
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,200
(Loud rock music)

596
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,900
OTTER: Girls, welcome
to the Delta toga party. Come in.

597
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Let me take your coat.

598
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,800
Great pair of togas.

599
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,000
Have some delicious Delta punch,
and l'll join you in a minute.

600
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,500
(Students screaming)

601
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,600
(Glass shattering)

602
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,400
This is Sissy, my steady girl.

603
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,800
This is the guy l told you about.

604
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,000
You're even prettier than Kent said.
What a great dress.

605
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
-You two talk, and l'll get us some punch.
-Good idea

606
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,100
He's really a lucky guy.

607
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,800
Why don't we go sit down somewhere?

608
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,400
(Playing slow chords)

609
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,600
(Singing) l gave my love a cherry

610
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,200
That had no stone

611
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,300
I gave my love a chicken

612
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,700
That had no bones

613
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,900
I gave my love a story

614
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,100
That had no end

615
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,500
I gave--

616
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,700
Sorry.

617
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,800
-You look great.
-So do you.

618
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,300
I had to wait until my folks went out.

619
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,800
Get me some more punch.

620
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,300
I got a lot of catching up to do.

621
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,500
You want to dance?

622
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,600
Yes.

623
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,100
(Singing upbeat rock and roll song)

624
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,800
Yeah, Otis!

625
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,300
(All shouting)

626
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,300
(Whistling)

627

(lmitating singer)

629
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,300
(All shouting)

630
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,100
(Singing softer and softer)

631
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,000
(Singing louder and louder)

632
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,400
Gator!

633
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,800
(Music gets louder and faster)

634
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,600
(Crashing)

635
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,400
(Rock and roll song ends)

636
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,100
(Students cheering)

637
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,800
(Band plays a romantic song)

638
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,500
-Mrs. Wormer, l'm so glad you came.
-Cut the crap.

639
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,000
Give me a drink.

640
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,600
-This is Hoover's room.
-Yeah? lt's neat.

641
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,600
(Romantic song continues)

(Glass shattering)

646
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,700
I think it's locked or something.

647
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,800
CLORETTE: Just a minute.

648
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,400
Fuck her.

649
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,700
Fuck her brains out.

650
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,700
Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns.

651
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,600
You know she wants it.

652
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,200
For shame!

653
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,000
Lawrence, l'm surprised at you.

654
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,700
Don't listen to that jack-off.
Look at those gazongas.

655
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,400
You'll never get a better chance.

656
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,400
If you lay one finger
on that poor, sweet, helpless girl...

657
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,900
you'll despise yourself forever.

658
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm proud of you, Lawrence.

659
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,400
You homo!

660
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,000
(Stealthy instrumental music)

661
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,900
(Doorbell rings)

662
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,200
(Dramatic instrumental music)

663
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,300
My fault! For Christ's sake, Carmine,
how could it be my fault?

664
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,100
One of those goddamn fraternities, l guess.

665
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,700
I don't know,
but l have a pretty good idea which one.

666
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,700
I'm gonna string them up by the balls!

667
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,800
(Mrs. Wormer laughing)

668
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,300
(Solemn instrumental music)

669
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,700
I bet it was that Eric Stratton.

670
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,100
You know that for sure?

671
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,500
No, but...

672
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,100
you'd be surprised
at some of the girls he's had.

673
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,600
Very surprised.

674
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,900
(Chatting)

675
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,300
It must have been some party.

676
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,700
Unbelievable. A new low. I'm so ashamed.

677
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,600
Almost sorry l missed it.

678
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,900
-What did you do, human sacrifice?
-No, just some harmless fun.

679
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,000
Buy me a dinner tonight?

680
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,800
Can't tonight. Busy.

681
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,800
Busy tonight?

682
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,400
(lndistinct talking)

683
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,800
(Greg banging on table)

684
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,600
GREG: Please take your seats.

685
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,600
This meeting of the disciplinary council
will now come to order.

686
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:32,200
We'll waive minutes and proceed directly
with charges against Delta Tau Chi.

687
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,400
Sergeant at Arms.

688
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,700
(Deltas hissing)

689
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,100
(Greg banging on table)

690
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,300
The following charges are brought:

691
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,500
First, that the Delta house
did knowingly violate...

692
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,000
the rules governing pledge recruitment...

693
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,300
by serving alcohol to freshmen
during pledge week...

694
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,300
and after established drinking hours.

695
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,500
I'd like to address these charges
one at a time, if l may.

696
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,000
You'll get your chance, smart guy.

697
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,500
Get on with it.

698
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,300
Second, that for the fifth
consecutive semester...

699
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,000
Delta has achieved
a deficient aggregate grade point average.

700
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,500
Half the houses didn't make grades.

701
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,500
You will speak when you're told to,
and not before!

702
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,300
Read.

703
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,600
Third...

704
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:29,500
that the Delta fraternity routinely provided
dangerous narcotic diet pills...

705
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,100
-to its members during--
-That's not true!

706
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,500
Not another word!

707
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,500
...during midterm examination week.

708
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,100
And most recently...

709
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,800
that a Roman toga party was held...

710
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,500
from which we have received...

711
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,400
two dozen reports
of individual acts of perversion...

712
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,700
so profound and disgusting...

713
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,800
that decorum prohibits listing them here.

714
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,900
(Greg banging on table)

715
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,900
These are the charges
as recorded this day...

716
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,800
15 November, 1962.

717
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,900
Faithfully submitted...

718
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,900
Douglas C. Neidermeyer...

719
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,000
Sergeant at Arms.

720
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,100
(Deltas hissing)

721
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,000
-Well done.
-Robert Hoover will speak for Delta house.

722
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,300
(Deltas cheering)

723
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,800
I don't think you can
fully judge a fraternity...

724
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,600
without looking at the positive qualities
of the people in it.

725
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:42,400
The Delta house has a Iong tradition
of existence to its members...

726
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,500
and to the community at large.

727
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,600
We've heard enough, Mr. Chairman.

728
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,400
-I was told l'd have a chance to--
-That's enough.

729
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,500
The court will now decide.

730
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,100
-You said--
-He said that's it! Are you deaf?

731
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,500
Let's finish this damn thing.

732
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,700
Blow job!

733
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,900
(Deltas coughing)

734
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,200
-I don't think it's fair!
-I'll tell you what's fair and what's not!

735
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,500
Eat me!

736
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,300
-Tell those assholes to shut up.
-Shut up, assholes!

737
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,700
-Do we have to listen to this?
-Point of parliamentary procedure.

738
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,400
-Don't screw around. They're serious.
-Take it easy, l'm in prelaw.

739
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,800
-Thought you're premed?
-What's the difference?

740
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,600
Ladies and gentlemen, l'll be brief.

741
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,400
What do you think he's up to?

742
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,200
The issue here is not
whether we broke a few rules or...

743
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,700
took a few liberties
with our female party guests.

744
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,300
We did.

745
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,700
But you can't hold a whole fraternity
responsible for the behaviour of...

746
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,800
a few sick, perverted individuaIs.

747
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,400
Ifyou do...

748
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,800
shouldn't we blame
the whole fraternity system?

749
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:04,000
And if the whole fraternity system is guilty...

750
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,600
then isn't this an indictment
of our educational institutions in general?

751
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,200
(Deltas cheering)

752
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,000
I put it to you, Greg.

753
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,300
Isn't this an indictment
of our entire American society?

754
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,200
Well...

755
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,500
you can do what you want to us...

756
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,600
but we won't sit here...

757
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,100
and listen to you badmouth
the United States of America!

758
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Gentlemen!

759
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,700
GREG: Order!

760
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,900
WORMER: You're not walking out
on this one, mister.

761
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,900
You're finished.

762
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,400
No more Delta!

763
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,900
(Deltas hum the national anthem)

764
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,200
You've bought it this time, buster!

765
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,300
I'm caIling your nationaI office!

766
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,200
I'm going to revoke your charter!

767
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,600
(National anthem plays)

768
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,700
Ifyou wise guys try one more thing...

769
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,600
one more, l'll kick you out of this college!

770
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,300
No more fun of any kind!

771
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,200
(Screaming)

772
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,400
(Mooing)

773
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:35,400
When my father was in Korea,
he wasn't flying. He was in the infantry.

774
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
He was an officer, of course....

775
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,600
How does it feel to be an independent?

776
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,900
How does it feel to be an asshole?

777
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,100
What did he say?

778
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,600
Hoover says we can't even enter a float
in the homecoming parade.

779
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,700
Some stupid zombies riding piles of Kleenex
down the street?

780
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,500
Look!

781
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,200
BLUTO: Goddamn son of a bitch!
l'll kill you, you scumbag!

782
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,100
Jerk-off! Assholes!

783
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,700
BOON: Jesus. What's going on?

784
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,900
They confiscated everything,
even the stuff we didn't steal.

785
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,500
They took the bar!

786
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,100
The whole fucking bar!

787
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Thanks. I needed that.

788
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,800
Christ.

789
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,600
This is ridiculous.

790
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,700
What are we going to do?

791
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,100
Road trip.

792
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,400
You can't take the car!
Fred wrote the mileage down!

793
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,400
He wants it back by Sunday.
Please don't take the car!

794
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,800
FLOUNDER: He'll be very mad at me!
OTTER: Get in.

795
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,200
Otter, don't you understand?

796
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,700
He wants it back by Sunday!

797
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,500
(Rock music playing in car)

798
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,400
Fred's gonna kill me. This car is expensive!

799
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,500
(Deltas whooping)

800
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,900
I'll get in trouble!
We can have fun, but drive carefully!

801
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,900
OTTER: We won't tell anybody!

802
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,200
FLOUNDER: l hear Dickinson girls are fast.
What should l say?

803
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,800
OTTER: Mention modern art, civil rights
or folk music, you're in like Flynn.

804
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,500
-You sure we have dates?
-Absolutely. What's the chick's name?

805
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,400
Fawn Liebowitz.

806
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,000
-She was from Fort Wayne, lndiana
-I hope l score. Oh, boy!

807
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,400
Oh, boy!

808
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,900
(Adventurous instrumental music)

809
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,700
Turn the car around. I'll be right back.

810
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,400
(Whistling)

811
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,300
(Classical music playing faintly)

812
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,300
OTTER: Excuse me.
RECEPTIONIST: Can l help you?

813
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,900
I'm here to pick up my date.
Could you ring Fawn Liebowitz?

814
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,200
Fawn Liebowitz?

815
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,200
Just a minute.

816
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,300
Hello, Shelly?

817
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,500
This is Brunella at the desk.
Could you come down here? Now.

818
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,800
A boy is here for Fawn.

819
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,500
Thank you.

820
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,400
-Is she coming down?
-Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here. She....

821
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,100
Would you excuse me a minute?

822
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,900
OTTER: Evening.

823
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,500
I'm Shelly Dubinsky, Fawn's roommate.

824
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,600
I'm Frank Lymon from Amherst,
Fawn's fianc.

825
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,100
Actually, we're engaged to be engaged.

826
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,100
What's wrong with everyone here?

827
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,800
Why don't we sit down, Frank?

828
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
I don't know how to tell you...

829
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,900
so l'll just tell you.

830
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,800
Fawn's dead.

831
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,700
She's dead?

832
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,700
(Laughing)

833
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,200
Did she put you up to this? That minx.

834
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,300
What a lively sense of humour.

835
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,000
"Sophomore dies in kiln explosion"?

836
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,900
-Oh, my God!
-I'm terribly sorry, Frank.

837
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,300
I just talked to her last week.

838
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,000
She was gonna make a pot for me.

839
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,800
If there's anything l can do....

840
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,900
You're so nice.

841
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,200
-I really shouldn't impose on you.
-No, really. Anything.

842
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,200
I don't think l should be alone tonight.

843
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,600
Would you go out with me?

844
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,700
I'll get my coat.

845
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,800
Could you get three dates for my friends?

846
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,700
(Adventurous instrumental music)

847
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,200
BOON: Otter, holy shit! Otis Day
and the Knights! l don't believe this.

848
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,800
(Cheering)

849
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,800
It feels so good to be back here
at the Dexter Lake Club.

850
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,200
We'd like to do a tune entitled:

851
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,100
Shama Lama Ding Dong.

852
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,400
So hit it!

853
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,300
(Crashing)

854
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,500
(Tyres squealing)

855
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,000
Wait till Otis sees us! He loves us!

856
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,700
Oh, my God!

857
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,100
It's dented!

858
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,700
(Singing rock and roll song)

859
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,400
(Music stops)

860
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,700
We are going to die.

861
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,500
We're the only white people here.

862
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,300
(Resumes singing)

863
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,300
-Are you sure--
-Don't worry about a thing, man.

864
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,500
A double rock 'n' rye, and...

865
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,900
seven Carlings.

866
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,000
Otis! My man!

867
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,500
You girls come here often?

868
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,500
(Sighs)

869
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,000
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

870
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,600
This is really fun.

871
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,600
(Sighs)

872
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,700
I'm really sorry.

873
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,100
I know what you must be going through.

874
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,500
Would you rather be alone?

875
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,100
-What are you majoring in?
-What?

876
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,400
-What are you majoring in?
-Primitive cultures.

877
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,800
OTTER: l need you so much.

878
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,700
I'm here.

879
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,000
Move to your left a little.

880
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,100
Good.

881
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,300
Where do you go to school?

882
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:05,900
I wonder where Otter is.
Maybe l should go look for him.

883
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,400
OTTER: l used to touch Fawn this way.

884
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,800
I know.

885
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,900
She told me.

886
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,200
She did?

887
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,600
(Moaning)

888
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,400
(Shelly sighing)

889
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,200
Do you mind if we dance with your dates?

890
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,200
Why, no, not at all. Go right ahead.

891
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,600
(Ripping)

892
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,400
If l was in your shoes...

893
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,900
-I'd be--
-Leaving. What a good idea

894
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,900
(Deltas shouting)

895
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,200
(Shelly yells)

896
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,600
BOON: Compose yourself,
we got to get out of here!

897
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,100
FLOUNDER: The Negroes took our dates!

898
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,000
Oh, my God! Please be careful!

899
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,300
This will cost hundreds of dollars to fix!

900
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,400
Oh, my God!

901
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,300
PINTO: We're out.

902
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,400
(Shouting)

903
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,100
What baffles me is why
Fawn would go out with boys like that.

904
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,900
-They reminded me of criminals.
-They were horrible.

905
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,600
I think Frank was kind of cute.

906
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,400
(All exclaim disgustedly)

907
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,600
I really felt sorry for him.

908
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,300
SHELLY: He started crying and....

909
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,500
(Phone ringing over the line)

910
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,800
(Romantic ballad)

911
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,500
What did Katy say?

912
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,200
She wasn't home.
Where could she be at 6:00 am.?

913
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,500
-What's with you two?
-I don't know. Something's wrong.

914
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,100
Women. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

915
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:52,200
You know where Mandy is?
She was supposed to help make tea

916
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,700
Sure don't.

917
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,100
She said she was just
going to wash her hair.

918
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,000
That's typical. Just when we're doing
something important.

919
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,000
I hate to see her make
such a chump out of you.

920
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,500
What are you saying?

921
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,500
I'm saying that Mandy and Eric Stratton
are having an affair.

922
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,300
But l love you, Greg.
That's why l had to tell you.

923
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,300
Babs...

924
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,700
I want you to do something for me.

925
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,000
(Crashing)

926
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,300
Good.

927
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,600
BOON: l'm outta here.
OTTER: Katy?

928
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,700
OTTER: Good luck.

929
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,500
(Rock and roll music playing on radio)

930
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,800
(Crying)

931
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,400
D-DAY: Hey. Stop blubbering.

932
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,700
When l'm through with this thing,
you won't even recognise it.

933
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,300
OTTER: Come on, Flounder.

934
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,100
You can't worry forever
about your mistakes.

935
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,200
You fucked up. You trusted us.

936
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,600
Make the best of it. Maybe we can help you.

937
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,700
That's easy for you to say.
What am l going to l tell Fred?

938
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,500
I'll tell you what.

939
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,300
I'll swear you were doing a great job
taking care of his car, but...

940
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:10,900
you parked it out back last night,
and this morning, it was gone.

941
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,200
D-Day takes care of the wreck.

942
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:18,400
We tell the police. Your brother's insurance
buys him a new car.

943
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,200
Will that work?

944
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,300
It's got to work better than the truth.

945
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,700
My advice to you...

946
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,200
is to start drinking heavily.

947
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,800
Better listen to him. He's in premed.

948
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,900
There you go. Just leave everything to me.

949
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,200
(Laughing)

950
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,200
Hi, Katy.

951
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,300
I missed you.

952
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,400
KATY: l was going to call you--
JENNINGS: Where are they?

953
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,300
Boon, l don't know what to say.

954
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,200
Boon, wait!

955
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,700
KATY: Shit.
JENNINGS: Must be in the kitchen.

956
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,100
What's the matter?

957
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,800
JENNINGS: There they are.

958
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,400
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

959
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,900
I'm sure l don't know. You'll have to ask her.

960
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,400
As soon as you can get there.

961
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,500
Well....

962
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,600
Do you know the Rainbow Motel
on Old Mill Road?

963
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,600
Thank you very much.

964
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,200
Bye.

965
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,300
Teddy!

966
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,200
Did you get the Deltas' grade reports?

967
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,200
Yes.

968
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,800
I have it right here.

969
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,500
Why didn't you tell me?

970
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,900
(Wormer laughing)

971
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,200
Good.

972
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,900
(Upbeat instrumental music)

973
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,900
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

974
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,900
(Whistling)

975
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It's "Mr. Thoughtful"
with a dozen roses for...

976
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,200
you::::

977
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,400
One, two, three, four, five.

978
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:01,200
Looks like we're a couple flowers short,
so some of you boys will have to--

979
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,600
Where are the other two?

980
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,600
Stratton and Schoenstein?

981
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
-We looked everywhere, sir, but....
-Never mind. It doesn't matter.

982
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,200
You gentlemen
seen your midterm grades yet?

983
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,500
They're not posted yet, sir.

984
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,100
I've seen them.

985
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
Mr. Kroger....

986
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,000
Two C's, two D's, and an F.

987
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,300
That's a 1 .2 grade average.

988
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:33,400
Congratulations, Kroger.
You're at the top of the Delta pledge class.

989
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,300
Mr. Dorfman.

990
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,000
Hello.

991
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,000
0.2.

992
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,200
Fat, drunk and stupid
is no way to go through life.

993
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,100
Mr. Hoover.

994
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,100
President of Delta house, 1 .6...

995
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,700
four C's and an F. A fine example you set.

996
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,900
Daniel Simpson Day...

997
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,600
has no grade point average.
All courses incomplete.

998
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,400
Mr. Blutarsky.

999
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,700
0.0.

1000
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:24,600
Tell Mr. Stratton and Mr. Schoenstein
exactly what l'm about to tell you.

1001
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,600
-What, sir?
-You're out!

1002
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:32,100
Finished at Faber! Expelled! l want you
off this campus Monday morning!

1003
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,800
And l'm sure you'll be happy to know...

1004
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,200
that l have notified your local draft boards...

1005
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,600
and told them that you are now all...

1006
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,100
eligible for military service.

1007
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,400
Well?

1008
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,800
Well?

1009
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,400
(Stammering)

1010
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:02,700
Out with it!

1011
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,200
(Vomiting)

1012
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,700
(Soft music playing on radio)

1013
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,000
Relax, honey.

1014
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,700
You know, l know, everybody knows
that Otter certainly had it coming.

1015
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,200
I don't think the Deltas
will be giving us any more trouble.

1016
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:31,900
Greg, honey?

1017
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,100
Is it supposed to be this soft?

1018
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,300
Christ!

1019
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,000
Seven years of college down the drain.

1020
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,400
Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps.

1021
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,600
My mother's going to kill me.

1022
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,300
I knew it.

1023
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,000
(Repeating himself)

1024
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,200
FLOUNDER: l can't believe l threw up
in front of Dean Wormer.

1025
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,300
Face it.

1026
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,800
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

1027
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,100
(Door opens)

1028
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,100
(Solemn instrumental music)

1029
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,000
Jesus Christ!

1030
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,800
What happened? You look grotesque!

1031
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,600
-Some Omegas danced on my face.
-Who was it?

1032
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,800
It was Greggie and Douggie...

1033
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,400
-and some of the other Hitler youth.
-What did you do?

1034
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,500
I don't know.

1035
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,000
They're just animals, l guess.

1036
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,300
Looks like l missed something.

1037
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,300
BOON: You did.

1038
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,900
We're aIl officiaIly kicked out ofschool.

1039
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,900
Wormer just got our grades.

1040
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,800
OTTER: They kicked us out of school?

1041
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,800
That makes sense.

1042
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:09,100
-What's this lying around shit?
-What should we do, moron?

1043
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,500
War's over. Wormer dropped the big one.

1044
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,800
What? "Over"?

1045
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,900
Did you say "over"?

1046
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,900
Nothing's over until we decide it is!

1047
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,400
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

1048
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,700
Hell, no!

1049
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,100
-Germans?
-Forget it, he's rolling.

1050
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,400
And it ain't over now.

1051
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,000
'Cause when the going gets tough...

1052
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,900
(Patriotic instrumental music)

1053
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,300
the tough get going! Who's with me?

1054
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,600
Let's go! Come on!

1055
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,800
(Bluto screaming)

1056
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,900
(Tense instrumental music)

1057
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,500
What the fuck happened
to the Delta l used to know?

1058
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,900
Where's the spirit?

1059
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,400
Where's the guts?

1060
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,000
This could be the greatest night
of our lives...

1061
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,200
but you're gonna let it be the worst.

1062
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:20,000
"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

1063
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,800
(Shouting) Just kiss my ass from now on.

1064
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:28,400
Not me! l won't take this!
Wormer is a dead man!

1065
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,800
-Marmalard: dead! Neidermeyer--
-Dead.

1066
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,400
Bluto's right.

1067
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,200
Psychotic...

1068
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,400
but absolutely right.

1069
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,800
We got to take these bastards.

1070
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,100
We could fight them
with conventional weapons.

1071
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,200
That could take years...

1072
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,600
cost millions of lives.

1073
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,300
In this case...

1074
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,000
I think we have to go all out.

1075
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,900
I think this situation absolutely requires...

1076
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:11,500
a really futile and stupid gesture...

1077
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,700
be done on somebody's part.

1078
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,500
We're just the guys to do it.

1079
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,100
Let's do it.

1080
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,300
Let's do it!

1081
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,100
(All shouting)

1082
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,400
Go! Go! Go!

1083
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,600
(Soaring instrumental music)

1084
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,200
(Glass shattering)

1085
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,600
Tommy?

1086
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,000
Hi.

1087
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,300
Hi.

1088
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,000
I'm Larry.

1089
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,300
Remember me? l took you to the party.

1090
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,200
Wait a minute.

1091
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,000
(Door opens)

1092
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,800
So how come you show up now?
l didn't expect to see you.

1093
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,100
I never got a chance to say good night
to you after the party.

1094
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,000
They almost pumped my stomach.

1095
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,700
Can we take a walk or something?

1096
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,800
-What do you mean, "or something"?
-I could get some beer.

1097
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,200
Not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

1098
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,400
Before we go any further,
there's something l have to tell you.

1099
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,300
I lied to you. I've never done this before.

1100
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,400
You've never made out with a girl before?

1101
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,000
I've never done what l think we're
going to do in a minute. I sort of did once--

1102
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,000
That's okay. Neither have l.

1103
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,200
Besides...

1104
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,300
CLORETTE: l lied, too.
PINTO: Yeah? What about?

1105
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,500
I'm only 13.

1106
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,300
Hi, there!

1107
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,500
Marvellous day.

1108
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,100
Excuse me, please. Pardon me.

1109
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,600
Off that mailbox!
That's government property. Move it.

1110
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,300
Would you hold this?

1111
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,200
Thank you.

1112
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,900
My kid can't see.
Can he stand in front of you?

1113
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,400
No.

1114
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:19,100
(Ominous instrumental music)

1115
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,600
Hoover!

1116
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,200
Where's Boon?

1117
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,900
I don't think you should stay around here.

1118
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,000
What are you talking about?

1119
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,300
We all got expelled last night.

1120
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,300
What?

1121
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,900
Why?

1122
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,100
KATY: Where's Boon?
HOOVER: Listen to me.

1123
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,900
I think you'd be glad later
if you weren't here now.

1124
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,200
(Crowd cheering)

1125
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,400
May l have 10,000 marbles, please?

1126
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,800
(Microphone hums shrilly)

1127
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,000
Testing.

1128
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:15,100
It gives me great pleasure to present...

1129
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,800
this ceremoniaI gold-plated whistle...

1130
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,300
to this year's honorary grand marshaI...

1131
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,900
Dean Vernon Wormer.

1132
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,400
Mr. MarshaI...

1133
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,200
the streets of Faber are yours.

1134
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,800
