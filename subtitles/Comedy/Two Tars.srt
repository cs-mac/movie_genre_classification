1
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,500
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!

2
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,400
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,600
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,100
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,200
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,900
No! No!

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Gandalf!

8
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,900
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,300
No!

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,100
Gandalf!

11
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,700
Gandalf!

12
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,900
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,400
Nothing.

14
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Just a dream.

15
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,100
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,700
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,800
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,900
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,100
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
-What's in this?
-Nothing.

23
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,700
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,400
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
You never know.

27
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,500
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,900
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,000
It is special.

30
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,000
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,300
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,700
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,500
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,800
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,200
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,300
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,000
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam. . .

44
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,300
. . .but they did.

45
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,900
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,300
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,100
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.

49
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,500
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,100
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,300
I don't usually hold with foreign food. . .

53
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,300
. . .but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,500
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,300
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,900
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,200
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.

62
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,300
I can smell it.

63
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,800
We're not alone.

64
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,800
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,700
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,500
Where is it?

67
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Where is it?

68
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,000
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
My precious.

70
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,100
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,200
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
This is Sting.

73
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,400
You've seen it before. . .

74
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,900
. . . haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,300
It burns!

77
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,700
It burns us!

78
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
It freezes!

79
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,100
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!

81
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,500
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,100
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!

83
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,700
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,500
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,700
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,700
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,500
Take it off us.

89
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,300
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,300
We swears.

91
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,900
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,200
We swears. . .

93
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,000
. . .to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
We will swear on. . .

95
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
. . .on the precious.

96
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,100
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,200
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,300
Yes. . .

99
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,300
. . .on the precious.

100
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,900
On the precious.

101
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,700
-Get down! I said, down!
-Sam!

103
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,600
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,900
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.

106
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
You've been there before?

107
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,900
Yes.

108
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,900
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,800
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,600
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,900
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,300
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,200
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,100
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,200
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,700
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,500
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,100
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Follow me!

122
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
Merry!

123
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,900
Merry!

124
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,900
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,800
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
We will deliver them.

129
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,500
Merry!

130
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,900
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
My friend is sick.

132
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,000
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,500
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Stop it!

135
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,800
-Leave him alone!
-Why?

137
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,700
You want some?

138
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,800
Merry.

140
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,100
Hello, Pip.

141
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,200
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.

142
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
-It was just an act.
-An act?

143
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,100
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,400
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,700
Man-flesh.

147
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Aragorn.

149
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,500
Let's move!

150
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,500
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,300
Hurry!

153
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,500
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,300
No food. No rest.

156
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,300
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,600
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,100
They may yet be alive.

159
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,500
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,300
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,300
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,200
Rohan.

164
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Home of the Horse-Iords.

165
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,700
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,700
Sets its will against us.

168
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,400
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,100
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
Saruman.

172
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
The world is changing.

173
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,700
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard. . .

174
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,900
. . . And Mordor?

175
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,900
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman. . .

176
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,600
. . . And the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,700
Together, my Lord Sauron. . .

178
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,300
. . . We shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,700
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

180
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,400
The forests will fall.

181
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
A new order will rise.

182
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,700
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear. . .

183
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,700
. . . And the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,500
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,500
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,600
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,000
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,600
-Burn it.
-Yes.

191
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,500
We will fight for you.

192
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,600
Swear it.

193
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,200
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,700
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,200
Murderers!

197
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,000
Burn every village!

199
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,000
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.

200
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

202
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,000
But no more.

203
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,300
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,000
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,900
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
He is too big for him.

207
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,700
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,300
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.

209
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,300
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
Quickly!

212
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
Go, child.

213
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,300
Rohan, my lord. . .

214
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,300
. . .is ready to fall.

215
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,500
Théodred.

216
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,300
Find the king's son!

217
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,900
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,400
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,600
He's alive.

220
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Théodred.

221
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,900
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,700
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,700
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,400
That is a lie.

225
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,200
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,700
Grýma.

227
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,900
Grýma.

228
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
Grýma.

229
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,500
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,300
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,700
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,800
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,300
Can you not see?

234
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,300
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent. . .

235
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,900
. . .your warmongering.

236
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,900
Warmongering?

237
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,200
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,300
What was the promised price, Grýma?

239
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,000
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,500
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,600
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,500
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,700
Too much.

244
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,600
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan. . .

245
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,300
. . .and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,000
You have no authority here.

247
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,500
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,700
This order does not come from me.

249
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,000
It comes from the king.

250
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,100
He signed it this morning.

251
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,900
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
Breathe.

253
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,400
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,900
We're not going no further. . .

255
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,900
. . . until we've had a breather.

256
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
Get a fire going!

257
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,800
Merry!

258
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,400
Merry!

259
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,200
What's making that noise?

261
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,100
It's the trees.

262
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
What?

263
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,800
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,300
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall. . .

265
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,900
. . .and come alive.

266
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Alive?

267
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,300
Trees that could whisper. . .

268
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
. . .talk to each other. . .

269
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,500
. . .even move.

270
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm starving.

271
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,300
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,900
Yeah!

273
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,200
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,600
What about them?

275
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,500
They're fresh.

276
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,800
They are not for eating.

277
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
What about their legs?

278
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,800
They don't need those.

279
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,300
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!

280
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,700
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
Alive?

282
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,900
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,400
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,500
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,500
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,200
Just a mouthful. . .

288
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,500
. . .a bit of the flank.

289
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
Pippin.

291
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
Let's go.

292
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,300
Go on.

293
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,900
Call for help.

294
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,300
Squeal.

295
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,700
Pippin!

297
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,400
A red sun rises.

298
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,700
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,400
Riders of Rohan. . .

300
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,100
. . .what news from the Mark?

301
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,000
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,900
Speak quickly!

303
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,000
I would cut off your head, Dwarf. . .

305
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,700
. . .if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,800
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,200
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,500
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,700
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,000
Not even his own kin.

312
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king. . .

313
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
. . .and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,000
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,900
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,000
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,000
He walks here and there, they say. . .

318
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,100
. . .as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,500
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,800
We are no spies.

321
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,300
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,500
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,700
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,700
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,800
We left none alive.

327
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,200
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,700
Dead?

329
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
I am sorry.

330
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,700
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,900
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Farewell.

333
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,800
Look for your friends.

334
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,500
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,600
We ride north!

337
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,900
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
We failed them.

339
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
And the other.

341
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,900
They crawled.

342
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Their hands were bound.

343
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,300
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
They ran over here.

345
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,800
They were followed.

346
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,500
The belt!

347
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,400
Run!

348
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,200
Tracks lead away from the battle. . .

349
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
. . .into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,100
Fangorn?

351
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,800
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,700
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,400
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,300
Come here!

355
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,100
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,700
He's gone.

357
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,500
Merry!

358
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,700
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,100
Run, Merry!

360
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,600
Little Orcs.

361
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,000
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
Tree?

363
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,000
I am no tree!

364
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
I am an Ent.

365
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
A tree-herder.

366
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,300
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,700
Don't encourage it!

369
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,000
And whose side are you on?

371
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,100
Side?

372
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,100
I am on nobody's side. . .

373
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,600
. . .because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,800
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,400
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Hobbits?

377
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,700
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,100
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,400
They come with fire.

380
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,100
They come with axes.

381
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,900
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,700
-Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
-No!

383
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,600
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,500
Halflings!

385
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,800
Shire-folk!

386
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,200
Maybe you are. . .

387
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,900
. . .and maybe you aren't.

388
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,700
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,400
The White Wizard?

390
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,300
Saruman.

391
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,900
See? See?

392
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,400
We've led you out.

393
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,500
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,400
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,100
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,300
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,900
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,500
I found it. I did.

401
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,300
The way through the marshes.

402
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,800
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,900
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,500
Come quickly.

405
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,500
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,900
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,200
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,600
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,900
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,300
And we are famished! Yes!

411
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,500
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,300
Here.

413
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,400
What does it eats?

414
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,500
Is it tasty?

415
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,100
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,800
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,300
We must starve!

418
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,800
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,700
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,500
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,300
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,700
Not like master.

423
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Master cares.

424
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,900
Master knows.

425
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,100
Yes.

426
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,800
Precious.

427
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,700
Once it takes hold of us. . .

428
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,500
. . .it never lets go.

429
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,300
Don't touch me!

430
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,300
There are dead things!

431
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,100
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,600
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,700
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,300
A great battle long ago.

435
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,800
Dead Marshes.

436
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,600
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,900
This way.

438
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,700
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,100
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones. . .

440
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,200
. . .and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,800
Frodo!

442
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,900
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.

443
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,800
-Gollum!
-Mr. Frodo!

444
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,800
Are you all right?

445
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,400
So bright.

446
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,200
So beautiful.

447
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,100
Our precious.

448
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,900
What did you say?

449
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,200
Master should be resting.

450
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,300
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,300
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,900
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,800
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,900
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

455
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,600
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,100
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

457
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,100
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,000
Were you?

459
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,300
Sméagol.

460
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,200
What did you call me?

461
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,100
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,900
A long time ago.

463
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
My name.

464
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,300
My name.

465
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,300
Sméagol.

466
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,800
Black Riders!

467
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,300
Hide! Hide!

468
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,600
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,300
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,600
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?

471
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,500
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,700
Wraiths!

473
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,900
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
They are calling for it.

475
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,100
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,300
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm here.

478
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,500
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,300
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,100
Orc blood.

481
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,400
These are strange tracks.

482
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,500
The air is so close in here.

483
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,000
This forest is old.

484
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,700
Very old.

485
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,600
Full of memory. . .

486
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,300
. . .and anger.

487
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,000
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,600
Gimli!

489
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,700
Lower your ax.

490
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,000
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,400
The Elves began it.

492
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,100
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,900
Talking trees.

494
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,400
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,700
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,500
Something's out there.

497
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,500
What do you see?

498
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,400
The White Wizard approaches.

499
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,400
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

500
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,800
We must be quick.

501
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,200
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

502
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,100
Where are they?

503
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,700
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

504
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,000
They met someone they did not expect.

505
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Does that comfort you?

506
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,200
Who are you?

507
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,500
Show yourself!

508
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It cannot be.

509
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
Forgive me.

510
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,200
I mistook you for Saruman.

511
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,600
I am Saruman.

512
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,800
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

513
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,100
You fell.

514
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000
Through fire. . .

515
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,400
. . .and water.

516
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,200
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak. . .

517
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,000
. . . I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

518
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,800
Until at last I threw down
my enemy. . .

519
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,200
. . . And smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

520
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,500
Darkness took me. . .

521
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,100
. . . And I strayed out of thought
and time.

522
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,800
Stars wheeled overhead. . .

523
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,300
. . . And every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

524
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
But it was not the end.

525
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,400
I felt life in me again.

526
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,700
I've been sent back. . .

527
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,300
. . . until my task is done.

528
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,500
Gandalf.

529
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,100
Gandalf?

530
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,200
Yes.

531
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,600
That was what they used to call me.

532
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,500
Gandalf the Grey.

533
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,500
That was my name.

534
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,100
Gandalf.

535
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,900
I am Gandalf the White.

536
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,800
And I come back to you now. . .

537
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,300
. . .at the turn of the tide.

538
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,300
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

539
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
-Edoras?

540
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,900
That is no short distance!

541
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,200
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

542
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

543
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,800
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

544
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,900
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here. . .

545
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,100
. . .in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested--?

546
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,700
I mean, charming. . .

547
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,500
. . .quite charming forest.

548
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,500
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

549
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,800
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

550
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,300
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones. . .

551
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,700
. . .that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

552
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,700
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

553
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,300
You still speak in riddles.

554
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,200
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

555
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,800
The Ents are going to wake up. . .

556
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,700
-. . .and find that they are strong.
-Strong?!

557
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,500
Oh, that's good.

558
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,300
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

559
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,500
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

560
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,100
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

561
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,900
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

562
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,600
That is one of the Mearas. . .

563
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,500
. . . unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

564
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,500
Shadowfax.

565
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,500
He is the lord of all horses. . .

566
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,800
. . .and has been my friend
through many dangers.

567
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,900
O rowan mine

568
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,700
I saw you shine

569
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,300
Upon a summer's day

570
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,700
Upon your head
How golden-red

571
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,300
The crown you bore aloft

572
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,800
Such a beautiful verse.

573
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,700
-Is it much further?
-Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

574
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,000
You might call it far, perhaps.

575
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,500
My home lies deep in the forest. . .

576
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,400
. . . near the roots of the mountain.

577
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,200
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

578
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,300
And safe is where I'll keep you.

579
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,700
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

580
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,900
It's one of my own compositions.

581
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,300
Right.

582
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,300
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

583
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:04,100
And the dreams of trees unfold

584
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:10,500
When woodland halls are green and cool

585
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,600
And the wind is in the West

586
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,600
Come back to me

587
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,400
Come back to me

588
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:28,700
And say my land is best

589
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,400
Sleep, little Shirelings.

590
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,000
Heed no nightly noise.

591
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,900
Sleep till morning light.

592
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,500
I have business in the forest.

593
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,900
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

594
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,600
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

595
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:09,300
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

596
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,500
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

597
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,700
Sauron will suffer no rival.

598
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,300
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

599
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,700
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

600
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,600
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

601
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,200
The rumor has reached him.

602
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,200
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.

603
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,900
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

604
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,200
He fears what you may become.

605
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,700
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

606
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,300
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

607
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,900
War is coming.

608
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,500
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge. . .

609
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,000
. . .for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

610
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,700
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

611
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,900
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

612
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,500
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

613
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,400
But for all their cunning. . .

614
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,000
. . .we have one advantage.

615
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,500
The Ring remains hidden.

616
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,400
And that we should seek to destroy it. . .

617
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,400
. . . has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

618
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,200
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor. . .

619
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,800
. . .in the hands of a Hobbit.

620
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,900
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

621
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,500
We must trust now in Frodo.

622
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,500
Everything depends upon speed. . .

623
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,500
. . .and the secrecy of his quest.

624
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,600
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

625
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,100
Frodo must finish this task alone.

626
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,000
He's not alone.

627
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,800
Sam went with him.

628
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,600
Did he?

629
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,200
Did he, indeed? Good.

630
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,100
Yes, very good.

631
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,500
The Black Gate of Mordor.

632
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,500
Oh, save us.

633
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,200
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

634
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,600
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

635
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,100
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

636
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,400
I did.

637
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,700
That's it, then.

638
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,500
We can't get past that.

639
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,100
Look!

640
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,700
The gate.

641
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,000
It's opening!

642
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,000
I can see a way down.

643
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,700
Sam, no!

644
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,100
Master!

645
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,900
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.

646
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,700
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

647
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,900
-Now!
-No!

648
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,300
No! No, master!

649
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,400
They catch you! They catch you!

650
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,100
Don't take it to him.

651
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,500
He wants the precious.

652
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,600
Always he is looking for it.

653
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,500
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

654
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,500
But we mustn't let him have it.

655
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,600
No! There's another way.

656
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,400
More secret. A dark way.

657
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,100
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.

658
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,700
He's up to something.

659
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,700
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

660
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,500
Yes. There's a path. . .

661
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,100
. . .and some stairs.

662
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,900
And then. . .

663
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,200
. . .a tunnel.

664
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,300
He's led us this far, Sam.

665
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,900
Mr. Frodo, no.

666
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,300
He's been true to his word.

667
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,200
No.

668
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,800
Lead the way, Sméagol.

669
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,100
Good Sméagol always helps.

670
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,700
Hello?

671
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Treebeard?

672
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,900
Where has he gone?

673
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,500
I had the loveliest dream last night.

674
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,700
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

675
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,200
And we smoked all of it.
And then. . .

676
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,500
. . .you were sick.

677
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,800
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

678
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,000
Did you hear that?

679
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,200
There it is again.

680
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:16,500
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

681
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,900
You just said something. . .Treeish.

682
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,900
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

683
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,000
You're taller.

684
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,900
-Who?
-You!

685
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,700
-Than what?
-Than me!

686
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,200
I've always been taller than you.

687
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,800
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

688
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,100
Please, Merry.

689
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,900
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

690
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,200
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

691
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,400
3'8"!

692
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,000
Three-foot-eight.

693
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,800
You did something.

694
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,900
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

695
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,200
Merry!

696
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,600
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

697
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,500
-I want some!
-It could well be dangerous!

698
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,700
Give me it back. Merry!

699
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,800
What's happening?!

700
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,000
It's got my leg!

701
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,800
Merry!

702
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,900
Help!

703
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,200
Away with you.

704
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,100
You should not be waking.

705
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,300
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

706
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,300
Go to sleep.

707
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,400
Away with you.

708
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,800
Come, the forest is waking up.

709
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,200
It isn't safe.

710
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,500
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

711
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,500
Anger festers in their hearts.

712
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,900
Black are their thoughts.

713
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,500
Strong is their hate.

714
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,300
They will harm you if they can.

715
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,900
There are too few of us now.

716
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:44,900
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

717
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,000
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

718
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,300
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.

719
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:56,800
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

720
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.

721
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

722
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,500
-How did they die?
-Die? No.

723
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,800
We lost them.

724
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,900
And now we cannot find them.

725
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

726
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,600
Can't say that I have.

727
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,100
You, Pip?

728
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,700
What do they look like?

729
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:37,600
I don't remember now.

730
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:57,100
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

731
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,400
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan. . .

732
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,800
. . . Whose mind is overthrown.

733
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

734
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,700
My lord, your son. . .

735
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,900
. . . he is dead.

736
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,100
My lord?

737
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,500
Uncle?

738
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,200
Will you not go to him?

739
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,500
Will you do nothing?

740
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,500
Be careful what you say.

741
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,800
Do not look for welcome here.

742
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,900
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

743
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,100
What a tragedy for the king. . .

744
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,100
. . .to lose his only son and heir.

745
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,500
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

746
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:20,400
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

747
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,000
Leave me alone, snake!

748
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,000
Oh, but you are alone.

749
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,100
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness. . .

750
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,600
. . .in the bitter watches of the night. . .

751
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,300
. . .when all your life seems to shrink.

752
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,500
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

753
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,000
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

754
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,000
So fair.

755
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,500
So cold.

756
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,300
Like a morning of pale spring. . .

757
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,800
. . .still clinging to winter's chill.

758
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,400
Your words are poison.

759
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,500
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

760
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,000
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

761
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,900
By order of Grýma Wormtongue.

762
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,200
Your staff.

763
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,800
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

764
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,600
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

765
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,100
He's a herald of woe.

766
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,500
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late. . .

767
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,900
. . .Théoden King.

768
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,100
He's not welcome.

769
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Why should I welcome you. . .

770
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,000
. . .Gandalf Stormcrow?

771
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,400
A just question, my liege.

772
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,300
Late is the hour. . .

773
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,300
. . .in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

774
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Láthspell I name him.

775
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,900
Ill news is an ill guest.

776
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:44,500
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

777
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,500
I have not passed
through fire and death. . .

778
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,800
. . .to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

779
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,700
His staff.

780
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,900
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

781
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,900
Théoden. . .

782
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,900
. . .son of Thengel. . .

783
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,900
. . .too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

784
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,900
I would stay still if I were you.

785
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,100
Hearken to me!

786
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,400
I release you. . .

787
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,400
. . .from the spell.

788
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,400
You have no power here. . .

789
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,100
. . .Gandalf the Grey.

790
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:54,100
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

791
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,600
Wait.

792
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,700
If I go, Théoden dies.

793
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,500
You did not kill me. . .

794
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,700
. . .you will not kill him.

795
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,100
Rohan is mine.

796
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,800
Be gone.

797
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,600
I know your face.

798
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,200
Éowyn.

799
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,600
Éowyn.

800
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,200
Gandalf?

801
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,500
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

802
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,800
Dark have been my dreams of late.

803
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,400
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better. . .

804
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,400
. . .if they grasped your sword.

805
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,600
I've only. . .

806
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,700
. . .ever served you, my lord.

807
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,600
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

808
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,500
Send me not from your sight.

809
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,300
No, my lord! No, my lord.

810
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,600
Let him go.

811
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,400
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

812
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,400
Get out of my way!

813
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Hail, Théoden King!

814
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,600
Where is Théodred?

815
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,900
Where is my son?

816
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,200
Simbelmynë.

817
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,600
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

818
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,100
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

819
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,900
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

820
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,900
The young perish and the old linger.

821
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,500
That I should live. . .

822
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,900
. . .to see the last days of my house.

823
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,700
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

824
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,900
No parent should have to bury
their child.

825
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,700
He was strong in life.

826
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,200
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

827
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,800
They had no warning.

828
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,300
They were unarmed.

829
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,600
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

830
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,300
Rick, cot and tree.

831
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,800
Where is Mama?

832
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,600
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

833
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,000
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

834
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,400
Ride out and meet him head on.

835
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,500
Draw him away from your women
and children.

836
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,300
You must fight.

837
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:39,200
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

838
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,900
Éomer is loyal to you.

839
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,700
His men will return
and fight for their king.

840
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,600
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

841
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,200
Éomer cannot help us.

842
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,500
I know what it is you want of me. . .

843
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,800
. . .but I will not bring further death
to my people.

844
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,100
I will not risk open war.

845
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,400
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

846
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,100
When last I looked. . .

847
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,000
. . .Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

848
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,700
Then what is the king's decision?

849
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,400
By order of the king. . .

850
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,900
. . .the city must empty.

851
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,800
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

852
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,800
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

853
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,500
Helm's Deep.

854
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,000
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

855
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,100
Who will defend them if not their king?

856
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,600
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

857
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,500
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

858
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,400
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

859
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,700
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

860
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,900
What they will get is a massacre.

861
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,800
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

862
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,800
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

863
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,000
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

864
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,100
The people of Rohan will need you.

865
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,900
The defenses have to hold.

866
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,900
They will hold.

867
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,900
The Grey Pilgrim.

868
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,600
That's what they used to call me.

869
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,700
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

870
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,300
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

871
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:43,000
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

872
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,500
At dawn, look to the east.

873
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,100
Go.

874
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,500
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

875
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,900
His name is Brego.

876
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,200
He was my cousin's horse.

877
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,100
Brego.

878
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,300
Your name is kingly.

879
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,600
I have heard of the magic of Elves. . .

880
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,900
. . .but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

881
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,300
You speak as one of their own.

882
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,300
I was raised in Rivendell. . .

883
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,100
. . .for a time.

884
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,200
Turn this fellow free.

885
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,200
He's seen enough of war.

886
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,200
Gandalf the White.

887
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,600
Gandalf the Fool!

888
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:00,700
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

889
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,700
There were three
who followed the wizard.

890
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:11,200
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

891
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,300
You stink of horse.

892
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,100
The Man. . .

893
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:27,100
-. . .was he from Gondor?
-No, from the North.

894
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,900
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

895
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,800
His cloth was poor.

896
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,600
And yet he bore a strange ring.

897
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,000
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

898
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:48,800
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

899
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,800
The Ring of Barahir.

900
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:55,100
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

901
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,500
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

902
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,300
The line was broken years ago.

903
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,100
It matters not.

904
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,700
The world of Men shall fall.

905
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,600
It will begin at Edoras.

906
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,300
I am ready, Gamling.

907
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,800
Bring my horse.

908
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,200
This is not a defeat.

909
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,700
We will return.

910
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,200
We will return.

911
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,500
You have some skill with a blade.

912
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,700
Women of this country learned long ago:

913
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,300
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

914
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,300
I fear neither death nor pain.

915
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
What do you fear, my lady?

916
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,500
A cage.

917
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:29,400
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

918
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,300
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

919
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,600
You're a daughter of kings. . .

920
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,900
. . .a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

921
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,500
I do not think that would be your fate.

922
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,100
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

923
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,300
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

924
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,200
He will expect an attack on the city.

925
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,600
They will flee to Helm's Deep. . .

926
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,000
. . .the great fortress of Rohan.

927
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:42,300
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

928
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,400
They will be slow.

929
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,000
They will have women and children
with them.

930
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,900
Send out your Warg-riders.

931
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,900
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

932
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,700
-Why do you do that?
-What?

933
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,300
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

934
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,600
Because.

935
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,100
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

936
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,400
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

937
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,500
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

938
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,800
You have no idea what it did to him. . .

939
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,400
. . .what it's still doing to him.

940
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,500
I want to help him, Sam.

941
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,900
Why?

942
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

943
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:53,900
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

944
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,700
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

945
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,400
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

946
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,300
I do.

947
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,000
It's the Ring.

948
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,100
You can't take your eyes off it.

949
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,700
I've seen you.

950
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:21,800
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

951
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,600
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

952
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,400
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.

953
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,300
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

954
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,200
Mine! My own!

955
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Can't you hear yourself?

956
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,800
Don't you know who you sound like?

957
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,700
We wants it.

958
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,400
We needs it.

959
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,200
Must have the precious.

960
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,700
They stole it from us.

961
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,100
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

962
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,900
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

963
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,300
No. Not master.

964
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,100
Yes, precious. False.

965
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:19,600
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

966
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,000
Master's my friend.

967
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:28,100
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

968
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,700
Not listening. I'm not listening.

969
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,700
You're a liar and a thief.

970
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,800
No.

971
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,400
Murderer.

972
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,800
Go away.

973
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,200
Go away?

974
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,800
I hate you.

975
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,300
I hate you.

976
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,700
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

977
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,700
I saved us.

978
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,200
It was me. We survived because of me.

979
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,800
Not anymore.

980
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,600
What did you say?

981
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,200
Master looks after us now.

982
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,700
We don't need you.

983
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,900
What?

984
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,800
Leave now. . .

985
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,600
. . .and never come back.

986
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,700
No.

987
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:34,300
Leave now and never come back.

988
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,400
Leave now and never come back!

989
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,500
We told him to go away.

990
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:59,500
And away he goes, precious.

991
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,600
Gone! Gone! Gone!

992
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,500
Sméagol is free!

993
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,600
Look.

994
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,100
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

995
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,600
They are young.

996
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,200
They are tender. They are nice.

997
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,700
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

998
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,900
You'll make him sick, you will. . .

999
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,100
. . .behaving like that.

1000
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,100
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1001
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,600
What's it doing?

1002
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,900
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1003
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,100
It ruins it.

1004
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,800
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1005
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,200
What we need is a few good taters.

1006
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
What's taters, precious?

1007
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,800
What's taters? Eh?

1008
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,600
Po-ta-toes.

1009
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,100
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1010
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:21,800
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1011
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,900
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1012
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,300
Oh, yes, we could.

1013
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:30,800
Spoil a nice fish.

1014
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,500
Give it to us raw. . .

1015
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,600
. . .and wriggling.

1016
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,800
You keep nasty chips.

1017
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,700
You're hopeless.

1018
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,100
Mr. Frodo?

1019
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,800
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.

1020
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,300
Servants of Sauron.

1021
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,200
They are called to Mordor.

1022
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,300
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1023
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,500
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1024
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,500
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.

1025
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:38,600
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1026
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,800
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1027
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,200
Mr. Frodo.

1028
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:45,200
Look.

1029
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,900
It's an oliphaunt.

1030
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,700
No one at home will believe this.

1031
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,100
Sméagol?

1032
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,300
We've lingered here too long.

1033
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,400
Come on, Sam.

1034
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,900
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1035
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:21,500
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1036
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,400
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1037
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,900
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1038
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,100
The enemy?

1039
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:36,400
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1040
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,800
You wonder what his name is. . .

1041
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:44,400
. . .where he came from.

1042
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,700
And if he was really evil at heart.

1043
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:53,600
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1044
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,500
If he would not rather have stayed there. . .

1045
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,100
. . .in peace.

1046
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:07,400
War will make corpses of us all.

1047
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,500
Bind their hands.

1048
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,000
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1049
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:22,700
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance. . .

1050
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,900
. . .that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1051
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:28,100
It's the beards.

1052
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:30,300
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief. . .

1053
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,300
. . .that there are no Dwarf women. . .

1054
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,500
. . .and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground. . .

1055
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,900
. . .which is, of course, ridiculous.

1056
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,900
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1057
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,300
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1058
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:56,800
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1059
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,700
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1060
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,100
Cut down by Orcs.

1061
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,100
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1062
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,200
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1063
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:14,700
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1064
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,600
Gimli.

1065
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,700
No, I couldn't.

1066
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,700
I really couldn't.

1067
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,500
I made some stew.

1068
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:39,800
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1069
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,300
Thank you.

1070
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,400
-It's good.
-Really?

1071
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,500
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1072
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:23,600
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1073
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,400
But he must be mistaken.

1074
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:30,900
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1075
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Then you must be at least 60.

1076
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,500
Seventy?

1077
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,500
But you cannot be 80!

1078
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,100
Eighty-seven.

1079
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,100
You are one of the Dûnedain.

1080
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:54,100
A descendant of Nûmenor,
blessed with long life.

1081
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,800
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1082
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,100
There are few of us left.

1083
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,900
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1084
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:06,900
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1085
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,900
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1086
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:29,000
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1087
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,100
Like my heart.

1088
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,000
Go to sleep.

1089
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,600
I am asleep.

1090
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,700
This is a dream.

1091
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,900
Then it is a good dream.

1092
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,400
Sleep.

1093
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,900
You told me once. . .

1094
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,300
This day would come.

1095
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:39,800
This is not the end. . .it is the beginning.

1096
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
You must go with Frodo.

1097
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:44,700
That is your path.

1098
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,300
My path is hidden from me.

1099
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,400
It is already laid before your feet.

1100
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,700
You cannot falter now.

1101
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,600
Arwen. . . .

1102
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,200
If you trust nothing else. . .

1103
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,500
Trust this. . .

1104
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,700
Trust us.

1105
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,800
Where is she?

1106
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,200
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1107
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,100
Our time here is ending.

1108
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:10,200
Arwen's time is ending.

1109
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,100
Let her go.

1110
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,200
Let her take the ship into the west.

1111
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,300
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1112
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,200
There it will be ever green.

1113
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,900
But never more than memory.

1114
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:27,000
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1115
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:30,700
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.

1116
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:33,100
She belongs with her people.

1117
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,800
Is this how you would take your leave?

1118
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

1119
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,900
I will not be coming back.

1120
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,600
You underestimate your skill in battle.

1121
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,100
You will come back.

1122
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,300
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

1123
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,700
What do you speak of?

1124
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,700
You have a chance for another life. . .

1125
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:18,900
Away from war. . .grief. . .despair.

1126
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,200
Why are you saying this?

1127
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:25,700
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1128
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,700
It was a dream, Arwen.

1129
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:31,400
Nothing more.

1130
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,800
I don't believe you.

1131
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,200
This belongs to you.

1132
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,400
It was a gift.

1133
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,400
Keep it.

1134
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,900
My lord?

1135
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:05,000
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1136
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,900
What is it?

1137
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,300
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.

1138
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,200
Wargs!

1139
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,800
A scout!

1140
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:12,300
-What is it? What do you see?
-Warg! We're under attack!

1141
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,700
Get them out of here!

1142
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,200
All riders to the head of the column.

1143
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,800
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1144
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,600
Come on!

1145
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,300
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1146
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:41,900
-I can fight.
-No!

1147
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,500
You must do this, for me.

1148
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,900
Follow me!

1149
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:57,400
-Forward. I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!

1150
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,200
-That's it! Go on!
-Stay together!

1151
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,600
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1152
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,800
That one counts as mine!

1153
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,400
Stinking creature.

1154
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:58,900
Aragorn!

1155
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,800
Aragorn?

1156
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,000
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1157
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,500
He's. . .

1158
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:24,600
. . .dead.

1159
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:28,000
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1160
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,700
You lie.

1161
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,800
Get the wounded on horses.

1162
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:11,100
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1163
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,500
Leave the dead.

1164
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,100
Come.

1165
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,400
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.

1166
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:36,300
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1167
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,500
We're safe!

1168
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,700
We're safe, my lady.

1169
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,000
Thank you.

1170
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:29,900
-Mama!
-Éothain!

1171
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,500
Freda!

1172
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:39,800
-Where is the rest?
-This is all we could save, my lady.

1173
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,700
Take it to the caves.

1174
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:47,600
Make way for the king.

1175
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:52,300
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1176
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:03,400
So few. So few of you have returned.

1177
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:08,300
Our people are safe.

1178
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:12,000
We have paid for it with many lives.

1179
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,300
My lady.

1180
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,000
Lord Aragorn. . .

1181
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:21,300
. . .where is he?

1182
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:24,700
He fell.

1183
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:49,300
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1184
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,300
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1185
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,500
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1186
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:58,200
Get them into the caves.

1187
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,700
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1188
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:08,900
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.

1189
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,300
Its outer wall is solid rock. . .

1190
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:14,400
. . . But for a small culvert
at its base. . .

1191
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,300
. . . Which is little more than a drain.

1192
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
How? How can fire undo stone?

1193
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:28,500
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1194
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,800
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1195
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,300
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning. . .

1196
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:42,000
. . .thousands, to storm the Keep.

1197
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,500
Tens of thousands.

1198
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:47,600
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1199
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
A new power is rising.

1200
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:05,000
Its victory is at hand.

1201
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,500
This night. . .

1202
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:17,000
. . .the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1203
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:20,400
March to Helm's Deep!

1204
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:23,900
Leave none alive!

1205
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:28,700
To war!

1206
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:36,700
There will be no dawn for Men.

1207
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:55,200
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1208
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:58,400
There is always smoke rising. . .

1209
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:02,300
. . .from Isengard these days.

1210
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,000
Isengard?

1211
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,000
There was a time. . .

1212
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,700
. . .when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1213
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:13,100
But now he has a mind of metal. . .

1214
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,100
. . .and wheels.

1215
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,100
He no longer cares for growing things.

1216
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:23,000
What is it?

1217
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,900
It's Saruman's army.

1218
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:31,600
The war has started.

1219
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:12,500
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

1220
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,300
Brego.

1221
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,500
Arwen.

1222
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,600
It is time.

1223
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:20,300
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now. . . before it is too late.

1224
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,700
I have made my choice.

1225
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:31,600
He is not coming back.

1226
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,100
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1227
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,900
There is still hope.

1228
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:47,500
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1229
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,600
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king. . .

1230
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,100
. . .and all that you hope for
comes true. . .

1231
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:00,800
. . .you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1232
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:04,000
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time. . .

1233
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:06,900
. . .Aragorn will die.

1234
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:12,100
And there will be no comfort
for you. . .

1235
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:16,300
. . . No comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1236
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,700
He will come to death. . .

1237
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:24,300
. . . An image of the splendor
of the kings of Men. . .

1238
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:28,900
. . .in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1239
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:41,500
But you, my daughter. . .

1240
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:47,100
. . .you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt. . .

1241
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:51,100
. . . As nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1242
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,700
Here you will dwell. . .

1243
02:04:55,900 --> 02:05:00,600
. . . Bound to your grief
under the fading trees. . .

1244
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,200
. . . Until all the world is changed. . .

1245
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:08,700
. . .and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1246
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,000
Arwen.

1247
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,500
There is nothing for you here. . .

1248
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:29,200
. . .only death.

1249
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:52,100
Do I not also have your love?

1250
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:55,300
You have my love, father.

1251
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,300
The power of the enemy is growing.

1252
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,900
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman. . .

1253
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:08,400
. . . To destroy the people of Rohan.

1254
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:13,900
Isengard has been unleashed.

1255
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,300
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor. . .

1256
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:25,200
. . . The last free kingdom of Men.

1257
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:29,600
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1258
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:36,100
He senses the Ring is close.

1259
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:39,600
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

1260
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:43,700
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand. . .

1261
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:48,900
. . .the quest will claim his life.

1262
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,100
You know this.

1263
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,400
You have foreseen it.

1264
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:59,700
It is the risk we all took.

1265
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,000
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

1266
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:13,300
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

1267
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:18,700
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1268
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,400
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand. . .

1269
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:26,500
. . . Take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1270
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,500
It is close now.

1271
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:34,800
So close to achieving its goal.

1272
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:41,300
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth. . .

1273
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:45,400
. . . Even unto to the ending
of the world.

1274
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,900
The time of the Elves. . .

1275
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:50,900
. . .is over.

1276
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:55,200
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

1277
02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:00,200
Do we let them stand alone?

1278
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:05,900
What news?

1279
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:08,800
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1280
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,700
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1281
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:15,700
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1282
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:18,200
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1283
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:20,500
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1284
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:24,000
-How many?
-Some thousands. More come every day.

1285
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,500
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1286
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:31,500
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1287
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:35,700
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1288
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:38,400
Sauron from Mordor.

1289
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:42,800
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1290
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,600
Gondor is weak.

1291
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,700
Sauron will strike us soon.

1292
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,200
And he will strike hard.

1293
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:54,600
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1294
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,100
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1295
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:12,900
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1296
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,200
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1297
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:23,500
Speak.

1298
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,000
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1299
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:30,200
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1300
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:32,100
Your bodyguard?

1301
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,000
His gardener.

1302
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:36,500
And where is your skulking friend?

1303
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:40,100
That gangrel creature.

1304
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,300
He had an ill-favored look.

1305
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,800
There was no other.

1306
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:52,000
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1307
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:58,100
One we lost in Moria. . .

1308
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,600
. . .two were my kin. . .

1309
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,400
. . .a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1310
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:08,300
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1311
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,800
You're a friend of Boromir?

1312
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:18,500
Yes.

1313
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:20,600
For my part.

1314
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,700
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1315
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:33,100
Dead?

1316
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,200
How? When?

1317
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:38,000
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1318
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:41,900
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1319
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:50,800
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1320
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,900
It was cloven in two.

1321
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:58,800
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1322
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,500
He was my brother.

1323
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:52,300
Boromir!

1324
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,600
Boromir!

1325
02:12:58,700 --> 02:13:02,300
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1326
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:05,900
A place of light and beauty and music.

1327
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,300
And so it shall be once more!

1328
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:13,400
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1329
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:17,700
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1330
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:26,800
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1331
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:29,000
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!

1332
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:31,900
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!

1333
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:42,900
Good speech. Nice and short.

1334
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:45,900
Leaves more time for drinking!

1335
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:50,200
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1336
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:55,600
Remember today, little brother.

1337
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:58,700
Today, life is good.

1338
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:04,200
What?

1339
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,900
He's here.

1340
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,900
-Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
-Where is he?

1341
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:15,400
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1342
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,600
Father!

1343
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:24,500
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1344
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:27,900
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1345
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:32,100
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1346
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:35,100
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1347
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,200
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1348
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,000
Oh, too few.

1349
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:41,800
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1350
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:46,900
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1351
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,200
That is not my intent.

1352
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:52,900
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1353
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:59,000
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir. . .

1354
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,800
. . . I know his uses, and they are few.

1355
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:05,400
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1356
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:08,900
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1357
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,800
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1358
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,600
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1359
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,900
The One Ring.

1360
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:27,000
-Isildur's Bane.
-It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1361
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:30,700
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1362
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,800
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1363
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:39,100
-Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.

1364
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:42,800
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1365
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,700
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1366
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:52,000
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1367
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:57,000
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1368
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:58,600
He will return.

1369
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,400
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1370
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:05,000
You must go.

1371
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:08,100
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1372
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:14,200
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1373
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,900
-Would you deny your own father?
-Lf there is need to go to Rivendell. . .

1374
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:20,900
-. . .send me in his stead.
-You?

1375
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:23,900
Oh, I see.

1376
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:28,100
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1377
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,400
I think not.

1378
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:33,300
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1379
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:36,300
The one who will not fail me.

1380
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:55,800
Remember today, little brother.

1381
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:15,300
Captain Faramir!

1382
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,500
We found the third one.

1383
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:31,500
You must come with me. Now.

1384
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:43,300
Down there.

1385
02:17:57,600 --> 02:18:00,400
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1386
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:12,000
They wait for my command.

1387
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:18,300
Shall I shoot?

1388
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:22,400
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

1389
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:24,300
So juicy sweet

1390
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,800
Our only wish
To catch a fish

1391
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,500
So juicy sweet

1392
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:38,600
Wait.

1393
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,700
This creature is bound to me.

1394
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:45,200
And I to him.

1395
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,600
He is our guide.

1396
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:55,500
Please. . .

1397
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:57,400
. . .let me go down to him.

1398
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,800
Sméagol.

1399
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,900
Master is here.

1400
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:15,200
Come, Sméagol.

1401
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:20,500
Trust master. Come.

1402
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:27,200
We must go now?

1403
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:30,800
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1404
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,300
Follow me. Come on.

1405
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:35,000
Come.

1406
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:38,500
Come, Sméagol.

1407
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1408
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:43,000
Come on.

1409
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,800
Don't hurt him!

1410
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,600
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1411
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,000
Master!

1412
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:19,400
That's enough.

1413
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:25,000
Where are you leading them?

1414
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:28,300
Answer me.

1415
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:32,200
Sméagol.

1416
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:40,100
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1417
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:43,800
Cruel Men hurts us.

1418
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,800
Master tricksed us.

1419
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,400
Of course he did.

1420
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:54,300
I told you he was tricksy.

1421
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:57,400
I told you he was false.

1422
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,100
Master is our friend.

1423
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:02,500
Our friend.

1424
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,800
Master betrayed us.

1425
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,800
No. Not its business.

1426
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:11,200
Leave us alone!

1427
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:13,700
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1428
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,000
They stole it from us!

1429
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:17,600
No. No.

1430
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:19,700
What did they steal?

1431
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:26,900
My precious!

1432
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:32,000
We have to get out of here.

1433
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:34,400
You go. Go, now.

1434
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,700
You can do it.

1435
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:41,500
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1436
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:43,400
Just this once.

1437
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,300
Put it on.

1438
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:47,600
Disappear.

1439
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:49,700
I can't.

1440
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:54,700
You were right, Sam.

1441
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:58,500
You tried to tell me but. . . .

1442
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,100
I'm sorry.

1443
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:12,200
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1444
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,200
If I put it on. . .

1445
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,600
. . . he'll find me.

1446
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,100
He'll see.

1447
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:24,100
Mr. Frodo. . . .

1448
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:32,900
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1449
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:37,900
Here in the Wild I have you. . .

1450
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,900
. . .two Halflings. . .

1451
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:43,100
. . .and a host of men at my call.

1452
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:49,700
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1453
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,500
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor. . .

1454
02:23:04,100 --> 02:23:07,000
. . .to show his quality.

1455
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,800
No!

1456
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:33,100
Stop it!

1457
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:34,300
Leave him alone.

1458
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:37,900
Don't you understand?

1459
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,000
He's got to destroy it!

1460
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:44,300
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1461
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:46,100
To the Mountain of Fire!

1462
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:50,100
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1463
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,100
Please. It's such a burden.

1464
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:57,200
Will you not help him?

1465
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:00,300
Captain?

1466
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,100
Prepare to leave.

1467
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,100
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1468
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:22,700
-He's alive!
-Where is he? Where is he?

1469
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:25,800
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1470
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,600
You are the luckiest, the canniest. . .

1471
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:33,600
. . .and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1472
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:35,700
Bless you, laddie.

1473
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:37,900
Gimli, where is the king?

1474
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,500
You're late.

1475
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:52,400
You look terrible.

1476
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,400
A great host, you say?

1477
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:37,100
-All Isengard is emptied.
-How many?

1478
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:40,600
Ten thousand strong at least.

1479
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:43,500
Ten thousand?

1480
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:46,300
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1481
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:50,900
To destroy the world of Men.

1482
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:55,200
They will be here by nightfall.

1483
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:02,100
Let them come!

1484
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:06,200
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms. . .

1485
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:09,300
. . .to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1486
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:20,100
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1487
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:22,500
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall. . .

1488
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:25,300
. . .or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1489
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:27,800
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1490
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:30,500
These are Uruk-hai.

1491
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:33,900
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1492
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:39,000
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1493
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,700
I know how to defend my own keep.

1494
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,300
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1495
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:57,400
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1496
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:00,200
Crops can be resown. . .

1497
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:03,200
. . . homes rebuilt.

1498
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:06,300
Within these walls. . .

1499
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,100
. . .we will outlast them.

1500
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:10,500
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1501
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:12,200
They come to destroy its people. . .

1502
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:14,700
. . .down to the last child.

1503
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:17,700
What would you have me do?

1504
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:19,600
Look at my men.

1505
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,400
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1506
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:27,700
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end. . .

1507
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:30,800
. . .as to be worthy of remembrance.

1508
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:36,100
Send out riders, my lord.

1509
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:39,200
You must call for aid.

1510
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:44,500
And who will come?

1511
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:46,400
Elves?

1512
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:48,500
Dwarves?

1513
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:52,000
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1514
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,000
The old alliances are dead.

1515
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:58,100
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?!

1516
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:00,400
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1517
02:29:01,300 --> 02:29:04,400
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1518
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:06,400
Where was Gon--?

1519
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,900
No, my Lord Aragorn. . .

1520
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,700
. . .we are alone.

1521
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:23,000
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1522
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,400
We need more time
to lay provisions--

1523
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:27,900
There is no time. War is upon us.

1524
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:29,800
Secure the gate.

1525
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,800
We Ents have not troubled. . .

1526
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:40,200
. . .about the wars of Men and wizards. . .

1527
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,800
. . .for a very long time.

1528
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,600
But now, something
is about to happen. . .

1529
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:52,000
. . .that has not happened. . .

1530
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:54,500
. . .for an age.

1531
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,900
Entmoot.

1532
02:29:58,300 --> 02:29:59,300
What's that?

1533
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:02,400
'Tis a gathering.

1534
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:06,000
A gathering of what?

1535
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,400
Beech. Oak.

1536
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,400
Chestnut. Ash.

1537
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:29,600
Good. Good. Good.

1538
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:32,000
Many have come.

1539
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:41,900
Now we must decide
if the Ents. . .

1540
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:44,500
. . .will go to war.

1541
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:56,000
Move back! Move to the caves!

1542
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,400
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1543
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:03,000
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1544
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,300
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1545
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:08,500
Aragorn, you must rest.

1546
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:11,000
You're no use to us half alive.

1547
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:12,600
Aragorn!

1548
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:18,700
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1549
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:20,500
That is an honorable charge.

1550
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:23,400
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1551
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,200
What renown is there in that?

1552
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:28,900
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1553
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:31,900
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1554
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,800
-Let me stand at your side.
-It is not in my power to command it.

1555
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:39,800
You do not command
the others to stay!

1556
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:43,600
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1557
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:46,800
Because they love you.

1558
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,100
I'm sorry.

1559
02:32:58,300 --> 02:33:01,500
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1560
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:04,200
These are no soldiers.

1561
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:09,700
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.

1562
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:16,300
Look at them. They're frightened.

1563
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:17,900
I can see it in their eyes.

1564
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:24,800
And they should be. . .

1565
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,900
Three hundred. . . against ten thousand!

1566
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:32,200
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras. . .

1567
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:35,700
They cannot win this fight.

1568
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:37,800
They are all going to die!

1569
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,100
Then I shall die as one of them!

1570
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:48,000
Let him go, lad.

1571
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:50,400
Let him be.

1572
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:57,100
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1573
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,000
My lord?

1574
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,500
Who am I , Gamling?

1575
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:14,400
You are our king, sire.

1576
02:34:17,300 --> 02:34:20,500
And do you trust your king?

1577
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,900
Your men, my lord. . .

1578
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:27,800
. . .will follow you to whatever end.

1579
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:36,200
To whatever end.

1580
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:49,100
Where is the horse and the rider?

1581
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:52,200
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1582
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:57,900
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1583
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:01,900
Like wind in the meadow.

1584
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:09,100
The days have gone down in the West. . .

1585
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:12,300
. . . Behind the hills. . .

1586
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:15,700
. . .into Shadow.

1587
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:27,100
How did it come to this?

1588
02:35:47,500 --> 02:35:49,300
It's been going for hours.

1589
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:52,700
They must have decided something
by now.

1590
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:56,800
Decided? No.

1591
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,900
We only just finished saying. . .

1592
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,800
. . .good morning.

1593
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:09,200
But it's nighttime already.

1594
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:11,100
You can't take forever.

1595
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Don't be hasty.

1596
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:16,700
We're running out of time!

1597
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:22,500
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1598
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:40,600
Give me your sword.

1599
02:36:49,700 --> 02:36:50,800
What is your name?

1600
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:53,600
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1601
02:36:55,700 --> 02:36:58,200
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1602
02:37:00,100 --> 02:37:01,900
They say that it is hopeless.

1603
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,600
This is a good sword.

1604
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:24,800
Haleth, son of Háma. . .

1605
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
. . .there is always hope.

1606
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:56,300
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1607
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:57,900
Forgive me.

1608
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:59,500
I was wrong to despair.

1609
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:04,900
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1610
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:11,000
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1611
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:16,300
It's a little tight across the chest.

1612
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:24,100
That is no Orc horn.

1613
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:31,300
Send for the king.

1614
02:38:31,500 --> 02:38:34,900
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!

1615
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:06,900
How is this possible?

1616
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:11,300
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1617
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:14,600
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1618
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:19,300
Long ago we fought and died together.

1619
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:24,300
We come to honor that allegiance.

1620
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:34,300
You are most welcome.

1621
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:42,900
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1622
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:18,000
You could have picked a better spot.

1623
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:26,700
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1624
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:34,300
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1625
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:37,300
Let's hope they last the night.

1626
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:38,400
Show them no mercy. . .

1627
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:41,500
For you shall receive none!

1628
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:17,300
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?

1629
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:20,200
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1630
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,200
HOLD!

1631
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:22,500
So it begins.

1632
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:29,300
Prepare to fire!

1633
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,100
Their armour is weak at the neck. . .

1634
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:41,700
And beneath the arm.

1635
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:43,500
Release Arrows!

1636
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:49,600
Did they hit anything?

1637
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:52,100
Give them a volley.

1638
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:54,300
-Fire!
-Fire!

1639
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:11,000
Send them to me! Come on!

1640
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:30,800
Ladders!

1641
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Good!

1642
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:41,400
Swords! Swords!

1643
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:19,900
Legolas! Two already!

1644
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:22,100
I'm on 17!

1645
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:24,800
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1646
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:32,900
Nineteen!

1647
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:59,200
Merry.

1648
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:07,100
We have just agreed.

1649
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:18,100
Yes?

1650
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:23,500
I have told your names to the Entmoot. . .

1651
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:27,700
. . .and we have agreed. . .

1652
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:32,100
. . .you are not Orcs.

1653
02:46:33,800 --> 02:46:35,800
Well, that's good news.

1654
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,900
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1655
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:44,100
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1656
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:45,800
Hasty?

1657
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:48,300
Our friends are out there.

1658
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:52,500
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1659
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:55,000
War? Yes.

1660
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:57,000
It affects us all.

1661
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,000
Tree, root and twig.

1662
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:04,700
But you must understand, young Hobbit. . .

1663
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,800
. . .it takes a long time. . .

1664
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,700
. . .to say anything in Old Entish. . .

1665
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:15,900
. . .and we never say anything. . .

1666
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,800
. . . unless it is worth taking. . .

1667
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,800
. . .a long time to say.

1668
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:27,700
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1669
02:47:27,900 --> 02:47:28,900
Nineteen!

1670
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:31,300
Twenty!

1671
02:47:31,400 --> 02:47:33,000
Twenty-one!

1672
02:47:42,700 --> 02:47:44,600
Causeway!

1673
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:54,300
Is this it?

1674
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:57,300
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1675
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:23,900
Bring him down, Legolas!

1676
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:27,900
Kill him!

1677
02:48:28,100 --> 02:48:29,100
Kill him!

1678
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:21,100
Brace the gate!

1679
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:40,800
Hold them! Stand firm!

1680
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:49,700
Aragorn!

1681
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:55,300
Gimli!

1682
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:06,400
Charge!

1683
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:45,800
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1684
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:50,400
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1685
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:53,200
How can that be your decision?!

1686
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:57,300
This is not our war.

1687
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,700
But you're part of this world!

1688
02:51:03,700 --> 02:51:05,400
Aren't you?!

1689
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:11,600
You must help. Please.

1690
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:15,500
You must do something.

1691
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:19,900
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1692
02:51:21,100 --> 02:51:24,600
But your part in this tale is over.

1693
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:26,900
Go back to your home.

1694
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:38,700
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1695
02:51:38,900 --> 02:51:40,700
We don't belong here, Merry.

1696
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:43,000
It's too big for us.

1697
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:45,800
What can we do in the end?

1698
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,500
We've got the Shire.

1699
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,400
Maybe we should go home.

1700
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:58,300
The fires of Isengard will spread. . .

1701
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:03,100
. . .and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1702
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:04,800
And. . . .

1703
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:09,500
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1704
02:52:12,900 --> 02:52:15,700
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1705
02:52:34,400 --> 02:52:35,600
Aragorn!

1706
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:38,100
Fall back to the Keep!

1707
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:41,200
Get your men out of there!

1708
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:43,700
To the Keep!

1709
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:49,900
Pull back to the Keep!

1710
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:52,000
Haldir!

1711
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,200
To the Keep!

1712
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:59,100
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1713
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:18,700
Haldir!

1714
02:53:59,700 --> 02:54:01,100
Brace the gate!

1715
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:04,500
Hold them!

1716
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:09,500
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1717
02:54:36,500 --> 02:54:38,300
Make way!

1718
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:42,700
We cannot hold much longer!

1719
02:54:48,500 --> 02:54:51,900
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?

1720
02:54:52,100 --> 02:54:54,500
As long as you can give me.

1721
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:56,300
Gimli!

1722
02:54:57,700 --> 02:54:59,000
Timbers!

1723
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:01,100
Brace the gate!

1724
02:55:15,200 --> 02:55:16,900
Come on. We can take them.

1725
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:19,200
It's a long way.

1726
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:25,900
Toss me.

1727
02:55:27,100 --> 02:55:28,800
-What?
-I cannot jump the distance!

1728
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,500
You'll have to toss me!

1729
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:37,100
Don't tell the Elf.

1730
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:39,300
Not a word.

1731
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:55,300
Shore up the door!

1732
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,500
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.

1733
02:55:57,600 --> 02:55:58,700
Watch our backs!

1734
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:04,800
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!

1735
02:56:52,700 --> 02:56:54,000
Hold fast the gate!

1736
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:00,900
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1737
02:57:05,400 --> 02:57:07,000
Aragorn!

1738
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,400
Pull everybody back.

1739
02:57:41,800 --> 02:57:43,500
Pull them back.

1740
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,400
Fall back!

1741
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:47,900
Fall back!

1742
02:57:49,100 --> 02:57:50,700
They have broken through!

1743
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:53,000
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1744
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,300
-Fall back!
-Retreat!

1745
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:58,000
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1746
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:00,300
Into the Keep!

1747
02:58:11,300 --> 02:58:16,100
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1748
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:20,700
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1749
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:27,500
Wait! Stop!

1750
02:58:28,300 --> 02:58:29,700
Stop!

1751
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:34,400
Turn around.

1752
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:37,900
-Turn around. Take us south.
-South?

1753
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:42,800
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1754
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:45,700
Yes. Exactly.

1755
02:58:45,900 --> 02:58:49,000
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1756
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:51,700
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1757
02:58:51,900 --> 02:58:53,800
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1758
02:58:56,300 --> 02:58:59,200
That doesn't make sense to me.

1759
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:00,500
But then. . .

1760
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:03,200
. . .you are very small.

1761
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:05,400
Perhaps you're right.

1762
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:09,400
South it is, then.

1763
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:14,000
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1764
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,600
I always like going south.

1765
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:22,900
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1766
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:25,900
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1767
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,900
No, we won't.

1768
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:30,700
Not this time.

1769
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:38,100
Look!

1770
02:59:39,700 --> 02:59:42,000
Osgiliath burns!

1771
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:43,500
Mordor has come.

1772
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:46,900
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1773
02:59:48,200 --> 02:59:50,300
It has only the power to destroy.

1774
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:52,600
Please. . .

1775
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:54,300
. . .let me go.

1776
02:59:55,300 --> 02:59:56,800
Hurry.

1777
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:01,500
Faramir!

1778
03:00:01,700 --> 03:00:04,100
You must let me go!

1779
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:07,800
And those little family of field mice. . .

1780
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,700
. . .that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1781
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:14,500
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they. . . .

1782
03:00:25,300 --> 03:00:28,100
Many of these trees were my friends.

1783
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:33,200
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1784
03:00:34,300 --> 03:00:35,500
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1785
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:38,300
They had voices of their own.

1786
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:42,900
Saruman.

1787
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:46,100
A wizard should know better!

1788
03:00:59,800 --> 03:01:03,300
There is no curse in Elvish. . .

1789
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:06,100
. . . Entish or the tongues of Men. . .

1790
03:01:06,200 --> 03:01:08,500
. . .for this treachery.

1791
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:12,500
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1792
03:01:17,100 --> 03:01:18,200
Where are they going?

1793
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:21,800
They have business with the Orcs.

1794
03:01:22,300 --> 03:01:26,400
My business is with Isengard tonight. . .

1795
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:29,100
. . .with rock and stone.

1796
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:53,100
Yes.

1797
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:55,500
Come, my friends.

1798
03:01:56,800 --> 03:02:00,800
The Ents are going to war.

1799
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:02,700
It is likely. . .

1800
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:06,200
. . .that we go to our doom.

1801
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:09,900
Last march. . .

1802
03:02:10,500 --> 03:02:12,400
. . .of the Ents.

1803
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:02,100
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1804
03:03:02,300 --> 03:03:04,300
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1805
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,300
Mr. Frodo?

1806
03:03:08,600 --> 03:03:12,600
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1807
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:15,100
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1808
03:03:28,900 --> 03:03:30,200
Take them to my father.

1809
03:03:31,700 --> 03:03:34,600
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1810
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:39,800
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1811
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,500
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1812
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:46,800
You want to know
why your brother died?

1813
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:50,900
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1814
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:52,800
He tried to kill him!

1815
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,200
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1816
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:57,700
Watch out!

1817
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:09,300
Mr. Frodo?

1818
03:04:11,800 --> 03:04:13,600
They're here.

1819
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:18,900
They've come.

1820
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:23,200
NazgûI!

1821
03:04:44,500 --> 03:04:46,500
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1822
03:04:48,300 --> 03:04:50,400
Take cover!

1823
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,500
The fortress is taken.

1824
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:10,400
It is over.

1825
03:05:10,600 --> 03:05:14,300
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1826
03:05:14,500 --> 03:05:17,300
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1827
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,300
They're breaking in!

1828
03:05:23,800 --> 03:05:26,200
They're past the door!

1829
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:33,400
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1830
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:37,800
Is there no other way?

1831
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:42,200
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1832
03:05:42,900 --> 03:05:45,000
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1833
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:52,000
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1834
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:54,900
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.

1835
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:00,200
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1836
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:06,100
Ride out with me.

1837
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,600
Ride out and meet them.

1838
03:06:12,300 --> 03:06:14,400
For death and glory.

1839
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:15,900
For Rohan.

1840
03:06:17,400 --> 03:06:18,700
For your people.

1841
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:21,300
The sun is rising.

1842
03:06:25,600 --> 03:06:28,500
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

1843
03:06:28,700 --> 03:06:30,000
At dawn. . .

1844
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:31,800
. . . Look to the east.

1845
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:37,400
Yes.

1846
03:06:39,800 --> 03:06:41,400
Yes.

1847
03:06:42,700 --> 03:06:44,900
The horn of Helm Hammerhand. . .

1848
03:06:45,100 --> 03:06:47,800
. . .shall sound in the Deep. . .

1849
03:06:48,200 --> 03:06:50,100
. . .one last time.

1850
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:51,700
Yes!

1851
03:06:54,700 --> 03:06:58,300
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1852
03:07:05,800 --> 03:07:07,000
Fell deeds, awake.

1853
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:09,300
Now for wrath. . .

1854
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:12,700
. . . now for ruin and a red dawn.

1855
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:21,600
Forth Eorlingas!

1856
03:08:07,400 --> 03:08:08,600
Gandalf.

1857
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:19,100
Théoden King stands alone.

1858
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:21,700
Not alone.

1859
03:08:22,200 --> 03:08:23,200
Rohirrim!

1860
03:08:28,900 --> 03:08:30,000
Éomer.

1861
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:32,600
To the king!

1862
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,700
Yes!

1863
03:09:57,500 --> 03:10:00,800
A hit. A fine hit.

1864
03:10:24,400 --> 03:10:26,700
Break the dam!

1865
03:10:26,900 --> 03:10:30,200
Release the river!

1866
03:10:56,400 --> 03:10:59,000
Pippin! Hold on!

1867
03:11:04,100 --> 03:11:06,900
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1868
03:11:46,600 --> 03:11:48,500
What are you doing?

1869
03:11:56,700 --> 03:11:58,200
Where are you going?

1870
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:55,300
It's me.

1871
03:12:57,700 --> 03:12:59,800
It's your Sam.

1872
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,500
Don't you know your Sam?

1873
03:13:23,500 --> 03:13:26,700
I can't do this, Sam.

1874
03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:29,500
I know.

1875
03:13:30,400 --> 03:13:32,700
It's all wrong.

1876
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:35,300
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1877
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:44,500
But we are.

1878
03:13:50,600 --> 03:13:53,500
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1879
03:13:53,700 --> 03:13:56,000
The ones that really mattered.

1880
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,900
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1881
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:02,900
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end. . .

1882
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,900
. . .because how could the end be happy?

1883
03:14:08,300 --> 03:14:10,400
How could the world go back
to the way it was. . .

1884
03:14:10,600 --> 03:14:13,900
. . . When so much bad had happened?

1885
03:14:14,800 --> 03:14:16,600
Victory!

1886
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:18,200
We have victory!

1887
03:14:18,400 --> 03:14:22,200
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing. . .

1888
03:14:22,400 --> 03:14:23,600
. . . This shadow.

1889
03:14:23,800 --> 03:14:26,100
Even darkness must pass.

1890
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:28,800
A new day will come.

1891
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:32,800
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1892
03:14:34,600 --> 03:14:36,900
Those were the stories
that stayed with you. . .

1893
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:38,700
. . . That meant something.

1894
03:14:38,900 --> 03:14:41,400
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1895
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:46,400
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1896
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:48,100
I know now.

1897
03:14:48,900 --> 03:14:51,000
Folk in those stories. . .

1898
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:55,100
. . . had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1899
03:14:55,300 --> 03:14:57,400
They kept going. . .

1900
03:14:58,100 --> 03:15:01,200
. . .because they were holding
on to something.

1901
03:15:02,700 --> 03:15:04,900
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1902
03:15:16,400 --> 03:15:20,100
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1903
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:22,900
And it's worth fighting for.

1904
03:15:48,800 --> 03:15:52,900
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1905
03:15:53,600 --> 03:15:57,400
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1906
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:59,700
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1907
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:05,200
Then it is forfeit.

1908
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:09,500
Release them.

1909
03:16:21,100 --> 03:16:23,100
Stay out of the forest!

1910
03:16:23,200 --> 03:16:24,900
Keep away from the trees!

1911
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:15,400
Final count. . .

1912
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:18,400
-. . .42.
-Forty-two?

1913
03:17:19,800 --> 03:17:24,300
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1914
03:17:25,100 --> 03:17:28,600
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1915
03:17:32,600 --> 03:17:35,700
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.

1916
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:38,900
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching. . .

1917
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:43,500
. . .because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1918
03:17:45,700 --> 03:17:50,200
-He doesn't look too happy, does he?
-Not too happy at all, Merry.

1919
03:17:50,400 --> 03:17:53,800
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1920
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:56,800
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1921
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,700
I hear the staff are very good.

1922
03:18:05,200 --> 03:18:07,400
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

1923
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:11,700
-The world's back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.

1924
03:18:11,800 --> 03:18:13,000
I'm starving.

1925
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:16,100
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1926
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:19,300
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1927
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:44,500
Saruman's storeroom!

1928
03:18:46,800 --> 03:18:49,400
I don't believe it.

1929
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:51,500
It can't be.

1930
03:18:52,200 --> 03:18:54,900
-It is!
-Longbottom Leaf.

1931
03:18:56,200 --> 03:18:58,400
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1932
03:18:58,700 --> 03:19:01,700
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1933
03:19:01,900 --> 03:19:02,900
Wait.

1934
03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:04,800
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1935
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,500
Share it?

1936
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:10,500
No. No.

1937
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:13,300
Dead plant and all that.

1938
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:15,700
Don't think he'd understand.

1939
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,100
Could be a distant relative.

1940
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:22,200
I get it.

1941
03:19:22,400 --> 03:19:25,100
Don't be hasty.

1942
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:27,800
Exactly.

1943
03:19:28,900 --> 03:19:31,000
Bar-hrum.

1944
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:56,900
This is the old sewer.

1945
03:19:57,000 --> 03:20:00,000
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1946
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:01,900
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1947
03:20:02,900 --> 03:20:05,300
Captain Faramir. . .

1948
03:20:05,900 --> 03:20:07,600
. . .you have shown your quality, sir.

1949
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:11,300
The very highest.

1950
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:14,300
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee. . .

1951
03:20:14,400 --> 03:20:17,300
. . .where gardeners are held in high honor.

1952
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:20,300
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1953
03:20:20,900 --> 03:20:22,400
Gollum says there's a path. . .

1954
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:26,300
. . . near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1955
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:28,400
Cirith Ungol?

1956
03:20:31,800 --> 03:20:34,300
-Is that its name?
-No.

1957
03:20:34,400 --> 03:20:36,000
No!

1958
03:20:36,800 --> 03:20:39,700
-Yes.
-Frodo. . .

1959
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:43,500
. . .they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1960
03:20:44,300 --> 03:20:46,700
-You cannot go that way.
-It is the only way.

1961
03:20:47,100 --> 03:20:53,100
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1962
03:20:54,600 --> 03:20:56,300
I must.

1963
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:03,100
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1964
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:05,200
Thank you.

1965
03:21:16,600 --> 03:21:20,500
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1966
03:21:32,500 --> 03:21:33,900
Come on, keep up.

1967
03:21:37,300 --> 03:21:39,900
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1968
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:42,300
You know that, don't you?

1969
03:21:43,100 --> 03:21:44,600
He was trying to save you, see?

1970
03:21:45,100 --> 03:21:46,500
Save me?

1971
03:21:46,900 --> 03:21:48,900
So there's no hard feelings.

1972
03:21:49,100 --> 03:21:54,000
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.

1973
03:21:54,200 --> 03:21:56,700
Gollum, Gollum.

1974
03:21:57,700 --> 03:21:59,400
Yes, master.

1975
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:03,100
-Nice Hobbits.
-Very decent of you.

1976
03:22:03,300 --> 03:22:05,500
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1977
03:22:10,800 --> 03:22:15,800
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1978
03:22:22,600 --> 03:22:25,500
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1979
03:22:26,200 --> 03:22:29,500
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1980
03:22:34,500 --> 03:22:37,700
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits. . .

1981
03:22:38,700 --> 03:22:41,800
. . . Somewhere in the wilderness.

1982
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:48,200
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1983
03:22:48,400 --> 03:22:49,700
What?

1984
03:22:49,900 --> 03:22:53,700
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1985
03:22:53,800 --> 03:22:56,900
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1986
03:22:57,100 --> 03:22:59,900
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1987
03:23:00,100 --> 03:23:01,700
"Yes, my boy.

1988
03:23:01,900 --> 03:23:05,500
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1989
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:08,100
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1990
03:23:08,300 --> 03:23:10,100
"Samwise the Brave."

1991
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:12,900
I want to hear more about Sam.

1992
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:19,900
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1993
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:25,000
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1994
03:23:26,100 --> 03:23:27,400
So was I.

1995
03:23:35,900 --> 03:23:38,500
"Samwise the Brave."

1996
03:23:42,600 --> 03:23:43,900
Sméagol?

1997
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:46,800
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1998
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:48,800
Master.

1999
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,800
Master looks after us.

2000
03:23:52,600 --> 03:23:55,300
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2001
03:23:55,400 --> 03:23:57,800
Master broke his promise.

2002
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:00,000
Don't ask Sméagol.

2003
03:24:00,200 --> 03:24:03,300
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2004
03:24:03,400 --> 03:24:06,100
Master betrayed us.

2005
03:24:06,300 --> 03:24:09,300
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2006
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:13,200
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2007
03:24:13,400 --> 03:24:16,000
Kill him! Kill him!

2008
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:17,600
Kill them both!

2009
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:21,200
And then we take the precious. . .

2010
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:24,800
. . .and we be the master!

2011
03:24:25,400 --> 03:24:28,000
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2012
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:30,700
Eyes always watching.

2013
03:24:30,900 --> 03:24:34,300
Then we stabs them out.

2014
03:24:34,400 --> 03:24:38,700
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2015
03:24:38,900 --> 03:24:42,200
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2016
03:24:42,400 --> 03:24:45,000
Kill them both.

2017
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:47,500
Yes. No! No!

2018
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:51,300
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2019
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:54,400
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2020
03:24:54,600 --> 03:24:57,100
-Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
-Sméagol?

2021
03:24:57,300 --> 03:25:02,400
We could let her do it.

2022
03:25:03,400 --> 03:25:07,300
Yes. She could do it.

2023
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:11,900
Yes, precious, she could.

2024
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:17,800
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2025
03:25:18,700 --> 03:25:21,400
Once they're dead.

2026
03:25:25,700 --> 03:25:29,200
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2027
03:25:29,400 --> 03:25:31,300
Sméagol will show you the way.

2028
03:25:31,500 --> 03:25:33,700
Follow me.
