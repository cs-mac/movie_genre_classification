1
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,761
Oh.

2
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,723
Oh, good morning.
Hi. Hi. Hi.

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,434
I'm Chef Goldblum.

4
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,103
And right now...

5
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,689
I'll bet you're probably
just getting comfortable...

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,570
in your own
Schlaaang Super Seat.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,198
But maybe you're
asking yourself,

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,827
"What the heck is this
Schlaaang Super Seat exactly?"

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,950
Here's how the
Schlaaang Super Seat works!...

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,992
First, several needles...

11
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,162
are connected to
a vein in your arm.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,332
Chemicals are then introduced
to synchronize your emotions

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,421
with the movie.

14
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,961
Next, air tubes are inserted
into the nasal cavity

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,006
to guide you into
a natural breathing pattern.

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,015
Exotic odors are released

17
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,097
to match the excitement
of the movie.

18
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,560
Finally, your legs are moved
out of your line of sight

19
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,850
and into our patented
Schlaaang stirrups,

20
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,520
to give you a viewing experience
you'll never forget.

21
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,735
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I gotta tell you.

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,696
My favorite thing about this
whole Schlaaang Super Seat

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,204
is the automatic popcorn
machine in the armrest.

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,412
Of course, be careful.
I... you know, I actually did this.

25
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,703
That hot butter
is gonna come spurting out.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,667
Don't get it on your hand.
It's gonna burn.

27
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,048
And remember,

28
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,335
if you're not sitting
in a Schlaaang Super Seat...

29
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,508
you're just not
sitting down.

30
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,091
The Schlaaang Super Seat.

31
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,386
The ultimate film-watching
seating experience!

32
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,775
Close your left eye.

33
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,662
Now rapidly open and close
your left eye like this.

34
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,584
Wow! This is easy.

35
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,871
Now close your right eye.

36
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,960
Now rapidly open and close
your right eye like this.

37
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,263
Thank you.

38
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,924
It is advised to remove your
dentures or false teeth

39
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,933
before the movie begins.

40
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,434
I've been walking
down these streets for years.

41
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,060
Bonjour, Diamond Jim.

42
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,721
Bonjour.

43
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,395
Diamond Jim,
good to see you.

44
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,026
Bonjour.

45
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,732
They all know my name.

46
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,988
But I can't say
that I know theirs.

47
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,866
Bonjour.

48
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,745
What can I say?
This is my home: sweet Paris.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,240
Bonjour.

50
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,206
The smell of baguettes, flowers,

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,292
fresh meat in the air.

52
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,832
Bonjour.

53
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,297
Bonjour.

54
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,682
This is a town
full of beautiful people...

55
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,183
all around you.

56
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,593
Bonjour.

57
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,512
Oui, oui. Magnifique.

58
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,068
I'm Diamond Jim.
This is my home.

59
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,774
My people.

60
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,780
But there's only one
that has my attention.

61
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,051
What can I get you,
Diamond Jim?

62
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,929
What do I have to do
to get you to finally go out with me?

63
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,930
Well...

64
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,724
a girl cannot
say no to diamonds.

65
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,765
Well, why didn't
you say so?

66
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,441
Oh, my God,
it is so beautiful.

67
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,281
Now kiss me.

68
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,619
What the fuck was that?

69
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,711
- That's it.
- That's our movie.

70
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,377
- Should we?
- Let's go make a speech.

71
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,759
Okay.

72
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,390
One more second.

73
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,680
This is the story of Tim and Eric.

74
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,189
They were given
$1 billion...

75
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,599
to make their first
feature film...

76
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,517
by this man:
Tommy Schlaaang.

77
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,063
I paid a billion dollars
for that piece of shit?

78
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,573
But Tim and Eric
did not spend their money wisely.

79
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,280
Despite the record-setting
budget,

80
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,739
they were only able
to edit together

81
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,030
three minutes
of useable footage.

82
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,697
They had expensive
personal make-overs.

83
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,867
These two guys don't get
into premiere parties.

84
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,878
These guys get in the front of
the line at premiere parties.

85
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,084
And they accidentally cast
a Johnny Depp impersonator...

86
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,748
instead of the genuine
Johnny Depp.

87
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,883
- You said it was Johnny Depp.
- It smelled like Johnny Depp.

88
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,885
Everyone said this is Johnny Depp
on the set. It was a big day.

89
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,139
No, it wasn't Johnny Depp.
I know my Johnny Depp.

90
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,051
Other expenses included
helicopter rides to work,

91
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,889
10-course lunches,

92
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,895
and real diamonds
for the Diamond Jim suit.

93
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,398
The diamonds are forever,
though, and we can't return them, so...

94
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,517
Those diamonds
aren't going back.

95
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
They hired a personal shopper...

96
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,896
and spiritual guru
named Jim Joe Kelly,

97
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,737
who they paid an astonishing
$500,000 a week.

98
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,492
I'm not even walking on a set
without Jim Joe.

99
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,278
If you think I'm gonna get
involved in something...

100
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,117
without him being a part of this,
then you're out of your mind.

101
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,282
They also employed
a team of personal assistants,

102
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,542
including this
small man named Jason.

103
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,248
Not now.

104
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,038
Tim and I are making a speech about
our movie, and you fucking blew it.

105
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,675
Come on, Jason, we need the hot corn
before the movie, not after the movie.

106
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,342
- You mind if I do it?
- Go ahead.

107
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,756
Come on!

108
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,970
Now sit down.
Sorry about that, gang.

109
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,260
But perhaps
most foolishly of all,

110
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,303
they signed a
legally binding contract...

111
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,097
with the Schlaaang Corporation
which held them...

112
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,357
personally responsible
for the $1 billion.

113
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,814
I want my money back!

114
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,322
We're going to sue you
for every dime.

115
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,234
You motherfuckers
are going to jail...

116
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,573
for what you did!

117
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,283
After several
threatening letters...

118
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,993
from the Schlaaang
Corporation,

119
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,032
Tim and Eric realized
they needed a plan...

120
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,747
to pay back Schlaaang's
billion dollars.

121
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,082
- Shred it.
- Okay.

122
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,090
We've really got to think
of a way to get that money back.

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,216
There's got to be
an easy way to do it here.

124
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,968
Are you guys hungry?

125
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,347
We could get some beef chili
and hot dog buns

126
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,099
like you like to put your mouth
around like you like to do.

127
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,761
Ma! When we're hungry,
I'll ring the bell.

128
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,975
Then you'll know
to put some chili on.

129
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,313
After days of workshopping failed ideas,

130
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,477
Tim and Eric faced
the very real threat...

131
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,646
of spending the rest
of their lives in jail.

132
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,985
But first they had to
terminate their relationship...

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,367
with their trusted friend
and spiritual guru,

134
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,777
Jim Joe Kelly.

135
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,195
You're not going to believe
what I bought for you.

136
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,988
We've got to tell him.

137
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,158
Oh, mercy.

138
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,755
I'm sensing some...
real depression here.

139
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,169
What's going on?

140
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,008
Tell him.

141
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,548
Jim Joe, we have
to let you go.

142
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,342
Wha...

143
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,057
- I'm sorry.
- What? What?

144
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,222
- It's all over, Jim Joe.
- What?

145
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,016
- It's okay.
- What?

146
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,982
- It's okay, Jim Joe.
- Breathe.

147
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,487
I can't...

148
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,897
- Breathe.
- Oh!

149
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,692
- Jim Joe?
- Oh, God.

150
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,360
Ohh!

151
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,829
No! No!

152
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,662
Pull him up.

153
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,835
One, two, three!

154
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,969
That's not how you do CPR.
You go like this.

155
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,150
See? Do it. Shit.
He's drying out.

156
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,653
- He's drying out! Put him back in!
- Change our plan!

157
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,946
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

158
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,413
No. No, no, no, no.

159
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,924
Just steep it.

160
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,964
Why can't I just work
at a reduced rate?

161
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,510
The money's gone. We lost a billion
dollars. We're screwed.

162
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,976
Easy, Jim Joe.

163
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,606
Easy.

164
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,609
After all that I've
done for you!

165
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,444
Oh, Jim Joe.

166
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,525
This is so much harder
for us than it is for you.

167
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,193
All right. We're sorry.
We're just broke.

168
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,003
Great singing voice.

169
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,512
He's wonderful.

170
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,548
He's remarkable.

171
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,181
I guess this is goodbye.

172
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,099
Time to move on.

173
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,187
Please out.

174
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,323
Is it "please out"
or "peace out"?

175
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,654
- It's up to you.
- Enjoy it.

176
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,615
Please out.

177
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,000
So, with nowhere left to go,

178
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,789
Tim and Eric headed
to their favorite nightclub,

179
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,754
Circus Disco,
to drown their sorrows.

180
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,678
I don't know what we're
going to do, man.

181
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,388
I think we're finished.

182
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,678
We screwed up.
No one's ever gonna let us

183
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,596
direct another movie
after that shit.

184
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,767
You know, I used to have this
crazy fantasy of the two of us

185
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,731
walking hand in hand
down that red carpet

186
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,395
on our way
to the Academy Awards.

187
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,063
That's nice.

188
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,449
I don't think
it's gonna happen.

189
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,530
I just want to get
fucking drunk.

190
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,865
Forget about all this
billion-dollar bullshit.

191
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,871
I'm glad you said it because
I'm feeling the same way.

192
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,998
I want to get
so fucking high.

193
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,330
- I want a hashish.
- I'm gonna get skit on my nose.

194
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,711
Yo, I want to go dumb.

195
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,212
I want to cut
my fucking arm off.

196
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,374
I'd love to fucking get
blackout-drunk with you,

197
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,586
get a bunch of dudes,

198
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,171
put a bunch of shit
up our holes.

199
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,836
Yeah,
let's go fucking nuts.

200
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,504
Let's dance!

201
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,971
 I want to get
so fuckin' high 

202
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,605
 So fuckin' high 

203
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,437
 I want to get
so fuckin' high 

204
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,896
 Yo, I want
to go dumb 

205
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,686
 I'm gonna
get skit on my nose 

206
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,899
 Skit-skit-skit
on my nose... 

207
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,234
Aah!

208
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,444
 I'm gonna get
skit on my nose 

209
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,778
 Skit-skit-skit
on my nose 

210
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,942
 Dumb... 

211
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,281
Aah!

212
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,373
Aah!

213
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,756
 I want a hashish 

214
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,470
 Ha-ha-ha-hashish 

215
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,929
 I want a hashish 

216
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,595
 Ha-ha-ha-hashish 

217
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,272
 Cut my fucking arm off 

218
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,728
 Fuck-fuck-fuck-
fucking arm off... 

219
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,274
 Fuck-fuck-fuck-
fucking arm off... 

220
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,654
Ow!

221
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,940
 Put a bunch of shit
up our holes 

222
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,109
 Bunch-bunch of shit
up our holes... 

223
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,777
Oh, wow.

224
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,195
 Bunch-bunch of shit. 

225
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,491
Ohh...

226
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,708
Yeah.

227
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,720
- You all right?
- Yeah.

228
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,934
Do you want to make
a billion dollars?

229
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,316
It's easy. Come and run my mall.
You'll be rich.

230
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,897
Hey, Eric,
come check this out.

231
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,779
You all love malls,
so take my mall.

232
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,314
What's the matter?

233
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,029
You don't want to make
a billion dollars?

234
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,364
Anyone can run
a stupid fucking mall,

235
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,028
even you.

236
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,040
Are you a man,
or possibly two men,

237
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,871
who need to make
a billion dollars?

238
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,785
Come and run my mall.
We're having hard times.

239
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,046
We need your ideas.
Everybody needs a billion.

240
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,959
Come and take over the S'wallow Valley
Mall and pizza court.

241
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,626
It's easy.
Not hard.

242
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,170
I said it's easy,
not hard.

243
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,806
There's never been an easier
way to make a billion dollars.

244
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,763
It's easy. And here's
the fun part: it's easy.

245
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,224
What's the matter? You don't want
to make a billion dollars?

246
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,185
My day wasn't going good
until I put on these...

247
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,270
Billion dollars.

248
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,604
Man, I love this...

249
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,768
Billion dollars.

250
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,366
I'm giving away a billion...
billion dollars!

251
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,777
But you gotta
run my mall.

252
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,367
Please save our mall.
We need your help.

253
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,826
Ah.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,083
I work at one of the kiosks,
and it would mean the world

255
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,371
- if someone would come in here...
- She's so beautiful.

256
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,336
...and help us make
this mall great again.

257
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,216
Come to the S'wallow Valley Mall,

258
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,173
right off the 182 freeway
in S'wallow Valley.

259
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,884
Sounds crazy, Eric,
I know, but I think we can do this.

260
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,047
Yo, I like it.

261
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,137
- This mall could be easy money, man.
- That's right.

262
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,677
You know what? And I'm really good at
numbers, accounting, all that stuff.

263
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,814
Well, you know me. I'm a big P.R.,
strategy, marketing kind of guy.

264
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,225
But you know,
more importantly, man,

265
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,940
I just want to say this could
be a fresh start for us.

266
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,070
We could forget all about
this Hollywood bullshit

267
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,651
and really reinvent
ourselves.

268
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,817
Yeah. You know, I've been meaning
to tell you this all night,

269
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,031
but I love you, man.
And I love our friendship.

270
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,741
Well, thank you.
I honor you,

271
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,746
and I honor our friendship,
and I honor our love.

272
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,750
It would mean a lot to me
if we could run this mall

273
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,660
and I could make love
to this hot woman

274
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,500
and we could start a business
partnership together.

275
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,084
I love it, but I've
got a big problem.

276
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,499
I hate to do this
to you here.

277
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,542
I need to have an emergency
business meeting right now.

278
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,962
Because guess what? We don't have
a name for our company yet.

279
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,597
Shit.

280
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,756
All right.
What are we good at?

281
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,266
Well, we're men
who do business.

282
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,426
We want to be
business members.

283
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,095
We're boys
who do business.

284
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,604
- Yeah.
- But...

285
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,270
Eric. Look.

286
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,695
It's a sign.

287
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,697
"Doing business".

288
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,826
"Dobis".

289
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,362
I love it. It's got a ring
to it, doesn't it?

290
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,700
- Yeah.
- Dobis.

291
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,582
"That's who we are".
We're Dobis P.R.

292
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,163
Dobis.

293
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,421
- Look at that.
- Look at all the elements of business.

294
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,424
- Look it. They're all there, Eric.
- Market research.

295
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,428
- There's strategic P.R.
- Profit and loss.

296
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,806
I'll have the report
to you by Monday.

297
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,807
I'll look forward to it.

298
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,263
Guys,

299
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,144
I told you, you should
never have fired me.

300
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,976
Jim Joe,
what do you want?

301
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,313
I've got some poetry about regret
I'd like to share with you.

302
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,476
Come on, Jim Joe.

303
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,567
Friendship is warm,
friendship is touch.

304
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,356
Jim Joe, please stop.

305
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,867
We have to do this for ourselves.
We're sorry.

306
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,403
- We've got to leave you behind.
- I'm sick, and I'm lost,

307
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,821
and I'm tired
of floating around.

308
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,490
We love you, Jim Joe.
We wish you the best.

309
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,284
Let's go.

310
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,345
 You cannot
look behind you 

311
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,597
 Oh, no, you can't 

312
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,142
 There's too much ahead
that excites you 

313
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,147
 Yes, there is 

314
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,732
 Just like two horses 

315
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,528
 Just like
two horses 

316
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,915
 Two horses 

317
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,417
 Running in the wind. 

318
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,882
Hi, this is Tim and Eric.

319
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,292
Sorry we're not
here right now.

320
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,926
We've left town to become
business members.

321
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,177
We are now Dobis.

322
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,588
Please leave a message
for Dobis.

323
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,302
Be blessed.

324
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,057
Shit.

325
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,891
Son of a bitch.

326
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,809
They just skipped town
on us, Tommy.

327
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,730
- You find them.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,865
Find them if it's
the last thing you do.

329
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,072
I want to drink their blood.

330
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,988
- I want to take a knife and gut them!
- Yes.

331
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,033
Oh, God, let me watch
their insides fall out.

332
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,293
Yes. Yes. Yes.
What else, Tommy?

333
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,671
- I want to strap them up...
- Yes.

334
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,082
And let a bamboo tree grow
right up into their ass, huh?

335
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,466
Yes.

336
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,343
Until the tree grows straight
through their brains!

337
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,505
Yes. And I will
deliver them unto you.

338
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,765
I want to eat
their fucking hearts!

339
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,095
Yeah!

340
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,852
Yes. Yes. Yes.

341
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,606
Okay.
Tell me what you think.

342
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,271
Uh, "Dear Mr. Weebs,

343
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,112
We are very, very, very,
very excited to meet you.

344
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,277
We are Dobis".

345
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,912
That's all I've got so far.
What do you think?

346
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,290
Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
I wasn't listening to you.

347
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,872
I'm just so focused
on this ridiculous look.

348
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,752
It's not working anymore.

349
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,629
Let me take a look.

350
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,459
It's just not right.

351
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,969
You know what, Eric, if we're
going to be businessmen,

352
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,847
I think maybe we should
look like businessmen, too.

353
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,804
- I agree.
- Hold on a second.

354
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,611
Now hold still.

355
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,034
Goodbye.

356
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,001
Oh!

357
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,975
Good night, Katie.
I miss you, my sweets.

358
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,612
Boy, you're really getting
attached to that photo, bud.

359
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,569
Tim, it's not
just a picture, man.

360
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,233
That could be
the girl of my dreams.

361
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,867
All right. Let's just
try to stay focused

362
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,278
on what's important here.

363
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,788
Ever since I saw you
in that commercial, Katie,

364
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,790
I felt this electricity
in my heart.

365
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,293
I can't wait to meet you
and make love to you

366
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,454
and go deep inside you
and show you my mushroom tip.

367
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,419
All right, well,
I'm hitting the sack.

368
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,685
Oh.

369
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,309
What the hell?

370
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,944
Okay.

371
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,573
- Katie.
- Okay.

372
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,983
All right.

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,740
You want to finish
that in the bathroom?

374
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,625
Almost done.
Almost done.

375
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,060
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
say good night, then.

376
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,529
 Just like two horses 

377
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:40,496
 Just like
two horses 

378
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,587
 Two horses 

379
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,998
 Runnin' in the wind 

380
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,714
 Runnin' in the wind 

381
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,550
 Runnin' in the wind. 

382
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,647
We've come
a long way, Tim.

383
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,478
We could turn around
right now if you want.

384
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,189
No.

385
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,069
I'm ready.

386
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,901
All right.
Let's go.

387
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,498
Hello?

388
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,585
Mr. Weebs?

389
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,986
Mr. Weebs?

390
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,533
Mr. Weebs?
Hello?

391
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,785
- What? What the...
- Mr. Weebs?

392
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,291
Go to heck!

393
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,076
- Whoa!
- Who is that, Taquito?

394
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,665
No, sir.
It's Dobis.

395
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,580
- It's Tim and Eric.
- Tim and Eric.

396
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,128
Oh.

397
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,133
- Oh. Come in.
- Thank you.

398
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,714
Yeah. Come in.

399
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,881
- Tim and Eric. Hello.
- Hi. Sorry to spook you.

400
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,801
- Good to meet you.
- Hi. Come in.

401
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,311
Hi. Hi.

402
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,063
I did not expect you guys.

403
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,692
I don't usually have visitors
at this time of the day.

404
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,148
So thank you.

405
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,983
Please, sit down.
Have a s...

406
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,570
God! Come on!

407
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,736
God damn it!
There's an order here.

408
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,323
Sorry.

409
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,160
Oh!
All this was organized.

410
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,541
Now, I don't know.

411
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,876
Because a couple of dicks
walked in and wrecked it.

412
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,665
- Can I help you?
- No!

413
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,084
Have you ever visited
an office before?

414
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,720
- You want us to come back another time?
- No.

415
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,390
I almost had a heart attack.

416
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,019
Can we have a fresh start?

417
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,598
- That'd be great.
- Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.

418
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:13,019
And I'm Tim Heidecker.
And we are from Dobis P.R.

419
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,903
We saw your commercial,

420
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,065
and we're here
to run the mall

421
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,482
and make that billion.

422
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,321
Do you want
to watch "Top Gun"?

423
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,824
- Right now?
- I love that movie.

424
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,615
- You have a copy?
- I have it here somewhere.

425
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,251
There it is.
It was right here...

426
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,786
- Right on top.
- the whole time.

427
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,124
Okay. "Top Gun".

428
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,039
- Just put it in here?
- Just put it right in there.

429
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,300
Great.

430
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,301
Does it start
from the top?

431
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,383
Mm-hmm.

432
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,797
"Top Gun" from the top.

433
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,802
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

434
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,721
- Tom Cruise, I guess.
- Mm-hmm.

435
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,190
- Ah.
- Great.

436
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,526
- I like that movie.
- It's a good movie.

437
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,406
- Terrific.
- Wonderful. Artistic.

438
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,114
Do you want
to watch it again?

439
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,238
We just saw
one pass of it, so...

440
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,532
We'd love to focus
in on the business.

441
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,917
It literally means
the world to me.

442
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,832
Come on.

443
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,417
I guess we can watch it
one more time.

444
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,877
Yeah.

445
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,792
- Rewind here?
- Rewind.

446
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,757
So while
we're rewinding,

447
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,092
let's talk business
about the mall.

448
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,507
And hit play.

449
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,222
- Okay. Play again?
- Round two.

450
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,229
- Play again.
- "Top Gun" from the top again.

451
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,607
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

452
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,444
I love that movie.
It's a great film.

453
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,404
Great flying.

454
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,786
Yeah.

455
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,571
I love that music.

456
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,285
Yeah.

457
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,747
Yeah, the music is great.

458
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,588
Not just the songs, either,
the score is good.

459
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,794
- The motorcycles and stuff.
- Uh-huh.

460
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,461
Is that Val Kilmer?
Is that Val Kilmer?

461
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,096
Jesus.

462
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,310
Fuck.

463
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,149
All right.

464
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,529
Taquito!

465
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,314
Get up here right now!

466
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,198
I've got some business
for you!

467
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,781
I'll need to introduce
you to Taquito.

468
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,786
He lives here in the mall.

469
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,410
He's a sick boy.

470
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,917
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

471
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,418
Come here.

472
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,508
He's your problem now.

473
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,302
Okay.

474
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,390
Also, you're going to have
to look out for the wolf.

475
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,636
Is that
a metaphorical wolf?

476
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,772
- Huh?
- Like an animal wolf?

477
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,604
- Yeah.
- You're talking about a wolf?

478
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,269
Oh, yeah.
He's a real wolf.

479
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,028
He'll bite you.

480
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,449
Noted. Okay.

481
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,201
Well, if I could
just move on?

482
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,954
One more thing. I hate to do this
to you, but in the commercial,

483
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,864
you said we were gonna
make a billion dollars.

484
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,375
Oh. The money's coming.

485
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,536
Did you wink there?

486
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,830
- Hmm?
- You just winked.

487
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,294
Look. Don't worry
about the money.

488
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,006
You're gonna make a billion
running this place.

489
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,387
Making the money.

490
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,888
Yeah, it happened again.

491
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,094
I'm sorry.
We're still seeing it.

492
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,759
Really?

493
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,053
I find that hard to believe.

494
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,563
I saw a wink.
That was a wink.

495
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,473
I don't think I winked.

496
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,314
Yeah. Well, we both saw it.
You winked.

497
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,274
I don't know if it's some kind of
reflexive thing.

498
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,437
No.

499
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,197
Would you just mind
saying "Tim and Eric,

500
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,780
you'll make the billion dollars,
run the mall," and there's no wink?

501
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,946
I hate doing this, but could you just...
you know, even with your hands...

502
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,910
- I'm happy to.
- just keep them open.

503
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,075
Then just say "Tim and Eric
will make a billion dollars".

504
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,494
No wink.

505
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,708
Just say the line
and keep the eyes wide open.

506
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,918
You're gonna do just fine
running this place.

507
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,129
You're gonna make a billion.

508
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,386
Even with them spread,
I... we see the wink.

509
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,888
I don't even know how
it's possible, but you're...

510
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,390
- you're winking through it.
- Hmm.

511
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,643
I think we should just
trust him on this.

512
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,553
- I don't know, man.
- We don't have any other options.

513
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,563
Wink or no wink, we have
to go with this. We're here.

514
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,726
Okay. All right,
well, Mr. Weebs,

515
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,689
we'd love to accept
the offer.

516
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,446
- Oh, that's wonderful news.
- We'll run your mall.

517
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,572
Great news.

518
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,075
Yes, Uncle Damian?
What is it?

519
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,451
Taquito!

520
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,490
These are Tim and Eric.

521
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,704
Oh, how nice.

522
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,245
They will be running
the mall from now on.

523
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,381
- You take orders from them.
- Yes, Uncle Damian.

524
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,337
Want to see where I live?

525
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,797
Want to know where to get food?

526
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,428
Taquito!

527
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,306
You do the song
like we practiced.

528
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,560
Yes, Uncle Damian.

529
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,392
 My name is Taquito,
I live here in the mall 

530
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,353
 I got left here
when I was really small 

531
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,018
 And then the mall closed,
and the wolves came to stay 

532
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,482
 They raised me at first 

533
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,941
 But now they chase me
all day 

534
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,401
 So stick with me 

535
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,861
 I'll show you
all the tricks 

536
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,699
 But not too close,
or you may get sick. 

537
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,376
Sorry, I'm real sick.

538
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,208
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.

539
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,169
It's just the shivers.

540
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,594
My body's hot,
but I feel cold.

541
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,011
Mr. Weebs?

542
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,019
Tonight's movie
features several important lessons.

543
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,230
The following segments
are meant to reinforce these themes.

544
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,451
You wanted to see me?

545
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,703
Yes.
You're fired.

546
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,740
Oh, no!

547
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,749
Why? Why?

548
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,036
That's it.
Let it all out.

549
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,830
Oh, no.

550
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,920
This is the best
business scenario for us.

551
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,380
It had to be done.

552
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,716
Yes, you are right.

553
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,426
I understand that now.

554
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,467
Thank you.
Good-bye.

555
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,930
Psst. Wait.

556
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,641
Come back.

557
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,851
This is your
severance package.

558
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,840
Sweet old Mrs. Wareheim.
Mrs. Heidecker.

559
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,591
Yes.

560
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,093
You must be so proud
of your boys.

561
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,380
Making a big
Hollywood movie.

562
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,423
Aren't you?

563
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,469
The sets,
the movie stars.

564
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,934
Geez Louise,
it's something, isn't it?

565
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,608
Well, you see,
the problem is

566
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,396
that they
screwed up big-time.

567
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,439
They screwed up, mommies.

568
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,358
Oh, no.

569
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,988
Are you scared?

570
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,703
- Hmm?
- Scared?

571
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,208
Where's your son?

572
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,118
I don't know.

573
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,662
Where are your sons?

574
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,376
I wish I could help you,
but I can't. Sorry.

575
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,259
Where are your sons?
Where are your sons?

576
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,635
Where is he?

577
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,426
Earle.
Let me try.

578
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,976
You've got Zaffer's Music
over there on the right.

579
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,984
Ahem. And that's
Dan's Tiny Baby Outlet.

580
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,816
He's only open
two days a week.

581
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,027
And this here
is Drimble's Yogurt.

582
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,409
Some folks
say it's haunted

583
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,695
by the yogurt man.

584
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,738
I don't know.

585
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,499
I wouldn't change
too much around here.

586
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,207
The yogurt man might
get real upset.

587
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,463
That's a bobo.

588
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,170
How are you?

589
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,925
Hi.

590
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,178
And this is Simon's.

591
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,805
They sell things
for mommies and daddies.

592
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,934
Oh, hey, Eric,
check it out. Swords.

593
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,095
Cool, I love swords.

594
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,686
Mr. Bishopman?

595
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,021
I have a couple of fellas
who wanted to meet you.

596
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,811
What's this? What do you want?
We're closing.

597
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,571
I'm Tim Heidecker.

598
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,982
I'm Eric Wareheim,
and we're from Dobis P.R.,

599
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,400
and we're here
to take over your mall.

600
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,910
That's right, Mr. Bishopman.

601
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,661
We are here to reimagine
what this mall can be,

602
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,289
and, in fact, we got some pretty big
and exciting changes in mind.

603
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,574
Mm-hmm.

604
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,958
So just hand over
your cost report,

605
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,290
and we'll get started on
some business plans for you.

606
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,420
You listen to me.

607
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,299
I'm Allen
fucking Bishopman,

608
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,551
and I've run E Z Swords
for 15 years.

609
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,587
And you want me to change?

610
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,096
Fuck you!

611
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,098
Sir, Dobis is here
to help, okay?

612
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,930
I like things this way.

613
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,685
I don't want things
to change!

614
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,971
Okay.

615
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,014
I sell two swords a year,
I'm good.

616
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,899
I sell no swords a year,
and I'm even better.

617
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,857
You see, S'wallow Valley
wants to keep swords off the streets,

618
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,570
and they pay me a monthly fee
to not sell any swords!

619
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:21,779
Okay.
I didn't know that.

620
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,195
Well, now you do, you shit!

621
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,909
Okay. Well, we didn't
know that. So...

622
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,200
Well, now you do,
you shit!

623
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,993
Well, we weren't aware.
I'm sorry.

624
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:36,256
Well, now you do,
you piece of shit.

625
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,384
I got a lot of stuff
going around in my head.

626
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,964
I've got to sort it out,

627
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,629
and it will help
to not have you

628
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,014
right in my fucking face
the whole time!

629
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,301
Well, we look forward to doing
business with you, sir.

630
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,642
Yes. All the best.

631
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,854
Good night.

632
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,689
Anyways, there's a lot
of other fun stuff

633
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,153
I'll show you tomorrow.

634
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,944
Well, here we are.
Here's my humble abode

635
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,080
and your temporary home
away from home.

636
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,458
Okay. Careful.

637
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,414
This is my secret tunnel.

638
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,884
Well, here's
the living room.

639
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,425
Shut the fuck up, you little cunt!

640
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,139
That's Roy.

641
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,271
Don't look him in the eye.

642
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,056
Hello.

643
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,106
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Ah!

644
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,324
Here we are.

645
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,031
This is my little palace.

646
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,161
This is where I sleep.

647
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,122
If you have to do
your business.

648
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,167
There's no curtain.
You just close your eyes.

649
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,003
If you have to do any work

650
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,293
or any kind
of calculations,

651
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,757
you can...

652
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,924
you can use
this machine I built.

653
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,013
It's called the...

654
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,350
it's called the taqutor.

655
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,513
Eric's our numbers
man here.

656
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,273
I'm more of a managerial
type for Dobis.

657
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,650
Really looking forward
to crunching some numbers

658
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,980
on that taqutor, Taquito.

659
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,693
Oh, yeah.
You must be hungry.

660
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,654
- We're fine.
- Here. Have a taquito.

661
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,035
Ooh.
No, thanks.

662
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,366
You've got to keep those
refrigerated, Taquito.

663
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,782
I know. That's why
I only eat the middle.

664
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,042
Taquito, don't put that
in your mouth, please.

665
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,051
Taquito,
is everything all right?

666
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,342
It's only blood.
It's just natural.

667
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,646
I'm not meant to live long.

668
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,766
Poor boy.

669
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,189
All right.
Well, on that note,

670
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,694
we should probably
hit the hay.

671
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,230
Okay.

672
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,195
- So...
- We can sleep right back there?

673
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,700
Yep.

674
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,946
- Good night.
- Sweet dreams.

675
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,625
Good night, Taquito.

676
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,332
Good night.

677
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,040
Yeah, awfully nice to have some company.

678
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,549
Thanks, Taquito.

679
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,793
Thank you.

680
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,240
 This is what we do 

681
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,954
 This is who we are 

682
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,790
 We're Dobis P.R.,
We're Dobis P.R.

00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,172
 And we love who we are 

685
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,426
 We're Dobis P.R.,

 P.R. 

700
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,269
Hello, people of
S'wallow Mall.

701
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,310
Let's give a real big
warm welcome

702
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,650
to our presidents
of Dobis P.R...

703
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,531
Tim and Eric!

704
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,990
- Hey.
- Hey, everybody.

705
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,405
Awesome.

706
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,448
What is up,
party people?

707
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,492
Thank you.

708
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,501
I'm Tim Heidecker.
This is Eric Wareheim.

709
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,208
We are Dobis P.R.,

710
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,543
and we're here to tell you
about our plan

711
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,128
to revitalize
the S'wallow Valley Mall.

712
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,009
Boo!

713
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,171
And here's how
we're gonna do it, guys.

714
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,341
We're gonna use the three
keys to success.

715
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,009
The first key to success.

716
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,770
We gotta get rid
of that wolf...

717
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,271
That wolf.

718
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,110
Okay, our second
key to success...

719
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,491
is we've got to clean
this mall up.

720
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,119
All right? We've got to put a fresh coat
of paint on things.

721
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,449
We've gotta get rid
of all you squatters.

722
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,956
The third key to success

723
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,162
is to prepare
for the grand re-opening

724
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,419
of the new
S'wallow Valley Mall.

725
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,705
We've got to get rid of
the stores that don't work

726
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,339
and bring in stores
that do work,

727
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,750
that make profits.

728
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,509
That's gonna do it
for us, guys.

729
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,887
And we're gonna be
making our billion.

730
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,172
You got that right.

731
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,590
I do want to add
a small caveat here.

732
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,430
We have absolutely
no experience doing this kind of stuff.

733
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,562
Absolutely not, guys.
We are Hollywood actors.

734
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,723
Okay?
That's our specialty.

735
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,735
Re-opening a shit-hole mall?
It's not what we do.

736
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,520
Yeah. We just want
to go on record here

737
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,530
so nobody can come back
and this can't bite us in the ass

738
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,282
that we didn't know what we
were doing here, okay?

739
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,363
When I look in your face,
sir, I say to myself,

740
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,369
I wish I stayed in Hollywood

741
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,872
and just stayed
a superstar actor.

742
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,078
What the fuck
am I doing down here

743
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,494
doing business
in this shit-hole mall?

744
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,084
- But that's Dobis.
- That's the pride of Dobis.

745
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,249
Get used to it 'cause this place
is gonna change.

746
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,088
Oh, yeah!

747
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,171
Come on, everybody!
Say Dobis!

748
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,306
- Dobis!
- Dobis!

749
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,435
Talk about it, Mama:
Dobis in the house.

750
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,813
- Dobis!
- Dobis!

751
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,144
Dobis!

752
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,274
Got you just
where I want you.

753
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,865
There you are.

754
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,451
Oh, you guys
are going down.

755
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,080
Excuse me. I was wondering
about this sword.

756
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,038
Hang on. Can't you see
I'm on the fucking phone?

757
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,577
Operator.

758
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,542
Yes.
Hello, operator.

759
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,253
I need the number for
the Schlaaang Corporation.

760
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,668
I have some information
they're gonna want to hear.

761
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,177
Let me give you their
customer service...

762
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,008
No, I don't want customer
service, you stupid bitch.

763
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,016
I want you to put me through
to headquarters, goddamn it.

764
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,518
H- hello?

765
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,179
Oh, she hung up. Great.
She hung up.

766
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,938
What the hell do you want?

767
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,147
Oh, you're just holding
a knife out like I know...

768
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,277
Oh, I know
what to do with that.

769
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,688
I just want to see how
much this sword was.

770
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,903
Get the hell out
of my store.

771
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,927
Official Dobis reps here,

772
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,838
stopping in
for a meet-and-greet.

773
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,392
Hi, welcome to Reggie's.
What can I get for you?

774
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,018
We've got a sale
on slightly soiled.

775
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,725
No, no, no.
We're not customers.

776
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,480
I don't know if you saw our presentation
we did the other day,

777
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,393
but we're running things
here at the mall now.

778
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,231
What exactly do you
sell here, Reggie?

779
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,145
Oh, used toilet paper,
of course.

780
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,157
There's a lot of demand
for that here, then, Reg?

781
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,033
It's more of
a gourmet operation.

782
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,660
Okay.
Write down gourm...

783
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,571
I got it. G-I...

784
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,489
No, G-O-R-M-A-Y.

785
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,124
G- O-R...

786
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,250
- M-A-Y.
- M-A-Y.

787
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:58,341
Yep. Uh, every night, we go
out to the usual spots...

788
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,093
you know, abandoned
port-a-potties, sewage mains,

789
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,255
those kind of places...
and we do our collecting.

790
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,844
And then we take
the messy slop back here,

791
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,100
and we spool it all
onto new rolls.

792
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,557
What's that? Shit?

793
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,973
It's a shit smell.
Is that you?

794
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,562
It smells like po-po.

795
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,603
My father taught me this
profession years ago.

796
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,487
And now I'm teaching
it to my son.

797
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,741
- Good.
- Speak of the devil.

798
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,569
Come on.

799
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,031
This is Jeffrey.

800
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,666
- Say hello.
- Hi.

801
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,327
Hello.

802
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,004
Where have you been
hiding this boy?

803
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,791
- That's not a bad boy.
- Come here.

804
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,425
Let me feast my eyes
on that boy.

805
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,211
Come here. Yeah.

806
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,471
Take a look at you.

807
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,972
Hey.

808
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,220
Look at the size of him.

809
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,056
Look at this.

810
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,516
Hmm.

811
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,147
Let me see your mouth.

812
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,478
Nice. Nice teeth.

813
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,860
You want to sit
on Uncle Tim's lap?

814
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,067
Get on my knee.

815
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,197
I like your son a lot.

816
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,029
All right,
all right, Tim.

817
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,195
Listen, Reggie, after
a few calculations here,

818
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,159
it looks like your store isn't quite fit
for the new Dobis brand.

819
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,575
Sorry, Reg. We're gonna
have to shut this boy down.

820
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,164
It's been in
the family for years.

821
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,502
The new S'wallow Valley Mall
is about fresh, clean, safe...

822
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,960
You know what, Tim?

823
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,171
There's an opening
for head of janitorial,

824
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,177
and I don't know
Reggie's qualifications,

825
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,679
but I feel like we could
give him a shot.

826
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,259
What do you think?

827
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,890
Uh, well...

828
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,392
You do the dust.
You do the shine.

829
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,052
We make a mess,
you clean it up.

830
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,893
- That's the job.
- Okay.

831
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,682
Great. Well, Reg,

832
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,976
it sounds like you're gonna be pretty
busy over the next few weeks.

833
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,815
Jeffrey, how about you
tag along with us?

834
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,104
And I can teach you
a little bit about

835
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,273
what it's like to be
a businessman around here,

836
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,112
what it's like
to be a real man.

837
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,904
What it's like to be a real
successful businessman.

838
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,288
Huh? Sound good?

839
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,414
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir.

840
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,792
Why don't you call me Daddy?
Say "Yes, Daddy".

841
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,248
Yes, Daddy.

842
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,708
Does that sound good
to you, Uncle Reg?

843
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,124
Yeah. Okay.

844
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,465
Are you gonna be my son?
That's what I thought.

845
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,789
Attention, squatters.

846
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,423
This is your final warning.

847
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,800
Please vacate the mall
immediately.

848
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:50,008
This is a direct order
from Dobis P.R.

849
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,721
Get out of here.

850
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,580
Swing, swing, swing.
Swing, swing.

851
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,786
Oh, shit.

852
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,166
You got, like,
a foot back here

853
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,668
if you swing it
hard enough.

854
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,788
I got it.
I got it.

855
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,048
Back it up.

856
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,677
Get out and push.
Get out and push.

857
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,937
Hey! I'm trying
to work in here.

858
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,610
All right. Shrim Alternative
Healing Center.

859
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,362
It looks like they have
a video here, guys.

860
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,648
You wanna watch a movie, son?

861
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,906
Good day.

862
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,409
I'm Dr. Doone Strutts.

863
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,490
And I want to thank you
for choosing

864
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,905
the Shrim Alternative
Healing Center.

865
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,665
Shrim.

866
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,826
Shrim can
help you achieve

867
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,710
premium body health.

868
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,543
Shrim.

869
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,169
Ooh.

870
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,089
You must locate
your inner shrim.

871
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,803
Shrim begin.

872
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,553
I will help you
find your shrim,

873
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,188
along with my sons.

874
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,476
- Shrim!
- Shrim!

875
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,986
Shrim.

876
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,399
Shrim!

877
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,112
Shrim!

878
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,905
I'd really like to get
my shrim tested,

879
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,369
meet Dr. Doone.

880
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,626
Shrim.
Sounds like shrimp.

881
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,912
Shrimp sounds like Shemp.

882
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,378
Shrim. We should get
some shrimp for dinner.

883
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,667
What?

884
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,085
Shrim! Shrim! Shrim!

885
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,800
Shrim!

886
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,605
All right, Katie's
Celebrity Balloons is our last stop.

887
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,141
Looks like no one's home.
We can turn around.

888
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,604
- No.
- Let's go back.

889
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,895
Just play it cool.
Play it just like yourself.

890
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,985
Just be natural.
Don't forget we're here for business.

891
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,491
Let's do it.

892
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,531
Jeffrey, stick with me.
Play with the balloons.

893
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,870
Hello. Hi.
Tim and Eric here.

894
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,286
- Oh, hi there.
- Hi, I'm Tim Heideck...

895
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,251
Hey,
I'm Eric Wareheim.

896
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,462
Businessmen here.
I'm so nervous.

897
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,716
So, um, love you.

898
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,378
- No.
- No?

899
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,421
Just be yourself.

900
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,306
Hi. Eric Wareheim.
I love you.

901
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,684
- Mm. Start again. Pardon us.
- One, two, three.

902
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,936
Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.
Very in love with you...

903
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,346
- Okay.
- This is business.

904
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,435
I'm trying to just say
the business thing.

905
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,690
We won't be able
to use any of that.

906
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,726
- Cut the love?
- Yeah.

907
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,362
Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.
We're here from Dobis.

908
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,193
We're evaluating
your balloon stand.

909
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,903
And I love you so much.

910
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,068
All right.
Why don't you take two?

911
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,988
Tsst. Tsst.

912
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,124
Take five. I'll get this.
Hi. We're Dobis.

913
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,626
We're just walking around,
trying to get a lay of the land,

914
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,082
figuring out what you guys
need, how we can make this mall better.

915
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,418
Oh. I was in
the audience.

916
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:15,505
I saw your presentation.
You were wonderful.

917
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,011
Thank you for coming
all this way to help us.

918
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:21,049
These are super cool.
How do you even make them?

919
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,558
Oh, thank you.

920
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,093
Eric. Eric.

921
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:33,061
Uh, so, Katie, I would love to schedule
an official Dobis dinner

922
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,649
to discuss
your business model

923
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,984
for your
balloon store here.

924
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,525
With both of you?
That would be great.

925
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,568
Um, or just me.

926
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,703
Um, Tim will probably
be busy with his son,

927
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,910
so you and I can just kind
of go over all the details.

928
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,041
Friday's no good.
Jeff's got a lot of homework.

929
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,622
We're gonna
concentrate on that.

930
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,038
Oh. Okay, fine.

931
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,298
Oh, yeah.

932
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,800
Hey, Eric.

933
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,893
Jeffrey!

934
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,018
Jeff?

935
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,156
I miss you, son.

936
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,870
What are you working on
over there, bud?

937
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,164
I'm just crunching some numbers
with the taqutor here,

938
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,378
and we got a problem.

939
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,918
What are you
talking about?

940
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,632
Come take a look at this.

941
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,426
Taqutor,

942
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,432
load up the Dobis
presentation, please.

943
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,594
See what I'm saying?
It doesn't add up.

944
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,807
Eric, it's probably just
a bug in the mainframe.

945
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,643
I'll have Jeffrey
run a diagnostic.

946
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,307
We'll get it sorted out.
It's nothing to worry about.

947
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,271
No. There's nothing wrong
with the taqutor, man.

948
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,404
The numbers are right here.
There's no way we're making that bil.

949
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,610
What are you saying?
That Weebs lied to us?

950
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,740
You know how stupid
that sounds?

951
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,492
You know
what your problem is?

952
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,905
Your head's in the clouds
thinking about Katie all the time.

953
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,118
Let me ask you something.

954
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,205
How many times did you
masturbate to her today?

955
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,915
Like five or six.

956
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,249
Five or six times,

957
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,880
when you should have been
focused on the prize.

958
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,461
You should be
focused on this:

959
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,342
opening up the S'wallow
Valley Mall,

960
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,219
making the "mooney," okay?
Not some dumb slut.

961
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,472
Hey!

962
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:28,510
Say what you want about my
calculations in the taqutor,

963
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,143
but leave Katie
out of this.

964
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,158
May I have a bite
of your apple?

965
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,011
I wish I had
a bigger bite.

966
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,549
That bite was all mine
because I worked hard for it.

967
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,389
Yep. I didn't
deserve that bite.

968
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,724
I should have
worked harder.

969
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,901
Oh, ladies, ladies, ladies.

970
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,369
I'm a successful
businessman, ladies.

971
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,374
I built the Schlaaang empire
from the ground up.

972
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,537
And if you think two idiots
can make a fool of me,

973
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:41,048
then you've got a lot
to learn about business

974
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,879
and the Schlaaang way.

975
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,298
Yes.

976
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,384
I've had you here for days,

977
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,050
and you've given me nothing.

978
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,810
Cornell, could you untie
Mrs. Wareheim, please?

979
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,860
Yes.

980
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,487
You see this?

981
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,444
It's a letter opener.

982
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,401
It was my grandpop's.

983
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,367
Beautiful.

984
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,250
He must have used it to open up
thousands of letters over the years,

985
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,914
but it also settled
more than a few arguments.

986
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,468
Do you want
to lose a finger, too?

987
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,627
Where are your sons?

988
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,762
I wish I could tell you
what you need to know

989
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,673
if it would get your
billion dollars back to you.

990
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,514
But I just don't think I know
where they did get to.

991
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,431
Motherfucking Tim and Eric,
where did you go?

992
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,570
 You are my son 

993
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,776
 You're better
than anyone 

994
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,945
 You're just like
a shiny new toy 

995
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,409
 You are my boy 

996
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,786
 You are my son 

997
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,453
 You're better
than anyone. 

998
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,544
- Ahem. Excuse me.
- What?

999
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,800
Sorry to interrupt, but do you want to
get back to Dobis?

1000
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,881
Or do you want
to continue singing?

1001
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,923
Yeah. It's fine.
Just got lost in my music.

1002
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,842
Well, we've got
Drimble's Yogurt here.

1003
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,386
Uh, looks like the power's
been off for years,

1004
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,930
so we got a lot of spoiled
yogurt we gotta deal with.

1005
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,474
And, as you recall, Taquito
gave us a little intel

1006
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,736
about a so-called yogurt man
that's haunting the premises.

1007
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,271
So Dobo better investigo.

1008
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,485
Well, if there is a yogurt man
in there, Eric,

1009
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,901
then today he's getting
his eviction notice.

1010
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,493
Oh, God.

1011
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,502
The smell.

1012
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,877
Yogurt man, are you in here?

1013
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,338
Hello?

1014
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,050
Yogurt man?
Ohh!

1015
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,151
Yogurt man, stand down!

1016
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,028
The mall's haunted!

1017
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,234
Wait.

1018
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,074
Taquito?

1019
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,374
- Taquito.
- I'm sorry, guys.

1020
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:32,636
I just don't want
anything to change.

1021
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,637
Taquito,
change is important.

1022
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,345
But that doesn't mean we're gonna
forget about our old friends.

1023
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,724
- I don't know.
- Hold on a second, Taquito.

1024
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,407
Taquito, we just had
a Dobis meeting,

1025
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,318
and we've decided to let you
run the mall fountain.

1026
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,078
Really?

1027
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,038
Not only do you have to get it working,
but you have to maintain it

1028
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,578
and keep track of
all the loose change.

1029
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,965
So I think Taquito's gonna be
with us for quite some time.

1030
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,126
Thanks, guys.

1031
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,135
I'll do the best I can.

1032
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:17,264
I hope I don't kick
the bucket before I finish.

1033
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,728
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking cunt motherfuckers!

1034
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,105
I'll kill you,
you goddamn...

1035
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,108
- Tim, how do I look?
- Take a peek.

1036
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,189
Well, well, well.

1037
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,855
- Sharp as a tack.
- I'm feeling pretty good.

1038
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,614
Big date tonight, huh?

1039
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,776
Yeah. I'm taking Katie
to Inbreadables.

1040
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:37,989
That'll be nice.

1041
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,620
- I'm trying to impress her.
- Oh. Almost forgot.

1042
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,327
I got you a little
something here.

1043
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,493
- It's called a Spanish fly.
- What is it?

1044
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,831
Let's just say
it'll enhance

1045
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,495
your lovemaking
experience tonight.

1046
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:49,959
I put this right in my ass?

1047
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,671
Mm, no. You put it orally.
Yeah, right in your mouth.

1048
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,670
Did you swallow it?

1049
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,348
Come on, swallow it.

1050
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,182
- Perfect.
- Didn't go in.

1051
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,642
Come on.
Swallow it.

1052
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,650
Mmm.

1053
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,481
Well, you better
hit the road, then.

1054
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,566
Okay.
Wish me luck, bud.

1055
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,822
I guess I'll just stay here
and work on Dobis.

1056
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,779
Keep my eye on the prize.

1057
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:20,695
Good luck with the pills.
Good luck.

1058
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,539
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1059
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,747
This is James Quall
here to talk about bread,

1060
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,833
and one thing
I'd have to say...

1061
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:34,842
is that I'd rather be saying
all these bread lines...

1062
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,172
than standing in one.

1063
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,257
Ah, yes. One thing
that might be a hazard...

1064
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,846
about talking about bread

1065
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:48,185
is they might accuse one
of being a loafer.

1066
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,312
Now I've just
come from Hollywood,

1067
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,024
where they have all these
famous personalities...

1068
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,190
like Bread Pitt
and Robert Breadford.

1069
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,074
And now...

1070
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,705
I'll be "baguette"

1071
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,912
in 20 minutes.

1072
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,122
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1073
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,255
I love this place.

1074
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,919
I know what you mean.

1075
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,713
- You want some of this bread slop?
- I'd love some.

1076
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,392
Mmm.

1077
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,899
This is so good.

1078
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,573
This is a funky place.

1079
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,872
So you were telling me
about your mom.

1080
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:51,376
Oh. Well, my mother calls
every Saturday night, right?

1081
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,709
It's like she's just calling
to see if I have a date.

1082
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:57,249
- So she doesn't just call...
- Ohh!

1083
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,758
Are you okay, honey?

1084
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,732
Is it getting hot in here?

1085
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:16,643
I don't think so.

1086
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,445
I'm just feeling
really weird.

1087
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,649
Are you okay, honey?

1088
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,488
There's so much
fucking bread here.

1089
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:32,000
Fuck. Fuck.
Ohh!

1090
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,580
Isn't it hot
in here, Katie?

1091
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,246
Little something
called Spanish fly.

1092
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,289
Eric, are you okay?

1093
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,459
I have way too many
teeth in my mouth!

1094
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,593
You might need some help.

1095
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,715
- Hi, how are you?
- No!

1096
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,806
What?

1097
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,142
Sorry, Eric, there's nothing
I can do for you now.

1098
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,477
What the fuck is that?

1099
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,318
I'm gonna take you
to the Shrim Healing Center.

1100
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,603
Come on.
You'll feel much better.

1101
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,737
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1102
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,274
Shrim!

1103
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,990
Come on in, my son.

1104
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,032
Dr. Doone has you now,

1105
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,872
and he's going to make you
feel all better.

1106
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,832
- Where am I?
- Shh.

1107
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,248
Quiet, my boy.

1108
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:23,715
You need the healing
powers of shrim.

1109
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,129
I can sense that.

1110
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,717
Okay.

1111
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,883
You're in a very bad place.

1112
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,021
Now drop those pants.

1113
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,940
Shrim!

1114
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,503
How was your date?

1115
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,923
Not so good.

1116
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,208
Eric got sick.

1117
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,719
Aw. That's too bad.

1118
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,131
It must be
really unsatisfying.

1119
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,721
Yeah. It was.

1120
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,897
It's a little awkward,
isn't it?

1121
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,523
- Yeah. I suppose.
- I'm so nervous.

1122
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,107
Listen.

1123
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,150
Want to go inside?

1124
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,654
Okay.

1125
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,618
Are you sure?

1126
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,125
No.

1127
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,287
Okay. Let's go.
Come on.

1128
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,753
Step into
the tub, my son.

1129
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,544
That's it.
That's it.

1130
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,089
Everything's going to be
okay, Eric, my boy.

1131
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,429
Dr. Doone has got you,

1132
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:57,346
and he's going to give you
a nice warm shrim bath.

1133
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,640
- What?
- All my boys have been

1134
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,935
hiding the shrim
inside them for days now,

1135
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,025
and they're excited
to finally let it out all over you.

1136
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,781
- What boys?
- Come, my sons.

1137
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,318
It's time.

1138
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,112
Oh, look at them.
They can barely hold it in.

1139
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,289
Shrim.

1140
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,621
Shrim.

1141
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,084
Shrim. Shrim.

1142
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,133
Yeah.

1143
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,351
Shrim.

1144
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,861
Shrim.

1145
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,818
Shrim.

1146
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,482
Shrim.

1147
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,536
- Ohh!
- Shrim.

1148
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,994
Shrim.

1149
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:02,832
My boys only eat
the finest, softest meat

1150
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:06,169
so that they can
achieve a level of shrim

1151
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,958
that's unmatched.

1152
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:11,003
Shrim. Shrim.

1153
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,407
Oh!

1154
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,451
Let the brown,

1155
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,912
foamy mess
wash all over you.

1156
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,682
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

1157
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,893
Shrim, shrim.

1158
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,537
This is the power of shrim!

1159
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,851
Jeffrey?

1160
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,561
Is that you, boy?

1161
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,991
What are you doing,
Jeffrey?

1162
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,194
Where's Papa Tim?

1163
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,704
Is he inside?

1164
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,119
Where are you going?

1165
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,084
Hello?

1166
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,591
What the fuck.

1167
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,054
- Shit.
- What's going on?

1168
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,718
Eric, don't do anything
stupid here, buddy.

1169
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,979
I should go.

1170
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,231
Katie. How could
you do this to me?

1171
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,437
- Eric, I'm so sorry.
- Hey, stop.

1172
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:32,819
You listen to me.
I saved you from her.

1173
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,605
She was nothing but dead weight, Eric.
She was making you soft.

1174
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,490
- She was not making me soft.
- She was making you soft.

1175
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,367
She wasn't making me soft.

1176
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,699
She was making you soft!

1177
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,990
She was making me hard.

1178
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,370
Rock hard.

1179
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,078
Sometimes,
when you're writing,

1180
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,497
you just look for opportunities
to create moments

1181
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,835
that take you
out of the scene

1182
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,341
and just add...
add a joke.

1183
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,470
The jag was that we were
doing "soft, soft, soft"

1184
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,847
and sort of out of
nowhere we go "hard".

1185
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,973
Boom! Laugh.

1186
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,600
We fought
for a laugh track,

1187
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,558
and they said, "No,
this is a feature film for the theaters.

1188
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,189
A laugh track wouldn't
make any sense".

1189
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,271
Think about it.

1190
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,561
Eric, she was
making you soft.

1191
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,196
She's taken your eyes off the game,
Eric, okay? We're here for Dobis.

1192
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,982
What did you give me?
That wasn't Spanish fly.

1193
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,866
I played the oldest trick
in the book.

1194
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,403
But I had to play it 'cause
I needed to save my friend.

1195
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:24,991
You poisoned me.

1196
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:28,124
- What else could I do?
- You son of a bitch.

1197
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,673
Motherfucker!

1198
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,212
How could you do that?

1199
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,673
No! No!

1200
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,977
Guys!

1201
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,649
- Jim Joe?
- Why are you fighting? Stop fighting.

1202
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,981
Don't you remember
my poem about peace?

1203
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,736
If you don't remember,
I'll recite it for you.

1204
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,694
- Jim Joe!
- P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.

1205
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,406
P~p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.

1206
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,745
Come on.
Yeah, yeah.

1207
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,962
Aah!

1208
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,769
Like that?

1209
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,768
Ohh!

1210
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,518
You want some of this?

1211
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,112
Oh!

1212
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,453
Aah!

1213
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,913
Why are you fighting?

1214
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:08,887
Motherfucker!

1215
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,975
No! No!
Aah! Ohh!

1216
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,439
Say you're sorry!

1217
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:25,325
- I'm sorry!
- Say you're sorry!

1218
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:28,032
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

1219
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:30,162
- Okay. It's okay.
- I'm sorry for everything!

1220
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,198
I'm sorry I poisoned you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1221
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,208
No, no, no, no.
Listen, I'm sorry, man.

1222
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,291
I'm sorry.
You were looking out for me.

1223
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,081
You were looking out for us
and the whole Dobis thing.

1224
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,590
I know that now.

1225
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,251
I'm glad you finally
see it that way

1226
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,885
'cause I'm just
trying to help.

1227
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:48,423
Yeah. I just have to
ask you one question.

1228
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:51,058
Why'd you have to sleep with Katie?
You know I love her.

1229
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,221
Well, to be honest with you,
the plan made me horny.

1230
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,606
I had to empty my ball sack
into something.

1231
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,231
That moist hole
must have felt so good.

1232
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,363
Boy, you really do
love her, don't you?

1233
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,070
I really do.

1234
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,576
It's not gonna bother you
when you're making love to her

1235
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,111
that my wick got
inside that hole?

1236
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,120
Not at all, man.

1237
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,952
There's something
special about it,

1238
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,867
you being deep inside
like that.

1239
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,541
Well, then, it will be an honor
to be your best man.

1240
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,677
Come on down
to the grand re-opening

1241
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,179
of the S'wallow Valley Mall.

1242
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,885
I'll be there. My best friend
Tim Heidecker will be there.

1243
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,390
I think you're gonna
like what you see.

1244
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,892
Ooh, you're gonna like
the fake trees.

1245
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,598
Ooh, you're gonna like
all our new stores.

1246
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,637
Ooh, you're gonna like
meeting my new son Jeffrey.

1247
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,556
My best friend Tim and I redid this
whole mall for you.

1248
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:39,770
You got to come down.

1249
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:40,979
It isn't gonna kill you.
Come on down.

1250
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,815
- It's for Dobis' sake!
- I'm gonna murder myself

1251
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,570
if you don't come down
to my new fucking mall.

1252
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,743
Come on down to the grand re-opening
of the S'wallow Valley Mall.

1253
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,653
My dad told me this is
the coolest mall ever.

1254
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,993
You think you know more than my dad?
Don't fucking come, then.

1255
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,829
It's the grand re-opening
of the S'wallow Valley Mall.

1256
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,291
It's just off Route 35
right here in historic S'wallow Valley.

1257
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,250
Where did you get that?

1258
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,635
This guy named Bishopman.
He sends this to me.

1259
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,262
He's been filling up
my voice-mail box for weeks

1260
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,843
with crazy rants
about these guys.

1261
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,428
But look at this.

1262
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,594
We got them, Tommy.
We got them.

1263
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,388
Earle, gather the men.

1264
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:21,683
We found your boys.
We're gonna go get them.

1265
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,307
All right.

1266
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,218
Listen, guys,
on behalf of Dobis,

1267
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,352
I want to say thank you
for all your hard work

1268
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,310
in getting this mall
back in shape.

1269
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,815
And I gotta say
something personally.

1270
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,350
We're all
very proud of you.

1271
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:05,735
Guys, tomorrow
is our big day,

1272
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,987
and Dobis couldn't be
more jazzed about it.

1273
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,772
But right now I want
to have a little fun,

1274
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,782
with the permission
of my best friend Tim.

1275
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,160
Muyo permissiono granted.

1276
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,790
Taquito,
would you do the honors?

1277
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:22,668
Here goes nothing.

1278
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,379
On three, everybody.

1279
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:28,838
One, two, three!

1280
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,342
Taquito.

1281
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:34,505
It's wonderful.

1282
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,345
It's gorgeous, Taquito.

1283
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,306
I worked really hard on it.

1284
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,347
- We should make a wish.
- I love it.

1285
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,937
Oh, Dobis, I wish
for this grand re-opening

1286
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,193
to be the greatest grand
re-opening of all time.

1287
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,319
I wish that Tim Heidecker
remains my best friend

1288
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,856
- and I get to marry Katie soon.
- Hmm.

1289
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,907
I forgot about that wolf.

1290
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,870
I know what to do.

1291
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,380
I will need some duct tape
and some pizza.

1292
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,182
Eric, I don't feel
good about this.

1293
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,975
Taquito, be careful.

1294
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,111
Mama Wolf!

1295
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,362
Taquito.

1296
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,445
I have some nice pizza
for you.

1297
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,736
Remember when
we had pizza?

1298
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,370
Hi, Mama Wolf.
Remember your baby boy?

1299
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:52,296
I have to ask you
a little favor.

1300
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,094
It's time to go
back to the...

1301
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,603
Taquito!

1302
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,778
He's gone.

1303
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,406
Must have snapped that
neck on the way down.

1304
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,942
- He saved the mall.
- Tell you what, Taquito.

1305
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,576
We're going to change
the name of the pizza court

1306
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,032
to the Taquito court,
do you hear me?

1307
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,413
Goodbye, boy.

1308
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,574
I miss the shit
out of him already.

1309
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,287
- Taquito!
- Mr. Weebs?

1310
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,751
What are you doing here?

1311
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,759
I could sense my boy
Taquito was in trouble.

1312
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,635
It's too late.
He's already dead.

1313
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,671
He sacrificed his body
for the mall.

1314
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,055
He's gone.

1315
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,888
Taquito.

1316
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,223
He's alive.

1317
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,140
Uh, am I in heaven?

1318
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,147
Taquito, you killed the wolf,
and you saved the mall.

1319
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,152
You did just what you
said you'd do.

1320
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,314
Uh, I did it.

1321
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,902
I killed the wolf.

1322
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,077
You did, my little boy.

1323
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,113
I'm so proud of you.

1324
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,703
I'm not gonna last long.

1325
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,835
I'm in a lot of pain.

1326
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,621
Oh, Taquito.

1327
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:16,088
Would you like Uncle Damian
to put some lead in you, son?

1328
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,594
It's so cold down here.

1329
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,675
Put me to sleep forever.

1330
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,010
Oh, Taquito.

1331
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,180
I can't watch him die twice.
I can't do it. Sorry.

1332
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,398
Taquito!

1333
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,031
I'm still here.

1334
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:44,028
Better try again.

1335
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,912
Okay.

1336
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,916
Taquito!

1337
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,623
Now I can't feel my legs.

1338
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,209
It won't be long now.

1339
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,418
I can't take this.
Finish him off.

1340
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,379
Damn it, Weebs,
shoot him in the face.

1341
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,214
No.

1342
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,674
I want my Taquito to have
an open casket funeral.

1343
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,224
Ow. Ohh!

1344
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,558
Come on, Taquito.

1345
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,894
Just die, Taquito.
Come on.

1346
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,863
Any minute now.

1347
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,525
Maybe I won't be sick
in heaven.

1348
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,738
He's dead.
Is he dead?

1349
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,414
- Yeah.
- Good.

1350
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,329
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Taquito. Thank you.

1351
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,674
That's it, then.

1352
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,098
A little to the left.

1353
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,313
Back a little bit.
That looks pretty good.

1354
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,944
- It's great.
- Yeah.

1355
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,606
You know what, Eric?
There's something I need to tell you.

1356
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,274
I think you may
have been right.

1357
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,277
I did some numbers
crunching of my own,

1358
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,286
and there's no way
we're going to make

1359
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,993
a billion dollars
running this mall.

1360
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:13,000
I know. But you know what?
That doesn't matter anymore.

1361
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,377
It's not about the money.
It's about you and me.

1362
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,664
It's about your new son.
It's about Katie.

1363
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:20,709
It's about the mall. I mean, we've
really made a difference here.

1364
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,753
You know what? They probably forgot
about that billion dollars anyway.

1365
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,094
It's just a billion dollars.
Hee!

1366
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:29,975
I love this fucking mall!
Come on.

1367
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,977
- To Dobis.
- Hey, big news.

1368
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,981
You have just been made
Dobis' employee of the month.

1369
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,937
I want to live in this
fucking mall forever.

1370
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,396
Yeah.

1371
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,024
Forever?

1372
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,614
Do you forgive me
for sleeping with Tim?

1373
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,029
I do.

1374
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,324
There he is.

1375
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,787
Ohh!

1376
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,668
I hope
you never leave.

1377
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,502
I guess we're gonna
be here forever.

1378
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,340
Look, Dad,
our first customers.

1379
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:09,973
I don't think
those are customers, son.

1380
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,802
Let me take a look.

1381
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,856
Shit. Schlaaang.

1382
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,483
They found us.

1383
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,564
All right, everybody inside.
Come on.

1384
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,361
What's going on?

1385
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:53,725
Listen up, Tim and Eric!

1386
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,932
We have you surrounded!

1387
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,518
And if you don't come out
in 10 seconds,

1388
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:02,310
I'm gonna come in there
and blow you to fucking hell!

1389
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:05,571
Finally.
Good luck, assholes.

1390
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,735
Ha ha ha! Hey, guys,
it's me... Allen.

1391
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:14,531
I was the one who sent you the tape
telling you where to find Tim and Eric.

1392
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,040
Shit!

1393
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,621
- Eric, look out!
- Oh, God!

1394
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:24,127
Okay, okay, listen, maybe...
maybe I overreacted.

1395
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,292
You think there's
some common ground here...

1396
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,880
I like you-you like me
kind of thing?

1397
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,592
Tim, we need
a Dobis-sized idea stat!

1398
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,722
Okay, hold on now.
Hold on. Let me think.

1399
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,475
- Come on! Think!
- Come on, Tim.

1400
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:38,683
- What's going on?
- Ah, I got it.

1401
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,643
Reggie, hey,
come on in.

1402
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:41,933
Come here,
come here, come here.

1403
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,851
- How's everything?
- Good.

1404
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,190
Family good?

1405
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,856
- Yes.
- Okay.

1406
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,025
So, listen, we got
a little thing out here.

1407
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,285
It's not really a big deal. But if you'd
go out there and talk to them,

1408
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,662
maybe knock some sense
into them, Reg.

1409
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,698
- Nice.
- You're a reasonable man.

1410
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,867
They're reasonable men.
You could go out there

1411
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,285
and tell them
to put their guns down.

1412
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,794
Would you do
that for us, Reg?

1413
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,296
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
do it, do it.

1414
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,797
Dobis needs you,
Reg. Please.

1415
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,253
You'd be hitting it
out of the park for us

1416
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,384
if you did it, Reg.

1417
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,762
- I can do that.
- Will you do it? Oh, good. Thanks, Reg.

1418
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,388
Why don't you go ahead
and do that now, then?

1419
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,895
Dobis thanks you, Reg.

1420
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,937
Hi.

1421
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,231
My name is Reggie.

1422
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,866
I think we should all
take a moment here

1423
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,447
and reassess the situation

1424
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:36,532
because there are a lot
of good people in there

1425
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:39,039
and I would hate
to see any of them hurt.

1426
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,325
Fire!

1427
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,618
No.

1428
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,599
How do you like that,
Tim and Eric?

1429
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,431
Huh? Ha! Ha!

1430
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,186
Aah!

1431
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,099
That didn't work.
Sorry.

1432
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,267
We're doomed.

1433
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,027
What is that smell?

1434
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:11,863
I pooped my pants.

1435
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,241
Oh, Allen,
that's disgusting.

1436
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,527
Look, I'm sorry that
I tattled on you two.

1437
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,036
I shouldn't have called.

1438
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,038
I just thought they were going to give
you a slap on the wrist.

1439
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,540
Smell's getting in my eyes.

1440
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,416
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

1441
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,043
Allen, you go
back to your store

1442
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:26,545
and bring as many swords
as you can carry.

1443
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,797
Okay.

1444
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,668
You're all gonna
die in there!

1445
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:42,177
Here you go, guys.
As many as I could muster.

1446
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:43,971
Thanks so much, Allen.
These are great.

1447
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,309
Oh, you're welcome.
You're welcome.

1448
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,020
Anything for you.
I am a team player.

1449
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,355
- Oh. This one's nice.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1450
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,895
That's one
of my favorite ones.

1451
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,155
I personally sharpened
that one... aah!

1452
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,284
That's for
betraying us, Allen!

1453
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:00,321
- Nice.
- Thanks, man.

1454
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,955
You know this is it.

1455
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,167
I know.

1456
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,249
I gotta say it's been
one hell of a ride.

1457
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,291
- To Dobis.
- To Dobis.

1458
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,045
Katie, I have something
to say to you now.

1459
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,677
You know you're the love
of my life, right?

1460
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,938
Yeah.

1461
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,770
Ever since I met you,
I wanted to consummate that love.

1462
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,357
I wanted to go deep inside
you without a condom

1463
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,943
and explode in
your canal. Psssh.

1464
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,733
Grow a little baby
up in there.

1465
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,698
Start a family.

1466
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:43,285
So I have to ask you this
one important question.

1467
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,587
Will you marry me?

1468
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,543
Hey, Eric, where'd you
get that big diamond?

1469
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,255
I got it on the "Diamond Jim" set.
I got tons of them.

1470
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:56,794
Oh, yeah, I got a ton
of them diamonds, too.

1471
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,304
I got, like, a billion
dollars' worth of them.

1472
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,551
Will you make me
the happiest man on earth?

1473
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:06,562
Yes, I do.

1474
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,348
- Katie!
- No.

1475
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,141
Nice shooting, Tommy.

1476
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,311
Really, really good.

1477
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,229
My love.

1478
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:16,988
No.

1479
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,997
Schlaaang!

1480
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,783
Eric.

1481
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,377
We doing this?

1482
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,504
Hells, yeah.

1483
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,916
Ah, shit, come on.

1484
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,635
Take them out!

1485
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,740
Okay, listen, I need you
to do something for me.

1486
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,870
It's not going to be easy,
but I know you can do it

1487
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,372
'cause you're my little boy.

1488
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:12,168
You're the best son
I ever had.

1489
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,372
Hey, Schlaaang!

1490
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,051
Shoot the kid!

1491
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,067
We did it.

1492
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:23,903
We did it, buddy.

1493
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,739
We really did it.

1494
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,741
Well, what did you think?

1495
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:10,996
As Steven Spielberg,
I approve of this movie.

1496
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,909
And let me say this is the greatest
film of all time.

1497
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,749
- Yeah.
- Let's celebrate.

1498
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,332
Yay!

1499
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:30,632
 Tim and Eric
have done it, yeah 

1500
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:34,303
 They made their movie
that they wanted to make 

1501
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:37,973
 You can tell by the smile
on their faces 

1502
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,357
 They got what they shot 

1503
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,860
 And then they put it
in the can 

1504
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:46,114
 "Tim and Eric's Billion
Dollar Movie" is done 

1505
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:49,822
 It's over, it's over,
it's over, oh, yeah 

1506
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:53,614
 "Tim and Eric's Billion
Dollar Movie" is done 

1507
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,078
 It's over, it's over,
it's over 

1508
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,744
 Oh, yeah... 

1509
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:51,005
Shrim!

1510
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,094
We did it. You understand me?
We fucking did it!

1511
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:04,477
Tim and Eric have taken
my part away from me...

1512
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,315
like Garry Marshall
did to me...

1513
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,446
back with "Laverne and Shirley"
and "Happy Days"...

1514
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,482
when they chose
Robin Williams over me.

1515
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,573
Hi. We're Tim and Eric.
I'm Tim Heidecker.

1516
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,208
Hi. I'm Eric Wareheimer,
and this movie...

1517
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:23,245
- Eric Wareheim.
- Hi. My name is Eric Wareheim.

1518
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,754
This is our
billion dollar movie.

1519
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:26,415
Thanks so much
for watching.

1520
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,254
I'm proud of the film.
I'm so proud of you, buddy.

1521
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,293
He's my best friend,
and I love him so much.

1522
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,337
I'm also proud of it
as well as you...

1523
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,256
of you.

1524
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,095
And...

1525
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,678
roll the credits.

1526
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,190
Okay.

1527
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,851
Roll credits.

1528
01:32:58,531 --> 01:32:59,691
You guys good?

1529
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:02,699
Great. Thanks.
Good for me.

1530
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,029
Oh, hi.

1531
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,569
I'm Michael Gross.

1532
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,614
