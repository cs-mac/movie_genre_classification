1
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,334
Chan.

2
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,337
Chan.

3
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,478
Ken.

4
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,448
You've come.
I do not know.

5
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,362
You slept very soundly.

6
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:44,335
You know, like this if it is old.

7
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,372
Do not feel we are old, Chan.

8
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,277
It is old age
but we still have a long story.

9
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,381
Do you remember our story, Ken?

10
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,385
Ken, we send it to the village.

11
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:07,293
We like just expelled.
In a place where we felt in exile.

12
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,491
I still remember that time, Chan.

13
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,332
We both felt free.

14
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,361
And it's a story that is not forgotten.

15
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,499
We send it to a far-flung village.

16
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,277
Must use a boat to get there.

17
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:31,247
And when it arrives
I felt very strange at all.

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,274
Are you Chan?
Mistress is waiting for you.

19
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,468
Alright.

20
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,356
Are you Chan?

21
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,293
Are you Chan?

22
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,425
I'm very pleased.

23
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,399
Are you surprised I'm old?

24
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,499
Not too.

25
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:09,381
Although I am old,
I still remember everything.

26
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,281
And I also have all of your pictures.

27
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,287
Are you Chan?

28
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,384
You know the story about me?

29
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,491
Meyakitkan and very sad.

30
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,489
Filled with suffering.

31
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,338
Can not be expressed in words.

32
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,237
Used here is often held performances.

33
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,511
The story of the king and queen.

34
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:51,221
Very touching and romantic.

35
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,422
We are all fascinated by the role.

36
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:04,232
Starring his very handsome man.
And I start my story with him.

37
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:10,334
A very manly at all.
But in the end ...

38
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,405
Very painful and regret.

39
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:22,320
You have no shame!
How dare you do that!

40
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,389
I beg you.

41
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:32,262
Please, you let this once.

42
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:38,233
I want to explain all that happened here.

43
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,371
No need to.

44
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,305
Do not you want to know?

45
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,280
Everything was clear.
You already can not forgive.

46
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:53,274
I want you to get out of here.
And do not ever come back again.

47
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,516
You're cruel.
Doing all of this.

48
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,316
What next?

49
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,430
Do you really go from there?

50
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,297
And leave him?

51
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,431
I've been kicked out.

52
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,400
There is no chance anymore.

53
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,509
I start everything from scratch.

54
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,517
Everything from the starting point.

55
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,354
It all depends on me now.

56
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,384
And then I found a place.

57
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,422
A very peaceful place.

58
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,358
And that makes me comfortable.

59
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:51,410
Here, I found peace.

60
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:15,390
I end here with Ken.
In this remote place.

61
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,466
Very quiet and peaceful here once.

62
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,410
You do not need khawartir with me.

63
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,479
I'm fine here.

64
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:33,451
I remember when I had to part with you.

65
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,485
It pains me,
but I had to do it.

66
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:43,489
To avoid pertengkaranku with Dad.

67
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,391
It makes me have to part with you.

68
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,370
Here a lot of servants.

69
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,471
And a lot of activities as well.

70
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:03,338
With that we both live everything.

71
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,418
And I feel at peace here.

72
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,356
While Ken, every day having fun.

73
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,452
Joked with the maid.
And the servants also entertain him.

74
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:25,369
I want you to be patient to wait.
I'll be home soon.

75
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,308
And we will be together again.
Jan Dara.

76
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,379
Chan, why did you this?

77
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,250
No nothing, Ken.
Just being felt all this.

78
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:46,451
You're lying, Chan.
You always say that.

79
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:52,226
Listen, Chan.
I've got a great idea.

80
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:57,234
Let's go have fun in the city.

81
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,494
What do you want?

82
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,330
Do not want.

83
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,404
Why do not you like?
Ken Chan wanted to entertain.

84
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,471
So you do not like this pensive.

85
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:16,387
Now, Chan. What would join Ken?
Ken would like to ask you to have fun.

86
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,395
You go.

87
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:52,255
Good evening, may I help you?
You can choose as you please.

88
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,453
There are skinny, fat, tall, short.

89
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,423
- How much is it?
- Not expensive, man.

90
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,433
With little money
You can feel satisfaction.

91
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,463
You do not need to worry,
all very good ministry.

92
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,504
What about it?

93
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,214
Do you often come here?

94
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,349
No.

95
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,218
What you first came here?

96
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,412
True, I first came here.

97
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,220
Are you going to come here again?

98
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,227
it depends on your service
if satisfactory I will come again.

99
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,525
You'll see.

100
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,337
So many men are
saying things like that.

101
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:46,334
But I'm not that kind of guy.
I'm a faithful.

102
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,376
Faithful like what?

103
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:59,354
It's easy to say the word faithful.
but in reality ...

104
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,358
Why do you say that?

105
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,492
Back before I was here,
I never felt a violent.

106
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,407
Happened when I was in the woods.
I had been obstructed by a group of people.

107
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,406
And I can not do anything.

108
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:26,281
I am at the abducted persons.
And the servants also taken.

109
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,321
And I was raped by them.

110
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:39,226
Every night.
Every night another man.

111
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:48,331
And there was a man who helped me.

112
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:54,335
He is also very loyal.

113
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,352
I do not know what I'm feeling right now.
Ken suddenly return with haste.

114
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:06,415
And when he arrived at the house,
he wanted to tell me something.

115
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:11,462
Though I had gone to bed.
But still he woke me up.

116
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:17,463
And told me about
her experience that night.

117
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,502
With the woman.

118
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,277
Then me and him immediately conduct an investigation.

119
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,245
But we did not find any.

120
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,274
You are sure of that story, Ken?

121
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:38,387
Chan, have I ever lied to you?

122
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,319
Looks like he also said ...
something else.

123
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,232
Oh, I remember there was something she said.

124
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,394
All events the last 10 years here.

125
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,407
What is your purpose?

126
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,277
To find out what about it?

127
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,439
It does not concern you,
for what bother?

128
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,353
Actually nothing to do with me.

129
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:15,324
What to do with you?

130
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:22,323
I want to find out the origin suggested.

131
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,471
Actually ...

132
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,216
We all also want to know the origin of our rafters.

133
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:54,289
Then we place down
The officer said that.

134
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,461
Far away from the city center,
and we had to walk along the river.

135
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,438
To get there.

136
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,401
And I hope, one thing.

137
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,377
I could find
I'm looking for answers.

138
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,375
This they want to ask something.

139
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,311
Can you help them?

140
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,260
What do you want to ask?

141
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,426
You want to know about?

142
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,399
Sorry.

143
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,251
I beg you to let me know.

144
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,254
It has to do with my mother
and origin suggested.

145
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,226
I'm begging you.

146
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,458
To tell them everything.

147
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:05,369
What happened at that time.

148
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,307
I beg of you.

149
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,274
I'll tell you, Chan.

150
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,345
At that time ...

151
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,306
I'm very happy.

152
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:09,297
At that time I was young and rich.

153
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:15,237
No one can touch me.
Everything wants to be friends with.

154
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:20,343
No exception to the police
and officials.

155
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,280
I'm very familiar with them.

156
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,251
Every day I always have fun.

157
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,516
Are accompanied with my friends.

158
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,327
And there is a policeman who is very close to me.

159
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:41,494
On one day,
he met a woman.

160
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,265
Beauty as an angel.

161
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,506
He instantly fell in love.

162
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,241
And at that moment
he promised in its own right.

163
00:16:54,513 --> 00:17:00,247
I must have this woman
whatever happens.

164
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,379
And it turns out his love too
received by the woman.

165
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,320
And finally ...

166
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,428
The woman kidnapped by
group of people.

167
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:15,232
And do not know where it was taken.

168
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,462
Not heard the news about him anymore.

169
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,404
Until one day ...

170
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,378
He investigated the
carrying troops.

171
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,372
Finding their hideout.

172
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:40,220
And she found her hero.
With a sad state.

173
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:47,297
And finally she told me everything.
What happened to him and others.

174
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,493
And what they do.

175
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,466
Tells us that
she was raped many times.

176
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,276
Day and night with the men.

177
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,447
I'm very pleased.

178
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,385
Finally you can go back to my arms.

179
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,223
Whatever happens, forget it.

180
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,254
From now on, we will begin a new chapter.

181
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,294
No need to remember the past again.

182
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:23,391
We can start from scratch.

183
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,465
But what about me?

184
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,504
Not a problem.

185
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,269
I will forget everything.

186
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,317
I was dirty.

187
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,359
I feel not worthy anymore.
I do not want to be like this.

188
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,350
Chan ...

189
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,489
Will you accept me?

190
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,234
Although what happened to me.

191
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,412
I receive you.

192
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,454
And on that night,
on their first night.

193
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,230
One thing happens.

194
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,459
Those that do will be in the firing squad.

195
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,491
Because there is no mercy for them.

196
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,295
I'm here to punish you.

197
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,470
No need, I'll handle it.

198
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,241
It was embarrassing my family name.

199
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,467
No need to talk anymore.

200
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,358
You, bastard.

201
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,353
Embarrassing!

202
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,390
You do not know who your father.

203
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,358
Many men who never felt the body.

204
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,393
Illegitimate child.

205
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,293
Chan.

206
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,394
Chan.

207
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,497
Do not come closer.

208
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,354
Do not come closer.

209
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,364
Do not come closer.

210
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,432
Chan.

211
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,358
Control yourself.

212
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,338
You do not know what it's like.

213
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,242
Knowing that my mother had been raped.

214
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,333
Chan, you listen.

215
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,412
It all does not matter now.

216
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,448
Listen, Chan.

217
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,412
It was all over.
You do not like this.

218
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,476
Listen, Chan.

219
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,534
Illegitimate child!

220
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,307
Illegitimate child!

221
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,471
Illegitimate child!

222
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,345
Illegitimate child!

223
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:56,461
Chan.

224
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,367
Chan, do not worry there Ken.

225
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,406
I will always be with you.

226
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,366
We're going to face all this, Chan.

227
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,334
It's over.

228
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:37,304
You do not need to worry anymore.

229
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:41,276
It was all over.

230
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:46,411
All things have karma.

231
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,482
Everything will be beautiful in its time.

232
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,323
Omniscient God.

233
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,418
He knows which is right.

234
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,490
He knows what is wrong.

235
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:07,302
Remember that.
Karma applies to everyone.

236
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,508
No one can escape it.

237
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:18,273
No one exception.
You remember this, Chan.

238
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:25,382
Your name is Chan.
Descendant of a distinguished.

239
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:30,317
Chan someone respectable.

240
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,261
A dignified and magnanimous.

241
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,368
You should continue this legacy.

242
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:44,432
Like a child following his father footsteps.

243
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,312
Do the right thing.

244
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:52,382
Do not do bad things.

245
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,481
Everything will be beautiful in its time.

246
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,348
I understand.

247
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:30,311
Chan, how are you doing there?
Still remember me?

248
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:37,524
Been a long time do not you write a letter to me.
I miss you so much.

249
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:44,326
May you be healthy there.
And not any less.

250
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:49,371
I'm here too fine.

251
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,476
I was so expecting you.

252
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:59,375
Hopefully you can quickly return.
We'll be together again.

253
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:05,211
And I also want to
to tell you something.

254
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,359
But I'll keep it,
until you come back.

255
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:16,267
Every day I think about you.
I miss you so much.

256
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,436
I hope you missed me too.

257
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:09,442
And Ken find his soul mate.

258
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,383
Very beautiful, is not it?

259
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:23,493
Ken soon married.
Without waiting for a long time again.

260
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,298
On the day that Ken is very happy at all.

261
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,439
Right, Ken.
You're very lucky.

262
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,283
And soon a son is given.

263
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,251
Chan, what are you here for?
See this son.

264
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:50,222
Boy, there is Chan here to see you.

265
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:55,228
Chan, what are you here for?
Want to see my son?

266
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,300
Chan, you're soon to follow.

267
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,405
This funny child.

268
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,503
Shooting star.

269
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,384
May you be a good boy.

270
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,344
So good sleep.

271
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,289
Ken is very happy in karuniai a son.

272
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,292
Day by day more and more fleeting.

273
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:28,458
And everything is going well.

274
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,235
And his son is getting big.

275
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:46,439
And I was alone here,
waiting for something.

276
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:53,382
I'm waiting for someone who craved.
Someone who can relieve my feelings.

277
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,385
Mother. Welcome.

278
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:02,355
Mother, is my son.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

279
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,400
Wake up all of you.

280
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,409
Finally ...

281
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:19,506
Everything can come together.

282
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,244
Karma has been fruitful.

283
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,386
No need to wait any longer.

284
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,328
Happiness will soon come.

285
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,490
The wonderful thing is coming.

286
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,362
Not to worry.

287
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,464
I'm not worried about anything.

288
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:50,312
You listen carefully.

289
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,351
You want to say something?

290
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,215
Something ...

291
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,321
Which is very important.

292
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,467
Something else that is not in ketauhi, Chan.

293
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,334
A taboo truth
for in the describing.

294
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:28,443
Something very forbidden
for in the describing.

295
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,450
Something very erotic.

296
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:38,261
A great sex game.

297
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,534
And it happened when you were a kid.

298
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:52,435
Your father took one of Singapore.
And also from Europe.

299
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,444
A woman who is very beautiful.

300
00:31:56,281 --> 00:32:00,240
Someone who has captivated his heart.

301
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,483
But this woman is very lonely.

302
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,290
He always imagined something.

303
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,515
Are you surprised to see me here?

304
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:18,384
Would you like to accompany me to drink?

305
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,322
Can not seem to.

306
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,465
Why? You're embarrassed?

307
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,333
Not so.

308
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,343
You never know.

309
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,243
You are my love.

310
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,315
At first glance.

311
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,220
You never know too.

312
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,452
You also love at first sight.

313
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,412
And when they come back.
One thing happens.

314
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,507
Things never terbanyangkan
will occur earlier.

315
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,352
My husband, lady.
Glad you two are back.

316
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm here to ask for the blessing of you.

317
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:23,437
Me and him are getting married.

318
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,214
We love each other,
can not be separated.

319
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:34,451
And she's pregnant with my child.
I beg ...

320
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,228
You can approve of our relationship.

321
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,492
Nice.

322
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:48,433
Why? Are you not happy
heard this news?

323
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:54,310
Unfortunately, it turns out our way
Singapore to bring happiness.

324
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,510
We will soon be having a party
for both of you.

325
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,387
What is it, dear?

326
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,289
That's all right.

327
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,328
I do not condone them.

328
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,422
Why?

329
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,263
What's the matter, aunt?

330
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,302
You say, dear.

331
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,440
Dear ...

332
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,380
I'm actually doing something.

333
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,490
Something shameful.

334
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,454
Thing else that you can not forgive.

335
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:58,375
I've done an illicit relationship
with your son.

336
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:03,279
Honey, why did you do it?

337
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,515
At that time I was very lonely.

338
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:18,326
You always have to work until late at night.

339
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,230
Why?

340
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,277
Why do you say that?

341
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,373
Very disappointing.

342
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,485
You do not want me to be happy?

343
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,420
- Not so.
- Then why did you tell me?

344
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,523
I really respect you for it.

345
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,459
Now you unload everything.
When I'm happy.

346
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,426
How could you do that.

347
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,233
How could you do that.

348
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:07,302
I do not want you anymore!
Divorce me! I want a divorce!

349
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,406
And get out of here too!

350
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,395
Dear.

351
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,275
Do you want to stay with me?

352
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,369
Although I was without any.

353
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,327
P'chon.

354
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,418
P'chon.

355
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,297
P'chon.

356
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,265
Do not leave me.

357
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,463
P'chon. Wait for me.

358
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,501
P'chon!

359
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,338
Nuam?

360
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,282
Nuam?

361
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,410
Nuam?

362
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:32,258
Finally, I managed to witchcraft as well.

363
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:38,495
All been shortchanged. I'm very pleased.

364
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,465
I'll wait.

365
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,506
Until they realized who I was.

366
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,440
Well, shaman.

367
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:07,293
You should be aware that you can not
managed without my help.

368
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,367
And only I can make
successful and happy.

369
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:18,272
With me here, you will be happy, do not need
fear nothing, I will take care of you.

370
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:24,405
Because I'm black magic shaman who master the
are not invincible.

371
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:30,318
- Mewha, you say something.
- I can not.

372
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:39,420
You have to remember, he is my favorite grandson,
keep him, do not make him sad.

373
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:46,294
You're not afraid of anyone anymore.

374
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,531
But you have to respect, Mewha.

375
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:56,235
I promise I'll take care of him properly,
do not let anyone hurt him.

376
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,245
Nice.

377
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:09,384
I'll give you an amulet to keep yourself,
of anything that will hurt you.

378
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:14,396
You have to remember, prohibition, if not
You could die.

379
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:22,331
Young coconuts are thrown to you.
Durian is already rotten.

380
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:27,399
Sticks, 3 sticks. Remember, mind you.

381
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:33,245
Or not, you will die easily.

382
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:39,289
Without it, you will be miserable, very miserable.

383
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,449
Remember, it's taboo!

384
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,496
I remember that.

385
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,240
Always.

386
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,485
Mistress big?

387
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,353
Grandma?

388
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,356
Mother?

389
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,393
- Mom?
- Grandma.

390
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,233
- I'm calling people out.
- Mom?

391
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:52,360
Remember, you're just a kid just rubbish
herein.

392
00:43:53,364 --> 00:44:01,271
You're just a lackey! Lackey!
Lackey!

393
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,498
Understand!

394
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,300
Derajatmu aware!

395
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,241
Illegitimate child!

396
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,474
At your fill!

397
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,479
To death too!

398
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:18,278
It was time for me to go back
to confront him.

399
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:25,254
Keeping promises with grandma and myself.
So I can not fled continue.

400
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:33,455
I have to go home.
As different people again.

401
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:39,298
With the whole family. And they
be aware of this myself.

402
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:45,306
That I've never ever the same.

403
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,498
Glad to see you guys again.
very touching.

404
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:22,343
Son, this is your father's lawyer.

405
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,449
I've been waiting for you.

406
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,444
Greetings.

407
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,327
Now this is your chair.

408
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,323
What's wrong, son?

409
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:09,315
Now you are the head of this family,
So you are ruling around here.

410
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,352
Greetings to my father.

411
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:19,228
Today I stumbled home to
take care of problems at home.

412
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,423
As well as the rightful heir.

413
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,233
How is that possible?

414
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:33,368
After all, why is he?
He really does not deserve to be here.

415
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:38,471
You're always in here keciali thank him.
You should know that.

416
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,376
So, you should not have brought him here.

417
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:51,224
- Why is that?
- Because he's not a part of this family.

418
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,263
That's it.

419
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,355
I see.

420
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,300
But for now I declare him
family.

421
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:04,272
Right now, you have to obey my words.

422
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:13,440
I do not tolerate any insult.
You must accept peraturanku.

423
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,314
Understand?

424
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,255
Yes, that I can accept.

425
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:28,397
If so, there is no problem anymore
available at a later date.

426
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:39,232
You must be friendly with my brother,
He will stay here, you must teirma it.

427
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,334
What is needed?

428
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,347
Of course.

429
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:51,388
I've gone to Singapore, and I've
stay in their place.

430
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,288
So it's time for me to repay them.

431
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:57,360
Alright.

432
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:01,420
If you say so, the head of the family.

433
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,267
Te-may.

434
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:12,468
- What you do not like me calling, the head of the family?
- I do not like to hear it alone

435
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:19,372
Sir, you have to get used to receiving it.

436
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,442
You've been in singapore, so you
should be used to it.

437
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,348
If I do not like, and why?

438
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,418
Why do you have to singapore?

439
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:36,455
To what do you get there?

440
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:41,430
You're just going to bring disaster on this family.

441
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,405
When I was in Singapore.

442
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,280
I realized one thing

443
00:50:55,352 --> 00:51:01,257
That a person, can not leave it alone.

444
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:08,422
And should be given a lesson, told
who's in charge.

445
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:15,266
So there is no problem anymore.

446
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:25,315
Called the head of the family, was a
excessive.

447
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:29,252
But I prefer something that respect.

448
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,411
Should not be said.

449
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,257
I am so happy.

450
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,522
You should be aware of it.

451
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,492
You know it all.

452
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:49,261
You do realize that all.

453
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:56,369
So I think of you as family.
Do not let them.

454
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,413
You tell me if they insult you.
Whatever it is, too.

455
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:10,484
That you would have remembered it.

456
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,420
As you used to say.

457
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:19,401
So this is not worry about it.

458
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:25,240
You do realize that's it.

459
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,308
So, you know.

460
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:36,283
What to do?
For one it is.

461
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:51,356
You were always despised me.

462
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,337
Eventually you like this.

463
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:05,346
Poor thing, poor thing.

464
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:09,475
Good? Ken?

465
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,387
Yes, sir?

466
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:18,383
- You sleep in her room, with your wife.
- Good. Tuan.

467
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,301
Wait, sir.

468
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,433
What are you gonna say?

469
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:43,343
do not do it, I'm begging you.
Tuan.

470
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:52,428
Yes? Yes? Why should I listen to you.

471
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:58,495
- You do as I tell you!
- Well, sir.

472
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:05,400
You sign it.

473
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:37,298
How are you uncle? What your son there?

474
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:10,432
My dear, I'm glad you're back.

475
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,428
But I've gone away.

476
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:21,301
I could keep an eye on the place,
I love you.

477
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,319
He has loved you all along.

478
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,415
Until he can no longer here.

479
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,523
Chan?

480
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,302
Never mind.

481
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,432
Do not be so sad anymore.

482
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,369
Yes, I know.

483
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,454
Greetings to the host.

484
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:24,522
You serve me.

485
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:32,420
Time when relatives came.

486
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:39,229
It was very fun.
We make it a party.

487
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:47,334
And marriage is made,
very festive at all.

488
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:52,244
Thought would live happily.

489
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:56,250
The wedding day begins with calm.

490
01:00:56,352 --> 01:01:01,221
And everyone was happy.

491
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:31,376
This corresponds to what you want, Chan.

492
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:40,318
It is marriage for our families.

493
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:46,530
If so, you're right people
very clever.

494
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,308
You call me, sir.

495
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,503
I like to call you Chan.

496
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,505
Chan maid!

497
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,338
Sir!

01:50:46,339 --> 01:50:50,207
I do not want to, why did you make me.

824
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:53,404
You want to fight it?

825
01:50:53,480 --> 01:51:02,388
We are old, which could fight again.
I beg you to accept it.

826
01:51:03,523 --> 01:51:12,397
Come Jan, stay in the house.
Keep only the certificate.

827
01:51:13,366 --> 01:51:17,496
- There is still the care of my son.
- Father I come pick you up.

828
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:23,399
- Ting, you've come.
- Uncle.

829
01:51:24,344 --> 01:51:33,412
- So is your son?
- Correct Jan, he's handsome like me.

830
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:41,486
- Berbaktilah on your father.
- Of course, I would take him to America.

831
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:47,256
I will go to America again 3 days.

832
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:53,439
True, we should be the father.

833
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,501
You want to go Ping?

834
01:51:57,343 --> 01:52:01,302
Maybe we will not see each other again?

835
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:09,381
Well, Help me wake up.

836
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:18,261
- Be careful father.
- I would feel lonely.

837
01:52:18,498 --> 01:52:25,301
Jan, Why do not you sell it and
around the world?

838
01:52:25,338 --> 01:52:32,437
- I do not intend to be without you.
- Do it for yourself.

839
01:52:33,513 --> 01:52:40,351
- I do not want.
- Look for your own happiness.

840
01:52:41,287 --> 01:52:47,487
- Can I get that?
- Everyone will be in January

841
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:53,388
Ping What's so funny?
You're making fun of me.

842
01:52:53,466 --> 01:52:56,367
Our uncle went first.

843
01:52:56,503 --> 01:53:01,236
- Hope you survived the trip.
- Thank you.

844
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:07,302
Take care of yourself Jan, do not drink too much.

845
01:53:07,347 --> 01:53:11,249
When drinking, I could not stop.

846
01:53:11,317 --> 01:53:16,345
- Do not play her well in January
- If women especially.

847
01:53:16,422 --> 01:53:20,290
You're a flirt. I went.

848
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:57,224
[Cry]
