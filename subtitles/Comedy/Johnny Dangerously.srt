1
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Anybody hungry?

2
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,900
Didn't think so.
Just kidding.

3
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,700
Okay, fellas, food time.
Burt, liver, no onions.

4
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Here you go, Burtie.
And, for dessert...

5
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,300
There you go.

6
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,600
Connie, Mack, you kids wanted the tuna,
hold the mayo. Lovely choice.

7
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Here you go. I'm not crazy
about you two living together.

8
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,700
Marvin, you ordered the flounder.
I didn't like the way it looked...

9
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,999
...so I prepared a little something
special for you. I think you'll like this.

10
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,799
Maybe not.
Okay, here we go.

11
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,499
- Polly, get that for me, would you?
- All right.

12
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,699
Kelly's Pet Shop. Polly speaking.
It's your mother, Johnny.

13
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,099
- Tell her to hold, would you?
- Hang on.

14
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:38,799
Thanks, Pol. Hi, Ma.

15
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,599
Not too much.
I'm just feeding some of the animals.

16
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,299
Yeah, sure. It's probably just
the weather. Don't worry about it.

17
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,599
Probably get better tomorrow.

18
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,699
Maybe if you wouldn't drink so much,
the whole thing would clear up.

19
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,099
I'll see you later.

20
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,899
All right, come here.
Hand it over.

21
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,099
- What the hell was that noise?
- It was this little gadget.

22
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,799
Something I came up with.
Prevents stealing.

23
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,999
- Stops guys like you.
- Go ahead, call the cops.

24
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,999
- Let's get this over with.
- Pretty tough, huh?

25
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,899
- Tough enough.
- Yeah? You like stealing?

26
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,999
- Beats paying for it.
- You think stealing makes you big?

27
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:27,599
Bigger than you, wearing an apron
and feeding a bunch of monkeys.

28
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:32,998
- I'll tell you where stealing gets you.
- Wake me when you're through.

29
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:38,598
You know, I started out just like you, kid.
It must have been 25 years ago.

30
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,998
- What's going on?
- Don't worry. It'll end in a few minutes.

31
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:45,898
It always does this when I talk
about the past. It was 1910.

32
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,498
Times were good in America.
Plenty of everything:

33
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:54,298
Jobs, security, laughs.

34
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:58,798
America was in great shape,
except for President William Howard Taft.

35
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:04,598
Was he a porker. He weighed as much
as Teddy Roosevelt and half of McKinley.

36
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:09,998
immigrants poured in from all over
the world, looking for a better life.

37
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:15,798
Over 97 percent of them settled
in a two-block area of New York City.

38
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:20,698
There was a law that said that
immigrants who wanted citizenship...

39
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:25,698
...had to stay out of their apartments and
walk around the streets with hats on.

40
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:28,298
Most didn't find streets
paved with gold.

41
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:36,798
instead, they found hard times. Nobody
had it tougher than my mom, Mom Kelly.

42
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:41,998
She was kind and sweet.
She had a colorful way of putting things.

43
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:47,898
The Lower East Side,
this really sucks.

44
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,797
I was your age and just
starting out in business.

45
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,697
Hey, kid, you got a paper?

46
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:55,597
- Hi, Mom.
Hi, Johnny.

47
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,497
- Your pancreas feeling better?
- Now don't you go worrying about me.

48
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:03,997
- You just keep yourself warm.
- Thanks, Mom.

49
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,697
Oh, God, it's the worst July in years.

50
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:12,197
You go on upstairs. As soon as I
sell these, we'll celebrate your birthday.

51
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:14,897
You're my darling boy.

52
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:17,897
Hey, kid, paper here.
- Yeah.

53
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:30,097
All right, Tribune. Get your Tribune.
Get your Tribune.

54
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:34,797
Tribune. Get your Tribune.
One lousy penny.

55
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:42,697
- One lousy penny. Get your Tribune.
Hey, this is my corner.

56
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:46,297
- Danny Vermin don't move for nobody.
- Oh, yeah?

57
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:50,697
Yeah. It's okay, officer,
I can handle this myself.

58
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,497
- Stop the car, Arthur. I wanna see this.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Dundee.

59
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:08,696
- No hard feelings.
- You ain't seen the last of Danny Vermin.

60
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,596
Hey, kid. Come here.

61
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,596
- I like the way you handle yourself.
- Thanks, mister.

62
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:22,696
Do you know who this man is?

63
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:27,296
- I give up.
- How'd you like to make a 50?

64
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:31,996
Do I have to break the law?

65
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:35,896
If I broke the law, it'd be
like breaking my mother's heart.

66
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:39,796
Okay, kid.
But if you change your mind...

67
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:44,496
...I値l be at the Club 25.

68
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:24,796
- Dr. Magnus? How's my mother?
- It's her pancreas. I need to operate.

69
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,495
- How much is it gonna cost?
- $49.95.

70
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:29,995
- $49.95?
- This week only.

71
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:34,795
- Where can I get that kind of money?
- Why not knock over a gas station?

72
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:45,495
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi, Johnny.

73
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:49,695
Hi, Mom.
You always were a sucker for a left.

74
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,295
- Come on, take a break.
- I can't.

75
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,995
I'm a year behind
on Mr. Stevenson's shirts.

76
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:59,095
There's a new law.
No wash on your birthday.

77
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:02,395
Gosh, Johnny, I really
don't think that's a law.

78
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:06,295
Well, you won't find it in your law books
because I just made it up.

79
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,495
He colored Oliver Wendell Holmes purple.

80
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:15,295
Isn't that something?
And him only 6 years old.

81
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:20,195
- Your father would have been proud.
- He always wanted you to be a lawyer.

82
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,595
He sure could have used one.
- You'll make something of yourself.

83
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:28,195
- I'll see that you do.
- No mother was ever blessed...

84
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:32,295
...with two finer sons
than Johnny and Tommy Kelly.

85
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:37,095
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Bless the saints, it's an ashtray.

86
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:40,295
I've been thinking of taking up smoking.
This clinches it.

87
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:46,294
- How does it feel to be 29?
- I only hope I reach 30.

88
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,994
- Are you all right, Mom?
- I'll be fine.

89
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:55,394
Johnny, you go back to work.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.

90
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:05,294
- She needs an operation immediately.
- it'd break my mother's heart.

91
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:09,094
- $49.95.
- How'd you like to make a 50?

92
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:13,694
- I just hope I reach 30.
- I値l be at the Club 25.

93
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:17,794
Sorry, Mom.
It's the only way I know how.

94
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:49,194
No more nodding!

95
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,793
Dundee's gang is here.

96
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,993
What's that bastidge want?

97
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:32,293
- How's tricks, Moronie?
- What are you doing here, icehole?

98
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,793
Can't a fellow enjoy
a night gambling with his pals?

99
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:39,793
Don't bullshty me.
Search the sum in a batch.

100
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:43,893
We're clean, Moronie.
You see, I don't bear no grudges...

101
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,593
...even though your boys have been
muscling in on my territory.

102
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,293
Why do you do that, Moronie?

103
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:53,393
- It's a free country, icehole.
- They're clean, boss.

104
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,493
Okay, you and the rest
of your bastidges can gamble.

105
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:03,993
But don't try no fargin trick,
or you'll end up with your bells in a sling.

106
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,993
What a mouth on that guy.

107
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,592
Hey, kid.

108
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:29,792
Paper, mister?

109
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,092
Here you go.

110
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,892
- Here you are, sir.
- Thanks, kid.

111
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,692
Nobody move and nobody will get hurt.

112
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:52,092
All we want is Moronie's money.
Go ahead, kid.

113
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:55,892
You fargin, sneaky bastidge.

114
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:01,492
I'm gonna take your dwork.
I'm gonna nail it to the wall!

115
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:05,592
I'm gonna crush your boils
in a meat grinder!

116
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:10,292
I'm gonna cut off your arms
and shove them up your icehole!

117
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:14,992
Dirty sum in a batch!
My own club.

118
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:16,392
Mr. Dundee, watch out!

119
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:24,292
Stupid, lock the fargin door!
We got Dundee!

120
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:30,592
Get that lousy kid!
Get that sum in a batch.

121
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:42,991
Get him! It's only a fargin kid,
you fargin styheads!

122
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,491
Get him!

123
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,091
Give me a gun.
Give me a gun!

124
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,891
- Next shooter.
Kid's like a monkey.

125
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:59,391
Get him! It's only a fargin kid.
Kill him!

126
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:06,591
Hell of an anniversary, Lou.

127
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:11,791
I don't believe you guys!
Get him, or you're all fired!

128
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:20,191
No, no, no. Permesso.
Say your prayers, icehole.

129
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,291
Hold it.

130
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:34,891
Why you miserable corksucker.
I'm gonna get you for this.

131
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:41,491
Roman Moronie never forgets
a fargin face, kid. I'll get you.

132
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:55,090
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, thanks to this kid...

133
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,290
...and this.
Thanks a lot, kid.

134
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,690
- From now on, you're my boy.
Yeah, you really live dangerously.

135
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,490
- By the way, what's your name?
- Johnny. Johnny...

136
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,090
Johnny Dangerously.

137
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,590
I should've never picked that name.
A name like that, you gotta live up to.

138
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,590
Act tough. Put up a front.
I got into a lot of fights.

139
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,490
- What's your last name?
- Binderhoff.

140
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,590
Great. Don't change that name
and you'll stay out of trouble.

141
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,190
Anyway, Mom's pancreas got better.
Things generally improved.

142
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,190
And I didn't have to work
for the Dundee gang.

143
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,590
I was your average,
poverty-stricken teenager...

144
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,590
...thinking about girls, my hair, girls.

145
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,790
Gee, Johnny, I致e never seen
anyone dance like that!

146
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,490
- Dr. Magnus, how's my mother?
- It's her thyroid, Johnny.

147
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,690
What's wrong with it?

148
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,289
We can't find it.
Gonna have to do a thyroid search.

149
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:19,189
- How much is that gonna cost?
- You're in luck. This week it's just $999.

150
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:22,389
$999?

151
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:27,089
Talk about bad luck.
There was only one place for me to go.

152
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,889
I joined the Jocko Dundee mob full time.

153
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,989
Jocko was still at war
with his old enemy, Roman Moronie.

154
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,989
The years didn't soften Moronie.

155
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,589
He continued to murder
the English language...

156
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:41,989
...and anyone who got in his way.

157
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:48,789
Moronie had a lot of rules for his gang.
Number one: Never park in his space.

158
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,089
The Dundee gang was a lot more fun.

159
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:55,889
Sure we did illegal things, but we
never bothered the general public.

160
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,789
And every Christmas, Jocko returned
a little cash back to the community.

161
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,489
Every chance I got,
I returned to the old neighborhood.

162
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,489
They looked up to me
like I was a folk hero.

163
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,089
"I love Johnny" T-shirts.
I love Johnny.

164
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,889
Johnny, can I follow in your footsteps?

165
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,389
Sure, kid.
Here, it was burning a hole in my pocket.

166
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:23,189
Look, Rosie, it's Johnny Dangerously.

167
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,389
Mrs. Zimmer.
Everybody, over here.

168
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,488
Now what did I tell all you people?

169
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:38,788
Around here you're Johnny Kelly,
a law-abiding night club owner...

170
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,488
...not the notorious gangster
Johnny Dangerously.

171
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:46,188
Sure, and I知 the pope.

172
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:51,088
- Hey, pope. How'd you know?
- Johnny, everybody knows...

173
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:57,488
...except your mother and your brother.
And nobody here is gonna say nothing.

174
00:17:57,988 --> 00:18:03,588
Thanks, Your Holiness. Tell you what,
build yourself a new gym at the Vatican.

175
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,788
Bless you, Johnny.

176
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,288
Johnny!

177
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:27,088
Hi, Ma.

178
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:28,888
How's my best girl?

179
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:31,988
You gotta watch that left, Ma.

180
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:36,288
I love him, but some day
I知 gonna knock him on his ass.

181
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:42,588
- What are you cooking, Ma?
- Beer.

182
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:47,388
With noodles? What a great idea.

183
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:53,287
- What's new?
- Me arthritis, that's new.

184
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:56,587
One of the muscles in me calf
is shriveling up.

185
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:02,787
Also, I知 losing sensation in me face.
I think it's a neurological disorder.

186
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:09,087
- But the rest of me is in the pink.
- You gotta take better care of yourself.

187
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:13,587
I don't want you living like this
and doing other people's laundry.

188
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,587
What are you saying,
give up me career?

189
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,787
Maybe you ought to retire.
Enjoy the golden years, Ma...

190
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:24,687
...not do this.

191
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,987
Son, I couldn't consider retiring.

192
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:36,387
Not so long as I can still
give good laundry.

193
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:41,287
- Where's Tommy?
- Don't be talking to me about Tommy.

194
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:46,987
- Why not?
- Because I知 leaving law school.

195
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:52,587
- If this is a joke, I ain't laughing.
- I'm dropping out and marrying Sally.

196
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:56,387
- You can't change my mind.
- Is this what you want, Sally?

197
00:19:56,887 --> 00:20:02,387
I want whatever Tommy wants.
I'm his girl, and he makes the decisions.

198
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:06,486
Sally's place is in the home,
and I intend to support her.

199
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:10,086
I'll shine boots, drive a hack,
blow glass, anything.

200
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:15,686
- Johnny, please, talk sense to him.
- You're breaking your mother's heart.

201
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:21,186
- Why, Tommy? Why?
- I can't say it in front of Mom.

202
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:25,686
Okay. I've got a little business
to take care of.

203
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:30,186
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 10:00?

204
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:35,186
All right, you little muskrat.

205
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,586
- I'll see you, Sally.
Bye.

206
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:41,686
Ma, don't worry about a thing.
I'll straighten everything out.

207
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:47,786
Hey, Ma, what's this in your ear? $100?

208
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:55,086
- What can't you say in front of Mom?
- Nothing, Mom.

209
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,086
I know what you can't say.
You wanna get laid.

210
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:00,686
- Mom!
- You wanna hump your brains out.

211
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:03,486
Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

212
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,986
Hi, Pat.
- Top of the morning. How's your mother?

213
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:13,286
Much better, Pat. Thanks for asking.

214
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:17,586
- Such a wonderful woman.
- Yes, she is. A sweet little lady.

215
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:22,386
She's got the smile of an angel.

216
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:50,085
Johnny is here!
Johnny!

217
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:51,985
Johnny!
Johnny!

218
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,985
You wanna be my first?
No, it's my turn.

219
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,085
- I'm not wearing a bra.
- That makes two of us.

220
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,385
- I'm a real blond, Johnny.
- Check it out Thursday?

221
00:22:01,785 --> 00:22:04,685
- You're on.
- How do you do it, Johnny?

222
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:07,485
Mutual respect.

223
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:13,385
- Hey, who's the nightingale?
- She just flew in from Pittsburgh.

224
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:17,585
Say, kid? What do they call you?

225
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:21,285
- Impressive.
- Her name is Lil Sheridan.

226
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:23,385
Thanks.

227
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,285
Lil Sheridan, huh?

228
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:30,885
My name's Dangerously...
Johnny Dangerously.

229
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:32,985
Did you know
your last name's an adverb?

230
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:36,685
Hey. I like that.

231
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:42,184
You got spirit,
spunk, fire, verve.

232
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:48,784
- You got those. I like those on a woman.
- Gee, my heart's all a flutter.

233
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:53,484
I'll tell you what,
why don't you take my card.

234
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:57,084
- Enjoying yourself?
- You call me tomorrow.

235
00:22:57,484 --> 00:23:02,284
Yeah? Don't be upset when you don't
hear the phone ringing.

236
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:07,784
- Suit yourself.
- I hope this is helping your morale.

237
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:11,284
That's the first time I had
to take that card back.

238
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:14,084
I kind of like it.

239
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,984
I'll be seeing you.

240
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:35,784
Does the word "smitten"
mean anything to anybody?

241
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:39,084
Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, Vito.

242
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,684
Vito, better cut down on the pasta.

243
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:44,584
- I'm starting a diet on Monday.
- Attaboy.

244
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:48,584
- What are you so happy about?
- Well, Vito, I just met an angel...

245
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:52,684
...an absolute angel.
- You met Lil, huh?

246
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:57,684
I sure did, Mr. Dundee.
You see this card? This card...

247
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:01,583
...has been to paradise.
Johnny's in love.

248
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,583
You remind me of me
and the wife 20 years ago.

249
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,583
Of course, Mae never looked like Lil.

250
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:12,783
And now she looks like him.

251
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:18,083
- But what am I, a beauty?
- Dames are put on Earth to weaken us...

252
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:22,183
...drain our energy,
laugh at us when they see us naked.

253
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:28,383
Meet two new members of the gang:
Danny Vermin and his sidekick, Dutch.

254
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:31,183
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hi, Danny.

255
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:34,083
Danny and I used to fight in
the old neighborhood.

256
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,783
I wondered what happened to you.

257
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:41,283
Well, I fulfilled a lot of people's
predictions. I've become a real scumbag.

258
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:43,183
Good for you.

259
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,783
A lot of people go their whole lives
without realizing what they wanna be.

260
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,283
Delivery for Jocko Dundee.

261
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:04,483
There's some postage due,
but I値l take care of it. No problem.

262
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:07,083
What's this?

263
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:21,682
He sent us a robot.

264
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:24,482
"Dear Bastidges,
I hope I got a few of you.

265
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:31,182
If not, I値l get you when I take over
the Club 25. Love and kisses, Moronie. "

266
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:36,082
- We gotta stop him.
- I got something to stop him.

267
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:40,882
They made it for him special.
It's an. 88 magnum.

268
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:43,482
It shoots through schools.

269
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:48,582
Vermin, maybe you got
too much sugar in your diet.

270
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,682
We do things differently around here.
Put the gun away.

271
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,982
Maybe I will and maybe I won't.

272
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:58,782
- Stash the rod, Danny.
- You shouldn't grab me, Johnny.

273
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,882
My mother grabbed me once.

274
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,582
Once.

275
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:07,682
- What are you gonna do, Johnny?
- I'll think of something...

276
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:12,382
...something clever,
something unexpected...

277
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,882
...something subtle.

278
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:25,582
- You know, this club is too fargin small.
- Yeah.

279
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:29,982
- How big was the crowd last night?
- Packed. We had to turn them away.

280
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:34,382
That's what I mean.
We've got to expand this fargin place.

281
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,281
Knock down that wall.
Knock down that wall.

282
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,581
And knock down that fargin wall.

283
00:26:44,181 --> 00:26:48,981
Now I知 really angry.
This is fargin war.

284
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:05,381
You must be Tommy.
Come in.

285
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,781
Johnny's expecting you.

286
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,581
Follow me.

287
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:17,381
Hello, Tommy.

288
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:25,381
Tommy, have a seat
you little muskrat.

289
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:32,081
What's this bull fertilizer
about you quitting school?

290
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:37,281
I'm sorry, Johnny. I just haven't got
the tits for it. I mean, heart.

291
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:41,481
Tommy, I want you to pay attention.

292
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:46,181
I don't understand. You're tops
in your class. You made the law review.

293
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:51,981
- Why do you have to get married now?
- Because if I don't get laid, I値l die.

294
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,880
Laid! Is that what
this is about, getting laid?

295
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,780
- I thought it was something serious.
It is serious.

296
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,480
I've tried going to bad girls, but for a
clean-cut kid like me, it's just no dice.

297
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,780
Oh, God! How do you get laid in 1930?

298
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,280
You think this is fun, Tom?

299
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,980
You think this is a picnic, Tommy?

300
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,580
You got a lot to learn, kid.
It's a bad habit.

301
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,280
It's like drinking coffee.
Believe me, if I could quit, I would.

302
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,980
Come on in here, Tom.
I wanna talk to you about something.

303
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,980
I think this is the most important
reason you should wait. Have a seat.

304
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,780
I wanna show you something, Tom,
something I think might open your eyes.

305
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,980
Your testicles and you.

306
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,180
Take a good look.
These are the unlucky ones.

307
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,580
These unfortunate souls
are suffering from ESS...

308
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,680
...Enlarged Scrotum Syndrome.

309
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,279
For these poor devils, it's too late.
But there is hope.

310
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,679
Here, at the Atlanta Genital institute...

311
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:25,779
...teams of doctors are at work around
the clock to cure this dreaded affliction.

312
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,479
Hi, I知 Dr. Zillman, and I壇 like
to talk to you about your testes.

313
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:38,279
The human testicle is like a balloon.
Sometimes, it is empty.

314
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,379
And sometimes... it is full.

315
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,379
And sometimes... it can explode.

316
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,479
Maybe this will help you understand.

317
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:55,579
Just remember that your testicles,
when treated with love and care...

318
00:29:55,979 --> 00:30:00,579
...will give you years
of maintenance-free service.

319
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,879
But if abused...

320
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:09,779
...well, the inevitable conclusion:

321
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,379
So next time, do the smart thing.
Don't let anything come between...

322
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:22,279
...your testicles and you. Thank you.

323
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:32,078
- Where are you going?
- Back to law school.

324
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:45,578
Let's hear it for the band.

325
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:50,378
Johnny, great to see you.
I've got an announcement to make.

326
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:54,178
When I die,
hopefully in my bed...

327
00:30:57,478 --> 00:31:03,478
...I wanna know that the Dundee mob
will continue with the same traditions...

328
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:10,278
...with the same high standards that have
made us the New York Yankees of crime.

329
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:17,978
And for that reason,
I知 naming as my successor...

330
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:21,678
...Johnny Dangerously.

331
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:30,778
Now I want you to give a warm welcome
to a very shy, retiring, little lady...

332
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,378
...who's come to us from a
convent school in Pittsburgh:

333
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:37,278
Lil Sheridan.

334
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:05,477
Yeah!

335
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:04,776
There's Johnny.

336
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,076
He's so cute.

337
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,976
You're holding up traffic.

338
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:23,176
That song you just sang,
I figured that gave me the green light.

339
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:28,675
Let's just say you're off red,
but you're still on amber.

340
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:32,575
I hope that light changes soon
because my motor's running.

341
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:36,475
You better be careful,
you don't wanna overheat.

342
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,275
- I'll tell you one thing...
- What's that?

343
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:42,075
...you sure can banter.

344
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:46,675
So then I decided to leave Pittsburgh
and come here to Chicago.

345
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:49,775
- Lil?
- Yeah?

346
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:54,375
This ain't Chicago.
We're in New York.

347
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:57,175
You're kidding.

348
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:04,275
New York, Chicago.
To a girl on her own, it's all the same.

349
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:12,675
I figured Mom and Dad didn't need
me around, not with 14 mouths to feed.

350
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:17,675
- Your folks had 14 kids?
- No, they ran a kennel.

351
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:22,775
- What about your folks?
- My mom practically raised us by herself.

352
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:29,175
I never knew my father or my uncle.
I kind of knew my grandmother.

353
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:34,075
Didn't know my grandfather.
Never knew any of my cousins.

354
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,775
- Any pets?
- Yeah, we had a dog.

355
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:42,674
He ran away when I was a kid.
I never knew him.

356
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:52,074
Where the hell are we?

357
00:35:56,574 --> 00:36:01,574
- Johnny, I知 falling in a big way.
- You got company, kid.

358
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:06,374
Where we gonna land?
And when we do, will our hearts break?

359
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:11,974
I'm sure there are answers
to all these questions, but first...

360
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,474
Sounds like Johnny's getting laid.

361
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:34,174
Moronie was still on the warpath.

362
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:36,874
Even getting to work was an adventure.

363
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:40,074
- Johnny, be careful.
- Don't worry, doll.

364
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,774
There's not a bullet out there
with my name on it.

365
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:49,174
I couldn't stand it if something
happened to you.

366
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,874
Neither could I.

367
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:14,273
One hippopotamus,
two hippopotamus...

368
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,773
...three hippopotamus.
Go!

369
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:41,473
- Whoa. Wait!
- Get him!

370
00:37:49,373 --> 00:37:50,973
Morning, Johnny.
- Hiya, Pat.

371
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:52,573
How's that precious mother of yours?

372
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:06,973
- You been out there today?
- Pretty rough, huh?

373
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:09,373
Not as bad as yesterday.

374
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:13,773
- You'll feel better if you have a cookie.
- Thanks.

375
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:17,972
- All fixed, Mr. Dundee.
- Thanks, pal.

376
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:22,972
- Who's that guy?
- The plumber. My drain was stuck.

377
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:27,972
Where is all this gangland warfare
getting us anyway?

378
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,572
I want Moronie.

379
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:35,572
And I知 not gonna rest
until I get him.

380
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:38,672
Or until he gets you.

381
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:42,272
Hey! Hey!

382
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:47,772
Oh! Relax, Johnny. Relax.
Come on.

383
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:54,372
A year from now, we're gonna look back
on all this and have one big laugh.

384
00:38:57,472 --> 00:39:00,172
Oh, boy.

385
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,572
I really had to wee wee.

386
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:07,972
That's funny. This bathroom drain
was never stuck before.

387
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:13,172
Mr. Dundee, wait!

388
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:23,272
- Got the number of that other plumber?
Mr. Dundee...

389
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:29,272
Oh, my God! Moronie, you son
of a bitch! What have you done to me?

390
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:32,472
- Calm down.
- Why go on living?

391
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:34,972
Look, don't panic.

392
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:39,671
Calm down? I'm standing here
with my dork in my hand.

393
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:42,071
It's not your dork. Look.

394
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:47,071
- Ah. Thank God. It's just the chain handle.
- Sure.

395
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,771
Freddie, you're still here,
you little bald-headed beauty.

396
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:56,371
I thought I lost you.
Johnny...

397
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:00,071
...this is a sign from above.
You okay, boss?

398
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:04,471
Johnny, I知 retiring before it's too late.

399
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:09,071
You remember this? Take it.
You're the boss now.

400
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:14,171
I don't know. It's a lot of responsibility.
I don't know if I知 ready.

401
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:18,971
- I'm ready for it.
- Forget it, Vermin.

402
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:34,371
I was on top, kid.
Moronie and I worked out a truce.

403
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:38,571
Lil and I were going strong.
And as for Ma...

404
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:43,871
...between the occasional transplant
and bypass, her health was improving.

405
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:49,271
- Yeah, I was on top of the world.
- Well, that was a great story, pops.

406
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:53,970
- So long.
- Wait, I知 just getting to the sad part.

407
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,470
See, now that everything else
in my life was going well...

408
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,270
...I was about to face
the greatest challenge of my life.

409
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,570
- Oh, Tommy. We're so proud of him.
- We sure are, kid.

410
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,470
- I owe it all to you, Johnny.
- Oh, go on.

411
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:23,270
This calls for a picture. The two
Kelly boys. Wait till I get me camera.

412
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,170
Hold this.
Where the hell is that camera?

413
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,370
Tommy, I want you to have
a little something.

414
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,270
- Kimball, Pritchard & Williston?
- Biggest law firm in the city.

415
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,470
I think you'll find them receptive.

416
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,970
Gee, thanks, Johnny,
but I致e already made up my mind.

417
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:55,670
I know you're gonna be proud of me.
I'm joining the district attorney's office.

418
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:02,070
I'm gonna dedicate my life
to fighting crime. Isn't that great?

419
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:07,870
Right. My little brother,
who I put through law school...

420
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,069
...is gonna be fighting crime.
Crime.

421
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:16,269
Mom, it's prohibition.

422
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:19,669
Oh, shut up.
Stop acting like a fag choir boy.

423
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:21,969
Here, another one.

424
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:26,669
To me two darling sons,
one a famous night club owner...

425
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:29,369
...the other a crime fighter.

426
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:32,269
With a father like Killer Kelly...

427
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:36,969
...it's a miracle neither of you turned
out to be a piece-of-shit criminal.

428
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,769
Maybe she was right.
I decided to go legit...

429
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:43,169
...but then I got hit with more
bad news about Mom.

430
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,869
- About your mom, John...
- What is it? How much?

431
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:50,069
- The blocked salivary gland. $7500.
- Really?

432
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,469
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
It'll be good to see her spit again.

433
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:58,569
I went back to crime,
and Tommy went to work for the DA.

434
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:02,369
Fortunately, I had the DA
on our payroll. So I wasn't too worried.

435
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:10,169
Hi. I'm the new assistant DA
I'm joining you in the war against crime.

436
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:14,169
- The boss in?
- In there.

437
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:22,169
Tommy Kelly reporting for work.
- Kelly, welcome to the team.

438
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:26,069
I'm proud to be part of any team
whose adversary is crime.

439
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:29,068
Well said. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

440
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:33,468
That's why we scout the law schools
for young idealists like yourself.

441
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:37,968
But before you begin,
why not ease into the job?

442
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,868
- Take a little vacation.
- A vacation?

443
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:44,768
But what about crime?

444
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:48,468
Don't worry. It'll still be here
when you get back.

445
00:43:48,868 --> 00:43:50,968
But don't you see? That's the trouble.

446
00:43:51,268 --> 00:43:54,568
Crime will always be here
unless something is done about it.

447
00:43:55,068 --> 00:43:56,968
Tommy didn't go on vacation.

448
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,968
He became the city's
most tireless crime fighter.

449
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:06,368
He fought crime in the newspapers.
He attacked it on the radio.

450
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,068
He arrested every criminal in town.

451
00:44:09,368 --> 00:44:13,068
And then, he turned his sights
on my old enemy, Moronie.

452
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:17,468
Roman Troy Moronie
is the man responsible for...

453
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:21,568
...the Mother's Day Massacre,
the Christmas Day Slaughter...

454
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:26,768
...the Lincoln's Birthday Mutilation,
and the Groundhog's Day Beheadings.

455
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:31,068
Before we begin the questions,
my client would like to read a statement.

456
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,468
Go ahead.

457
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:39,668
I would like to direct this to
the distinguished members of the panel.

458
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:45,168
"You lousy corksuckers,
you have violated my fargin rights.

459
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:49,667
This sum in a batching country
was founded...

460
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:55,367
...so that the liberties of common
patriotic citizens like me...

461
00:44:55,667 --> 00:45:00,867
...could not be taken away
by a bunch of fargin iceholes...

462
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:04,167
...like yourselves. "
Thank you very much.

463
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,367
[MUMBLING}

464
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:09,867
What do the names
Benny the Hump, Roland Carpidi...

465
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,167
...and Izzy the Nose mean to you?

466
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:15,067
They don't mean a thing.

467
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:17,667
- Recognize this?
- No.

468
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:21,967
Can you explain how your fingerprints
got on this gun...

469
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:27,067
...which was used to kill everyone
in the building at 110 East 40th Street?

470
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:28,567
Where'd you get that?

471
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:31,867
If a train left New York
at 300 miles per hour...

472
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:34,867
...and accelerated speed
15 miles per hour...

473
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:37,967
...and traveled a distance
of 683 miles...

474
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:42,367
...tell me, sir, what time
would that train reach Chicago?

475
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:46,267
- That's a fargin trick question!
- What time?

476
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:56,267
This weed of crime
that threatens to grow unchecked...

477
00:45:56,667 --> 00:46:02,867
...and choke off this beautiful flower,
which is our free democratic society.

478
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:06,366
I never thought this radio stunt
would catch on.

479
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:11,566
He's impossible to control. The public
sees him as a knight in shining armor.

480
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:15,466
This goes through armor.
Then it goes through the victim...

481
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:19,666
...through the wall, through a tree...
- Relax.

482
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:24,566
- Kelly's got nothing on us.
- Maybe we should wait until he does.

483
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:25,866
Pipe down, Vermin.

484
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:29,066
We knock off Kelly, and the whole city
would be breathing down our necks.

485
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:32,966
If Jocko was in charge,
we'd be making cement loafers for him.

486
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:37,366
Jocko's not in charge, I am.
Got it?

487
00:46:38,266 --> 00:46:41,966
Burr, talk some sense to the kid.
Get him to play ball.

488
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:46,466
Fabulous idea, Johnny. We'll appeal
to the more practical side of the man.

489
00:46:46,866 --> 00:46:51,166
There you go. While you're at it,
buy yourself a second home.

490
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:55,266
- Thanks, Johnny.
- Sure.

491
00:46:57,266 --> 00:46:58,966
This gang's getting soft.

492
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:02,466
By letting Kelly take us apart, we'd be
the laughingstock of the underworld.

493
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:03,766
Yeah.

494
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:07,266
At parties, people ask what I do.
I'm embarrassed. I say I知 a barber.

495
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:12,266
I told somebody I was a male nurse.
I'm ashamed to admit I知 a criminal.

496
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:16,366
- Me too.
- We gotta do something about this.

497
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:19,866
Boy, you fellas really disappoint me.

498
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,165
Take a look around you.
What do you see?

499
00:47:23,565 --> 00:47:28,265
I'll tell you what I see.
I see some guys doing pretty damn good.

500
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:33,065
- Manny, you got a sauna?
- Yeah, I got a sauna.

501
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:34,665
All right.

502
00:47:35,265 --> 00:47:38,565
Ollie, you send your mother
to Norway every summer, don't you?

503
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:40,365
Yeah, Johnny.

504
00:47:40,665 --> 00:47:44,465
Vito, how many hats do you own?

505
00:47:44,765 --> 00:47:48,165
Upwards of around 180.

506
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,665
180 hats. That's a lot of hats.

507
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:55,965
You never told me that.
- Tell me another gang in New York...

508
00:47:56,265 --> 00:47:58,265
...that's got a dental plan.

509
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:03,365
- Do you know why we're so successful?
- Why, Johnny? Tell us.

510
00:48:03,565 --> 00:48:07,465
Because we're diversified.
Diversification.

511
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:11,165
We're exploring new
and exciting areas of crime.

512
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:17,365
We better, because there are Japanese
gangs who'll do it faster and cheaper.

513
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:21,665
Believe me, fellas. Believe me.
There's so much out there...

514
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,865
...you could find something you like.
- I like what I知 doing right now.

515
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:29,965
I enjoy collecting protection money,
putting whores to work, loan sharking.

516
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:34,965
I enjoy planting bombs in people's cars.
These are a few of my favorite things.

517
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:36,765
Sick? Don't ask.

518
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:41,364
You missed, fuckface.

519
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:44,764
All right, Vermin.

520
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:49,464
You're not getting that back
until you've matured.

521
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:51,364
Aren't we touchy today, Johnny?

522
00:48:51,664 --> 00:48:55,464
What's the matter? Something going on
between you and Kelly?

523
00:48:58,464 --> 00:49:04,264
You shouldn't hang me on a hook.
My father hung me on a hook once.

524
00:49:04,664 --> 00:49:07,064
Once.

525
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:12,964
- Come on, boys. I'm buying.
- Now you're talking.

526
00:49:13,264 --> 00:49:17,664
Bye, Danny.
Hang in there, Vermin.

527
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:20,564
There's something fishy with
Johnny and that DA.

528
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:24,164
And I知 gonna find out what it is.

529
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:45,664
Good news, sir.

530
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:48,064
I got enough to put Dangerously
where he belongs.

531
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:51,564
Hold it. We don't even know
such a man exists.

532
00:49:51,764 --> 00:49:55,864
Until now.
Sir, I have got conclusive evidence:

533
00:49:56,164 --> 00:50:00,763
Notarized depositions,
tire prints, blood samples.

534
00:50:01,163 --> 00:50:04,763
I've got eyewitness accounts,
murder weapons, fingerprints...

535
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:08,063
Hold it. Hold it, kid.

536
00:50:08,363 --> 00:50:11,363
It's flimsy. It's not enough.

537
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:16,163
It'll never hold up in a court of law.
Let's put this aside.

538
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:21,363
We're here to socialize, not talk shop.

539
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:29,663
- Had enough milk-fed veal, Tommy?
- Yes, sir. Delicious.

540
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:33,963
Now, can we get back
to this damaging evidence...

541
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:38,563
...on Johnny Dangerously?
- No. Tonight, I wanna talk about...

542
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:44,463
...Tommy Kelly and his future.
You're engaged, aren't you?

543
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:50,063
Yes, sir, I am. To a fine and decent girl.
We plan to be married soon.

544
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:55,063
- As soon as you can afford it, eh?
- We'll manage.

545
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:58,663
Oh, I知 sure you will.

546
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:02,663
But a little help can't hurt.

547
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:06,363
Come here, Tom.
Let me show you something.

548
00:51:14,463 --> 00:51:15,863
It's time to play ball!

549
00:51:16,163 --> 00:51:20,662
Let's see what's in store
for Tommy Kelly if he plays ball!

550
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:25,662
In a hurry, Sally? Pop it into
this time-saving microflame oven.

551
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:28,962
Cook a whole turkey in just under a day!

552
00:51:29,662 --> 00:51:34,462
In a rut, Tom? Get away from it all.
Take a trip around the world...

553
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:40,262
...on us! Twice!
Aboard the S.S. Kelly.

554
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:45,962
And when you return,
move into your own cozy, little love nest.

555
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:51,462
Plenty of extra closet space.
Perfect for entertaining.

556
00:51:51,962 --> 00:51:55,462
And on those chilly winter nights...

557
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:58,962
...Sally can wrap herself up
in this number.

558
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:05,062
And on those hot summer nights,
she can wrap herself up in ice!

559
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:09,962
It's all yours, Tommy,
if you play ball!

560
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:14,062
What do you say?

561
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:18,762
I say I値l see you behind bars.

562
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:35,361
- Yeah, what's up?
Didn't go for it. What should I do?

563
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:39,661
Hold on, I値l ask Johnny.
What do you wanna do about Kelly?

564
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:42,361
Kill him.
He wants you to kill him.

565
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:46,861
I thought he'd feel that way.
So I致e taken care of it.

566
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:16,861
Oh, my God!

567
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:24,761
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

568
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:34,161
- Which one's Tommy?
- You got me.

569
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:40,261
This is him. He's got his father's eyes.
Give me a pen.

570
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:46,361
In case they move him.

571
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:52,560
Hey, Ma? Is he gonna...?
Are they...?

572
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,760
- Will he...?
- Croak? No, don't you worry.

573
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,660
Dr. Kaplan says he's going to be fine.
We Kellys are tough.

574
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,360
- What happened?
- He was coming from the DA's house...

575
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,560
...and his brakes failed.
- His brakes?

576
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,160
I smell a rat.

577
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,160
Get yourself a cab.

578
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,660
I got a little business to attend to.

579
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,760
This is very nice, although unexpected.

580
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,360
Well, I figure you've been on the take
from us for all these years.

581
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:41,060
- It's just my way of saying thanks.
- That's generous of you. You know...

582
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:47,060
...you've always seemed to me
to be more sensitive than the rest.

583
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,560
We should spend some time together.

584
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,460
Say, two weeks in Puerto Rico?

585
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:02,560
It's a thought. By the way,
I picked a little something up for you.

586
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,460
Ah, John.

587
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:13,359
A smoking jacket.

588
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:17,659
Red, my favorite color.

589
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:28,559
Tasty. What is this we're drinking?

590
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:33,759
Read the label. Excuse me for a minute,
I've gotta make a call.

591
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:38,059
"Malt liquor. "

592
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:57,759
Yo!

593
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,259
My God. My God, I can see.
I can see.

594
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:42,858
- Hi, honey. I'm home.
Johnny, you're early.

595
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:45,858
That's all right, isn't it?

596
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:51,058
Johnny, you never missed before.
Is something wrong?

597
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,258
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, Mrs. Capone.

598
00:56:57,558 --> 00:57:00,358
Could I borrow a cup of bullets.
We're a little short.

599
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,458
We're a little low here too,
Mrs. Capone.

600
00:57:02,758 --> 00:57:04,658
Oh, boy. Al's gonna be pissed.

601
00:57:05,058 --> 00:57:07,958
Hey, well, maybe Al's gonna have
to stay home tonight.

602
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:10,358
Gee.

603
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:13,858
- Johnny, you weren't very nice to her.
- Oh, no?

604
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:18,058
When's somebody gonna be nice
to Johnny Dangerously?

605
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:22,358
Look at this.
My own brother is out to get me...

606
00:57:22,658 --> 00:57:25,958
...that psycho Vermin's out to get him,
the gang's getting antsy...

607
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:28,958
...and the Crime Commission's
breathing down my neck.

608
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:35,558
- I hope that's for a small grownup.
- Just wishful thinking.

609
00:57:36,058 --> 00:57:40,958
- Maybe someday, kid.
- When, Johnny?

610
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,258
When are we gonna stop running
and start living?

611
00:57:44,558 --> 00:57:46,357
I don't mean to complain...

612
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:51,257
...but with Sally and Tommy getting
hitched tomorrow, it got me thinking.

613
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:56,757
I got a real, old-fashioned streak in me.
I wanna live a normal life.

614
00:57:57,157 --> 00:58:01,657
Johnny Dangerously can't live
a normal life. It ain't in the cards.

615
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:06,557
People like me,
we're like shooting stars.

616
00:58:06,957 --> 00:58:11,857
We cross the sky, burning hot
for one moment in time, and then we...

617
00:58:12,257 --> 00:58:17,257
...plunge to earth, disappear. Jesus
Christ, I知 starting to upset myself.

618
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:21,057
Oh, but, Johnny,
it doesn't have to be that way.

619
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:27,757
- We can change.
- I don't know, Lil. Dare we dream?

620
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:33,457
Hanging curtains, ironing shirts.

621
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:37,657
- Car pools, PTA.
- Sharing a casserole recipe.

622
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:41,857
Putting up shelf paper.
Oh, Johnny, I love shelf paper.

623
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:47,057
- A little house, white picket fence.
- Kids and dogs playing in the yard.

624
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:51,657
Saying hi to a neighbor named Fred.

625
00:58:52,057 --> 00:58:55,857
Maybe there is a rainbow
for us out there.

626
00:58:56,957 --> 00:58:58,857
Sure, we had dreams.

627
00:58:59,157 --> 00:59:03,257
But when you're in crime,
dreams don't always come true.

628
00:59:08,856 --> 00:59:11,256
Follow them.

629
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:22,356
Park in this spot here.
- It's for the handicapped.

630
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:27,056
I am handicapped. I'm psychotic.

631
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:36,256
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

632
00:59:43,156 --> 00:59:46,756
You're like a daughter to me,
and I wanna share something with you.

633
00:59:47,056 --> 00:59:50,956
- What's that, Mom Kelly?
- I go both ways.

634
01:00:02,556 --> 01:00:05,456
I'm glad we waited,
but I can't wait anymore.

635
01:00:05,756 --> 01:00:10,556
- Okay, where?
- Some place real close.

636
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:34,755
I know Tommy's excited,
but I wonder if he knows about foreplay.

637
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:37,455
- He'll figure it out.
- And when will you follow...

638
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:43,155
...your brother's example, Johnny Kelly?
- Brothers.

639
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:47,455
I knew there was something.

640
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:51,955
Leave your face right there.

641
01:00:52,255 --> 01:00:56,355
How do you like that? Johnny
Dangerously is Tommy Kelly's brother.

642
01:00:57,255 --> 01:01:02,855
- What?
- Dangerously is the DA's brother.

643
01:01:09,055 --> 01:01:12,755
That's it? You little shit!

644
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:21,655
Hallelujah!

645
01:01:26,555 --> 01:01:30,755
There you are. I was wondering
what happened to my kid brother.

646
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:35,855
I'm Johnny Kelly's kid brother,
not Johnny Dangerously's.

647
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:41,254
It was just a matter of time, wasn't it?
All I ask is that you don't tell Ma.

648
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:45,754
She's gonna find out,
because when I put you behind bars...

649
01:01:46,154 --> 01:01:48,954
...your picture's gonna be
on the front page everywhere.

650
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:53,754
- Why, Johnny? Why?
- I don't know, kid.

651
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:57,354
Maybe it's because that big dealer up in
the sky shuffles the cards...

652
01:01:58,054 --> 01:01:59,754
...and we just play what we're dealt.

653
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:04,154
- It's against the law to gamble!
- Jesus Christ.

654
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,654
I took an oath to fight crime,
but I can't go against my own brother.

655
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:13,254
- We have to settle this with our fists.
- Wait a minute, kid.

656
01:02:13,754 --> 01:02:18,054
- You can't fight me. I'm too good.
- I'll take my chances.

657
01:02:18,454 --> 01:02:22,354
Okay. I win, you quit.

658
01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:28,154
- You win, I quit.
- All right.

659
01:02:35,654 --> 01:02:37,154
Johnny, take a dive.

660
01:02:45,654 --> 01:02:48,854
I didn't know you packed such a wallop.

661
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:51,954
All right, Tom, you win.

662
01:02:52,154 --> 01:02:57,054
- I'm going legit.
- Gee, thanks, Johnny!

663
01:02:57,554 --> 01:02:58,653
Hey.

664
01:03:07,353 --> 01:03:09,453
This time, I really was going legit.

665
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:13,953
Now all I had to do
was make the gang understand.

666
01:03:18,653 --> 01:03:22,753
- Who did that?
- Sorry. Did I get you?

667
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:26,953
You ruined the jacket. See?

668
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:31,153
- When do we tell the boys about Johnny?
- As soon as he gets here.

669
01:03:31,553 --> 01:03:35,253
I wanna see the look on his face.

670
01:03:40,853 --> 01:03:44,153
You know, you're not doing
yourself any good.

671
01:03:45,053 --> 01:03:49,753
And for you kids out there who are
thinking about smoking, don't start.

672
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:51,753
And if you've started, stop.

673
01:03:52,053 --> 01:03:55,653
Smoking don't make you look tough,
it makes you look stupid.

674
01:03:55,953 --> 01:03:58,853
If you've gotta put something
in your mouth...

675
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:04,253
...make it a stick of chewing gum.
Sure. That's what Johnny does.

676
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:08,353
Smoking is the worst thing
you can do to your body.

677
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:14,453
- See?
- Hey, Johnny, let's have it.

678
01:04:14,753 --> 01:04:19,852
I'll be late for target practice.
There's an opera letting out.

679
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:25,052
- All right, here it is. I'm going legit.
- Le-what?

680
01:04:25,352 --> 01:04:26,452
- Legit.
- Le-why?

681
01:04:26,752 --> 01:04:30,452
I'll tell you le-why.
Le-cause Johnny Dangerously...

682
01:04:30,752 --> 01:04:33,852
...is really Johnny Kelly,
brother of the DA, Tommy Kelly.

683
01:04:38,152 --> 01:04:43,952
Johnny, is this true? Because if it is,
I don't know how to react.

684
01:04:44,452 --> 01:04:47,852
Yeah, kid, it is true.

685
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:52,652
Tommy Kelly is my brother.
And you know what? I'm proud of him.

686
01:04:53,052 --> 01:04:55,952
Sure you're proud of him.
You've been working with him...

687
01:04:56,252 --> 01:05:00,152
...helping his career. And now that he's
on top, you're running out on us.

688
01:05:00,452 --> 01:05:04,352
You know something, Johnny,
you don't care about crime.

689
01:05:06,752 --> 01:05:08,752
I don't care about crime?

690
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:12,852
I've devoted my entire life to crime
since I was 12 years old.

691
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:17,852
I just think we ought to relax,
that's all, and enjoy what we got.

692
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:22,652
We got plenty. Fellas,
I'm closing this store up for good.

693
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,752
Well, I知 reopening it
under new management.

694
01:05:27,152 --> 01:05:31,152
Oh, no, you're not,
because you don't have the keys.

695
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:34,951
And I do. And I知 turning them
over to the crime commissioner.

696
01:05:35,251 --> 01:05:40,451
And us with them, huh, Johnny?
I knew it, he's turning squealer.

697
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:46,751
You know, I知 bored
with slapping you around.

698
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:49,651
It bores me.

699
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:56,851
Don't worry, fellas,
you guys are in the clear.

700
01:05:57,251 --> 01:05:58,451
It's me they're after.

701
01:06:03,351 --> 01:06:06,651
Dirty Jew! Shanty nigger!
White-trash bastard!

702
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:10,851
Go ahead, walk all over
the little people!

703
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:28,951
Commissioner, there's all the evidence
against me, just like I promised you.

704
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:33,251
Use it.
I'm ready to pay my debt.

705
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:37,351
Hey, how about a thank-you?

706
01:06:37,651 --> 01:06:40,951
Hey, how about me getting out of here?

707
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:44,951
Hey, how about me getting knocked out?

708
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,450
I'd love to stick around and see how
this whole thing turns out...

709
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,850
...but I got a new store to open.

710
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:24,250
Oh, you lousy, Wop, Slovak, Chink, Jap,
Polack, Mick, Krauts, Hebe fags!

711
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:29,050
- Hi, doll. What's your name?
- Mary Margaret Catherine Dineen.

712
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,050
- How'd you like to make some money?
- One at a time or both together?

713
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:37,350
How much for you to clean room 708
and forget you ever saw us?

714
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:41,550
- $17,000.
- All right, 17 grand it is.

715
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:46,250
Do us a big favor and forget
we ever gave you this money, huh?

716
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:50,150
- What money?
- Attagirl.

717
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:57,050
One at a time. One at a time.

718
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,950
- Did you do it?
- You know better than to ask me that.

719
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:06,250
- Why did they find a gun in your hand?
- I've been framed like the Mona Lisa.

720
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:07,950
John!
- Yeah, Duffy?

721
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,649
What were you doing there?

722
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:12,849
- I was there to tell him I was going legit.
- Le-what?

723
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:16,449
Legit, as in legitimate.

724
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:18,849
Hey, Johnny, can we get a picture?

725
01:08:19,149 --> 01:08:22,649
Sure, why not?
It's the first picture ever taken of me...

726
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:25,049
...so make it a good one.

727
01:08:28,649 --> 01:08:30,249
All right. Thank you.

728
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:38,549
Empty your pockets, Johnny.

729
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:48,249
Wait a minute, my cigarette case.
I can't find my cigarette case.

730
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:50,449
- Maybe it's in another suit.
- No.

731
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:53,349
- Did you leave it in your car?
- No.

732
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:56,649
Sometimes when I shave,
I put it on the sink.

733
01:08:56,849 --> 01:09:00,949
No, it's my good luck piece.
I never go anywhere without it.

734
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:04,049
Whoever has my cigarette case
bumped off the commissioner.

735
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:10,049
Excuse me. Johnny, I came as soon
as I heard. I brought your bail money.

736
01:09:11,249 --> 01:09:14,849
I hate to disappoint you, little lady.
Johnny's being held without bail.

737
01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:16,549
By whose orders?

738
01:09:16,849 --> 01:09:19,049
The man who's gonna prosecute you...

739
01:09:19,649 --> 01:09:22,449
...the DA himself.

740
01:09:22,749 --> 01:09:26,649
I suppose this is what
you call going legit?

741
01:09:27,448 --> 01:09:32,148
I was set up. Find my cigarette case
and you'll find the guy who did it.

742
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:35,248
Oh, come on. There are a million
cigarette cases out there.

743
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:37,948
But only one has a
bullet dent and smells like gum.

744
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:40,348
Johnny, don't say anything
until you get a lawyer.

745
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:45,148
- I can handle my own brother.
- Wait a minute. You mean you and he...?

746
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,748
- That's right. Me and him is brothers.
- We were brothers.

747
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:50,548
Brothers!

748
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:54,248
Hey, wait. Hey!

749
01:09:57,648 --> 01:09:58,648
Yo!

750
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,848
- Is that the city edition?
- What?

751
01:10:09,148 --> 01:10:12,348
I said, is that the city edition?

752
01:10:12,648 --> 01:10:18,648
Oh, no. Son of a bitch.
Now I知 deaf.

753
01:10:26,648 --> 01:10:29,648
He's guilty. He's guilty!

754
01:10:35,848 --> 01:10:37,048
Mrs. Kelly.

755
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:40,348
- Get this side. It's my best side.
- Anything to say?

756
01:10:40,648 --> 01:10:45,447
Truthfully, I致e got mixed feelings.
Thrilled for Tommy, sad for Johnny.

757
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:51,147
Sorry, fellas, no comment. This is
the toughest thing I致e ever had to do.

758
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,647
I'm sure you boys can understand.

759
01:10:56,147 --> 01:10:59,647
Nice work in there Mr. DA.
Allow me to introduce myself.

760
01:10:59,947 --> 01:11:03,347
I'm Danny Vermin.
I was associated with your brother.

761
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:06,747
I just want to thank you personally
for sending him to the hot seat.

762
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:14,047
Watch this. Johnny taught me this.

763
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,147
You shouldn't kick me in the balls.

764
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:23,147
My sister kicked me in the balls once.

765
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:27,447
Look, Mom.
- It's Johnny's cigarette case...

766
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:31,047
...the one he was talking about.
- That's mine.

767
01:11:31,347 --> 01:11:36,147
This is my brother's cigarette case.
Johnny didn't do it.

768
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:39,747
I'm gonna get you, Vermin,
if it's the last thing I do.

769
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:45,147
It just might be, Mr. DA.

770
01:11:47,747 --> 01:11:50,147
Johnny ain't guilty.

771
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:54,047
And you sent him to the big house.

772
01:12:02,147 --> 01:12:06,946
- It's an honor to have you on death row.
- The pleasure's all mine.

773
01:12:07,346 --> 01:12:10,146
- Hi, pops. Still here, huh?
You bet.

774
01:12:10,546 --> 01:12:12,946
They finally got you, huh, Brooklyn?

775
01:12:13,146 --> 01:12:17,346
- Louie. How are you? You look great.
You're beautiful, Johnny.

776
01:12:18,446 --> 01:12:23,846
Listen, why don't you go out
and get the boys some quiche.

777
01:12:28,446 --> 01:12:33,846
- Johnny, this is my best guard, Tony.
Hi, Tony. How are you?

778
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:39,546
I think you took a shot at me one time.
Hey, I never forget a gun.

779
01:12:40,046 --> 01:12:43,446
Come on, guys.
We gonna do this or what?

780
01:12:55,646 --> 01:13:01,146
- There's nothing left. Look.
- Finest metal, good holes...

781
01:13:01,646 --> 01:13:04,446
I keep telling you, Howard,
the boy needs a role model.

782
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:07,046
- Rocky, I知 so horny.
- Me too.

783
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:11,046
Vermin's turning the place into a dive.
It's attracting the worst elements.

784
01:13:11,446 --> 01:13:13,046
- That son of a...
And Johnny...

785
01:13:13,146 --> 01:13:15,946
Don't tell me. He put in a salad bar.

786
01:13:16,346 --> 01:13:19,646
No. He's making a play for me.

787
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,445
Wait a minute,
that's just what we want.

788
01:13:24,845 --> 01:13:28,945
I gotta prove he framed me.
Lil, I want you to play up to him.

789
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:32,745
- But, Johnny...
- No "buts. " Keep your eyes and ears open.

790
01:13:33,245 --> 01:13:36,445
First thing you hear, you get it
to me on the grapevine. You got it?

791
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,645
- Got it.
- Attagirl.

792
01:13:39,945 --> 01:13:42,045
Come here.

793
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:52,345
Next time, I値l bring a can opener.
- Good idea.

794
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:57,045
Yo!

795
01:14:06,845 --> 01:14:09,245
I can hear again, and I can see.

796
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:13,345
I can hear again, and I can see!

797
01:14:14,045 --> 01:14:16,145
But who am I?

798
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:25,345
Tommy, please take a break
and eat something.

799
01:14:25,645 --> 01:14:31,245
- I won't eat until I save my brother.
- Keep up the good work, Governor Kelly.

800
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:38,445
- It's governor, is it?
- That's just cheap talk, Mom.

801
01:14:38,745 --> 01:14:43,544
Anybody that would send his own
brother to the hot seat gets my vote.

802
01:14:44,044 --> 01:14:47,644
I've been trying night and day
to prove Johnny's innocence.

803
01:14:47,844 --> 01:14:52,044
If I leave it to you,
Johnny'll fry in the chair like his father.

804
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:57,844
Well, your old mom just might
have something for you tonight.

805
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:12,844
Who is it?
Open up. It's Ma Kelly.

806
01:15:13,944 --> 01:15:16,344
- What do you want? Get out of here.
I gotta talk to you.

807
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:20,244
- We don't have nothing to say.
We've got plenty to say.

808
01:15:20,644 --> 01:15:22,944
- We've got a lot in common.
- Like what?

809
01:15:23,444 --> 01:15:28,644
We both scrub floors, we're swell
lookers and neither of us is Chinese.

810
01:15:29,744 --> 01:15:33,244
You've been doing your homework.
What do you want?

811
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:36,244
How much will it take
for you to tell the truth?

812
01:15:36,544 --> 01:15:37,744
19,500.

813
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:45,344
Boy, am I having a good year.

814
01:15:50,544 --> 01:15:52,344
What's the matter, you got no manners?

815
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:54,144
Send me a bill for the door.

816
01:15:54,344 --> 01:15:56,744
You don't even wait for the body
to get cold, do you?

817
01:15:57,143 --> 01:15:58,443
I go where the action is.

818
01:15:58,643 --> 01:16:01,243
Where's your mom?
Did you send her up the river too?

819
01:16:01,543 --> 01:16:05,543
What do you want, Mr. DA?
And make it quick.

820
01:16:05,943 --> 01:16:09,743
There's a subpoena out for you.
I wanted to serve it myself.

821
01:16:10,143 --> 01:16:13,043
- Subpoena? You ain't got a thing on me.
- Oh, no?

822
01:16:13,343 --> 01:16:16,443
Does the name Mary Margaret Catherine
Dineen strike a familiar chord?

823
01:16:18,543 --> 01:16:20,143
- I'm tone deaf.
- Too bad...

824
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:24,243
...because she's singing like a canary,
and we got her in her own cage.

825
01:16:24,643 --> 01:16:28,043
It's gonna be my pleasure
to send you to the chair.

826
01:16:28,343 --> 01:16:30,943
Come on, boys. Let's go.

827
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:34,843
I don't like the smell in here.

828
01:16:36,443 --> 01:16:40,643
The cleaning dame will spill her guts,
and we can't get to her.

829
01:16:40,843 --> 01:16:43,743
- But we can get to him.
- How, boss?

830
01:16:44,143 --> 01:16:46,943
Don't you listen to the radio?

831
01:16:47,243 --> 01:16:50,243
The governor and DA
Kelly will attend the premiere of the new...

832
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:52,443
...James Cagney movie tomorrow night.

833
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:56,743
Should be clear skies tomorrow night as
the governor and DA Tommy Kelly...

834
01:16:57,043 --> 01:16:59,043
...attend the new James Cagney movie.

835
01:16:59,643 --> 01:17:01,443
Which theater?

836
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:04,043
The Savoy, on 37th.

837
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:08,643
It'll be like shooting ducks in a pond.
Once we knock the DA off...

838
01:17:09,043 --> 01:17:13,643
...that cleaning dame
will clam up just fine.

839
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:18,142
Get this to Johnny on the grapevine:

840
01:17:18,442 --> 01:17:22,342
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's brother
at the Savoy theater tomorrow night.

841
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:25,642
- Got it?
Got it.

842
01:17:31,442 --> 01:17:36,742
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's
brother at the Savoy theater. Pass it on.

843
01:17:37,242 --> 01:17:40,542
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's
brother at the Savoy. Pass it on.

844
01:17:40,842 --> 01:17:43,842
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's
mother at the Savoy. Pass it on.

845
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:47,142
Vermin's mother is gonna kill Johnny
at the Savoy. Pass it on.

846
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:55,042
- Urgent message through the grapevine.
- Yeah? What is it?

847
01:17:55,342 --> 01:18:00,042
Johnny and the Mothers are playing
"Stomping at the Savoy" in Vermont.

848
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:03,142
Vermin's gonna kill my brother
at the Savoy theater tonight.

849
01:18:03,442 --> 01:18:07,642
- I didn't say that.
- No, but I know this grapevine.

850
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:10,842
I gotta get out of here.

851
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:15,942
Guard! Come here!

852
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:21,942
- Yeah?
- Smell that food. I think it's rotten.

853
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:47,741
- What's all this about, Johnny?
- I can't take it anymore! I'm cracking up!

854
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:51,941
Fry me tonight!
The waiting's driving me crazy!

855
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:56,141
- You've still got two more weeks.
- I don't want them!

856
01:18:56,441 --> 01:19:00,241
- Fry me tonight!
- Okay, Johnny. Anything for you.

857
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:05,941
We'll bump Steinberg.
Dangerously will go to the chair tonight.

858
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:16,441
Everyone who is
anyone is here tonight...

859
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:21,941
...including Mr. Crime Fighter himself,
District Attorney Tommy Kelly.

860
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:24,941
They're talking about you as
our next governor.

861
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:30,341
That's nice, but right now all I care
about is proving my brother's innocence.

862
01:19:30,741 --> 01:19:35,341
Johnny, if you're listening,
I love you.

863
01:19:45,941 --> 01:19:50,641
Your turn, Johnny.
The priest you requested has arrived.

864
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,840
Are you ready, my son?
- I'm ready if you are, Father.

865
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,640
So long, Johnny.
Me gust of us. You gust of us.

866
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,940
We missed the bus.
They missed the bus.

867
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,240
Be brave, Johnny.
- When's the next bus?

868
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:21,640
- Always, Nails.
- Summa cum laude. Magna cum laude.

869
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,240
The radio's too laude.

870
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,540
Good luck, Johnny.
Semper fidelis. High fidelis.

871
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,040
- Why didn't I take shop?
- Post meridian. Ante meridian.

872
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,540
Uncle Meridian.
All the little Meridians.

873
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,240
Goodbye, Johnny.
Goodbye, Rock.

874
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:44,140
- The Magna Carta. Master Charge you.
Spit in his eye, Johnny.

875
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:48,840
- You bet, Rabbi.
- Doom procelus. Lots of Vitalis.

876
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,940
Do you have any last words, Johnny?

877
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,340
Well said!

878
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,540
Okay, warden. This is where
we say our goodbyes.

879
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,139
- Come on.
- Johnny?

880
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:14,839
- You weren't gonna kill me, were you?
What? With this?

881
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:29,639
Calling all cars...

882
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:32,639
...Johnny Dangerously has just
escaped from state prison.

883
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:38,239
Hey, ace. Could I have a popcorn,
Milk Duds and a white fish?

884
01:21:55,939 --> 01:22:00,539
- When we gonna give it to him?
- When Cagney gets his in the movie...

885
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:03,739
...a few minutes from now.

886
01:22:04,339 --> 01:22:07,339
Calling all cars, be on the lookout
for Johnny Dangerously...

887
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:10,239
...and two accomplices in a black sedan.

888
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:12,939
I repeat: in a black sedan.

889
01:22:13,339 --> 01:22:16,339
A black sedan, huh?
We'll just see about that.

890
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,139
- I hope this works.
- It always does at home, Johnny.

891
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:24,739
Come on, shelf paper.

892
01:22:28,338 --> 01:22:29,738
Get back and don't bug me.

893
01:22:30,838 --> 01:22:34,138
Get out of the way, boss.

894
01:22:57,538 --> 01:23:01,438
Calling all cars, Johnny Dangerously
now driving a white sedan...

895
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:03,938
...disguised as a trout fisherman.

896
01:23:04,638 --> 01:23:07,938
Johnny, we've been spotted.

897
01:23:09,538 --> 01:23:12,138
Peel the next layer.

898
01:23:15,038 --> 01:23:19,638
- Someday it'll be in Johnny Jr. 's room.
- Sure. Sure.

899
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,538
There he goes. Get him.

900
01:23:21,838 --> 01:23:25,638
Don't let him
get away. He knows too much.

901
01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:31,538
Calling all cars,
be on the look out for...

902
01:23:32,138 --> 01:23:37,338
...Dangerously and accomplices dressed
as nuns, driving a sedan covered with...

903
01:23:37,738 --> 01:23:40,538
...you'll love this, duckies and bunnies.

904
01:23:41,338 --> 01:23:43,738
Calling all cars...

905
01:23:44,038 --> 01:23:46,437
...come to Dooley's Bar and Grill.
I'm buying.

906
01:23:54,337 --> 01:23:57,637
There's something
you don't see every day.

907
01:23:58,837 --> 01:24:02,937
- Everybody stay where you are.
- Alice, keep down.

908
01:24:13,737 --> 01:24:17,837
You might as well come down,
Pembroke. There's no one left but you.

909
01:24:28,737 --> 01:24:30,237
Ah. Shit.

910
01:24:37,337 --> 01:24:41,937
- Johnny, are you okay?
- Sure, kid, I知 fine. How about you?

911
01:24:42,337 --> 01:24:46,637
- You didn't get hit, did you?
- I don't think so.

912
01:24:47,837 --> 01:24:49,137
Boy, does that thing come in handy.

913
01:24:49,937 --> 01:24:52,737
Johnny, you were gonna take
the bullet for me.

914
01:24:53,337 --> 01:24:55,637
Actually, I was counting
on a lot of missing.

915
01:24:55,937 --> 01:24:56,837
Oh, Johnny.

916
01:24:57,137 --> 01:24:58,237
Johnny!

917
01:24:59,937 --> 01:25:02,536
Sorry, Johnny, I have to take you
back to the big house.

918
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:03,836
No!

919
01:25:04,136 --> 01:25:08,236
Mr. Governor, I have a witness to clear
my brother. That's the man you want.

920
01:25:10,136 --> 01:25:14,436
Officer, you can release this man.
I'm granting him a full pardon.

921
01:25:16,936 --> 01:25:19,336
Thanks, gov.

922
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:25,336
You shouldn't shoot me, Johnny.
My grandmother shot me once.

923
01:25:25,736 --> 01:25:28,936
Oh, Johnny, darling,
you must be exhausted.

924
01:25:29,336 --> 01:25:32,436
Breaking out of prison,
racing here in the nick of time...

925
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:36,936
...and saving your brother's life.
I'd say you had a full day.

926
01:25:37,536 --> 01:25:42,536
Funny, Ma, I知 not even very tired.
It must have been that little nap.

927
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:46,536
I'll have some stories
to tell my grandchildren...

928
01:25:46,936 --> 01:25:49,636
...if I have any.

929
01:25:50,636 --> 01:25:54,236
Lil, what do you say we start
a little gang of our own?

930
01:25:54,536 --> 01:25:57,636
- That be okay with you?
- Johnny, I like it.

931
01:25:58,036 --> 01:26:02,036
Kid, I知 gonna make you love it.

932
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:11,136
So that's my story.
I hope you learned something from it.

933
01:26:11,536 --> 01:26:16,536
I sure did. Wow, the electric chair.
Boy, from now on, I知 going straight.

934
01:26:16,936 --> 01:26:19,936
See to it that you do,
or I知 coming after you.

935
01:26:20,335 --> 01:26:22,235
Get out of here.

936
01:26:22,535 --> 01:26:26,935
Wait a minute,
aren't you forgetting something?

937
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:35,235
There you go.

938
01:26:35,535 --> 01:26:38,335
Thanks, Mr. Kelly.

939
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:42,035
Hey, kid, don't forget...

940
01:26:42,435 --> 01:26:45,035
...crime doesn't pay.
Right.

941
01:26:49,735 --> 01:26:50,735
Johnny!

942
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:01,935
Well, it paid a little.
