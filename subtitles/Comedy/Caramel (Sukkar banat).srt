1
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,938
We're done!

2
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,164
I hope I'll make you up
for your wedding.

3
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:03,358
You first!

4
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:29,339
Layale, listen darling.

5
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,263
I have an audition
for a major ad and I'm late.

6
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,878
Please let me in before the redhead.

7
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:40,480
Hello, Soussou.

8
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:42,354
- How are you?
- Fine.

9
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,896
What will it be today?

10
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,780
Lots of volume, like a fluffy cat.

11
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,316
For Sunday.

12
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:50,632
What's on Sunday?

13
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,600
We might bury my sister-in-law.

14
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:57,737
She's dying, she won't last long.

15
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,746
But everything is ready.

16
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,599
I bought two pretty trays...

17
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,967
...for serving coffee and cigarettes.

18
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:08,140
Handmade, at a very good price.

19
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,333
And what a dress I got her!

20
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:15,099
With lace, especially around the collar.

21
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:18,264
Then I took it to the tailor...

22
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,173
...to take it in.

23
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:24,283
Layale, it's for you.

24
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,055
Hello.

25
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:39,828
Okay.

26
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:43,001
Okay, my love.

27
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,602
Soussou, I have to run.

28
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:52,006
Nisrine will look after you. Okay?

29
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:53,470
This is outrageous!

30
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:57,220
Nisrine, look after the shop.
I won't be long.

31
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:01,822
Nisrine.

32
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:25,692
- Lili. Lili, what are you doing?
- Working.

33
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:27,282
What?

34
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,535
What are you doing?

35
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,117
- I'm looking for a piece of paper.
- What paper?

36
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,505
My piece of paper.

37
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,145
Okay, out of the way.

38
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,860
I'll give you another one.

39
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,894
But!

40
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:44,618
Take this one, it's better.

41
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,140
Take it.

42
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,029
- I don't want it.
- It's much nicer.

43
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,404
Look how nice these are.

44
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:54,663
There's plenty.
Forget the other one.

45
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,453
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Hell, where else?

46
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,903
Go now.

47
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,744
Hello, Miss.

48
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,316
Hello.

49
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,999
You'd look prettier with the seatbelt on.

50
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,846
I can't, it suffocates me.

51
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:56,912
Truth be told, you're absolutely right.

52
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:01,362
But public safety requires it.

53
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,771
And if I don't put it on?

54
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,606
I'll have to...

55
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,442
...fine you.

56
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:14,652
As if I'm not fined enough?

57
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,160
Better now?

58
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:18,826
Satisfied?

59
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,194
Marvelous.

60
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,851
- Can I go now?
- Drive safely.

61
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,096
Thank you.

62
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,914
- What's up?
- Oh, my God!

63
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,156
Do you want a snack?

64
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,588
Your shirt is pretty.

65
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:27,233
Did she give it to you?

66
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,932
I won't leave until you fix my hair.

67
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,441
- What is this?
- Volume.

68
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,717
You call this volume?
Do you like it?

69
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,873
Would you go out looking like this?

70
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,564
- What's up?
- Shut them up...

71
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,450
...before I lose my temper
and hurt someone.

72
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,472
We need to close.

73
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:54,928
What's this pin for?

74
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,130
- It's chic.
- You consider this chic?

75
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,116
What's wrong?
Aren't you late for the audition?

76
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:04,453
My hair doesn't resemble
the haircut in the magazine.

77
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:06,405
Look closely at the picture.

78
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,982
Can't you see that the model
is your daughter's age?

79
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,530
Shut up and go inside.
That's enough.

80
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:15,449
What's wrong?
It's looks great.

81
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,328
You think this is great, Layale?

82
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:20,251
My hair has no volume.

83
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:24,217
See how she glued these?
I look old and cockeyed.

84
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:26,439
Like a femme fatale.

85
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,773
Shut your trap!

86
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:32,503
What does she want?
To get rid of me?

87
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,032
No, to be your loyal slave.

88
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,907
Will you shut up?

89
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:37,785
It's too hot in here.

90
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,506
Don't be cheap, turn on the AC.

91
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:43,350
The electrical fuse might blow up.

92
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:46,097
- Shut up.
- Switch off the fridge.

93
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:49,272
Forget this tape, it's useless.

94
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,073
Yeah, you're right.

95
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:54,319
Why do you insist on using it?

96
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:59,322
I'll tie your hair in a way...

97
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:02,006
...that will lift your eyes up
without the tape.

98
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,771
You'll look younger.
Then, we take off this pin.

99
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,496
- Look how gorgeous.
- You think so?

100
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:13,898
You're dazzling.
Like an orchid.

101
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,285
Rima, Johnny Bravo's here.

102
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,241
Thank God we're closed.

103
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,083
Hi, girls.

104
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,769
Hello. Good evening.

105
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:34,526
How are you, Bassam?

106
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:38,426
If they like your hair,
tell them I did it.

107
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:44,376
Good luck with the audition.

108
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,167
Rima, take care of the shop.

109
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:49,881
- Yeah, okay.
- Bye.

110
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,880
Hello, Auntie Rose.
How are you?

111
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,735
- Fine, and you?
- All is well.

112
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,994
How are you, Lili?

113
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:30,578
I've got some aprons that need fixing.

114
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,123
Put them on the table.

115
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:35,935
Stay for coffee.
We'll have a chat.

116
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:39,455
Some other time.
I have a bus to catch.

117
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,223
Bye, Lili.

118
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,662
Lili, she's saying goodbye.

119
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,612
Bye, bye, bye.

120
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,288
Okay, I'm off.

121
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,618
Goodnight. Thank you.

122
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:55,071
Lili, why are you acting this way?

123
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,484
She was talking to you.

124
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,777
You want to scare the customers away?

125
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,144
What are you doing?

126
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,889
Do I look better now?

127
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,610
You'd look better
without the chewing gum.

128
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,582
Welcome, it's a great honor.
Behold our future bride.

129
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,039
It's a great pleasure.

130
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:47,700
You made us happy.
Bless you.

131
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,013
Are you mad?

132
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:54,823
No one can see us.

133
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,472
My God.

134
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,839
You're so handsome.

135
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,785
Let me do the dishes.

136
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,702
You've been up since this morning.

137
00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:15,913
No, let me do it.

138
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,834
I'll do it!

139
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,777
Okay, dear?

140
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:35,014
How is work?
Everything is fine?

141
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,368
Hello.

142
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,392
Is there a problem?

143
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,122
No, everything's great.

144
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:41,339
Please, feel at home.

145
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,546
Thank you.

146
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,321
I cannot speak louder.

147
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,103
My little brother's asleep.

148
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:14,637
I can't go to the living room.
My parents will hear me.

149
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,903
Wait, I'll go to the bathroom.

150
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,815
Can you hear me better?

151
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,291
How many times must we talk about it?

152
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:37,183
I don't feel myself.

153
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,462
What's his problem?

154
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,333
Hello.

155
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,511
Hello.

156
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:15,944
A problem with the car?

157
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:19,626
No. Is there a problem?

158
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:21,473
The lady is your wife?

159
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,456
The lady is my fiancйe.

160
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,814
Your fiancйe.

161
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:31,638
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

162
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,009
We were at a party.
Now we're having a chat.

163
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:37,409
And I'm about to walk her home.

164
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,666
Why don't you chat at her place?

165
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,691
This is an indecent activity.

166
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,195
Two people talking in the street...

167
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,107
...is an indecent activity?

168
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,471
Who can prove she lives here?

169
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,357
Her parents live here.

170
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:55,470
Do you want us to go up
and check it out together?

171
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:57,071
Lower your voice.

172
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:59,645
Quit it, I'm talking.

173
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:01,376
Who can prove she's your fiancйe?

174
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,204
Instead of catching criminals,
you're harassing us?

175
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,458
Exactly!

176
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,895
Help me, God!
He doesn't want to understand.

177
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:11,296
- And now what?
- Your ID.

178
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,553
- Give him the ID.
- No way.

179
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:17,287
Give him the ID.
Don't make a scene.

180
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:18,920
Never!

181
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,351
What a stubborn mule.

182
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:24,202
Comply, or get out of the car.

183
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,569
My God, I'm always misunderstood.

184
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:29,847
Get out of the vehicle, please.

185
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,754
I won't get out! You get in!

186
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:37,779
"The policeman having insisted...

187
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,907
...several times...

188
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:45,465
...that the driver..."

189
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,043
What's his name again, our "Romeo"?

190
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:51,446
Bassam the Bragger.

191
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:55,897
Bragger! Bragger.

192
00:16:56,985 --> 00:17:01,612
"...to get out of the vehicle..."

193
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:05,053
What did he say?

194
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,559
"Even God won't get me out".

195
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,622
God?

196
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:22,166
"Even God won't get me out...

197
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,166
...of the vehicle."

198
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,197
He's one strong guy.

199
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:34,411
You know that we have enough
reasons to send you to jail?

200
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:37,193
That'll make your day.

201
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:47,879
<i>Oh, yes, our beautiful bride</i>

202
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,023
<i>Oh yes, Bassam is at her feet</i>

203
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:55,011
<i>Oh yes, for you we shall sing</i>

204
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:58,835
<i>Walk proud</i>

205
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:01,938
<i>Our lovely and pretty bride</i>

206
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:06,148
<i>If that night, Bassam didn 't mess up</i>

207
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,437
<i>And the police didn 't rub</i>
<i>His face in the mud</i>

208
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,354
<i>And your father didn't threaten him</i>

209
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,039
<i>Your wedding day</i>
<i>Would have never come so soon!</i>

210
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:20,865
<i>Walk proud, my lovely bride</i>

211
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:24,138
<i>The most beautiful rose</i>
<i>In the garden</i>

212
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:32,105
Help! Help me!

213
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:37,668
Please, help me!

214
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,521
- Please let go.
- No way!

215
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:41,696
I want them.

216
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:45,109
Even if I must lie
in the middle of the road.

217
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,838
Go back, please. Let go.

218
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,720
I'll call a policeman.
I've had enough!

219
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:53,885
But I am the police.

220
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,737
He deserves it.

221
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:59,166
- Although he's cute.
- Cute? Him?

222
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,045
You never like anybody?

223
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,312
Enough. Without him,
we'd still be at the police station.

224
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:06,371
Even God wouldn't
get him out of the car.

225
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,768
These are parking tickets.
Why do you want them?

226
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:12,664
They are from my fiancй.

227
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:14,092
Your fiancй?

228
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,052
Come here.

229
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:19,413
My God, your grip is as powerful
as a crab's claw!

230
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:21,638
What's the matter, my dear Lili?

231
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,865
He's torturing me.

232
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,889
- What's going on?
- She's collecting tickets.

233
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,951
You don't want that?
That's better, isn't it?

234
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:31,941
- I don't want it.
- Take a flower.

235
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,641
I don't want it!

236
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:35,487
What is she doing?

237
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,621
She is stealing the tickets!

238
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,685
Thank you for what you did last night.

239
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,525
It's nothing.

240
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,439
If you hadn't been there...

241
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:49,335
You know, I didn't do much.

242
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:54,383
You could drop by our salon sometime.

243
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,683
- We'll give you special treatment.
- One day, I will.

244
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,564
Nisrine, come here!

245
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:02,487
All the girls will be at your service.

246
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,615
Goodbye. We'll be expecting you.

247
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:20,089
You think you're stronger
than the policeman?

248
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,527
Go inside now.

249
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:23,990
I won't.

250
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,238
Stop. I'm working.

251
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,676
Oh, really! You're working?

252
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,441
You do nothing but follow me.

253
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,099
Hello, ladies.

254
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,567
Hello. Welcome.

255
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:37,215
Don't talk to her!
Come, let me give you some love.

256
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:40,345
Go inside.

257
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:41,803
Ma'am, could you, please...

258
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,823
Go in, so I can understand.

259
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:47,929
How can you understand him?
You can't even understand me.

260
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:51,405
- He's American.
- Shut up. Let me find out what he wants.

261
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,327
He wants me to run away with him.

262
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:58,257
Go inside, you're embarrassing me.
I want to know what he wants.

263
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,560
Go play with the rubbish
you've been collecting.

264
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:04,830
Don't come out again.

265
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:10,406
There. That's the vest.

266
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:11,651
The jacket.

267
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:15,274
It's too big, it needs fixing.

268
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,495
- Oh, you want to fix it?
- Yes.

269
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:20,350
The trousers need shortening.

270
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,601
That's fine. Go change.

271
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,490
Alright. Go in and try it on.

272
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:28,777
- Try.
- Alright.

273
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:31,029
Thank you.

274
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,063
<i>My darling likes to go for a stroll</i>

275
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:14,772
<i>In the evening, he says</i>
<i>Let's go</i>

276
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,407
<i>If I say no, I'm in trouble</i>

277
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,493
<i>Welcome, my prince</i>

278
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,488
Lili, what are you doing?

279
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:27,680
You keep on sewing.

280
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:31,019
Sorry.

281
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,448
Good morning, sir.
How are you?

282
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,735
Where have you been, my love?

283
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,327
Hello, Auntie Rose.

284
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:51,994
Here are the aprons.

285
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,986
Come in, don't stay by the door.

286
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:58,121
No, I can't.
I left Lili by herself.

287
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,279
Don't worry about Lili.

288
00:23:00,454 --> 00:23:02,921
Come in for a hairdo.
We're not busy.

289
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:06,184
- No, no.
- Come on in.

290
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,039
I must go, she's alone.

291
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,264
Your hair needs a good brushing.

292
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,810
Come on in, we're having coffee.

293
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:16,589
Come in, we need
to find you a husband.

294
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:18,573
You're a bit late.

295
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,353
You're still beautiful, come in.

296
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:25,014
No, Lili's all by herself. I must go.

297
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:42,680
Hello.

298
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,769
Sorry, I came without an appointment.
Can I get my hair done?

299
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:08,581
- Something's bothering you?
- Not at all.

300
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,578
I was just walking by.
I decided to come in.

301
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,156
I had nothing to do.

302
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,152
I'm glad that you came.

303
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:16,954
Go on, run.

304
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,384
Handsome young man.
Don't forget!

305
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:31,965
Pick up the ones under the car.

306
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:36,589
And you, sweetheart.
Pick up the two papers over there.

307
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,680
Put them in the basket.

308
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,750
God bless you and keep you safe.

309
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:56,763
Yes, put them in there.

310
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:01,363
I want to see what he wrote to me.

311
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:02,538
What?

312
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:06,095
He loves me very much.
He wrote me all these letters.

313
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,936
- Thank you, dear.
- Okay, bye.

314
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:12,838
Don't be long!

315
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,101
Hello, my love.

316
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:52,857
Hello.

317
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:55,393
Hello, sunshine.

318
00:28:55,574 --> 00:28:58,314
You forgot your wallet.

319
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,380
I was expecting your call.

320
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:03,843
What?

321
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:07,046
I swear, I've been waiting for an hour.

322
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:08,724
Ask Joseph.

323
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:12,688
Okay, stop fooling around.

324
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:14,289
When can you pick it up?

325
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,924
Now I'm busy.
I'm having my coffee.

326
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:23,854
And Joseph is foreseeing my future.

327
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,486
He sees a chair and a beautiful girl.

328
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:33,145
She's at the window.
She's looking at me without seeing me.

329
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:40,869
I swear.

330
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:44,238
There's even a fly on my forehead.

331
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:48,377
She parks in forbidden areas...

332
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:52,240
...to tease the policeman
who's admiring her...

333
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,952
...instead of fining her.

334
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,087
You find it funny!

335
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:07,728
Okay, goodbye.

336
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:21,652
Anything else?

337
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,864
Can you sign here, please?

338
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:29,591
- Where?
- Here, please.

339
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:34,003
That's it?

340
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:37,974
Here also. New regulations.

341
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,411
- Anything else?
- Thank you.

342
00:31:40,557 --> 00:31:42,573
Let's go.

343
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:47,722
- Can I drop you off somewhere?
- What?

344
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:51,574
- Drop you off?
- No, thanks. Don't bother.

345
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,457
Tarek, answer.

346
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:28,351
Tarek, answer!

347
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:32,774
Hurry up, Lйa.

348
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,016
Yes, Dad.

349
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,382
Mom?

350
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,302
She's not here.

351
00:32:42,451 --> 00:32:43,482
I don't know.

352
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,779
Smoking a joint next door.

353
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,527
Stupid! Damn you!

354
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,532
What's the matter? I'm busy.

355
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:02,663
I'm busy in the kitchen.
What do you want?

356
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:04,682
What?

357
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,185
Why promise the kids...

358
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:09,924
...and then change your mind?

359
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:12,743
Good for you.
Okay, leave me alone.

360
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:14,696
Okay, goodbye.

361
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:17,130
What an idiot!

362
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:19,744
And you two, out of my sight!

363
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:22,140
Your father is busy.

364
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,957
He's taking his girlfriend to the beach.

365
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:36,023
Hello.

366
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:40,926
I want to have my hair done.

367
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,842
Of course, come in.

368
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:48,927
- Hello.
- Good morning. Welcome.

369
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:50,372
Start the generator,
I need to use the blow dryer.

370
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:02,138
Sorry it took me so long.

371
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:04,703
It's okay.

372
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,349
Mr. Charles!

373
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,352
Mr. Charles, tell her to let me out.

374
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,150
Why are you so stubborn?

375
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,377
Stubborn as a mule!

376
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,026
You old bag!

377
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,804
In your dreams, I'll let you out!

378
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:29,544
I'm going to kill her.

379
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:37,417
There are people
expecting me for dinner.

380
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,290
Expecting you?

381
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,583
In Hell, yes.

382
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:43,845
You wait and see.

383
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,813
The plane is about to take off.
It's getting dark.

384
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:50,072
She wants to travel now.

385
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:52,583
I'll send you up to Heaven, alright.

386
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,299
I'm going to tell the neighbors.

387
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:01,283
They'll eat you alive.

388
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,940
Rose!

389
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:09,834
Damn whoever gave you that name.

390
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:14,330
Excuse me.

391
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,565
Wait till I get my hands on you.

392
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,254
If you drive the customers away,
how will we survive? Go upstairs!

393
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:25,001
- The plane is taking off.
- What plane? Where to?

394
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,540
I'm expected for dinner.

395
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:29,803
Yes, everybody's expecting you.

396
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:33,952
If you drive them away,
how will we live?

397
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:45,013
I'm sorry, sir.

398
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,805
Sorry.

399
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,168
Are the trousers okay?

400
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:02,411
I'd like them a little shorter, please.

401
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:05,436
- Shorter?
- Yes. I like it.

402
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:10,030
- Shorter? Like this?
- Yes.

403
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:13,020
Nice, isn't it?

404
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:19,595
Just what I needed.
Another crazy fool.

405
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,071
Walid.

406
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,836
Can you call me from the land line?

407
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:40,012
I'm too tired.

408
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:42,276
I need to check if my mobile is working.

409
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,485
Do as your sister says.

410
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,112
Okay, it's working.

411
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:09,072
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

412
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:27,927
Rabih, it's Layale.

413
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,834
Rabih. Can you hear me?

414
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:07,097
Layale. Layale.

415
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,278
Yes?

416
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,684
The fan's batteries are dead.

417
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,942
Do you have any?

418
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:24,048
Hello! Come in.

419
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,585
Look in the cup, there's a white horse!

420
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:32,355
Do you know what it means?

421
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,060
You'll be married soon.

422
00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:37,233
Are you hiding secrets from us?

423
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,491
Hiding secrets from your mother?

424
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,821
You believe this nonsense, Mom?

425
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,665
Yes, of course!

426
00:39:46,423 --> 00:39:48,748
Make a wish now.

427
00:39:54,077 --> 00:39:57,446
There's a husband, look at the ring!

428
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,772
Look how it sparkles.

429
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:03,497
That's good.
She's going to get married.

430
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:05,448
That's for sure,
you're going to be happy.

431
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:07,740
You believe this rubbish?

432
00:40:08,585 --> 00:40:10,839
Things she's told me have come true...

433
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:13,073
We'll eat cakes.

434
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:15,609
We'll rejoice.

435
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:46,135
Hi, my name's Jamale Tarabay.
I have two children.

436
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,496
Turn the board around.

437
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:50,898
I can't read it.

438
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:54,699
My name's Jamale Tarabay...

439
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,155
The light's too strong.

440
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,376
Nothing I can do about it.

441
00:41:58,528 --> 00:42:00,604
Look into the camera.

442
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,412
I have two children.
I have many hobbies.

443
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,014
I was an actress.

444
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:10,002
- Really! What kind of roles?
- Soap operas.

445
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:11,534
You've never seen me?

446
00:42:11,678 --> 00:42:12,923
Not really.

447
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,573
Series and ads too.

448
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:17,659
Such as?

449
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:21,200
Products, detergents, lots of things.

450
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,541
Okay. Now lose the board.

451
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:29,343
Higher.

452
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:32,339
Very good. Now the other way.

453
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,224
- How?
- The other way.

454
00:42:35,406 --> 00:42:37,209
Lower your arms.

455
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:41,104
Tell me about yourself. Right side.

456
00:42:41,252 --> 00:42:43,399
No. Right, darling.

457
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:45,979
Okay, tell me about yourself.

458
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,616
I have lots of hobbies.

459
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,913
I like music, painting...

460
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:53,138
Very good.

461
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,271
Other side now.

462
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,813
Other side, please.

463
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:02,713
Okay. Go on.

464
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:04,517
Sideways?

465
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,341
Can you walk now?

466
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,509
- That way?
- Please.

467
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:32,043
Are you a group?

468
00:43:32,187 --> 00:43:33,717
No, just two people.

469
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:36,976
- Two girls?
- No. My husband and me.

470
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:40,116
Ah, you're married.

471
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:44,076
Two people.
A double bed, I guess?

472
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,726
- When for?
- Saturday.

473
00:43:47,912 --> 00:43:50,901
Saturday, just a minute.

474
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:04,462
Can I have your name?

475
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:08,087
Rosette Baddour.

476
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,583
Rosette Baddour?

477
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:12,882
Pretty name, Baddour.

478
00:44:13,032 --> 00:44:16,780
Are you from Beit-Mйry?

479
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,731
I have friends from the Baddour family.

480
00:44:18,877 --> 00:44:20,466
From Beit-Mйry, yes.

481
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,048
Mr. Samir, the owner of the supermarket.

482
00:44:23,191 --> 00:44:26,311
Do you know him?

483
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,336
He's a relative.

484
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,370
By the way, were you living in Canada...

485
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:34,247
No.

486
00:44:34,394 --> 00:44:35,983
I'm sorry.

487
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:39,989
I need your ID card, please.

488
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:43,747
Or any other ID proving that...

489
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:45,380
...you're married.

490
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:49,134
These are the regulations.

491
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:51,022
Just a second...

492
00:44:51,164 --> 00:44:53,417
Take your time.

493
00:45:03,897 --> 00:45:05,700
It's hot. Can we open the window?

494
00:45:05,846 --> 00:45:09,108
No, darling. We can't. Sorry.

495
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:10,785
Let's continue.

496
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:13,950
Now face the wall.

497
00:45:16,353 --> 00:45:18,535
Look straight in front of you.

498
00:45:18,788 --> 00:45:21,778
Sideways.

499
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:25,109
Now look at the wall...

500
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:28,177
...as if speaking to a friend.

501
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,235
- Recite the script.
- Like this, or towards you?

502
00:45:31,383 --> 00:45:34,088
Your body still, your face towards me.

503
00:45:34,236 --> 00:45:37,427
My body still and my face towards you?

504
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:39,652
Yesterday, I met my friend.

505
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:44,385
She told me, "Your face is glowing.
What's your secret?"

506
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,610
Sorry to interrupt...

507
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:50,134
...but there's something
stuck on your eyebrows.

508
00:45:52,258 --> 00:45:55,449
I told her, " I am using
the new soap Eve."

509
00:45:55,946 --> 00:45:58,164
It has a freshening effect.

510
00:45:58,312 --> 00:46:00,910
Every evening,
I wash my face with it.

511
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:08,878
Smile.

512
00:46:09,028 --> 00:46:11,804
You should be happy
about your fresh complexion.

513
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,381
My friend congratulated
me on my complexion.

514
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:19,111
She told me, "What do you do
to have such a radiant complexion?"

515
00:46:19,256 --> 00:46:22,245
"I use a new soap. Eve."

516
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,713
It's very good in the evening.

517
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:26,934
It is very fresh.

518
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:30,902
- Come on, go on.
- I can't.

519
00:46:43,855 --> 00:46:46,108
- You'll be with whom?
- Sorry?

520
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:49,031
Who you're sharing the room with?

521
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:50,945
With my husband.

522
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:53,210
Can I have your name?

523
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,989
Liliane Chakkour.

524
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:07,473
I need an ID card, please.

525
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:25,984
Hello. Good morning, Pasha.

526
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:28,558
I'm fine, thank you.

527
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,088
At your service.

528
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:35,791
It's okay. We'll be there in five minutes.

529
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,989
God be with you.

530
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,493
Good morning.

531
00:47:41,644 --> 00:47:44,419
A morning full of roses and jasmine!

532
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:25,540
Any cake left?

533
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,449
My God! What's this place?

534
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:33,056
What?

535
00:52:33,337 --> 00:52:34,761
Oh, my God!

536
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,800
- Why are you so gloomy?
- Look who's talking!

537
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:47,525
What have you done to your face?

538
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:50,304
Just a bit of touching up.

539
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:52,293
Makeup.

540
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:59,703
Since this morning...

541
00:52:59,848 --> 00:53:01,960
...like an idiot...

542
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:05,406
...I've been cleaning
every inch of the room.

543
00:53:05,554 --> 00:53:07,736
I almost bleached the carpet.

544
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:12,016
I even allowed myself to be taken...

545
00:53:12,165 --> 00:53:13,968
...for a hooker.

546
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:16,860
And he doesn't even call.

547
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:22,524
He just sent a message:
"Can't get away from my wife."

548
00:53:23,506 --> 00:53:27,326
What kills me is how stupid I am.

549
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:31,435
I spend my life waiting for a horn.

550
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:32,610
A car horn!

551
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:36,236
- What horn?
- Forget it.

552
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:39,748
Lucky he didn't show up,
the cake is terrible.

553
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,005
Let me taste.

554
00:53:47,096 --> 00:53:49,148
How many eggs did you put in?

555
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,852
Ten, as you said.

556
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,731
Ten? Are you out of your mind?

557
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:56,345
Disgusting.

558
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,730
I can't even look into my parents' eyes.

559
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:04,728
I'm so ashamed.

560
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:09,081
In the evening they ask:
"Where were you?"

561
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:10,955
I say, "At the salon."

562
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:15,135
"When are you getting married?"
What do you want me to tell them?

563
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:23,486
And I'm still lying to myself...

564
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:27,208
...thinking that he's going to leave her.

565
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:31,344
What gets to me, is not knowing...

566
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,681
...who is this woman
that he can't leave?

567
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,855
I want to know who she is.

568
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:40,047
What she's like.

569
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:42,442
How she walks.

570
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:44,876
How she smells.

571
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:50,271
Do you think you are
the only one living a lie?

572
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:54,479
Nisrine?

573
00:54:55,148 --> 00:54:56,880
What's the matter?

574
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,209
Honey, what's wrong?

575
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:02,584
What's wrong? What's wrong?

576
00:55:02,872 --> 00:55:04,188
What is it?

577
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,922
I swear, I'm fine.

578
00:55:06,072 --> 00:55:08,504
We should be talking
about your wedding.

579
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:10,556
What's the matter?

580
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:15,246
My prince charming won't be the first.

581
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,894
What do you mean?

582
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:20,675
Bassam won't be my first man.

583
00:55:21,382 --> 00:55:24,572
- He doesn't know?
- No, he doesn't.

584
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:29,798
Don't fuss, we'll kill two morning doves.

585
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,016
What are you talking about?

586
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:35,392
I've heard that if a girl has sinned...

587
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:39,051
...a little dove's blood
on the bridal sheet will do.

588
00:55:39,194 --> 00:55:40,653
Why not sparrows?

589
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,677
Maybe it looks more real.

590
00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:45,482
How do you trick the husband?

591
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,442
Well, the bride works it out.

592
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:50,047
It's like a challenge.

593
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:52,062
You and your crazy ideas.

594
00:55:52,207 --> 00:55:53,796
What do you suggest?

595
00:55:53,946 --> 00:55:55,714
What happened?

596
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:12,513
Let's go, girls.
Back to your rooms, break's over.

597
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:15,237
Stop lazing around.

598
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:18,156
Souad Abdel-Sater?

599
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:20,590
Why not Abdel-Satan!

600
00:56:20,736 --> 00:56:22,953
I don't understand.

601
00:56:23,102 --> 00:56:24,560
Souad Abdel-Sater?

602
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:28,142
Where did you get that name?

603
00:56:28,738 --> 00:56:30,612
In the obituaries?

604
00:56:30,756 --> 00:56:33,389
Couldn't you pick a Christian name?

605
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:36,529
Rita or Theresa, for example?

606
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,615
While we're at it...

607
00:56:38,758 --> 00:56:40,834
...let's choose a French name.

608
00:56:40,985 --> 00:56:42,930
Marie, Julie.

609
00:56:43,073 --> 00:56:45,990
I can't be a "Marie" just once?

610
00:56:46,134 --> 00:56:47,450
Yes, it would suit you.

611
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:51,272
What, you think you're going
to the Moulin Rouge or the Lido?

612
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:53,640
It's just a clinic.

613
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:55,865
Stop fussing.

614
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:59,274
You can hardly say "hi" in French.

615
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:01,500
You flunked it in high school.

616
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,180
I don't have to speak.

617
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:05,124
So you'd be a dumb French girl?

618
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,772
What do you know?
I can speak French.

619
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:11,519
My name is Julie. I'm from Paris.

620
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:13,688
I've come for a "hot" couture.

621
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:15,488
Shut up, he'll hear us.

622
00:57:15,637 --> 00:57:18,069
Okay, I'll shut up.

623
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:21,342
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning.

624
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,558
I'm going to the museum, please.

625
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:25,654
- Where?
- Museum.

626
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:27,457
Get in.

627
00:57:27,954 --> 00:57:30,030
Good morning.

628
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,256
But we're not going to the museum.

629
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,317
We'll take a shortcut.

630
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:37,200
Don't worry. I know the way.

631
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:41,277
Julie what?

632
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:44,822
- Pompidou.
- Pompidou?

633
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:53,592
For Dr. Stambouli?

634
00:57:54,882 --> 00:57:57,029
Fourth...

635
00:57:57,526 --> 00:58:00,752
...floor, lift is on your left.

636
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,690
Miss Pompidou...

637
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:08,652
...signature, please.

638
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,287
Two Stambouli stitches...

639
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,503
...and you'll be good as new.

640
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:25,070
Like a teenager.

641
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:37,248
If Mr. Pompidou calls...

642
00:58:37,398 --> 00:58:39,474
...tell him I am at the tailor's.

643
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:08,389
What are you listening to?

644
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:15,212
Your hair is beautiful.

645
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:17,686
Thank you.

646
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,329
I like yours too, but...

647
00:59:21,236 --> 00:59:25,055
...short hair would suit you,
you have a beautiful face.

648
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,187
I wish.

649
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,729
We could do it now.

650
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,115
Cut my hair?

651
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:37,688
They'd go mad at home.

652
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:47,952
Rima.

653
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,242
You've used up the hot water.

654
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:52,467
What now?

655
01:00:04,307 --> 01:00:05,410
Oh, sorry.

656
01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:09,829
I've come for...

657
01:00:10,014 --> 01:00:12,860
...the special...
The waxing offer.

658
01:00:13,005 --> 01:00:14,559
I didn't quite understand.

659
01:00:16,345 --> 01:00:20,236
Someone from your salon called me.
Isn't this salon Si Belle?

660
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:23,193
Yes, I called you.

661
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:27,157
- Your name?
- Christine Khoury.

662
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,557
My appointment is for tomorrow.

663
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:32,208
But today is better.
Is it a problem?

664
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,675
No, no problem.
What will it be?

665
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:35,851
Waxing.

666
01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:38,743
Layale.

667
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:42,159
The lady's here for the special.

668
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:45,222
The waxing offer.

669
01:00:45,362 --> 01:00:47,414
Hello.

670
01:00:48,006 --> 01:00:50,367
This way, please.

671
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:49,095
Sorry. It might be a bit hot.

672
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,343
Don't worry.
Maybe I'm oversensitive today.

673
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:55,455
Don't worry.

674
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:16,441
Your hair is so beautiful.

675
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:19,365
Thank you.

676
01:02:19,508 --> 01:02:23,707
I've always wanted to dye my hair black.

677
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,112
Why don't you?

678
01:02:26,814 --> 01:02:28,546
I'm thinking about it.

679
01:02:28,693 --> 01:02:32,513
But my husband likes me the way I am.
I don't want to upset him.

680
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,135
He doesn't like change.

681
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:44,626
Wait a second.

682
01:02:46,855 --> 01:02:49,037
Sorry.

683
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,686
It's okay.

684
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,756
What, should I have asked
for your permission before inviting her?

685
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:58,641
Stop being obsessed with her.

686
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:02,440
Did you see her ass?

687
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:05,216
Enormous. Relax.

688
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,211
As for you, I'll cut your
tongue off if you mock me.

689
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:10,300
- I'm scared.
- Are you talking to me?

690
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:12,590
- Have you seen your ass?
- Shut up!

691
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:15,480
Thanks, you're so kind.

692
01:03:15,662 --> 01:03:17,951
Aren't you tired?

693
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:21,953
<i>Holy Mary, full of grace.</i>
<i>The Lord is with you.</i>

694
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:23,687
<i>You are blessed amongst women.</i>

695
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:27,349
<i>And Jesus,</i>
<i>Blessed be the fruit of your womb.</i>

696
01:03:28,048 --> 01:03:31,346
<i>- Hail Mary...</i>
<i>- Holy Mary.</i>

697
01:03:31,527 --> 01:03:35,204
<i>Mother of God,</i>
<i>Pray for us poor sinners.</i>

698
01:03:35,389 --> 01:03:37,227
<i>Now and at the time of our death.</i>

699
01:03:37,372 --> 01:03:39,626
You're killing me.

700
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:44,050
- Once more.
- No, that's enough.

701
01:03:44,748 --> 01:03:47,180
Our Lady won't forgive you.

702
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:51,001
Not at all.
Why won't she forgive me?

703
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:54,554
One more Hail Mary?

704
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,846
Two, if you want.

705
01:03:56,995 --> 01:03:58,525
<i>Hail Mary...</i>

706
01:03:58,664 --> 01:04:02,484
Father Constantin, pray for me!

707
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:06,759
I'll call the vicar,
I'll ask him to pray.

708
01:04:41,876 --> 01:04:44,165
God give you health.

709
01:04:52,244 --> 01:04:54,261
Hello!

710
01:04:56,419 --> 01:04:58,116
Hello, young man.

711
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:02,776
Welcome.
We thought you'd never come.

712
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,276
What a pleasure. Come in.

713
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:06,888
Thank you. Sorry...

714
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:09,568
Girls, let the gentleman through.

715
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:11,239
- Good morning.
- Come in, come in.

716
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,571
Samia, can you give your place
to Mr. Handsome?

717
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:26,612
Of course.
Please, son. Sit down.

718
01:05:26,758 --> 01:05:30,127
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

719
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:38,166
Layale. We need you here.

720
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,210
What should we do to this lovely face?

721
01:05:57,966 --> 01:05:59,460
The sideburns?

722
01:06:00,296 --> 01:06:01,791
It won't hurt.

723
01:06:03,985 --> 01:06:05,300
The moustache?

724
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:06,833
I'd say...

725
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:11,148
...a few hairs here and there.

726
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,235
Quickly, with the tweezers.

727
01:06:13,413 --> 01:06:16,367
For the moustache, we'll see.

728
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:18,311
As for the eyebrows...

729
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:20,570
Absolutely.

730
01:06:23,886 --> 01:06:25,997
Heat the sugar, please.

731
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:34,739
Welcome.

732
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:38,278
Thank you.

733
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,973
<i>Under your protection</i>

734
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:19,002
<i>We shelter, Holy Mary.</i>

735
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:08,900
Dear Rose,
Meet me for coffee at Doughan's...

736
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:12,161
...Tuesday at 5? Charles

737
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:28,550
Hello, Auntie Rose.

738
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,573
What a surprise.

739
01:09:30,752 --> 01:09:33,492
What brings you here?

740
01:09:34,405 --> 01:09:38,083
- What's up?
- She's got news.

741
01:09:38,232 --> 01:09:40,521
I've come to fix my hair.

742
01:09:40,668 --> 01:09:42,257
No!

743
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:45,040
I don't believe it.

744
01:09:45,226 --> 01:09:48,974
Rose finally came to fix her hair!

745
01:09:49,157 --> 01:09:51,445
Let's pick the best color.

746
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,912
It's an honor.

747
01:09:54,097 --> 01:09:56,350
The best hairdo.
Where's the catalogue?

748
01:10:10,032 --> 01:10:12,949
I told you, I have an audition.

749
01:10:14,972 --> 01:10:19,076
I put on some makeup.
Had my hair done.

750
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:22,098
And my nails too.

751
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:26,162
Of course I'm beautiful,
darling. I'm gorgeous.

752
01:10:30,003 --> 01:10:32,849
I'm waiting for my turn.

753
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:36,089
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you.

754
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,795
Was I a bit shy?

755
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:41,054
Not at all. You were very good.

756
01:10:41,205 --> 01:10:44,681
We'll call you soon. Okay? Bye-bye.

757
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,042
- Hello, Jamale.
- Hi.

758
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,478
How are you?
Where have you been?

759
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:52,539
- Me?
- Show me.

760
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:55,948
Your new color is lovely.

761
01:10:56,096 --> 01:10:57,686
Hello, Rana. What's the matter?

762
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:02,349
Jamale!

763
01:11:02,498 --> 01:11:05,759
You've got blood on your skirt.

764
01:11:05,907 --> 01:11:07,781
I can't believe it!

765
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:10,357
Girls, have you got a maxi pad?

766
01:11:23,024 --> 01:11:24,340
Come in, come in.

767
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:27,333
Just a second, I'm coming.

768
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,390
Is everything ready for the wedding?

769
01:11:58,234 --> 01:11:59,586
Everything's fine.

770
01:12:01,505 --> 01:12:04,422
I've still got a small matter to sort out.

771
01:12:04,566 --> 01:12:08,493
But it will be alright, God willing.

772
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:02,414
Sarah, come here, darling.

773
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:40,382
Would you like something to drink?

774
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:43,226
No, thank you.

775
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:45,840
Red polish, like yours?

776
01:13:46,018 --> 01:13:48,000
It's very nice on you.

777
01:13:48,176 --> 01:13:51,296
That depends on what you're wearing.

778
01:13:51,447 --> 01:13:52,976
A red dress.

779
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:56,799
It's a surprise for my husband.
It's our wedding anniversary.

780
01:13:59,379 --> 01:14:02,984
I've been running since this morning
to get everything ready...

781
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:06,232
...without him even noticing.
I baked a cake.

782
01:14:06,302 --> 01:14:08,698
I hope it'll be good. Normally...

783
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,554
...my cakes are tasty.

784
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,311
Damn it! I forgot the balloons.

785
01:14:17,888 --> 01:14:21,778
I'll ask my sister to buy some.

786
01:14:25,508 --> 01:14:28,248
So family and friends will be there.

787
01:14:28,395 --> 01:14:30,340
All the people he loves.

788
01:14:30,691 --> 01:14:33,811
He should be happy, right?

789
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:37,885
Something's bothering you?

790
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:40,464
No.

791
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,833
Are you okay?
Are you feeling alright?

792
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:49,015
Here is your tip.

793
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,906
You deserve more.

794
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:53,084
No, thank you.

795
01:14:53,237 --> 01:14:55,739
I insist.

796
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:54,240
How beautiful you are!

797
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:56,670
Darling, what are you doing?

798
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:58,548
You're going out?

799
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:01,471
Let me work a bit.

800
01:17:07,463 --> 01:17:09,574
Work.

801
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,773
Draw a nice moustache.

802
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:19,977
I know where you're going.

803
01:17:20,127 --> 01:17:22,488
Go and wash your face, first.

804
01:17:22,632 --> 01:17:23,806
Lili, that's enough!

805
01:17:24,998 --> 01:17:27,703
He doesn't like women with makeup.

806
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,404
He likes my style.

807
01:17:30,843 --> 01:17:33,513
That's enough, get out.

808
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,660
Slow down, Rima.
The girl is sick.

809
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:40,019
I drive as I damn well please.

810
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:43,322
It's your mouth we should've sewn up.

811
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:46,565
I don't believe this.

812
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:51,227
You'd rather I drove into the potholes?

813
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:54,881
You haven't missed a single one so far!

814
01:17:55,058 --> 01:17:58,533
I just love listening to your complaints.

815
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:02,152
- You wanted to sit in front!
- All I want is to arrive in one piece.

816
01:18:02,295 --> 01:18:04,999
Do you have an audition or not?

817
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,185
Open, dear.

818
01:18:57,822 --> 01:18:59,174
Rose.

819
01:19:00,258 --> 01:19:04,148
Open, so we can pray together.

820
01:19:04,294 --> 01:19:08,363
I brought you some fish for dinner.

821
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,107
Are you coming?

822
01:19:17,028 --> 01:19:19,281
Poor me.

823
01:19:19,428 --> 01:19:21,824
I'm tired of this life!

824
01:19:32,754 --> 01:19:35,351
Rosa.

825
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,250
My precious.

826
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,767
You want to go to Manara?

827
01:19:42,913 --> 01:19:46,353
Maybe I'll bury you there.

828
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:53,062
Please, open.

829
01:19:54,324 --> 01:19:57,658
May God send you a nice husband.

830
01:19:58,986 --> 01:20:02,106
I love you, Rose.

831
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:33,911
Why are you so stubborn?

832
01:20:34,057 --> 01:20:36,239
Why?

833
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,786
Are you deaf?

834
01:20:38,927 --> 01:20:42,047
Shall I take you to an ear doctor?

835
01:21:18,485 --> 01:21:21,819
What a mistake
to let you do this to me!

836
01:21:21,999 --> 01:21:24,016
How can one trust women?
Are you nuts?

837
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:27,555
Pull the curtains, it's not a show.

838
01:21:27,705 --> 01:21:29,781
You think you're the main attraction?

839
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:32,778
Why not razors?

840
01:21:32,924 --> 01:21:37,158
One day, you'll miss having all that hair.

841
01:21:37,656 --> 01:21:41,440
I'd like to see you in a skirt,
like a real girl.

842
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:45,133
You're always complaining. You can't
come to my wedding looking like this.

843
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,430
You have nice legs.
Why do you hide them?

844
01:21:48,615 --> 01:21:51,212
You want me to be like you?
Look at her.

845
01:21:51,363 --> 01:21:53,688
I feel sorry for your husband.

846
01:21:54,286 --> 01:21:55,602
I'll deal with you later.

847
01:21:55,748 --> 01:21:58,345
I can't take it anymore. Take it off.

848
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:00,781
Two more minutes.

849
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:05,798
I like his voice more than yours, Rima.

850
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:41,741
Come on, darling,
get it out of your system.

851
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:53,082
When it comes to horns,
his horn is really special.

852
01:22:56,911 --> 01:22:58,500
Your taste.

853
01:22:58,651 --> 01:23:00,110
- What's wrong?
- This is naughty.

854
01:23:00,251 --> 01:23:01,567
It's good for a bride.

855
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:06,233
Mom, stop stuffing
everything in this suitcase.

856
01:23:06,409 --> 01:23:08,876
Who would wear such old stuff?

857
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:13,324
As if I knew it would take you
ten years to get married.

858
01:23:13,507 --> 01:23:16,176
And besides, it's your
auntie who brought them.

859
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,678
Then let her wear them.

860
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:29,753
It's very nice.
Look in the mirror.

861
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:38,127
Come on, Nisrine, hurry up.

862
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:40,259
I have something to tell you.

863
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:42,346
So you know what to expect.

864
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:45,265
You're no longer a child.

865
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:49,230
I did well in bringing you up.

866
01:23:49,377 --> 01:23:53,719
But this is your last night at home.

867
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:56,954
This separation breaks my heart.

868
01:23:57,101 --> 01:24:01,099
Tomorrow, it'll be your night.
You know what this means.

869
01:24:01,276 --> 01:24:03,423
You go from one stage to another.

870
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:07,012
It will be the second stage of your life.

871
01:24:08,095 --> 01:24:10,171
All girls go through that.

872
01:24:10,322 --> 01:24:12,267
I've been through it too.

873
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:15,327
You shouldn't be shy with him.

874
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:18,875
He's your husband, your prince.

875
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,045
For better or for worse.

876
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,625
At first, it'll be difficult.
Then you'll get used to it.

877
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:29,068
Slowly, you'll get to know him.

878
01:24:29,248 --> 01:24:32,926
That's life. Only God
knows what's in store.

879
01:24:33,076 --> 01:24:35,437
It's like a melon.

880
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,498
You must cut it to see if it's good.

881
01:24:38,677 --> 01:24:41,833
God bless you.

882
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:44,271
You'll always be my little girl.

883
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:48,237
Stop, Mom, you'll make me cry.

884
01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:49,700
Don't forget, my darling.

885
01:24:49,845 --> 01:24:51,090
- Don't cry.
- You're my life.

886
01:24:51,237 --> 01:24:55,614
Our home will always be open for you.

887
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,607
I'll always pray for you.

888
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,696
- Let's go.
- Yes, love.

889
01:25:00,839 --> 01:25:04,659
- I don't want to see you cry.
- Alright, darling.

890
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:19,878
Just a second.

891
01:26:20,234 --> 01:26:23,224
Just a second.
Sorry for interrupting.

892
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,698
I'd like to present a small gift...

893
01:26:26,845 --> 01:26:28,505
...to the bride and the groom.

894
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,741
A modest gift.

895
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:36,793
<i>I don 't care what people say</i>

896
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:40,611
<i>Your name is my prayer</i>

897
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:44,794
<i>And fills me with Joy</i>

898
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:52,377
<i>More beautiful than the earth, our love is</i>

899
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:55,084
<i>They talk about love</i>

900
01:26:55,235 --> 01:26:58,355
<i>When they talk about you</i>

901
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:06,218
<i>Love if you wish</i>

902
01:27:06,368 --> 01:27:09,357
<i>But love as they do...</i>

903
01:27:21,467 --> 01:27:23,828
Are you in line for the bathroom?

904
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,004
Yes.

905
01:27:25,155 --> 01:27:28,073
May I go in before you?
I've got my period.

906
01:27:28,217 --> 01:27:31,242
No, no. Okay?

907
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,948
Come on, girls.

908
01:28:19,605 --> 01:28:21,716
Ready?

909
01:28:28,964 --> 01:28:30,387
One...

910
01:28:38,288 --> 01:28:40,269
Two...

911
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:46,772
Three!

912
01:28:51,544 --> 01:28:54,319
Look, it's a morning dove!

913
01:31:13,598 --> 01:31:16,718
To my Beirut
