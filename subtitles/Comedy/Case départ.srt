1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Hey.

2
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,900
Hey.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,100
You know, I, uh, I got
a piece of advice.

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,300
I'd feel really selfish
if I didn't share it.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Okay.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,900
You're supposed to picture 'em
naked when you're on the stand.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
If you're nervous.

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,700
Oh.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,100
I would, but, um,
it's my dad, so...

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,200
Yeah, okay...

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,100
Right.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm Truitt, by the way.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Tamyra.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,800
Everyone calls me Spider.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,100
Well, the world would be taken
over by mosquitoes and flies

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,700
if it weren't
for spiders, so...

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Good point.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,000
Did he do that?

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,000
How did you know that?

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,600
I don't even know you,
but... that makes me

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,500
really want to kick
someone's ass on your behalf.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Thanks.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,200
So, why are you here?

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,600
Someone said I did something I didn't do.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,200
Oh.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,200
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,400
So, listen, if things go well
today and-and I'm a free man

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,700
and the criminal justice
system doesn't fail me...

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,200
do you want to hang out?

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,300
Tamyra?

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,900
They're ready for you.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
You're gonna be great.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Be strong.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes! Let's hang out.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
My name and info's on a sticker
inside the front cover,

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,300
and... it was nice
meeting you.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
Maybe it was good luck
or something.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,300
Hey!

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
What, are you guys leaving
for a long lunch?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,900
We know you?

42
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,000
Kate Carley.
Lawyer for DHS.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
You guys dcold jobs, right?

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.
Detectives Rush, Miller.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,600
So back in '98, I represented
a teenager named Tamyra Borden,

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,800
who was suing her piece-of-scum
father for emancipation.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Scum like how?
Drunk.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,900
Good old Sly liked
to beat his little girl,

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,500
put out his cigarettes on her.

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,400
So I lose.
Jerk judge said

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
daughter's testimony wasn't
evidence enough of abuse.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,700
Three months later
Tamyra was killed.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,200
Skull crushed in.

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,000
They put the dad away?
No, they did not.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,100
And now, dad's brought up
on charges for his stepdaughter.

56
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,200
Beating her, too?

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,700
Three-year-old's in a coma.

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,800
I've been talking
to the assigned DA.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,700
Doing some research,
this is what I find.

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,100
What is it?

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Social Security checks for Tamyra
Borden 'cause her mother's dead.

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Checks were stolen and cashed
by dear old Dad for six months

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
after her death, until Uncle
Sam stopped sending them.

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
We'll look into it.

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,900
I was just outta law school.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,300
Me and her could've shared
a wardrobe, ya know?

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
Case got away from me.

68
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,400
Got it.

69
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,300
Just get the guy, so I
can live with myself.

70
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,000
???

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,700
??? the Kensington and Allegheny
overpass, August '98.

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,900
Well, blunt-force trauma
to the skull's what killed her.

73
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,200
ME speculates
a hammer's the murder weapon.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
Original theory
was, neighborhood

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,100
like that, Tamyra's looking for
drugs, turning tricks, maybe.

76
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,000
Interviewed family, neighbors.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,700
No one knew what she was doing that day, who she
might've been with.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
What about friends?

79
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,800
None in here.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,700
Sounds like Tamyra was a loner.

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,500
Mother died in Vegas in '92.

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
She and her dad were split by then.

83
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,900
Sly Borden- three counts
of public intoxication.

84
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,100
Second conviction
for drunk driving in '01.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,700
He said he hadn't
seen Tamyra

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,200
in a week before she died.

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,300
New info on
the Social Security checks,

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,800
maybe her dad'll be
more cooperative.

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,600
Why is it that I'm in a
crap cell with no cable hookup?

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Ain't that the way?

91
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,500
Beat your baby girl
half to death and get treated
like a scumbag.

92
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,300
Don't come at me
with that bullcrap.

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,100
You ever heard of
"innocent until guilty"?

94
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,500
We're here to talk about
Tamyra.

95
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,600
Where were you the night she
was killed?

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,100
In the privacy of my own home,
sleepin' off a bad day.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,100
I had no idea my little girl
was gettin' murdered.

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
And you were just crippled
with grief

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,700
when you spent her Social
Security checks at the track.

100
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,600
I was just trying to get by.

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Tamyra woulda wanted that.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,100
The daughter you
physically abused?

103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,200
I'll bet she hated
your guts.

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,700
That why you finished
her off, Sly?

105
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,600
Couldn't stand the way
she looked at you?

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,500
I hadn't seen the girl in a week
when I heard she died.

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,300
And by the way, now she is dead,

108
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,500
everybody talks
like she's some angel.

109
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
You got another
version?

110
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,300
Took after her mother.

111
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,200
Kind of a ho.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,900
That's nice of you.

113
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm sayin' it wasn't me
that got her into trouble.

114
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,200
It was herself
and her ho-ish habits.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,100
Dinner's ready.

116
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,100
Don't yell.

117
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,600
Here, Dad.
Dinner.

118
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,700
You can just set it on your lap.

119
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,900
So... when you were little

120
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
and Grandpa Ed
had the department store,

121
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
where was that?

122
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't know.
Downtown.

123
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
I told you this a million times.

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,700
Did you ever work there?

125
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:34,800
No.

126
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,400
By the time I was old enough
to get a job,

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,300
the store was closing.

128
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
No customers.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,100
Sorry.

130
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Sorry?!

131
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,700
We went from being
"Hello, Mr. Borden"

132
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
to havin' our hand out
like the Mexican bums

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
that took over our neighborhood,

134
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,700
and there was nothin' that I
could do to get us back on top.

135
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,800
Just...

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,900
Okay, Dad.

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,900
You just...

138
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,100
love bringing up
stuff like this.

139
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,100
I'm a failure?!

140
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,800
You're the failure.

142
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,400
What do you do around here, anyway? Huh?

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,700
Nothing.

144
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,900
Like a mouse.

145
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,600
You're out?

146
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,100
Go sit down on the couch.

147
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
Who the hell are you?

148
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
I said sit down on the couch,

149
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,100
'cause her and I are gonna walk
out of here

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,600
and you're just gonna watch us
leave, okay, old man?

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,500
Tamyra, go wait outside.

152
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,500
Spider?

153
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,900
It's okay. Wait outside.

154
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,700
If you ever try to see
her again, I'll make sure

155
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
you fall down those stairs
and don't get up.

156
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,900
Last time I saw her.

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Good riddance.

158
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Spider?
What's his real name?

159
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,500
Hell if I know.

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,700
But Tamyra was writing letters
to some prisoner-

161
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,700
number blah-blah-blah-
for a few months

162
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
before he graced us
with his visit.

163
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,500
And you keep this in
for ten years?

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,300
Certain people could view me
in a bad light after that story.

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,300
You get a look at where he was
locked up with those letters?

166
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,100
No.

167
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,500
You see his car
that night?

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
Oh, yeah.

169
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,500
Jerk drove a Nissan Altima.

170
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,900
That was Tamyra's slap
in my face.

171
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,600
Havin' a boyfriend
with a Jap car.

172
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Uh-huh.

173
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,800
Can't really say you dug
yourself out here, Sly.

174
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,200
But thanks for seeing us.

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,900
We'll be sure to stop by again.

176
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,900
Who's the clown?

177
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,200
Never seen him before.

178
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,200
Friend of yours?

179
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,900
That's the problem
with this job.

180
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,500
People know
where you work.

181
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Who is he?

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,800
Deadbeat from
my undercover days.

183
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,600
Ex-banger, dealer,
just got outta prison.

184
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,800
Came looking for a second date?

185
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,500
Kidding.

186
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,900
You don't date.

187
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,800
Don't think you know so much
more about things than I do.

188
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,500
That woman just tolerates you.

189
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,300
Toni can handle a real man.
Not every woman can.

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
We got a list from DMV-

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,700
who owned a '94

192
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,400
Nissan Altima in '98.

193
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't suppose any of 'em put
down Spider as their first name?

194
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,100
No, but one guy might fit the bill.

195
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,000
Lil and Scotty are with him now.

196
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,800
No, I'm not Spider.

197
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,000
That guy's real name
is Truitt Leland.

198
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
And he drove a car
registered to you

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,900
the night he went to
Tamyra Borden's house?

200
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,000
He used to borrow
my car, yes.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,900
I used to hang out with him
when I was young and stupid.

202
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,900
You don't keep up?

203
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Have you met him?

204
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,300
The moment I graduated from angry young man-dom,

205
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,100
I
stopped spending time with him.

206
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
What do
you know about Tamyra?

207
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,000
She dated Spider.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,100
Stayed at his mom's house
with us for a few weeks.

209
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Look, do I need a lawyer?

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,700
I swear, I'm nothing like that guy.

211
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Why are you protesting
so much, Elliot?

212
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,800
God knows what he's done that I don't want to be
associated with.

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,900
He have anything to do
with Tamyra's death?

214
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,500
When did she die?

215
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,000
I mean, she stopped coming
around, but I just figured...

216
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,100
What?

217
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,900
That it was because of what
was going on with us... with Spider.

218
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,200
Which was what, Elliot?

219
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,300
Look, my parents had
a bad divorce and I had "dad" issues,

220
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,200
which made me vulnerable
to Spider.

221
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Again...

222
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
stupid kid.

223
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,500
Truitt wrote me
all these letters,

224
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,600
and I don't know.

225
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
It was nice
to get something in the mail.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
My mom- she used
to send postcards or whatever, but...

227
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
Yeah, Truitt's a good writer.

228
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
That's my son.

229
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,600
And he can talk his way
out of anything, too.

230
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Hope he warned you
we're boring over here.

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,300
We don't drink or
smoke or anything.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,300
No, that's great.

233
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,600
Want some milk?

234
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Okay.

235
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Tamyra, if you
ever want a place to stay.

236
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,300
We have an
extra room.

237
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
I left my dad, moved in here.

238
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,200
We're her orphans.

239
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Trust me, there's
no better mother.

240
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
Take this downstairs.

241
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,900
It's "No Mom Allowed. "

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,400
The values that we're taught
are important to us,

243
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,900
don't mean
anything anymore.

244
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,400
I mean, go to school.

245
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,300
You can't afford college.

246
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,100
Work hard. Well, some illegal aliens
get my job.

247
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
Be honest.
Go to church.

248
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,300
Well, I'd like to. But my preacher
and my government

249
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,000
are lying to me about what kind of people
they really are.

250
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
But it's not like things have ever been better.

251
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Or easier.

252
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
It's the same old struggles our parents had.

253
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,400
What about our grandparents?

254
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
My grandfather comesack
from World War II

255
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,000
and goes to any college
he wants to on the government.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
I come back from Kuwait, I'm on my own.

257
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,800
Something's gone wrong between that generation and this one.

258
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,700
Big time.

259
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,100
I think we know what it is.

260
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,400
It's the government's
liberal agenda.

261
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,600
They serve the blacks,

262
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,200
the Jews, the Mexicans,
and the homosexuals.

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
The white race is under attack.

264
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
You were skinheads.

265
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
Like I said,
I was lonely and lost,

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,100
so I hung out with Spider
and tolerated all that talk.

267
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,200
But he was
the true believer.

268
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,700
Tamyra's boyfriend
was a neo-Nazi

269
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,200
and she winds up
with her skull bashed in.

270
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I wonder if Spider and his steel-toed boots

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,300
know anything about that.

272
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,600
Truitt Leland, summer of '98,
he spends two months

273
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,200
at the house of corrections for
trashing a convenience store.

274
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Owned by a Vietnamese couple.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Only two months?

276
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,700
Court called it vandalism.

277
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,500
Not ethnic-motivated.

278
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
He up to his old tricks?

279
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,500
Recent as '06,

280
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,400
cops got called to break apart a scuffle

281
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,100
at a White Pride rally he organized.

282
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,600
No charges pressed.

283
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Speaking of which.

284
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,400
Guess my invite
got lost in the mail.

285
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
Can I help you?

286
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
This is a Neighborhood Freedom Coalition meeting.

287
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,700
Freedom from what, exactly?

288
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,800
Philly PD.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,800
We've got a legal right to congregate here.

290
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
What's your issue?

291
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,100
Tamyra Borden.

292
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,900
You know anything about

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,700
her gettin' her head bashed in...

294
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
Spider?

295
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,700
It's Truitt.

296
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,800
And no, I don't.

297
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
Is this your normal
potluck accessory... Spider?

298
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,900
Again, I've got a legal right,

299
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
I have a permit.

300
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,400
That sets my mind at ease.

301
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Neo-Nazi roaming the streets
with a concealed weapon.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Unbelievable. The bigotry.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
You should know better than anyone.

304
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Just because we're organized

305
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,700
and proud of our race

306
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
doesn't mean we go around
committing murder.

307
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,100
Tamyra was your girlfriend
when she was killed.

308
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,700
And you've got a history of violence.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,400
What we had was
pure and innoct.

310
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,700
That girl was an Aryan goddess.

311
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,000
Is that a compliment?

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, so you didn't get
slap-happy on her

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
when she decided she wasn't
into the swastika thing?

314
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,000
What makes you think
she wasn't into it?

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,700
Hey.

316
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Hey.

317
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Why are you up?

318
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I couldn't sleep.

319
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,900
Why not?

320
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,200
Because I was worried
you couldn't sleep.

321
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
You barely talked
to me tonight.

322
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,500
Do you believe
in, like, the Holocaust?

323
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,900
That it was right?

324
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,500
No.

325
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm confused.

326
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,100
Why did you talk to me

327
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,800
that day
at the courthouse?

328
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,500
Why did you write to me?

329
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

330
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,200
That's ridiculous.

331
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,300
I hate the way
that swastika looks.

332
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
It's hate.

333
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
And I just don't think you are like that.

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,800
The swastika is
an ancient symbol for strength.

335
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,000
I mean to the sun, good luck.

336
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,700
That's everything I want for you.

337
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,900
For our people.

338
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,400
When my dad lost his job...

339
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,900
that's when he started drinking.

340
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,900
Who'd he lose it to?

341
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
An illegal alien, right?

342
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
Yeah.

343
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,800
He just... he felt so useless,
you know.

344
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,900
I could tell.

345
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,600
I just wish things could have
been better for him.

346
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
It doesn't have
to be that way.

347
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
Are you gonna help me?

348
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,000
Are you gonna be brave?

349
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Why'd Tamyra have
to be brave?

350
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,600
What did you
get her into?

351
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
Nothing other than
defending our beliefs.

352
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,600
And how do you do that?

353
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,400
We abide by the law.

354
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,000
You cops protect us so well,

355
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,100
how could we not
want to play nice?

356
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,800
Nice.

357
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,000
You remember prison.

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,700
How would you like that
for the rest of your life?

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,400
Unless you're going to press charges,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

360
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,700
You know you have
no grounds to do that.

361
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,000
Plus, I have a First Amendment
right to congregate here

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,700
and that's what
I plan on doing.

363
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
See ya.

364
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,600
Hey, Spider,
where'd you get that nickname from?

365
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,800
Wouldn't happen to do
with the skinhead tattoo

366
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
you get when you kill
a black person, would it?

367
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
It's 'cause I'm nocturnal.

368
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,100
He was taunting us, boss.

369
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,000
Jackass thinks he can hide,but he's wrong.

370
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,700
These are all the crime reports from the summer of '98.

371
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,300
When Spider ask Tamyra to swear her allegiance to him,

372
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,000
said he needed her to be brave.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,100
These types can't resist staking a claim.

374
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,100
There's got to be a signature in there.

375
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,900
A week before Tamyra's murder there were
broken windows at a temple in South Philly.

376
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
The same at a mosque.

377
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,200
Racist graffiti on an African-American family home--

378
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,400
standard curse word stuff,
nothing distinctive.

379
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,100
Oh, I've got something.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,300
It was flagged as ethnic intimidation
'cause it's a Honduran lady.

381
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
This car belonged
to Nora Mariposa,

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,300
went missing
August 17, 1998.

383
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,900
The day
before Tamyra was killed.

384
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,700
There's graffiti
on the door.

385
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,100
That a skinhead tag?

386
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,300
I've been reading up on the crap
these white supremacists use

387
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,400
to justify their beliefs.

388
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,300
That's real educational.

389
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,600
Oh, the Internet's
overflowing with stuff.

390
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
They're everywhere.

391
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,000
The one thing they can all agree on is this book

392
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,300
<i>The Lightning and The Sun.</i>

393
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,000
It's got a loving dedication to Hitler himself.

394
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,100
Isn't that sweet?

395
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,000
That book's about using violence to cleanse society.

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,700
And this tag is the lightning and the sun.

397
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Nora Mariposa never turned up?

398
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,600
But we got a witness.

399
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,700
Nora's four-year-old son was in the car.

400
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
You were four years old,Miguel,

401
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
when your mother went missing?

402
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

403
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,100
They found me in the car,
but I didn't remember anything.

404
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,300
You remember this?

405
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,900
Did you see someone do this?

406
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Sorry.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,100
Can we show you some other pictures?

408
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,100
Was, uh, this guy there that night?

409
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,700
I don't know. Sorry.

410
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
Him and her.

411
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,900
These two?

412
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,300
They were there that night?

413
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,800
<i>Ponche de goma.</i>

414
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,900
Flat tire.

415
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,800
<i>Hola, chica.</i>

416
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,600
What did they do when they got out of the truck?

417
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,100
Miguel?

418
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,600
They hurt her.

419
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
My mother.

420
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
What are you doing?

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,700
Remember I told you to be brave?

422
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,900
<i>ecesitas ayuda?</i>

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
<i>Si.</i>

424
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
<i>Gracias.</i>

425
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
I cannot change tire.

426
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,500
You guys gotta get down here.
It's going to get explosive.

427
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
Spider.

428
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,500
Your father,a white man,

429
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,400
lost his job because people like this
are willing to work for nothing!

430
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,300
Leeches!

431
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
Wait.You'll kill her!

432
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
No. You will.

433
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,800
Hey, hey, look at me

434
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,100
I know that you're scared, okay?

435
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,700
This is what it looks like

436
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,200
when you're fighting
to get your life back, okay?

437
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,400
Trust me. I love you.

438
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
She shot Nora.

439
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,500
????

440
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,000
So far, none of them
match Nora Mariposa.

441
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,400
Must have hid the body.

442
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,200
Rush and Will
are in with the girl.

443
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,300
Neck tat girl?

444
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,700
She was capable of beating
Nora Mariposa to death.

445
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Could have done it to Tamyra.

446
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Stillman.

447
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,900
The not-so-nice lady told you to get lost, homes.

448
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,800
I know she did,
but she needs to talk to me.

449
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,600
How about I talk to you, sport?

450
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,500
Man, I just need to see my kid.

451
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,400
Your kid?

452
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Veronica.

453
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
My daughter.

454
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
I got it.

455
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,500
I said I got it.

456
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,500
I told you...
we're done talking about this.

457
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm not the same
person as I was.

458
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
No drugs,
no playing around.

459
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,300
I got my act together
on the inside.

460
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,500
Good for you.

461
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,500
She even know about me?

462
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,800
What should I say?

463
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
Dad's in prison.
Ex-banger thug?

464
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,600
Kat, you act like
you're better than me.

465
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,700
You forgot how we met?

466
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,200
I was doing my job.

467
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,800
Oh. That's what
you tell yourself, huh?

468
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I've made a life for me and her,
and it works.

469
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,600
We got it down.
That's all she needs.

470
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
You sure about that?

471
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,500
I leave Philly in a week.

472
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Get away from all the elements.

473
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,500
Make sure I stay on track.

474
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Before I go... I'd like
to meet my daughter.

475
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
I said no.

476
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,000
And don't come
back here again

477
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,800
or I'll have your sorry ass
thrown back in jail.

478
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,700
Those your kids screaming
like banshees out there?

479
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,000
ADD. Yeah.

480
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,300
I guess you weren't
a diehard skinhead, huh?

481
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,900
Love is blind.

482
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,400
And another of those kids
has got Spider as a dad.

483
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
So? You can't tell me
who to have my babies with.

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,800
Four years back child support.

485
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
What is he,
ashamed of you guys?

486
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,400
He's a frickin' dirtbag
is what he is.

487
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,800
And after you did
everything for him.

488
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Helped him kill a woman.

489
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,800
Huh

490
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,700
Nora Mariposa.

491
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,300
We got a witness puts you as coconspirator to murder,

492
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,100
beating that woman as she lay on the ground.

493
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,800
A witness?
That's impossible.

494
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,700
It was frickin' pitch-dark.

495
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,000
Um... You've just put yourself

496
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
at the scene
of the murder, Lindsay.

497
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,700
So, that means
you're going away.

498
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
But I didn't do it.

499
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
Who did, Lindsay?

500
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,400
Was it Tamyra?

501
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
You've got one option
if you want to save yourself,

502
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,000
and that's tell us
what happened.

503
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,500
It's them...

504
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,600
or you.

505
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Spider trusted Tamyra
that night...

506
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,100
which was a huge mistake.

507
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:52,400
No. No.

508
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,700
Oh, my God.

509
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
What happened?

510
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,700
We killed the bitch.
Roadkill.

511
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Why?

512
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,900
No. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

513
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,900
Why are you
freaking out on me?

514
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,800
Why did you do that?

515
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,600
Why?

516
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,800
Spider...

517
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,700
you never said
we'd do this.

518
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,400
What did I say,
Elliot, huh?

519
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,300
What did I say?!
I said this was war!

520
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,200
What do soldiers do?!

521
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
What do they do, Elliot?!

522
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,000
I thought, I thought
it was about ideas or the...

523
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,500
Ideas?

524
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
What did you think
we were doing?

525
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
We have to call
an ambulance!

526
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
You stupid bitch.
She's dead.

527
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,100
How can you be my girl

528
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
when you're acting
like this right now?

529
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,500
Stop!

530
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Here's an idea.

531
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,900
Why don't you help me
clean this up?

532
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,700
Help me.

533
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,400
Teamwork.

534
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Give me a T.

535
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,500
Wait, I told what
you wanted to know.

536
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,600
You said it was me or them.

537
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
We meant you and them.

538
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,900
Tell us where Spider is.

539
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,200
-With his bitch wife.
-They took off.

540
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,100
Do you know where
Spider might hide out?

541
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Can't you give me a break?

542
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
I was kind of stupid back then.

543
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,300
Still are, Lindsay.

544
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Think you guys are going
in the wrong direction.

545
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,200
What? This ain't the swap meet?

546
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,000
You're gonna want
to put that weapon

547
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,300
on the ground, right now. Now!

548
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,700
Put your weapon down,
sweetheart.

549
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,700
What did you do
with Nora Mariposa's body?

550
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,600
You're going away
for life for that, Spider.

551
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,300
Don't care.

552
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
Movement's strong inside.

553
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Good. You got somebody
to pray for you

554
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,100
when you get the needle.

555
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
No way.

556
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,000
Double murder--
Nora and Tamyra.

557
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,400
I didn't do Tamyra.

558
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,900
She was gonna turn you in.
She was a traitor ??

559
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,500
Something had to be done,
and you were the guy to do it.

560
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,600
Not with her.

561
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,700
She was just
a little freaked out,

562
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,400
but she would've come around.

563
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
Deep down, she was with me.

564
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,300
Hoping she'd be
your Aryan bride?

565
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
Not everybody saw
my future like that.

566
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,800
Tamyra?

567
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,700
You guys were out late last night.

568
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,300
Are you looking for something?

569
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,100
No. It's okay.

570
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,500
Honey, what's wrong?

571
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,400
Sweetheart,
please let me help.

572
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,900
Is it your father?

573
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,200
No.
Please let me out.

574
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,000
I need to go to the police.

575
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,700
Is someone hurt?

576
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,000
She's dead.

577
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,700
We killed her.

578
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,700
Who?

579
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,100
A woman, a Latin woman.

580
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
We shot her.

581
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,200
Please, let me out.

582
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Do you know what those
spic mud people niggers do

583
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,100
to white women like us?

584
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,600
Ravage us.

585
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
And you don't hear
about it on the news,

586
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,900
and the cops won't help.

587
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,800
All we have is men
like my son to protect us.

588
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,800
No, but this woman
didn't do anything wrong.

589
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,000
We are at war
with those people.

590
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
You are either with us,
or you're against us.

591
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,500
You can't do this.

592
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,800
We are.

593
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,000
It's happening
with or without you.

594
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,500
Your mother killed
Tamyra Borden?

595
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,700
Why are you surprised?

596
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
She raised me.

597
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,100
My mother...

598
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,500
is the ultimate believer.

599
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
You ever heard those stories about
somebody who raises a pit bull?

600
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
eds them gunpowder and
kicks them to make them mean?

601
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,800
One day the dog turns on 'em, attacks.

602
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
That's what
happened to you.

603
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,700
Your little psychopath Spider

604
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,400
told us what you did to
his girlfriend Tamyra.

605
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,200
He straight-cold sold you out.

606
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
What did I do? I talked to her.
Tried to reason with her.

607
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
And when that didn't work, you killed her.

608
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,700
I would never lay my hands on that girl.

609
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,700
She was going to send
Spider back to jail.

610
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
Your baby boy.

611
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,700
You wouldn't
let that happen.

612
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,900
Do you think I'm stupid?

613
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,200
We think you had someone else
do your dirty work for you.

614
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,000
Somehow Tamyra got out and was
beat to death a mile from your house.

615
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,800
Somehow.

616
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,400
Hey.

617
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,500
Why aren't you upstairs
eating dinner?

618
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,400
Elliot.

619
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Yeah?

620
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,000
We ran away
from our parents, and...

621
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,800
here we are again.

622
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,400
We're prisoners...

623
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,800
living with
another crazy man.

624
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah. Spider's not
what I thought.

625
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,700
If I could go back to the night
that he came to get me,

626
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
instead of getting in that car,
I'd run away.

627
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I'd get on the
first bus out,

628
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,000
and when I got out,
I'd change my name.

629
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,700
I'd try to always be happy.

630
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,100
Elliot, what
are you doing?

631
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,700
They'll kill you.

632
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,400
You need to go.

633
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,300
Go now. Please.

634
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,700
Come with me.

635
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,900
Come!

636
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Don't be scared.

637
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you to leave.

638
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,100
When you first came.

639
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,900
Go.

640
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,500
He went after her.

641
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,700
Ten minutes later.

642
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,300
With a hammer.

643
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
And you just let him go?

644
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,000
You can't stop young men
on a mission.

645
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Elliot went after her
on your mission.

646
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
You put him up
to it, Rayanne.

647
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
How'd you make him do it?

648
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,700
Elliot didn't
believe in killing.

649
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,300
You don't know Elliot.

650
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,400
He's not who he pretends to be.

651
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,600
He's much weaker.

652
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,800
Did you talk to Spider?

653
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,100
Everything all right?

654
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,500
Tamyra wasn't just some girl
you met a few times.

655
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,200
You helped her escape from Spider.

656
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,100
You both knew Spider
killed Nora Mariposa.

657
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,700
And Rayanne
says that's

658
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,300
what you did to Tamyra.

659
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,500
What? Well, Rayanne is a trailer trash lunatic.

660
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,800
What is it you teach?

661
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,500
Economics.

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So this is for pleasure?

663
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,900
<i>Ah, Lightning and the Sun.</i>

664
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,000
You fooled us, Elliot.

665
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You look normal enough.

666
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And Nordic mythology.

667
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Ben Klassen.

668
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
<i>History of the Illuminati.</i>

669
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,400
<i>Mein Kampf.</i>

670
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,000
You didn't stop
hanging out with Spider

671
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,600
because of
his beliefs.
'Cause you two

672
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,100
got that in common.
Do those college

673
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,100
kids' parents know
the kind of sewage

674
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,300
they're paying you
to teach their kids?
You don't think

675
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,900
economics and race
belong in the same classroom?

676
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,500
This is all about money.

677
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,800
9/11. The Jews bringing
do the towers.

678
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,200
The war we're fighting
right now with our white males.

679
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,600
It's all to protect Israel?

680
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,500
You really drank the Kool-Aid,
didn't you?

681
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,900
Does it nag at you, Detective,

682
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
that you only got your job

683
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,700
because the liberal elite
pities your race?

684
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,300
You guys believe
in alien probes, too?

685
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,600
The tide is turning, Detective.

686
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,300
We are on the Internet.

687
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,900
We are funded and organized.

688
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,900
And politicians agree:
it's time to make

689
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,100
our neighborhoods safe,
protect our borders.

690
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,000
The courts agree affirmative action is reverse racism.

691
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,300
You wrap it up like it ain't narrow-minded,

692
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,300
paranoid bullcrap, but it is.

693
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,200
Well, what's really
crazy, Elliot, is

694
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,600
that you can say all this...

695
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,400
but you're Jewish.

696
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,600
No, I'm not.

697
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,300
No. Your mother's
Jewish, Elliot.

698
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
Makes you the most self-hating
son of a bitch I ever seen.

699
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm not that.

700
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,700
Not anymore.

701
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,800
It's 'cause of your mother
you have this way about you.

702
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,200
It's weak.

703
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,700
People see it.

704
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,900
That's why it is.

705
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,200
How it is.

706
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,000
How?

707
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,300
Nobody respecting you.

708
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,700
It's that sick thing in you.

709
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,300
I don't even live
with my mother.

710
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,700
I don't even like her.

711
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,800
It's only half.

712
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,400
Feels like more than that.

713
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,400
It's not.

714
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,400
You've gotta burn it out.

715
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,700
How'd you burn
it out, Elliot?

716
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,400
Killing Tamyra for the cause?

717
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,200
Rayanne convinced you.

718
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,200
You're not gonna leave here

719
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
and say that thing
you said, are you?

720
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,500
Because that would be slander.

721
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm a white American.

722
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,500
Nothing less.

723
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,600
Take her
somewhere else.

724
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,700
Wait till you're far from here.

725
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,300
Our esteemed president Theodore Roosevelt said it

726
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,100
and I don't know why people can't grasp this

727
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,700
"We have room for but one sole loyalty

728
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,100
and that is loyalty to the American people."

729
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Okay.

730
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,000
I'll handle it.

731
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,400
Tamyra was American.

732
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,300
Your logic doesn't work.

733
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm talking about
the ordinary American.

734
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Your mailman, college student,
fireman.

735
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,400
They've been wronged,

736
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,200
and now they're mad.

737
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
I didn't write the rules of war.

738
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,900
They've existed since the dawn of time.

739
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Blood is spilled and it wipes us clean.

740
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,100
Why'd you need
to be clean, Elliot?

741
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,000
You could've left with her.

742
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,300
No. She was a race traitor.

743
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,200
Like you.

744
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,600
And I was a soldier.

745
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,700
It's what the true soldiers do.

746
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,500
And when the race war starts,

747
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,300
everyone who ever laughed at me and deserted me

748
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,000
will say, "He knew.

749
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
He knew all along."

750
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,900
I had to.

751
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,700
To be clean.
