We want to go to the Peninsula.

624
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,465
[JONAS] At my old post,
I took part in an air patrol.

625
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,270
We wouldn't fly directly
over the Peninsula,

626
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:25,867
but I could see it from a distance.
It's totally overgrown.

627
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,423
If anyone actually lives there
it's in a completely primitive state.

628
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,266
- How do we get there?
- You're seriously considering this?

629
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,785
We've already decided.

630
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,062
[BESS] You know you'll be
on your own out there.

631
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,541
There will be no one
to look after you.

632
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,146
Whatever we go through
it will be together.

633
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:47,544
I know how you're feeling, but you're
not thinking of all the risks.

634
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,664
If we stay here we'll be found out.
We'll get the cure.

635
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:01,106
You know, it's many years ago, I was not
much older than you when I got the bug,

636
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:06,502
no one even knew
what S.O.S. was back then.

637
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:10,551
People were getting it,
most of them would commit suicide.

638
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,670
There was a young man
in my living block,

639
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,861
I could tell he was a hider,
just like me,

640
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:22,225
but no one dared mention it back then.

641
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:28,466
One night, he knocked on my door
and told me that he and two others

642
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,464
were going to the Peninsula
and he wanted me to go with him.

643
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,901
Of course, there was no way
I was going.

644
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,703
I knew they were
headed for their deaths.

645
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,225
Bess.

646
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:46,624
The few months after he left
were the loneliest I've ever felt.

647
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:51,344
We'd only spoken that one time.

648
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,223
More than all the suicides I've seen,

649
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:02,023
it was his death that was the most...
unnecessarily wasteful.

650
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,989
Such a waste.

651
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,870
That was a new feeling for me.

652
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,422
But you don't know that he died.

653
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,110
What if he didn't?

654
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,268
I can talk to my old colleague.

655
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:32,025
He was the pilot who took us
on the air patrol.

656
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:36,350
If they get caught, the whole plan could
be traced back to you or to the group.

657
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,423
You said interfering
was too risky.

658
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:46,307
If you make this decision
you know there is no turning back.

659
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:51,546
If you do manage to get out,
you can never return.

660
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,950
Of course.

661
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:12,868
When you get to the border
ask for Oliver, he will fly you.

662
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,105
What if he gets caught?

663
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,301
He won't.

664
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,389
Good luck.

665
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,704

776
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,668
I'm still pregnant.

777
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:03,301
We're going to get on
the train tomorrow. Okay?

778
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,303
I love you.

779
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:14,105
I love you, I love you,
I love you...

780
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,350
You have to fight it.
Just fight it okay?

781
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,182
I can already tell it's in me.

782
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:43,227
Just remember... Okay?

783
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,464
How?

784
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,467
Remember this feeling.

785
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,511
Just remember what this feels like.

786
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:00,904
Yeah... yeah, just promise me...

787
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:05,066
...no matter... what happens...

788
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,984
...no matter what I say,
what I feel or don't feel

789
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,587
I'm still,
I'm still in here trying. Okay?

790
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:15,301
I'm still in here.
Just don't give up on me.

791
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,462
Please, don't give up on me.

792
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:19,508
- I promise.
- Don't give up on me.

793
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:22,311
I promise that I won't...

794
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,790
Silas?

795
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,580
Good Morning.

796
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:29,344
Do you still love me?

797
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,628
I remember I loved you.

798
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,590
But...

799
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,384
I don't feel it anymore.

800
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,989
Do you still want to go?

801
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,063
We made a plan.

802
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,909
Right.

803
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:50,951
