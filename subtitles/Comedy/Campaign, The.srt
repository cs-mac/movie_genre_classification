2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,211
What's it all about?

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,757
America, Jesus, freedom.

4
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,175
Say it again.

5
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,720
America, Jesus, freedom.

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,096
And what does that mean?

7
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:00,851
Shit, I don't know.
But the people sure love it when I say it.

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,686
How's my hair?

9
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,522
Strong. Real strong.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,735
Let's send him back to Washington.

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:14,156
Democratic congressman today,
vice president tomorrow.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,034
Here he is, running unopposed...

13
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,162
- Hello, everyone!
- ...Cam Brady!

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:26,001
North Carolina is taking care of business.

15
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:31,882
Just like you, every day,
I'm living the American dream.

16
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,843
I come from humble beginnings.

17
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,845
My father worked with his hands...

18
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,557
...as head stylist for Vidal Sassoon.

19
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,727
- Amen!
- Very much the typical American family.

20
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:48,690
I'm here today with my beautiful family,
and I'd love for you to welcome them.

21
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,276
My two children, Jessica, Cam Jr.

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,114
- I love you, J. Lo. Camouflage.
- Get them, Camo!

23
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,326
And of course, my Rock of Gibraltar...

24
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,286
...Mrs. Rose Brady, my wife.

25
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,496
Love you, baby.

26
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,957
My dream maker. Thanks for coming out.

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,459
Cam Brady '012.

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,213
Our nation's security
has never been stronger...

29
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:16,009
...because our troops and our veterans
are this nation's backbone.

30
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:20,305
Because farmers are this nation's backbone.

31
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,893
Schools is this nation's backbone.

32
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:30,399
Audio-installation specialists
and window tinters are this nation's backbone.

33
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:36,738
Because Filipino Tilt-A-Whirl operators
are this nation's backbone.

34
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,618
And I wanna make you a promise today...

35
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:46,206
...that if you send me back to Washington, D.C.,
for a fifth consecutive term...

36
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:52,045
...I will let them know it's about America,
Jesus and freedom.

37
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,922
We love you, Cam!

38
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,301
I love you too.

39
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,428
You got a lot of energy, don't you?

40
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,515
- Oh, Shana.
- Oh! Oh, Cam!

41
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,142
Your body's so toned.

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,560
- Cam!
- So toned.

43
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,980
- Cam, it smells horrible in here.
- It's not that bad once you get used to it.

44
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,568
If it's a-rocking, don't come a-knocking.

45
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,283
This is bad, Cam.

46
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,661
This is real bad. Okay?
I don't like those numbers at all.

47
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,332
- Just one poll. Those things aren't scientific.
- Yes, they are.

48
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,417
All this is is science. This is math.

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,212
But if you took it
and put it on its axis this way--

50
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,798
Hey, look, Cam, I'm telling you right now,
it was the phone call.

51
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,217
- Mm-mm.
- Yes.

52
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,887
- No way.
- Yes way. No, look at this, look at this, okay?

53
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,432
Sixty-two percent of the people
that got asked liked you, okay?

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,186
Then the phone call happened.
Then they asked the same question.

55
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,605
Now only 46 percent of the people like you.

56
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,024
Run through it one more time.

57
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,360
Look, before the call, this is you.
Like Price Is Right.

58
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,781
And then look at that. Straight down.

59
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,284
I thought I was calling Shana. I misdialed.

60
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,371
And, Lord, we just pray
that you bless this table...

61
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,581
...this food, this family and this nation.

62
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,712
Hey, Jared,
let's let the machine take one for God.

63
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,884
Hey, Shana,
it's Congressman Cam Brady here.

64
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:25,931
I just stepped away from a family dinner
to tell you I wish I wasn't eating fried steak.

65
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,225
I wish I was eating Shana pussy.

66
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,271
Seriously, baby, you get me so hard
my dick presses against my zipper...

67
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,481
...and it hurts like a motherfucker.

68
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,691
What else?

69
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,443
Oh, hey, I got your parents tickets to
The Producers.

70
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,613
And, oh, yeah,
let's do something crazy weird next time...

71
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,700
...like lick each other's buttholes
in a Denny's bathroom.

72
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,119
All right, I gotta go. Cam Brady in '012.

73
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,871
- Okay.
- Now, that was clearly a wrong number.

74
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,873
- Right.
- He is not listening to Jesus...

75
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,003
...because if he was,
oh, Jesus would give him a tongue-lashing.

76
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,298
Not like the one he has requested.

77
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,301
And that family's hopping mad.

78
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,594
- What do you want me to say?
- You tell me.

79
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,723
I fucked up.

80
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,642
Yeah, we're in a bad situation here, okay?

81
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,062
- What do you wanna do?
- Get out front. Walk it back.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,234
We can't have this.
It's a behavior that has to stop.

83
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,361
But, congressman, you made the call.

84
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,031
I have made in my lifetime...

85
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,451
...probably over 100,000 phone calls...

86
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,954
...of which I could say maybe 1 percent
have been inappropriate.

87
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,498
- What is that, a thousand phone calls?
- That is exactly 1000.

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,503
A thousand phone calls have been rude,
inappropriate, sexually explicit.

89
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,380
Phone calls I wish I could take back.

90
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:45,719
But that's only 1000 out of 100,000.
I'll take those odds any day of the week.

91
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,769
Gentlemen, I can't bring this bill
to the floor. I'll get killed.

92
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,189
There is no way Congress
will let Motch Worldwide Global...

93
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,485
...put "made in America"
on goods made in China.

94
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:05,405
Why not?
The name of the town in China is America.

95
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,240
Oh, now, technically it's Mera-Kai.

96
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,951
My brother and I are job creators.

97
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,205
And because of that,
we're also candidate creators.

98
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,748
My hands are tied.

99
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,250
- That's a real pity, isn't it, Wade?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,004
By the time we're finished,
half your district will think you're a Marxist...

101
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,217
...and the other half will think you've got
every D.C. Craigslist hooker on speed dial.

102
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,177
Got it?

103
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,390
When the family plugged in their phone
into the answering machine...

104
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,184
...they became consenting adults.

105
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,560
Cam Brady's done.

106
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,979
He doesn't have this district
locked up anymore.

107
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,065
Let's get Brady out of there.

108
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,609
Finance someone
who'll be a friend of the Motches...

109
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,736
...and help us change these regulations.

110
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,531
Who do we have down there
that we could run?

111
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,534
Big Jim Santon's in prison
for embezzling state lottery funds.

112
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,746
- Sad.
- Well, Raymond Huggins' boy Marty?

113
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,541
Isn't he the weird one?

114
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,210
Has weird ever stopped us before?

115
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:05,215
How, in the year 2012,
do they still have an answering machine?

116
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,717
Why are they denied modern technology?

117
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,970
Make the call.

118
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,686
Come on, guys.

119
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,233
- Hey there, Marty.
- Hey, Tammy.

120
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,573
- Good morning, Dr. Scruggs.
- I have no idea who you are.

121
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,993
Hey, Diane.
How's business at Candles 'N' Such?

122
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,705
Such is selling.
I can't move the candles, though.

123
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,833
Yes, you can, Diane.
"Can't" is the real C-word.

124
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,339
Cock-a-doodle-doo, Travis. You look tired.
Did you get some sleep?

125
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,758
Yeah, I'm just real high.

126
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,677
You're hysterical, Travis.

127
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,348
- How's the turnout for the 11 :30 tour?
- Just one person signed in.

128
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,728
What? Are you serious?
What happened to the eighth-grade field trip?

129
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,272
I guess the kids
would just rather go to class.

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,692
- Well, I just need one person.
- Yeah, well, guess who it is.

131
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,112
Mrs. Cutler again.
She got a crush on you, Marty.

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,531
She's gonna have to get in line. Heh.

133
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,578
Hammond, or the jewel of the Carolinas,
as I like to call it...

134
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,999
...is rich in history
and flush with natural beauty.

135
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,792
We've also had celebrities pass through.

136
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,086
Eight years ago,
actress Rosie Perez passed through...

137
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,508
...when she got turned around on the interstate
and came to ask us for direc--

138
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,677
- Travis, stop, stop. Stop the tour. Stop the tour.
- Now? All right.

139
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,598
Hello, Father?

140
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,225
Yes.

141
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,727
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

142
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,707
Oh, I's a-coming, I's a-coming.

143
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,042
Patience for the tired.

144
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,754
Now, you just enjoy that view
from the porch, now.

145
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,173
Oh. Almost there.

146
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,719
Oh, well, my Lord, if it ain't Mr. Marty.

147
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,974
- Hi, Mrs. Yao.
- Oh, come on in, child.

148
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:23,061
Oh, Mr. Senior's down at the docks
trying to scare up some catfish.

149
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,605
He's still making you talk like that?

150
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,942
Yup. He pays me an extra 50 bucks a week.

151
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,152
Says it reminds him of the good old days.

152
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,363
- He can be an old coot.
- Yeah.

153
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,949
Well, hey, your daddy down by the lake...

154
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,617
...fishing for some catfish to fry up.

155
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,704
Mm, Lordy, that sounds good.

156
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,414
Catfish.

157
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,296
- Marty, you stack of cock rings.
- Stop! Ha, ha!

158
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,799
- Mouthful of pubes.
- Don't tickle. Stop tickling me! Stop tickling me!

159
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,093
- Full revenge, man.
- Stop! Stop tickling me!

160
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,597
I'm sorry, brother. Ha, ha. Oh, man.

161
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,515
You should see the look on your stupid face.

162
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,144
Ah. It's good to see you, brother.
Daddy got a little surprise for you.

163
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,105
- Do you know what it is?
- Yeah. But I ain't gonna tell you, dick sweat.

164
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,065
- Bam! Ha, ha.
- Ow!

165
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,319
- It's still funny.
- Come on. Let's not keep Daddy waiting.

166
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,239
Okay. Hey, Daddy.

167
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,833
Now, listen up.

168
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,211
Glenn and Wade Motch called this morning.
You know the Motch brothers?

169
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,799
And they feel there's an opening
to challenge Cam Brady for congressman.

170
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,428
And, well...

171
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,597
...believe it or not...

172
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,767
...they want you to run for office.

173
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,480
Dad, that is like the greatest....

174
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,693
This is like the greatest news I've ever heard.
I can't believe this.

175
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,155
All these years I've been begging you
to let me get into politics...

176
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,740
...and right now here it is.

177
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,952
I didn't even know they knew who I was.
Motch brothers.

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,996
Well, I'll tell you this.

179
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,668
I'll make you proud. I will.

180
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,296
I'll make you-- I'll make you real proud.

181
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,342
I'd say there's mathematically zero chance
of that happening.

182
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,594
Your brother Tripp is a bull's-eye.

183
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,306
But you look like Richard Simmons
just crapped out a goddamn hobbit.

184
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:28,436
Dad, if you're still holding a grudge
because I wore Crocs to Mom's funeral...

185
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,232
...like I've told you a thousand times,
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,068
Mom would've wanted it that way.
She was casual.

187
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,195
I don't even know what to think.

188
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,280
I got so many thoughts
running through my mind...

189
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,743
...about what I can do for the district
and for the town, for the people of Hammond.

190
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,163
Give them a voice.
Put them in the right direction.

191
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,290
I mean, it's a mess out there.

192
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,294
Son, it's no secret
we've never enjoyed each other's company.

193
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,005
You can be so bleak sometimes, Dad.

194
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,215
Hmm.

195
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,053
Did you ever get that calendar I sent
of those animals dressed in human clothing?

196
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,014
I was looking at mine yesterday
because I bought one for myself...

197
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,767
...and it had a giraffe in high heels.

198
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,562
And I thought to myself,
"Who thinks of this stuff?"

199
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,355
I laughed so hard.

200
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,942
I thought it was super cute.
A giraffe is tall enough as is.

201
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,778
Then somebody thought,
"Let's put a giraffe in high heels.

202
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,281
Maybe add a belt.
There was a little bow on him."

203
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,409
Boy, you really are a sad little fucker,
aren't you?

204
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,826
This is the 14th district of
North Carolina and the city of Hammond.

205
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,830
We are acquiring massive parcels of real estate
under a shell corporation...

206
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,124
...so we can reopen three large factories.

207
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,834
Ostensibly, we own this district.

208
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,421
We think we can operate at the same regulatory
and wage levels as China...

209
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,590
...and eliminate shipping costs.

210
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,009
And your government will cooperate?

211
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,012
We also own
the most important resource of all:

212
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,680
a willing candidate.

213
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,643
Candidate. Your elections are unpredictable.

214
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,271
Mr. Zheng, there's something
you need to know about American politics.

215
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,817
When you've got the money,
nothing is unpredictable.

216
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,531
Sometimes democracy moves
with the stroke of a pen...

217
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,243
...and tonight Cam Brady
will win his fifth term in Congress...

218
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,829
...simply by registering for the ballot.

219
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,289
That's the perks of running unopposed.

220
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,085
- Check it out. It's a picture of my dick.
- Oh, come on.

221
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,463
I shaved my pubic hair to look
like a 19th-century handlebar mustache.

222
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,383
- Man, put that away, will you?
- I'm gonna tweet it to Shana.

223
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,677
- Cam, don't do that, please.
- Too late.

224
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,846
I CC'd you. Heh.

225
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,806
- I don't wanna see it.
- You're welcome.

226
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:15,103
Next up, we have ballot confirmation
of Camden Brady, congressman.

227
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,312
Thank you, Carl.

228
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,940
- Let's get this bad boy signed.
- Let's do it.

229
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,202
I couldn't tell what was going on.
I thought the thing was locked.

230
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,290
What the hell is this?

231
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,586
- Hey, Becky.
- Hi.

232
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:48,720
Hello.
My name is Marty Sylvester Huggins...

233
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,809
...and I'm here today to formally announce
my candidacy on the Republican ticket...

234
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,937
...for the 14th district for congressman.

235
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:03,985
I have, uh, my check and my application
and my birth certificate all right here if you....

236
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,279
Wait, what--? Hold on. Hold on.
What's going on here?

237
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,783
Hold on a second, Cam.
Let me take a look at this.

238
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,661
All his paperwork is here.

239
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,498
Marty Huggins is officially on the ballot...

240
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,834
- ...running for congressional representative...
- What?

241
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,961
...of the 14th district of North Carolina.

242
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,963
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, come on, Carl.

243
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,591
- Is this some kind ofjoke?
- Come on, Carl.

244
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,551
They're gonna wanna get to know you...

245
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,887
...now that you're challenging
our congressman.

246
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,889
How do you expect to do that?

247
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,562
- Uh, say that again.
- That's Marty Huggins.

248
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,899
You know, back in fourth grade,
they used to call him Tickle Shits...

249
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,735
...because all you had to do was tickle him
and he'd shit his pants.

250
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,154
- Oh, I remember that name.
- Mm-hm.

251
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,615
I'm Marty Huggins, and I approve this message.

252
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,533
- I've always wanted to say that.
- Heh.

253
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,164
What the hell?

254
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,624
I can't seem to--

255
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,626
- Push the door.
- Yeah, you gonna push.

256
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,420
Push it? Push it real good?

257
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:08,161
Breaking news out of North Carolina.

258
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:09,872
Democratic incumbent Cam Brady...

259
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,041
...getting a run for his money
by newcomer Marty Huggins.

260
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:16,295
Early rumors have billionaire industrialists
the Motch brothers...

261
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:18,547
...financing a PAC supporting Huggins.

262
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:23,302
And with a thin majority in the House,
this race could be hugely important.

263
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:27,264
You know, baby, I've been thinking.
I don't like this.

264
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:31,226
Why does a Marty Huggins
come out of nowhere and decide to run?

265
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,730
Baby, I'm a thoroughbred.
I'm gonna smoke that clown.

266
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:39,109
Kids, put your headphones in.
About to use TV mature words.

267
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:41,695
You know I love it
when you get all bitchy and wild.

268
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:46,241
You listen to me,
you dick dragging around a body.

269
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,328
Marty Huggins' daddy is Raymond Huggins.

270
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,622
He was Jesse Helms' campaign manager
for six terms.

271
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,374
- Mm-hm.
- He's got fucking juice. What have you got?

272
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,878
A mistress with a GED and a 9-year-old son.

273
00:16:58,463 --> 00:16:59,755
She's got a kid?

274
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:06,261
Ass and titties, ass and titties
And big booty bitches

275
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:11,141
Ass and titties, ass and titties
Ass and titties

276
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,977
Last election,
Newsweek mentioned you as a possible VP.

277
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:16,605
- I want that VP nod, Cam.
- Okay.

278
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:21,068
I wanna be second lady.
And what are you doing to make that happen?

279
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:25,906
You're grinding your hairy crescent roll against
any piece of ass that flashes you a smile.

280
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,408
None of that was my fault. I was powerless.

281
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:34,122
I was plied with copious amounts
of Red Bull, Jell-O shots...

282
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,499
...and Goldschläger.

283
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,377
Remember Dr. Jenkins,
he thought I had Crohn's disease.

284
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:41,505
There were flakes of 24-karat gold
in my stool for about a month.

285
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:46,259
I crapped gold.

286
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,471
Was the nicest thing.

287
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,974
- Just got a call from, uh, Cam Brady...
- Oh.

288
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:55,811
...saying that, uh, he invited me
to something called a civility brunch.

289
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,020
Oh.

290
00:17:57,188 --> 00:18:00,023
Which I think is just a chance for us
to share a meal together...

291
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:02,359
...and talk about the campaign
and its issues...

292
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:05,278
...and make sure
that everything's gonna be civil, you know?

293
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:09,408
That's a lovely idea, Marty.
We're all so proud of you.

294
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:13,745
I knew one day
your dad would realize your true potential.

295
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:18,000
Um, boys, put down your utensils.
I wanna talk to you about something real quick.

296
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,461
I wanted to take this time...

297
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:25,590
...to say that we're gonna be under
a lot of media scrutiny.

298
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,720
So if there's anything
that you wanna talk about...

299
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:32,055
...any kind of secrets...

300
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,891
...or stories or fibs...

301
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:38,770
...now's the time to put it on the table, okay?

302
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:41,857
And if you tell me,
if you tell me and your mom...

303
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,233
...we're not gonna be mad.

304
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:48,989
I said the Lord's name in vain at school.

305
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:52,075
Mm-hm.

306
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:00,542
Well, I said I wasn't gonna get angry,
and I'm not angry.

307
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,877
Okay. Good.

308
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:07,007
I went to the petting zoo
and I let the goat lick my penis.

309
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:11,136
What? What--?

310
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:15,140
- Now, that I have a--
- Now, honey.

311
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,976
Now, you promised
you wouldn't get mad, okay?

312
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:20,312
They're just-- They're being honest.

313
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,066
Okay. Maybe that's-- Hopefully, that's it.

314
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,694
I had a beer with the old biker man
at the end of the street...

315
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,363
...and he let me touch his old lady's titty.

316
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:33,992
- Oh, God.
- Ugh. "Breast."

317
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,580
I go to the mall and hide in a stairwell
and take photos up women's skirts.

318
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:42,417
I have a whole book of cooter shots
under my bed.

319
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,923
One time I put a firefly in my butthole.

320
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:51,718
- Why?
- To make my farts glow.

321
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,512
Oh, God.

322
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,976
I shaved the dog and glued the hair
to my nut sac so I'd look like a grown man.

323
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,104
Oh, God.

324
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:05,816
I touch myself to Drew Carey
on The Price Is Right.

325
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:06,983
God.

326
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,027
Okay, that's enough. Stop, please.

327
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,532
I wanna thank you all for coming here today.

328
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:18,453
Events like this give us an opportunity
to show Washington, D.C...

329
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:22,582
...that we're not gonna stand for the
mudslinging that's tearing this country apart.

330
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,917
Support our troops.

331
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,794
- Yes.
- Yeah.

332
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:30,132
And with that, I would like to, uh,
take this time...

333
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,636
...to introduce my opponent and, uh,
my friend, Marty Huggins.

334
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:36,221
Marty?

335
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:40,976
Thank you so much.

336
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:45,063
Thank you, uh, Cam. Thank you, uh--
Thank you everybody.

337
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:50,318
Well, I'm a little nervous. Heh.
I'll be honest with you. Um....

338
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:53,655
My dad always told me two things
about giving speeches.

339
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:57,075
One, never say anything bad
about the Jews...

340
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:00,412
...and two, tell an interesting story.

341
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,663
I have two pugs.

342
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:05,000
One's named Poundcake
and one's named Muffins.

343
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:06,585
Good Lord.

344
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:10,297
Anyway, Poundcake loves
to get underneath the sofa.

345
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,882
And I know exactly why.

346
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,801
Because my wife leaves Milky Ways
underneath the sofa...

347
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:16,428
...with Hamburger Helper on it.

348
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:20,515
And Muffins is always yapping at him,
like, "Don't go underneath the sofa."

349
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:21,850
And Poundcake barks back:

350
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:24,477
"I am under the sofa,
and I'm having a good time."

351
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:26,521
And they look at me like, "What?"

352
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:29,274
The other one's looking at the other one,
going, "What?"

353
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:31,610
Then I walk in like,
"What are y'all two doing?"

354
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:33,528
But every day, it's the same thing.

355
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:37,324
Just barking about one of them
being underneath the sofa.

356
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,953
- That's-- And that's my story.
- All right.

357
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,541
Thank you very much.

358
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:48,793
Thank you, Marty.

359
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:50,837
Have a seat.

360
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:54,049
I am sorry. Where are my manners?
I forgot Marty's bio.

361
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:55,467
Didn't know I had a bio.

362
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:57,636
Mitch, if you'd go ahead and kill the lights.

363
00:21:57,803 --> 00:21:59,930
If we could draw those curtains, thank you.

364
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:01,765
Little presentation.

365
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:06,102
Today we are here
to meet Martin Sylvester Huggins...

366
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,438
...who was born right here in 1972.

367
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:12,651
As a boy, Marty attended camp
for weight loss and emotional stability.

368
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:19,115
In high school, he was part
of an all-male a cappella group, Dude Ranch.

369
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,201
At 25, he met the love of his life.

370
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:24,829
She proposed to him six times
before he said yes.

371
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:26,539
Together, they have two boys...

372
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:30,252
...and two pugs,
which, keep in mind, are Chinese.

373
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:31,962
They're Chinese dogs.

374
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,800
And currently Marty Huggins
works out at Curves...

375
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:40,303
...which is a workout facility
for plus-size women.

376
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,601
Anyway, don't you find that interesting
to learn about Marty Huggins?

377
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,687
That's my opponent, Marty Huggins.

378
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:53,316
Eat up, everyone. Enjoy.

379
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:59,114
Welcome to the fucking show.

380
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,794
Okay, Marty, you're not gonna cry.

381
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:17,090
Hey. Get some American dogs, you Commie!

382
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:20,302
- They're not Communist dogs.
- Drive.

383
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,806
Move the car. Stab and steer. Let's go.

384
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:27,183
- Who are you?
- Tim Wattley.

385
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,353
Motch brothers sent me.
I'm your campaign manager.

386
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:33,148
I'm here to make you not suck.

387
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:37,319
Now put this shit bucket in gear.

388
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:51,750
- What's this all about, Mr. Wattley?
- Your life as you know it is over.

389
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,836
Your campaign headquarters
are being furnished and staffed...

390
00:23:55,004 --> 00:23:58,840
...and the Motch brothers have put $1 million
into your political action committee.

391
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:01,676
But these are my things.
I mean, this is my doily collection.

392
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:05,972
- And that's my sign.
- From now on, you don't own pugs.

393
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,059
You own a chocolate Lab and a
golden retriever, two highest-polling dogs.

394
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:11,811
One of them will be named Sergeant,
the other Scout.

395
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:14,731
They will wear bandanas.

396
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:15,940
Sit.

397
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:18,318
What about my pugs?

398
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:21,154
- Have them put down humanely.
- Coming through.

399
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:22,864
No. That cannot stay there.

400
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:26,701
You wanna put a live deer in the backyard, fine,
but I don't want dead things--

401
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,204
No. You cannot have guns in here.
Are you crazy?

402
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:32,916
Dylan is prone to intense bouts of violence.

403
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:36,836
Marty. Marty, they just let themselves in.
I tried to stop them.

404
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:39,547
They want me to cut my hair
like Katie Couric.

405
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:41,424
I want a Bible on this end table...

406
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:45,220
...and an oil painting of an eagle
over this fireplace, stat.

407
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:48,429
We have 49 days...

408
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:52,516
...before this district of 700,000 people
decides if they like you or not.

409
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:55,602
Right now, your likability is at 26 percent.

410
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,690
The focus group words
that come up about you are "odd"...

411
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,443
..."clammy," "probably Serbian."

412
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,404
- That's an old one.
- "He looks like the Travelocity gnome."

413
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:06,613
What?

414
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:11,034
If you really wanna help this district,
the first thing you have to do, Marty, is win.

415
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:15,789
I do wanna help the district. I love my home.
It's just all happening so fast.

416
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:20,586
Listen, I think Cam Brady can be beaten.
But I don't believe you believe that.

417
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,962
You know what?

418
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,049
I'm just gonna call your dad
and tell him you don't have the rocks for this.

419
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:27,676
Hey.

420
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:29,928
You put your phone away, Mr. Wattley.

421
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:34,224
This might be hard for you to believe,
but this dog has a ton of fight in him.

422
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,434
A ton of fight.

423
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:40,189
And when I get a scent, I hunt, brother.
I hunt all day long.

424
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:42,816
So don't you ever insinuate anything
like that again.

425
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,741
Call me Tim.

426
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:53,452
Complete makeover, head to toe.

427
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,289
No, no, no, not the pink one.
Let me have a black one.

428
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:00,167
It looks like that Precious girl's panties.

429
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:03,420
Younger, stronger, smarter.

430
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:06,715
Hit him again.

431
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:10,135
Oh! Don't do that, it tickles, okay?

432
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:19,394
Why don't you clean this crap up off the beach?
Keep the change.

433
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:22,189
Like Burt. Goddamn it.

434
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:24,191
Why don't you clean this crap up
off the beach?

435
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,818
- Again.
- Why don't you clean this crap up off the beach?

436
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,613
- Get rid of this.
- That's where I keep my things.

437
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:32,199
No, up. I need you up, like this.
See the difference?

438
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:34,535
- Yeah.
- Here. Watch me. Up. Up.

439
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:37,829
Swag. There you go. Like a man.

440
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:56,218
Sassy salesman sold me Sicilian sausages.

441
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:59,096
Keep it simple
and direct questions to the talking points.

442
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:02,641
- My boy Spanx are too tight.
- They're supposed to be. Now suck in.

443
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,769
When you meet Cam at center stage,
shake hands but don't let go.

444
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:09,857
Pull him close, maintain a smile,
and then lay some trash talk on him.

445
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,192
- Yeah.
- Set the tone.

446
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,484
Right.

447
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:16,488
- You jacked?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm jacked, yeah.

448
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,493
- Now you're jacked.
- Now I'm jacked. Okay.

449
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:27,075
Good evening, everyone.
Please welcome candidate Marty Huggins...

450
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,160
...and Congressman Cam Brady.

451
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,124
Yeah, baby. Looking good, baby.

452
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:39,253
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

453
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:43,466
Hate to break it to you, friend,
but your balloon's getting ready to pop.

454
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:46,094
And that balloon's full
of your own butt toots.

455
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:48,137
Are you trying to trash-talk me?

456
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:51,974
Might wanna decide whether
you're gonna buy toilet paper or aftershave.

457
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:54,602
- Because your face is like a butt.
- Oh, my God.

458
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,855
- You don't know how to trash-talk, do you?
- I do know how to.

459
00:27:58,023 --> 00:28:00,733
- Let me give you some trash talk, okay?
- Mm-hm.

460
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:04,320
You know what the difference between
your mama and a washing machine is?

461
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:06,239
When I dump a load in a machine...

462
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:08,866
...machine doesn't follow me around
for three weeks.

463
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,451
Now you go.

464
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:16,290
You should take a bath in a toilet.
I just wanna do the debate.

465
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,667
No. Now I go.

466
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:20,086
You're such a little turd...

467
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:23,423
...that when you sit in sand,
cats try to bury you.

468
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,216
You have a very vulgar mouth.

469
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:29,095
- Please let go of my hand.
- I want you to reach down and touch my nuts.

470
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,305
- Stop.
- That's what nuts feel like. Touch it.

471
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,766
- I don't want to.
- Let me see if you got any.

472
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,102
Sirs. Sirs, we'd love to get started.

473
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:38,938
- I'd love to start.
- Me too.

474
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:50,199
- Tim.
- Get him something to stand on.

475
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:53,578
Thank you.

476
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:56,205
Our first question will go to the incumbent.

477
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,083
How would you bring jobs back
to the 14th district?

478
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:02,253
That's a great question, Carl.
Thank you for asking it.

479
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:06,090
It's the first thing I think of
when I wake up in the morning...

480
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:09,260
...and it's the last thing I think of
when I go to bed.

481
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:14,015
Jobs in North Carolina mean what?
A strong North Carolina.

482
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:18,144
And a strong North Carolina
means a strong America.

483
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:20,730
And that, my friends,
is how we're gonna do it.

484
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:24,066
- All right.
- It's how we do, baby.

485
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:26,110
- Yeah.
- It's how we do.

486
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:27,945
You've got my vote, Cam.

487
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:32,825
Mr. Huggins,
you have one minute for a rebuttal.

488
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:34,494
Just like we rehearsed.

489
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:38,164
Cam Brady just gave you
the old D.C. Dip and Twirl.

490
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:40,082
Just danced around the question.

491
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:44,837
Well, I'm here to tell you, North Carolina,
that when it comes to jobs for my district...

492
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:47,089
...Martin Huggins doesn't dance.

493
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:51,177
He rolls up his sleeves,
puts his sandwich in his lunch pail...

494
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:53,971
...and brings jobs to the Tar Heel State.

495
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,765
- Yes!
- Yes!

496
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:01,729
What the hell?

497
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,151
Let's bring back corporations
to North Carolina.

498
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,278
Let's clean up D.C.

499
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:13,491
And bring your brooms, because it's a mess.

500
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:28,130
There was a clear winner in the first debate.
Marty Huggins simply electrified this crowd.

501
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:31,133
Two hours ago,
this congressional race was dead on arrival.

502
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:34,762
- That was real nice, Marty.
- I was jacked. I don't know what I was saying.

503
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,557
- Doesn't matter. You killed it.
- Marty. Here he is.

504
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:40,059
Rumpelscrotskin,
you been doing so good up there.

505
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:41,519
Who did this to you?

506
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:43,855
You could not have been doing this
on your own.

507
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:46,190
Oh. I want you to meet Becky.
Becky, this is Marty.

508
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:48,401
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Becky.

509
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:49,777
Wow, you were great.

510
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,655
- I thought you were married to Mindy.
- I am. This is Becky.

511
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:55,324
Your brother said I could dance
in your campaign video.

512
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:59,036
I have a lot of experience.
I worked for Jumbo's and Crazy Girls.

513
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:01,330
- Fantastic.
- Well, well, well. Tim Wattley.

514
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:05,626
- You really outdone yourself this time.
- Gentlemen. Very spirited debate.

515
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,169
- Hey, Cam.
- Hey, Becky.

516
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:08,379
Hey, Becky.

517
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:11,257
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we've got some babies to kiss.

518
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:12,800
Okay.

519
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,969
It was like I was another person,
you know?

520
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,930
I actually have a baby I need to kiss
right down there.

521
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:22,184
- What's the matter with him?
- This is my district. That's my baby.

522
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:25,146
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, please.

523
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,858
Oh. Oh, you don't take a swing at my hair.

524
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,530
You little fucker.

525
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:50,463
No!

526
00:31:55,469 --> 00:31:57,136
Oh, shit.

527
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:08,606
Bizarre news coming out of the 14th district
congressional race in North Carolina.

528
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:14,153
Now, get this: Cam Brady,
four-time congressman, punched a baby.

529
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:17,740
This is likely to hurt him
with the Christian right, social conservatives.

530
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:20,701
Really any group
that opposes baby-punching.

531
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:23,120
Baby is fine, and he said he punches
like a 3-year-old.

532
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:26,916
After Cam Brady's baby-punching incident...

533
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:30,419
...Marty Huggins has jumped 11 points
in the polls.

534
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:34,882
That is totally taken out of context.

535
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,343
Well, not really.
I mean, you punched that baby.

536
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,428
Is anyone asking how my hand feels...

537
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:43,683
...after punching that iron-like jaw
of that baby?

538
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,519
- How is your hand?
- I can't even make a fist.

539
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:49,522
I tell you right now, though,
I'm so angered by seeing that...

540
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,191
...I wish I could go out
and punch that baby again.

541
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:55,736
We're getting killed. You're the
best campaign-ad guy in the business.

542
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:59,156
I got something that's gonna help.
We tried to take a negative...

543
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:03,369
...okay, your recent scandals,
and show the positive side of that negative.

544
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:05,621
Take a look.

545
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,915
Cam Brady has come under fire...

546
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,210
...for getting it on with this woman,
Shana St. Croix...

547
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:15,464
...a former professional cheerleader
and part-time aerobics instructor...

548
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:16,966
...who can do this.

549
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,219
And this.

550
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:22,972
- Yes, she can.
- Okay.

551
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,433
Shouldn't our leaders be men we admire?

552
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,603
We can go into all the great things Cam's done
as a congressman...

553
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:32,481
...or we can just show some more
of this little honey.

554
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,901
Vote for Cam Brady...

555
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:40,072
...a real American man.

556
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:43,409
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Oh, I fucking love it.

557
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,954
Shana's gonna love it too.
She looks so hot in it.

558
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:48,164
Jesus, Cam.

559
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:51,834
Well, let me tell you something.
This spot tested through the roof with men.

560
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:53,919
- I knew it.
- Now, here's the downside.

561
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:55,421
Horrible numbers with women.

562
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:57,006
- You don't say.
- Horrible?

563
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:59,884
- Yeah, that's not a surprise to me.
- Worst we've ever seen.

564
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,135
- You're kidding me.
- No.

565
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:05,306
- "Worst" as in...?
- In the history of numbers.

566
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:06,807
Yeah, that's lower than I thought.

567
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:11,312
Okay, now, this is a spot to raise some
important questions in the minds of voters.

568
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,981
We're calling it "Homeland Insecurity."

569
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:15,524
- Ha, ha.
- Check it out.

570
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:17,902
Al-Qaeda. The Taliban.

571
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,820
I hate those guys.

572
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:22,990
One thing unites all of them
in their blood pacts:

573
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,742
facial hair.

574
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,287
There's someone else, North Carolina,
that has facial hair:

575
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:29,830
Marty Huggins.

576
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:31,040
- Right.
- Right?

577
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,375
Why doesn't Marty Huggins
answer the question?

578
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:35,336
Is he a Taliban or an al Qaeda?

579
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:36,587
Are you kidding me?

580
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,423
Why does Marty Huggins
refuse to take a lie-detector test?

581
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,633
Why won't he?

582
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:43,260
And where exactly
was Marty Huggins on 9/11?

583
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:44,762
- Bingo.
- Okay.

584
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,890
There's just too many questions.

585
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:51,811
Boy, that is solid too. Real solid.

586
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:53,813
- Yes.
- Uh, Rick, let me ask you this.

587
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,734
Has there been any sort of correlation
between Huggins and, heh, Islamic radicals?

588
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,861
- I mean, at all?
- None that I know of.

589
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:03,781
What-- I think what Rick's trying
to illustrate with that...

590
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:07,159
...is there's still a heck of a lot of questions
about this guy.

591
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:09,411
- Spot on.
- How are we gonna pay for these?

592
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:13,541
We're gonna run them both.
Let's turn the heat up on Mr. Marty Huggins.

593
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:19,088
Gentlemen, we're really counting
on your support.

594
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:25,094
The guys at Goldman Sachs are prepared
to donate $500,000 to your super PAC.

595
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:28,305
Provided, of course,
you pick up the phone any time we call.

596
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:29,890
That's not gonna be a problem.

597
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:32,685
If you give us a million, hell,
I'll let you sleep with my wife.

598
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:39,567
- And for 1 .5, I'll throw in my cousin.
- I don't know if you want her cousin.

599
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:40,985
That might drive the price down.

600
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:42,903
- No, she lost weight.
- Oh.

601
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:46,031
Mrs. Brady, are you playing footsie
with me under the table?

602
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,324
Nope, that's me.

603
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,412
He's a switch-hitter.

604
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:53,330
- Oh, no.
- No, no.

605
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:58,544
No. I did once. I did once, in college. Yes.
Which we've never talked about.

606
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,922
It goes without saying,
this lunch never happened.

607
00:36:06,428 --> 00:36:08,637
This question is for the congressman.

608
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:14,268
Why have you consistently voted
against campaign-finance reform?

609
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:15,477
Yeah.

610
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,147
We all know big money
is running this country.

611
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:20,608
- That's right.
- Do they run you?

612
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,651
Yeah!

613
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:24,403
Hold on.

614
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:29,033
Why don't we stop all the softball questions
and ask some real questions, okay?

615
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:32,661
Like why won't Marty Huggins here
take a lie-detector test?

616
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,663
- Yeah. Take the test.
- Yeah.

617
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:37,875
- Yeah.
- Is he an al Qaeda? Is he a Taliban?

618
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:40,169
Congressman, please.

619
00:36:40,337 --> 00:36:43,464
I've seen a mustache like that before,
and you know who wore it?

620
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:45,007
Saddam Hussein.

621
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:49,845
And I believe we never caught two of his sons,
Uday and Falafel.

622
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:54,016
I am not beholden to
Cam Brady's accusations.

623
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:55,684
I am beholden to only one man...

624
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:58,562
...and that is the greatest American
that has ever lived:

625
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,150
Jesus Christ.
Who happened to have a mustache.

626
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,071
There you go, Marty. Amen, Marty.
Jesus loves you, Marty.

627
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:09,448
Cam Brady, is it true...

628
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:12,910
...that you have not been to church
in over nine months?

629
00:37:13,078 --> 00:37:16,455
- Good question.
- First of all, my relationship to God...

630
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:19,708
...is not measured by taking attendance.

631
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:22,211
Hallelujah.

632
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:26,465
Well, as a Christian, I guess that it would
be easy for you to recite the Lord's Prayer.

633
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:30,010
Is that what we're resorting to here?
Gestapo tactics?

634
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:31,428
I would like to hear that.

635
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,847
Would you like to hear him
say the Lord's Prayer?

636
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:37,601
- You heard the man.
- Fine, I'm happy to. Ahem.

637
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,771
If the media wouldn't mind
turning off their recording devices...

638
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:44,733
...and closing their eyes as well,
we can start with the Lord's Prayer.

639
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:46,986
Our father...

640
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:50,155
...Art, who is up in heaven...

641
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:52,324
...aloe vera be thy name....

642
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,287
- Thy. Thy.
- The thigh.

643
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:59,039
Thy kingdom....

644
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:01,542
Thy kingdom come.

645
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:03,210
The magic kingdom.

646
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:05,045
As it is on earth...

647
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,423
...in a helicopter.

648
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,967
Give us this day our daily...

649
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:13,095
...pizza and let us digest it.

650
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,389
Forgive us....

651
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:17,975
Pass.

652
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:23,480
Forgive our passes we commit sometimes
on womenfolk...

653
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:28,027
...with their dresses that are too tight.
Like, that's a nice caboose you got on your--

654
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:31,739
You know what?
That's not part of it, I know that.

655
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:33,991
Keep your heads bowed, please.

656
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,119
Forgive us for trespassing...

657
00:38:37,287 --> 00:38:39,705
...and do not lead us to the Temptations.

658
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:42,791
Because we are tired of them
and their dancing.

659
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:48,047
And deliver us from evil
with your mighty sword and falcon...

660
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:49,923
...forever and ever and ever. Amen.

661
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:51,925
Amen.

662
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:54,178
- That wasn't right.
- He doesn't know it.

663
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:56,930
- He does not know the Lord's Prayer.
- It's pretty close.

664
00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:58,474
I know the essence.

665
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:03,812
I think we can all agree.
Cam Brady, he's a mess.

666
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,524
All I know, if you say, "It's a mess,"
you don't support our troops.

667
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:10,110
Cam Brady '012.
I was the last one to say something.

668
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:11,320
Yeah, baby.

669
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:16,367
Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty!

670
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:20,662
You want a holy war, little man?
You got one.

671
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:29,171
- Every day
- Every day would be Sunday

672
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:32,132
Thank you for having me
at your congregation.

673
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,388
First time I've worn a Yamaha. It fits nicely.
How do you say "It's a mess" in Hebrew?

674
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:39,807
Donkey Kong?

675
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,686
I have the faith in me.

676
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:46,230
- Hallelujah.
- Yeah. All right.

677
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:48,982
Mitch, I could do this forever.
These snakes love me.

678
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,655
Goddamn it. Fucking son of a fuck.

679
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:58,200
Oh, the fucking cunt-ass serpent bit me!

680
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:04,164
Oh, jam a lit sparkler up my dickhole.
That is painful.

681
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:08,043
Staple my tits to my balls
and then do sit-ups. It hurts.

682
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:12,047
Sir, words like that
have never been spoken in this room.

683
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:15,634
But the fucker bit me.
I'm sorry, the snake bit me.

684
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:19,805
- Which means you don't have the faith of God.
- Yeah-- Yes, I do.

685
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:24,560
God has removed the venom from my blood
and the blasphemy from my heart.

686
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,855
- It's a miracle.
- It's a miracle.

687
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:30,149
Hallelujah.

688
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:35,779
- I can't feel anything. It's F'd up.
- Hey, you okay?

689
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,033
Hey, Cam. Come on, we gotta go.

690
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:43,745
I feel like I'm maintaining.
Am I maintaining, Mitch?

691
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:48,000
- No, you're not. You look horrible. Come on.
- Let's get a couple of burritos.

692
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:57,551
Oh, my God.

693
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,115
Now, a poll conducted this afternoon
shows the congressman...

694
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:10,077
...getting a two-point bump from the incident.

695
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:13,455
Why were you handling dangerous
snakes without a professional present?

696
00:41:13,623 --> 00:41:14,665
For the poops.

697
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:16,375
Mitzi, look at this.

698
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:19,044
Cam Brady got a two-point bump out of a--

699
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:23,799
- I was watching that.
- No, Marty. We have to talk.

700
00:41:23,966 --> 00:41:26,802
You're never home,
and when you are, it's all politics.

701
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:29,262
Gosh, I am so flustered.

702
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,848
Everybody's got me
running every which way but loose.

703
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:36,019
I just wanna get back to the basics.
I miss you.

704
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:40,232
Let's just have one night like we used to.

705
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,901
No Tim Wattley.

706
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:44,945
Just the family.

707
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:47,406
That sounds like a little slice of heaven.

708
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:16,309
What the fuck is going on in here?

709
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:20,272
You kids go upstairs,
wash your filthy faces, and get to bed.

710
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,481
Hurry up!

711
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:23,817
Are you gonna let him
talk to our children that way?

712
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:26,945
- Let me handle this.
- I know you're Marty's wife, but I swear...

713
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:28,697
...get out before I lose my shit.

714
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:30,449
- Marty.
- Now, Mr. Wattley.

715
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:35,495
Marty, I need you kicking Cam's balls in
on a daily basis.

716
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:40,333
And I come here and find you playing
Hee Haw with the fuck-around gang.

717
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:44,629
- Oh, he's drunk. You're drunk.
- Yeah, I'm a little lit. So what?

718
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:48,717
You have an opportunity to win this thing.

719
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:52,137
Do you really think so?

720
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:56,266
You promised me this dog could hunt.

721
00:42:58,436 --> 00:43:00,479
Can you do that?

722
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:03,148
Yes, I can, Mr. Wattley.

723
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:07,319
That's my boy.

724
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:12,365
I think I'm gonna take the children
and go stay at my mother's for the night.

725
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:14,951
Mitzi, this will all be over
as soon as I win, okay?

726
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,286
I promise.

727
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:21,708
Just remember, Marty,
what you're giving up for what you're getting.

728
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:29,090
Come here.

729
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:31,968
Yeah?

730
00:43:33,638 --> 00:43:36,389
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Camo, what's going on?

731
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:39,893
Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know
that I'm running for class president.

732
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:43,772
Good for you. Come on in, have a seat.

733
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,275
So, uh, what are the issues you're gonna
run on? Figure that out yet?

734
00:43:47,443 --> 00:43:50,195
No, no, that's boring.
Nobody really cares about that.

735
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,823
But I did spread a rumor...

736
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,576
...that my opponent, Tommy Monahan,
may or may not have a vagina.

737
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,664
- That could work, yeah.
- It will work.

738
00:44:00,832 --> 00:44:04,084
Win at all costs, right, Dad?
You taught me that.

739
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:06,837
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Learned from the best.

740
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:14,594
These dreams go on when I close my eyes

741
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,388
Every sec--

742
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:22,769
Cam Brady.

743
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:25,105
What are you doing here? It's 11 :00 at night.

744
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:28,525
I know. But, uh-- But we need to talk.

745
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:31,438
What is this we have here?

746
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:36,568
It's a small-batch bourbon.
By-product of the prohibition days.

747
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,906
Mm. Oh, wow. Thank you. That is smooth.

748
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,326
- It's good.
- It's good, yeah.

749
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:50,165
- Ah.
- Well....

750
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:56,338
- Are they okay?
- What's that?

751
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:57,839
Your Chinese dogs.

752
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:02,844
Well, pugs were bred
with, uh, short snouts...

753
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:06,765
- Mm.
- ...so they could lock in and take down lions.

754
00:45:07,392 --> 00:45:09,935
I find that hard to believe. Heh.

755
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:12,813
You can Google it. It's worth a Google.

756
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:18,777
Marty, I was thinking we could
make this campaign a little more civil...

757
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:22,447
...if there were some way that you and I
could become friends.

758
00:45:22,615 --> 00:45:24,616
Well, I appreciate you saying that, Cam.

759
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:29,329
The meanness and the nastiness
needs to stop.

760
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:35,085
I mean, this race is for the people, isn't it?
It shouldn't be about us.

761
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:42,384
Do your dogs ever go to a different room?

762
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:45,554
- No, I like to have them nearby.
- Oh.

763
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:49,683
You know when I first got into politics?

764
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:52,352
The fifth grade. Heh.

765
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,689
Out on the playground,
there was this jaggedy old jungle gym.

766
00:45:57,233 --> 00:46:00,861
Rusty, sharp edges.
We used to call it Jim the Ripper.

767
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:03,614
It got me pretty good.

768
00:46:03,781 --> 00:46:06,992
Yeah, I remember that old jungle gym.

769
00:46:07,493 --> 00:46:09,161
Thank you.

770
00:46:09,912 --> 00:46:11,246
You're welcome.

771
00:46:11,414 --> 00:46:16,835
Well, in the fifth grade,
I ran for class president...

772
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:18,462
...under one promise:

773
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,799
to take down the jaggedy jungle gym.

774
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:26,178
And I won.

775
00:46:26,346 --> 00:46:28,722
Well, that's a heartwarming story, Cam.

776
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:34,853
Ah.

777
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:40,275
Thank you.

778
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:41,818
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

779
00:46:41,986 --> 00:46:43,779
We are--

780
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,156
We are definitely going to Cancún.

781
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,576
And you're not gonna pay for a thing.

782
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,453
- Bye, Marty.
- Heh.

783
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:53,789
- Hey, Cam?
- Yeah?

784
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:56,750
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you too.

785
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:58,043
Oh, man. Whew.

786
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:06,635
You know what to do, Marty.

787
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:12,849
Hammond Police.

788
00:47:13,017 --> 00:47:16,061
Yes, I'd like to report a drunk driver, please.

789
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:21,566
He's going to D-D.C. to be VP

790
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:22,818
Whoo!

791
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:24,486
Barracuda

792
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:30,659
Oh, fuck. Fuck me.

793
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:41,920
- In God we must.
- Sir, please get out of the vehicle.

794
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:43,880
You have a great night.

795
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:45,382
- Sir?
- Huh?

796
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,552
- Please get out of the vehicle.
- Get out of the-- You know what? Absolutely.

797
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,930
And thank you for doing your job.
I appreciate it.

798
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:56,268
Also, thank you for releasing me
upon my own recognizance.

799
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:01,648
Sir, have you been drinking?

800
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:04,651
Yes, I have.
I've had five or six small-batch bourbons.

801
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:07,487
That's a lot. I'm gonna have to ask you
to take a Breathalyzer test.

802
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:08,780
Mm-hm.

803
00:48:08,948 --> 00:48:12,284
We got a runner. Stop running!

804
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:19,332
- Try to catch me, Ranger Rick.
- Stop!

805
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:23,754
Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah.

806
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:25,046
Oh, whoo!

807
00:48:25,214 --> 00:48:27,132
- Chase.
- Stop the vehicle! Stop the vehicle!

808
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:08,029
I'm an American.

809
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:13,493
And I believe in American ingenuity
and hard work.

810
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:15,453
Unlike my friend here, Cam Brady...

811
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:18,289
...who believes that everyone should live
in Rainbow Land.

812
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,503
Douglas, I'd like to say one thing.
I'm an American too.

813
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:28,258
And I have no idea what he's referring to
as Rainbow Land, okay?

814
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:31,678
I'm referring to a 13-page doctrine...

815
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:34,806
...written by Camden Brady...

816
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:36,557
...called Rainbow Land.

817
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:39,185
That's something I wrote
in the second grade.

818
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:43,273
I think anybody that writes
about the redistribution of wealth...

819
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,192
...sounds like a communist to me.

820
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:48,403
- Am I right?
- Hold on.

821
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:53,700
It is the simple story of a teddy bear
giving a pot of gold to a leprechaun, okay?

822
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:57,078
- That's right.
- May I read from Page 7?

823
00:49:57,246 --> 00:49:58,705
Don't listen to him, Cam.

824
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:01,749
"Please come with me to Rainbow Land...

825
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:05,670
...where unicorns are made of fudge
and cotton candy...

826
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:07,588
...and everything is free."

827
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:11,175
It's a fictitious place.
Rainbow Land, it's fiction.

828
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:14,012
I guess we're all idiots
according to Cam Brady.

829
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:18,224
- I didn't say that. I did not say that.
- Hey! Hey!

830
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:21,185
I do not want to live in Rainbow Land...

831
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:24,731
...and you can't make me live
in Rainbow Land.

832
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,941
- Yeah.
- This is America.

833
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:29,152
You do not have to live in Rainbow Land.

834
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,904
- You can go to Rainbow Land.
- It does not exist.

835
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:35,366
It's a fictitious place. I was 8.
It's from a child's imagination.

836
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:38,453
- It's right here in his communist manifesto.
- Oh, come on.

837
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,622
- I won't go to Rainbow Land.
- Sit down.

838
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:45,960
I said, sit the fuck down. It doesn't exist.

839
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,546
Go back to where you're from, dick.

840
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:50,631
It's not a real place!

841
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:54,010
How many times do I gotta say it?
It's not real!

842
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,804
- What is he pointing at?
- Don't worry.

843
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:58,723
- Is he pointing at me?
- He sure the fuck is.

844
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:01,684
- Cam, you're a communist.
- He's talking shit about me again?

845
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:03,519
- You pointing at me?
- What?

846
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:05,521
- You pointing at me? You talking to me?
- Huh?

847
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:08,024
- Fucking dickhead!
- What are you doing? Cam, no.

848
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:10,068
- What did you--?
- No. No!

849
00:51:14,198 --> 00:51:15,490
No, no, no!

850
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:21,454
Your nickname in school was Tickle Shits.
I'm gonna see if it's true.

851
00:51:21,622 --> 00:51:23,247
Don't you shit your pants, Marty.

852
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:24,832
- Don't! Ha, ha!
- Go for his hair.

853
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,627
- You do not touch the hair.
- Don't you touch my hair.

854
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:30,254
- It's a $900 haircut.
- Don't talk about that, Cam.

855
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:32,507
I'm gonna kill you.

856
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:46,396
Remember the politician that punched a baby?
Well, he's at it again.

857
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:49,982
He punched Uggie, the dog from
the Academy Award-winning film The Artist.

858
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,902
Marty Huggins is solidly ahead.

859
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,864
Rainbow Land is now number six
on Amazon.com.

860
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:00,628
Why would you do this?
You just killed the campaign.

861
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:03,297
You're five points down. You can't win this.

862
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:05,883
I told you, I don't truck with losers.

863
00:52:06,051 --> 00:52:08,970
Plus, I got offered a lobbying job in D.C.
for Motch brothers.

864
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:10,304
- The Motch brothers?
- Yup.

865
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:12,849
You know what they're trying to do.
Get you to leave me.

866
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:14,809
- You got your baton, baby?
- Yeah.

867
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:16,936
Come on, baby, we're a team.
You're my rock.

868
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,773
You're dragging me down, baby.

869
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:23,609
What if my poll numbers go up?
Will you come back?

870
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,530
I hate to do this to you, buddy,
but we got bigger problems.

871
00:52:29,158 --> 00:52:31,492
I think you need to see this.

872
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,496
Congressman
Cam Brady claims to be a family man.

873
00:52:35,664 --> 00:52:37,248
What a nice day we've had.

874
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,709
- Cam Jr.?
- Mm-hm.

875
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:43,212
- The batting cages, the water park.
- Must be a hidden-camera situation.

876
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,757
You were doing cannonballs.
You were good at those.

877
00:52:45,924 --> 00:52:48,468
- Yeah.
- Seeing any girls yet?

878
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:50,511
- What is he doing?
- Sort of.

879
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:54,098
Must be tough having your dad
not be around that much, you know?

880
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:56,809
What is he talking about?
I'm around too much.

881
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:58,186
I could be your dad.

882
00:53:00,105 --> 00:53:03,191
- You can call me "Dad."
- No.

883
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,068
- Go ahead, try.
- No, don't do it.

884
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:08,154
- No, I'm your daddy.
- Go ahead.

885
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:13,868
- Dad.
- Oh, shit.

886
00:53:14,036 --> 00:53:16,204
There you go. That wasn't bad.

887
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:21,918
I'm Marty Huggins,
and I regretfully approve this message.

888
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,378
Love you, Cam Jr.

889
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:29,258
Marty Huggins,
the father Cam Brady will never be.

890
00:53:30,427 --> 00:53:33,679
Just take it easy. All right?
Just take a deep breath.

891
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,808
Now, we ought to think about
how we gonna get back, okay?

892
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:39,727
But we can't let emotion
cloud our judgment, okay?

893
00:53:39,895 --> 00:53:42,980
We gotta think logically here.
Now, what do you wanna do?

894
00:53:43,148 --> 00:53:44,816
I'm gonna fuck his wife.

895
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:47,985
Great. No. No, you can't do that. No, no, no.

896
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:51,405
I'm gonna fuck his wife,
and I'm gonna go put it on television.

897
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:53,407
No. Okay, you definitely can't do that.

898
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:56,661
First part, maybe,
but the second part, definitely not.

899
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:57,995
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

900
00:53:58,163 --> 00:54:02,875
You get my son to call you "Daddy,"
I fuck your wife.

901
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:05,002
- That's the deal?
- That is the deal.

902
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,337
What are you pointing at?

903
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:10,007
- Got a book of bad ideas?
- I got a book of good ideas. That's the first one.

904
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,135
Get my son to call you "Daddy"...

905
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:16,264
...turn the page, it says, "Fuck your wife."

906
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:18,516
Okay, let's talk about this.

907
00:54:20,978 --> 00:54:23,312
Welcome back, everybody,
to The Price Is Right.

908
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,730
George Gray, who's next, please?

909
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,150
Coming.

910
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:34,115
Congressman Brady.

911
00:54:34,283 --> 00:54:37,368
Marty's down at the tourism office, so....

912
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:39,954
I really like your hair.

913
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:41,706
It's very Katie Couric.

914
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,333
Thank you.

915
00:54:45,878 --> 00:54:47,795
May I come in and use your phone?

916
00:54:51,508 --> 00:54:57,889
Cal Tjader. Best known
for starting the samba-salsa jazz craze.

917
00:54:58,056 --> 00:55:04,103
Yet sadly, was not recognized
for a Grammy for over 40 years.

918
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:11,235
I find it tragic when someone isn't recognized
for perfection.

919
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:14,280
That's very interesting.

920
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:16,407
Tell me something about you.

921
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:20,202
Oh, uh, well, I love owls.

922
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,538
I collect them, you know.
Not real ones, of course.

923
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:24,582
But I got some porcelain
or maybe china ones.

924
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:29,921
There's some pretty grumpy ones too
that kind of have those big eyebrows, like--

925
00:55:30,088 --> 00:55:32,381
Oh, God,
I know exactly what you're talking about.

926
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:34,759
- I'm gonna let these little fellas out.
- Oh.

927
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:37,720
Come on, little buddies. Come on.

928
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:43,476
Get out, you little fuckers.

929
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:47,313
They are tiny little munchkin butts,
aren't they?

930
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:50,149
They're Marty's dogs.
They don't listen to me.

931
00:55:50,692 --> 00:55:53,903
Well, I don't understand that,
because I find you fascinating.

932
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:55,529
Oh, thank you.

933
00:55:56,198 --> 00:55:58,950
Mitzi, I'm gonna cut to the chase.

934
00:56:00,535 --> 00:56:02,787
I've had feelings for you.

935
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:09,126
- Are we doing what I think we're doing?
- I don't know.

936
00:56:09,294 --> 00:56:13,589
I tell you right now, my heart is beating
like a phone book in a dryer...

937
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:17,885
...and I'm so afraid
of what's about to happen.

938
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:20,304
What's about to happen?

939
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:22,640
This.

940
00:56:29,856 --> 00:56:34,694
Ooh.

941
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:36,779
- Ooh!
- Oh.

942
00:56:36,947 --> 00:56:41,367
I want you to put my head in the freezer
while you do me from behind.

943
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:45,621
- Hold on, hold on. Isn't the freezer too high?
- I'll get a stool!

944
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:49,500
Easy. Easy, Mitzi. Easy.

945
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:52,795
The following commercial
is rated TV-MA for mature audiences.

946
00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:55,881
Marty Huggins can't even
take care of his own wife, so I did.

947
00:56:56,049 --> 00:56:58,259
- Whoo!
- That night, Marty's wife voted.

948
00:56:58,427 --> 00:57:01,971
- Multiple times.
- Good work. Attaboy. Whoo!

949
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,931
Whoo! Whoo!

950
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:06,517
- Getting juicy in here.
- Whoo!

951
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:08,853
Come on, this isn't a game.

952
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:13,274
I'm Cam Brady,
and I seductively approve this message.

953
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:19,321
- Boom. There it is. Let's get this out ASAP.
- Cam, you can't do that.

954
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:22,658
- Why? Because it wasn't your idea?
- No. No, because it's porn.

955
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:24,910
- I didn't sign up for this.
- Oh, really?

956
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:26,954
What did you sign up for, Mitch?

957
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:30,291
The Big Fat Pussy Who's Too Afraid
to Do What It Takes to Win Club?

958
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:32,585
You gotta calm down.
You're going crazy on me.

959
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:35,921
- I'm crazy because I refuse to lose?
- I think so.

960
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:38,132
Goddamn it, Mitch! Goddamn it!

961
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,010
My feet are taped to the bicycle on this one!

962
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:43,763
I will do anything it takes to win.

963
00:57:43,972 --> 00:57:46,223
- Hey, hey.
- Even if it means lying!

964
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:49,894
- Or physically hurting someone!
- Easy, easy, easy. Put that down.

965
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:53,606
Or branding myself with a coat hanger
in the shape of a V for "victory."

966
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:55,483
I get it. Okay, I'm sorry, everybody.

967
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,194
Even if it means listening to Metallica
in a sauna...

968
00:57:58,361 --> 00:57:59,779
He's a little stressed out.

969
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:02,615
...while I do push-ups
with a naked Shana on my back.

970
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,283
- Come on, man.
- Is that crazy?

971
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:06,160
- I think so.
- Do I seem crazy?

972
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:08,496
- Or are you the crazy one?
- You gotta stop it.

973
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:12,958
Okay, sit down.

974
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,797
Sit the fuck down right now. Okay.
Breathe. Just breathe, okay?

975
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,384
Now, what is going on with you?
This is getting out of hand.

976
00:58:22,552 --> 00:58:25,721
Okay, look. Here's the deal, Mitch.

977
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:29,100
- I did get a little crazy there.
- Yes, you did.

978
00:58:29,267 --> 00:58:32,686
But I gotta tell you,
this is what it's gonna take to win.

979
00:58:35,774 --> 00:58:40,402
Cam, I've been here for eight years with you,
by your side.

980
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,571
And we've done some great things.

981
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:45,449
But I don't know
what the hell's gotten into you.

982
00:58:45,617 --> 00:58:47,076
What?

983
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:51,288
And to be honest with you,
I'm pretty goddamn disappointed.

984
00:58:51,456 --> 00:58:53,165
I'm sorry.

985
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,751
Okay, well, get out of here. Go.

986
00:58:55,919 --> 00:58:57,920
- Anyone can do your job.
- Hey.

987
00:58:58,088 --> 00:58:59,505
Anyone.

988
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:06,679
- You. What's your name?
- Uh, Jason, sir.

989
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:11,058
I just started here. I'm an intern.
But I'm a poli sci major in college.

990
00:59:11,226 --> 00:59:14,228
Okay, well, guess what, Jason.
You're running my campaign.

991
00:59:14,396 --> 00:59:16,897
- Are you serious?
- Congratulations to Jason, everyone.

992
00:59:17,065 --> 00:59:19,400
- Nice round of applause.
- I got so many good ideas.

993
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:22,570
Did you know that our government,
we actually give tax breaks to companies...

994
00:59:22,737 --> 00:59:26,198
...that outsource jobs to other countries?
That's awful.

995
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:29,451
We've already lost 7 million jobs
since NAFTA, right?

996
00:59:29,619 --> 00:59:33,539
You get the fuck out of here.
You get the fuck out of here.

997
00:59:33,748 --> 00:59:37,877
I don't wanna hear that bullshit.
Hey, what did you major in in college?

998
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:40,004
- You!
- Uh, sports marketing.

999
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:44,466
Okay. You're running my campaign.
Take this down to the TV station.

1000
00:59:44,634 --> 00:59:47,720
Go. Right now. Tell them to run it.
Let's go, people.

1001
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:52,558
Let's win this thing for America. Right?

1002
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:56,312
It's the first combination political commercial
and sex tape...

1003
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:59,732
...and it's got over 65 million hits
on YouTube.

1004
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,193
Cam Brady was supposed to be
on my show tonight...

1005
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,861
...but he's had to cancel again.

1006
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:06,405
He's apparently dealing with a sex tape.

1007
01:00:06,573 --> 01:00:09,742
He's gotta withdraw his name from the ballot
at the very least, wouldn't you say?

1008
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,453
- Uh, a slight bump, actually.
- What?

1009
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:15,623
And there's Muffins and Poundcake...

1010
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:19,585
...in a parking lot of an airport Denny's...

1011
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:22,922
...thirsty, alone and tired.

1012
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:28,636
And then I find a wife who's forced me
to wear the horns of a cuckold.

1013
01:00:28,803 --> 01:00:33,015
Look, Marty, I definitely did wrong.

1014
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:37,436
But do you know this is the first time
you've actually talked to me in weeks?

1015
01:00:37,604 --> 01:00:40,481
The entire country is talking
about what you did.

1016
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:42,191
I know.

1017
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,818
Tim says I gotta kick you out...

1018
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:48,656
...or else I'll look weak
and I'll lose the election.

1019
01:00:48,823 --> 01:00:52,117
When did Tim Wattley
become part of this family?

1020
01:00:56,581 --> 01:00:59,625
Why don't you make up
your own mind, Marty?

1021
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:02,836
I think you should leave, Mitzi.

1022
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:05,923
At least until the election's over.

1023
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:09,718
And then what?
You'll be the old Marty again?

1024
01:01:09,886 --> 01:01:12,179
- And what if you win?
- Well--

1025
01:01:12,347 --> 01:01:16,976
- Marty, you should've never entered this race.
- Well, Cam Brady should've never entered you.

1026
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,312
- Tim told me to say that.
- Gross.

1027
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:23,357
Goodbye, Marty.

1028
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:29,863
We're out of Honey Nut Cheerios.

1029
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,129
Okay, so here's the deal.

1030
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:34,840
If I bag a buck,
we'll get a nice bounce in the polls.

1031
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:38,969
So, what I did is
I bought a dead seven-point buck, I froze it...

1032
01:01:39,137 --> 01:01:41,388
...and I put it out by the lake in the woods.

1033
01:01:41,556 --> 01:01:43,765
It's probably defrosted by about now.

1034
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:47,060
So get the photographers ready when I yell.

1035
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:50,147
That's an awesome plan, congressman.
What's the signal?

1036
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,649
Well, you'll hear a gunshot,
and then you'll hear me yell:

1037
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:54,276
"Black Hawk down!"

1038
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,863
That makes sense. Hey.

1039
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:04,953
Marty Huggins.
I didn't realize you were a sportsman.

1040
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:08,165
Sorry about that thing with your wife.
You know politics.

1041
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:13,128
Ho--! He shot me.
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

1042
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,340
- You saw it. You all saw it.
- Way to go, Marty.

1043
01:02:16,507 --> 01:02:19,301
- Hunting season's over. Let's go, start the car.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,094
It went right through my femur.

1045
01:02:21,262 --> 01:02:25,098
Candidate Huggins shot his opponent,
Congressman Brady, in a hunting accident...

1046
01:02:25,266 --> 01:02:26,892
...and went up in the polls.

1047
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,685
Ted Nugent would be proud.

1048
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:32,105
- Bravo, young man.
- Well, well, well.

1049
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:33,940
If it isn't Dick Van Shrinkle.

1050
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,111
We didn't have any idea
that you had this kind of talent.

1051
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:39,321
Well done.

1052
01:02:40,114 --> 01:02:44,868
I'm only saying this because I've had
about a dozen brandies and a bump of coke...

1053
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:47,204
...and I'm a little emotional.

1054
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:50,040
Goddamn it, I'm so proud of you. I mean--

1055
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,670
You actually shot a man
and went up in the polls.

1056
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,297
That's something we've only dreamed about.

1057
01:02:57,465 --> 01:03:01,426
Well, I would've shot somebody a long time
ago if I knew you'd be proud of me, Dad.

1058
01:03:01,594 --> 01:03:02,636
- Sit down.
- Okay.

1059
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:05,806
Well, the good news is
you don't have to worry about the charges.

1060
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:08,642
There was not a single soul
who was willing to testify.

1061
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:12,771
As of right now,
you are 12 points over Cam Brady.

1062
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:15,774
- That's right.
- Well, I'm just super overwhelmed by it.

1063
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:17,275
It's been a really good day.

1064
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:19,653
Well, I got some more good news
for you, son.

1065
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:25,951
We have purchased all the rights
and large tracts of land in your district...

1066
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,997
...and we will be building three factories
that will generate 8000 jobs...

1067
01:03:31,165 --> 01:03:34,084
...and over a billion dollars of revenue
per annum.

1068
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:35,293
Oh, my goodness.

1069
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,838
And we immediately sold that real estate
and debt...

1070
01:03:38,005 --> 01:03:40,674
...to the People's Republic
for a massive profit.

1071
01:03:41,092 --> 01:03:44,845
- I'm sorry, to who?
- Oh. The 14th district now belongs to China.

1072
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:52,018
Guess those jobs will be good
for the district.

1073
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:54,563
Actually, American workers
are paid way too much...

1074
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:57,023
...for us to book the profits
we're accustomed to.

1075
01:03:57,191 --> 01:04:01,069
We'll be bringing in low-paid Chinese labor.
They'll clock in at 50 cents an hour.

1076
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,613
We call the concept "insourcing."

1077
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:07,200
And we want you to start using "insourcing"
in all your campaign speeches.

1078
01:04:07,368 --> 01:04:08,910
The word tested through the roof.

1079
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:12,581
It just kind of seems like you're building
a big sweatshop in Hammond.

1080
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:15,667
You have factories in China.
Why are you gonna bring them here?

1081
01:04:15,835 --> 01:04:17,586
It'll save a fortune in shipping.

1082
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:21,214
It'll double the already-doubled profits
that we make.

1083
01:04:22,049 --> 01:04:25,802
With all due respect, I thought we were
gonna do something nice for the district.

1084
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:30,766
And when you request those EPA waivers
and concessions on minimum wage...

1085
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,726
...the whole project will be a go.

1086
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,398
Well, Marty?

1087
01:04:43,196 --> 01:04:44,488
No, I won't do it.

1088
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,703
I'm not gonna be known as the congressman
who sold out his district to the Chinese.

1089
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,039
What are you doing?
You're fucking up, baby bro.

1090
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:56,792
Goddamn it, son! Will you do as I say?

1091
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,795
Look, I'm not the type of guy
that talks back to his father.

1092
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:03,507
But I imagine that guy, and I imagine that guy
would say something like this:

1093
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:08,595
You were never there for me.
This town was always there for me.

1094
01:05:09,222 --> 01:05:11,723
And by the way,
I know when you were married to Mama...

1095
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:15,769
...you were having an affair with that woman
that looked like Dog the Bounty Hunter.

1096
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:20,941
What you're doing is wrong. It's dead wrong.

1097
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:32,953
Jiggle it.

1098
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,830
- Jiggle a little.
- Jiggle a little.

1099
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:36,623
I did. I mean....

1100
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,835
- Jig-- You pull-- Lift it up and jiggle it.
- Lift it up.

1101
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,586
- Shake and push.
- Now push.

1102
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:44,464
- No, at the same time. You gotta--
- Jiggle, shake and push.

1103
01:05:44,632 --> 01:05:45,924
- Yeah.
- There it is.

1104
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:48,426
Nope. Now I got it.

1105
01:05:53,975 --> 01:05:55,100
Do we kill him?

1106
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:58,395
No, no, no.

1107
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:02,440
What we're looking for is a new,
fresh voice...

1108
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:05,902
...that'll wake up the people
and harness their frustrations.

1109
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,529
A savior, if you will.

1110
01:06:08,322 --> 01:06:11,992
And it turns out
he's been right in front of us all along.

1111
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:15,579
I'm not gonna cry.

1112
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:19,165
- I'm not gonna cry.
- Rinse.

1113
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:22,127
Jesus, Wattley.

1114
01:06:22,587 --> 01:06:24,254
What the hell are you doing in here?

1115
01:06:24,422 --> 01:06:29,175
Motch brothers sent me.
I'm here to make you not suck.

1116
01:06:31,762 --> 01:06:37,017
Introducing the new and improved Cam Brady.

1117
01:06:38,311 --> 01:06:39,728
Bring him down.

1118
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:51,740
How you doing, North Carolina?

1119
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:57,621
The new Cam Brady is here today
to stop the talking and start the walking.

1120
01:06:57,788 --> 01:07:02,417
The funny thing is, there's still
a lot people out there that say no.

1121
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:05,962
Marty Huggins says no.

1122
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:12,052
But we're gonna kick his ass,
because that's how we do.

1123
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:13,595
Whoo!

1124
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,682
Motch paid me 50 grand
to make a few appearances.

1125
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,644
We're not back together.
Put your arm around me.

1126
01:07:20,811 --> 01:07:23,813
Now, remember,
y'all have to support Cam Brady.

1127
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:26,024
Cam Brady '012. Whoo!

1128
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:29,319
Y'all have to hate Marty Huggins!

1129
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:36,576
Well, let's be honest.

1130
01:07:38,162 --> 01:07:40,121
We're getting our tushes handed to us.

1131
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,458
You're only eight points down, Marty.

1132
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:47,837
There's a chance we could make it up
before the polls open tomorrow.

1133
01:07:54,762 --> 01:07:57,597
- Hello, Mitzi.
- Hey, Marty.

1134
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:02,894
Look, after 17 years of faithful marriage...

1135
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,522
...I did a bad, stupid thing.

1136
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,524
I got crazy, Marty.

1137
01:08:07,692 --> 01:08:11,027
I lost myself and who I am.

1138
01:08:11,195 --> 01:08:13,780
And I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

1139
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,366
Well, you should be.

1140
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:19,285
You hurt my feelings, Mitzi.

1141
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:22,747
And I don't get my feelings hurt that much,
you know?

1142
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:25,250
But I'm to blame too.

1143
01:08:25,418 --> 01:08:27,711
I turned my back on the boys and you.

1144
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:30,422
And to the people of this town.

1145
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:35,093
I got all messed up with the hoopla
of bigtime politics...

1146
01:08:35,261 --> 01:08:37,762
...and look who I am now.

1147
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:39,723
I ain't much of nothing.

1148
01:08:42,268 --> 01:08:46,271
Marty, tomorrow is election day.

1149
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:50,900
You're not gonna win.
And that means they'll destroy this town.

1150
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,070
You've got 14 hours
till they open up those polls.

1151
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,698
We're up against some dirty players.

1152
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,951
It's time to save this town.

1153
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,752
Now, when you say something like that...

1154
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:11,421
...I do get a little careless whisper
in my body.

1155
01:09:11,589 --> 01:09:12,672
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

1156
01:09:21,348 --> 01:09:23,808
Be my Drew Carey.

1157
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:27,312
Mitzi Huggins, come on down.

1158
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,364
Oh. Oh, I'm dizzy.

1159
01:09:38,532 --> 01:09:40,617
Okay, people.

1160
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:44,037
It's time to get to work. Let's do it.

1161
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:49,959
It's election day.
Polls are opening on the East Coast.

1162
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:53,129
Record turnout
in North Carolina's 14th district..

1163
01:09:53,297 --> 01:09:56,591
...where Cam Brady is solidly ahead.

1164
01:09:57,343 --> 01:09:58,927
- All right.
- That's how we do.

1165
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:00,845
Ha, ha. Hello.

1166
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:04,349
Stuart, do you still have those
TV commercial spots available for today?

1167
01:10:04,517 --> 01:10:05,558
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

1168
01:10:05,726 --> 01:10:07,727
Hey. Hey, everybody.

1169
01:10:07,895 --> 01:10:12,232
Hey, shut up, shut up, everybody.
Check out these TVs.

1170
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:16,444
Hello, I'm Marty Huggins.
I'm running to be your congressman.

1171
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:20,615
I've spent my last penny on this ad
to tell everyone in the district one thing.

1172
01:10:21,408 --> 01:10:22,992
I have not been honest with you.

1173
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,287
See, the truth is,
big money is running politics in America.

1174
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,999
Billionaires and corporations
have given me millions of dollars...

1175
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:31,793
...to say what they want me to say.

1176
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,253
What the hell is he doing?

1177
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,923
And most of the time,
what they want me to say is a lie.

1178
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:39,008
Well, I'm not doing it anymore.

1179
01:10:39,176 --> 01:10:42,762
But on this election day,
if you choose to vote for me, know this:

1180
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,933
I will never take another dime
from any billionaire or corporation.

1181
01:10:47,101 --> 01:10:52,105
And to get the ball rolling,
I will tell you the darkest secrets of my life.

1182
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:57,026
On October 23rd, 1996, at 2:11 p.m...

1183
01:10:57,194 --> 01:11:01,322
...I farted in a very crowded elevator
and blamed it on a war veteran.

1184
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,491
I would like to apologize to that woman.

1185
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:09,372
Last year, I attended a Halloween party
dressed up as Lady Gaga.

1186
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:14,127
I felt so alive and free,
I did not take off the costume for two days.

1187
01:11:14,295 --> 01:11:15,962
As a prank, when I was 15...

1188
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,299
...my big brother told me
you have to masturbate with your feet.

1189
01:11:19,466 --> 01:11:21,342
And to this day, that's how I do it.

1190
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:25,054
This feels good. Ahem.

1191
01:11:25,222 --> 01:11:30,435
Everyone, turn to the person next to you,
reach in your heart, and let it speak.

1192
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,564
I had an affair with the waitress
at Ruby Tuesdays.

1193
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,192
So did I.

1194
01:11:39,653 --> 01:11:43,156
I run a meth lab out of the kids' tree fort.

1195
01:11:43,324 --> 01:11:45,950
I'm your twin sister.

1196
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:51,748
Sometimes when I get a little drunk,
I let kids touch my old lady's titty.

1197
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:56,085
Ninety percent of the time,
I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.

1198
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:58,838
I tried to kill you in your sleep.

1199
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:00,381
What?

1200
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:02,926
Three times.

1201
01:12:03,093 --> 01:12:07,931
You see, telling the truth feels good,
and it's what this country was built on.

1202
01:12:08,098 --> 01:12:12,393
I'm Marty Huggins,
and this is one message I approve.

1203
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:17,523
Oh, Mr. Raymond.
Here you go, your afternoon refreshment.

1204
01:12:17,691 --> 01:12:20,151
- Mrs. Yao?
- Yeah.

1205
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:22,862
Do you know what I like most
about your Asian boys?

1206
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,072
Hmm?

1207
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,908
They respect their elders
and do as they're told.

1208
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,411
You have been saying for years...

1209
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,747
...how you want Marty to stand up
and be his own man.

1210
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,793
Well, he's finally done it.
You should be proud of him.

1211
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:39,379
- What did you say?
- Oh, right. Uh....

1212
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,674
Your son Marty be standing up like a man...

1213
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:45,343
...but his pappy gots to support him.

1214
01:12:47,638 --> 01:12:49,472
This is bullshit.

1215
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:52,767
Election day winding down.

1216
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,645
North Carolina's 14th district
one of the last to call it.

1217
01:12:55,813 --> 01:12:59,190
And today opponent Marty Huggins
did the craziest stunt to date.

1218
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:03,528
Marty Huggins, he actually promised to be
the most honest congressman out there.

1219
01:13:03,696 --> 01:13:06,447
Listen, guys,
he opened his life up, and it's worked.

1220
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:07,991
He's up in the polls.

1221
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:10,868
The whole country is still waiting
on the result.

1222
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:16,165
Ahem. We have a winner,
as verified by the State Election Board.

1223
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,459
And the results were as follows.

1224
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:23,798
With 90,362 votes, Camden Brady.

1225
01:13:29,263 --> 01:13:32,432
And now for the results for Martin Huggins:

1226
01:13:32,599 --> 01:13:36,894
80,365 votes. Cam Brady wins.

1227
01:13:37,062 --> 01:13:39,522
- Yeah! Whoo!
- All right. Whoo!

1228
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:46,654
How can that be?
We were up 10,000 votes in the exit polls.

1229
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,781
How can that be?

1230
01:13:55,539 --> 01:13:57,832
Who's taking care of business now?

1231
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,501
- Thank you.
- We did it, baby. We did it.

1232
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:04,047
It's you and me against the world forever.

1233
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,549
Cam Brady!

1234
01:14:06,717 --> 01:14:09,802
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Well done.

1235
01:14:11,221 --> 01:14:14,265
Pardon me. Excuse me, thank you.
Thank you.

1236
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:16,642
- Mitzi.
- Cam.

1237
01:14:17,227 --> 01:14:18,269
Sorry.

1238
01:14:18,937 --> 01:14:19,979
Hey, Marty.

1239
01:14:20,606 --> 01:14:23,358
Why are you so upset?
You ran a hell of a campaign.

1240
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:27,028
- I mean, you got a real talent for this.
- You still don't get it, do you?

1241
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,114
I didn't do this for some career.

1242
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,993
I did this because I love my home
and I wanted to help out.

1243
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:38,289
Just like you did when you took down
that jaggedy jungle gym...

1244
01:14:38,457 --> 01:14:41,334
...so other kids wouldn't get cut like me.

1245
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:44,087
- It got you too.
- Yeah.

1246
01:14:44,254 --> 01:14:46,297
I remember that jaggedy jungle gym.

1247
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:49,425
- Ow.
- Look at this.

1248
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:52,845
Oh, no.

1249
01:14:53,013 --> 01:14:57,016
Doctors said it was the worst
playground accident they'd ever seen.

1250
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:03,106
And I just dangled there
for two straight nights.

1251
01:15:03,273 --> 01:15:04,690
Oh, good Lord.

1252
01:15:04,858 --> 01:15:08,319
But back then, in the fourth grade,
I voted for you.

1253
01:15:08,487 --> 01:15:09,529
You know why?

1254
01:15:09,988 --> 01:15:14,158
Because you were a voice of the people.
But that's when we was kids.

1255
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,704
I guess this is the, uh....
The way of the world now.

1256
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,916
Come on, Cam, we gotta go.

1257
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,671
It had to be said.

1258
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:29,340
- Pull up your pants, honey.
- Okay.

1259
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,135
Here he is, the man of the hour.

1260
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:38,182
It's been a pleasure running his campaign.
Congressman Cam Brady.

1261
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,892
We love you, Cam.

1262
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:43,479
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thanks.

1263
01:15:44,523 --> 01:15:46,065
So, uh....

1264
01:15:46,233 --> 01:15:48,609
So I won. That's great.

1265
01:15:52,656 --> 01:15:56,242
Marty Huggins did a crazy thing
on TV today.

1266
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,411
He told the truth.

1267
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:00,580
So here I go.

1268
01:16:00,747 --> 01:16:03,332
I am a great politician.

1269
01:16:06,378 --> 01:16:08,171
Yeah.

1270
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,777
- But I am a horrible congressman.
- No.

1271
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:33,738
Now, hold on, hear me out.

1272
01:16:33,906 --> 01:16:38,326
I hardly ever vote in Congress,
and I never read the bills.

1273
01:16:38,535 --> 01:16:43,623
When I'm in D.C.,
I mostly Facebook old girlfriends...

1274
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,541
...play fantasy hockey.

1275
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:50,129
Words with Friends, Scrabble,
Draw Something.

1276
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:53,841
I just enjoy being Congressman Cam Brady...

1277
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,928
...and I was scared to death of losing that.

1278
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:01,098
So I took a bunch of money
from the Motch brothers...

1279
01:17:01,266 --> 01:17:06,521
...and convinced myself that selling
the 14th district to China was a good idea.

1280
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,689
All they care about is profits.

1281
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,776
Not you, not me, not America.

1282
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,530
The only reason why my wife is here tonight
is because they paid her to be here.

1283
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:19,534
Jesus, I think we should
take our leave. Excuse me.

1284
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,744
- He's a liar.
- He's a nutbag.

1285
01:17:21,912 --> 01:17:23,704
Don't touch me. We're both ex-Marines.

1286
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:27,375
Get away now.
Get away or I'll start slapping people.

1287
01:17:27,543 --> 01:17:31,295
But do you know which individual
in this room...

1288
01:17:31,463 --> 01:17:34,048
...stood up to the Motch brothers
and said no?

1289
01:17:35,259 --> 01:17:38,761
Marty Huggins.
That son of a bitch fears no man.

1290
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:41,180
He should be your congressman.

1291
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,225
Sure, I know what you're thinking:
He's a weirdo.

1292
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,477
I've often wondered...

1293
01:17:46,645 --> 01:17:50,773
...why the folks
from Ripley's Believe It or Not!...

1294
01:17:50,941 --> 01:17:54,068
...haven't broken into his house...

1295
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,612
...and kidnapped him
for a permanent display.

1296
01:17:57,322 --> 01:18:01,826
He's one of the good ones,
and I've actually grown fond of him.

1297
01:18:01,994 --> 01:18:04,745
So with that, I'd like to announce
my withdrawal from this election...

1298
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:09,625
...and congratulate
Congressman Marty Huggins.

1299
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:13,379
Come on up here, Marty.

1300
01:18:14,464 --> 01:18:15,923
Goddamn.

1301
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:22,179
AUDIENCE
Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty!

1302
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:23,973
You sure about this?

1303
01:18:25,183 --> 01:18:27,226
Get on up there before I change my mind.

1304
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,897
Thanks so much.

1305
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:34,817
One minute you got your pants down...

1306
01:18:34,985 --> 01:18:38,446
...and the next minute
you're a U.S. congressman.

1307
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,616
It's usually the other way around, I guess.

1308
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:47,288
I'd like to thank Cam Brady
for his intestinal fortitude...

1309
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,081
...for doing what he just did.

1310
01:18:52,002 --> 01:18:57,131
I want the 14th district to know
that you will not be sold to China...

1311
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,758
...to Brazil...

1312
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,552
...to Nova Scotia...

1313
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,471
...or any other country.

1314
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:06,474
- Hi, Cam.
- Hey, Mitch.

1315
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:09,310
That was the greatest gesture
I've ever seen in my life.

1316
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:12,938
- That was book-worthy.
- Thank you.

1317
01:19:13,106 --> 01:19:18,194
- I'd really like to work together again someday.
- Well, nothing would please me more.

1318
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:19,612
It's a deal.

1319
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,948
By the way, I hope you don't mind me
saying this, but you look great.

1320
01:19:23,116 --> 01:19:24,784
- I started drinking again.
- Oh.

1321
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,827
Mm-hm.

1322
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:31,415
And I want to end daylight savings time.
I hate when it gets dark early.

1323
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:36,253
Washington, D.C., I have a message for you:

1324
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:40,675
I'm bringing my broom,
because you know why?

1325
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,551
It's a mess.

1326
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:47,348
It's a mess! It's a mess! It's a mess!

1327
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,226
It's a mess! It's a mess!

1328
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:55,231
Congressman
Scott Talley will tender his resignation...

1329
01:19:55,399 --> 01:20:01,153
...over allegations of using federal funds
to purchase his mistress's fake breasts.

1330
01:20:01,321 --> 01:20:06,742
Large breasts offer more protection
to a woman's tender vital organs.

1331
01:20:07,577 --> 01:20:09,829
- Talley's done.
- What a waste.

1332
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,708
- Connie!
- I think you fired her.

1333
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,627
Oh, damn it. Who is it?

1334
01:20:16,795 --> 01:20:20,214
Hola, it's me, Rosita,
your new cleaning lady.

1335
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:22,967
Oh, this is a big casa.

1336
01:20:23,135 --> 01:20:27,263
It's going to take me forever to clean it,
but I do it for you.

1337
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:30,224
Go away.

1338
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,892
This is a subpoena...

1339
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,604
...for you to appear before a congressional
hearing on campaign-finance illegalities.

1340
01:20:35,772 --> 01:20:37,982
You've been served, dickheads. Heh.

1341
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,109
- What?
- Who's heading this hearing?

1342
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:43,404
Oh. Congressman Marty Huggins...

1343
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,741
...and he's going to go loco
on your gringo asses.

1344
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,329
Greedy motherfuckers.

1345
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:31,243
Okay, everyone, please. Okay.

1346
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:34,121
I'd like to remind these gentlemen
why they are here.

1347
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,208
You were spending millions of dollars
buying politicians...

1348
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,502
...spreading misinformation...

1349
01:21:39,669 --> 01:21:43,130
...and influencing legislation
for your personal gain.

1350
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:46,634
- Now, I think the re--
- Marty. You're doing great.

1351
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:49,762
- And I just love being your chief of staff.
- Good.

1352
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:53,265
Unfortunately,
none of these charges are illegal.

1353
01:21:53,433 --> 01:21:54,892
Uh, that's correct, congressman.

1354
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:58,395
The Citizens United ruling
made that abundantly clear.

1355
01:21:58,563 --> 01:22:03,526
Maybe I can't get you on the corruption
of elections, but I can get you on this:

1356
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:07,446
I can--

1357
01:22:07,614 --> 01:22:10,950
It's a coupon to Chick-fil-A.
It's a coupon to Chick-fil-A.

1358
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:16,622
Aiding and abetting
a known international fugitive.

1359
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:21,085
This is Tim Wattley,
a.k.a. Leonidis Stavros...

1360
01:22:21,253 --> 01:22:23,045
...a.k.a. the Greek Butcher...

1361
01:22:23,213 --> 01:22:25,005
...a.k.a. the Greek Baker...

1362
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:27,299
...a.k.a. the Greek Candlestick Maker...

1363
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:29,510
...a.k.a. Dermot Mulroney...

1364
01:22:30,136 --> 01:22:32,972
...a.k.a. Osama Getting-Laiden.

1365
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:37,268
Gentlemen, these are federal offenses.

1366
01:22:37,435 --> 01:22:41,772
My brother is responsible for this.
I've never heard of Mr. Wattley in my life.

1367
01:22:41,982 --> 01:22:43,482
Boom.

1368
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:46,026
- You're under arrest.
- I've never seen him before.

1369
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:49,321
- It's a mess.
- Whoo!

1370
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:51,490
I put you in that chair. I can get you out.

1371
01:22:51,658 --> 01:22:53,200
- This is a sham.
- Are you kidding?

1372
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:56,203
- We make every decision together.
- This is all you.

1373
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,065
