1
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:23,860
How do I get in to see the manager?

2
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,612
Thank you.

3
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:36,968
Hello?

4
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:48,825
Who the hell are you?

5
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:51,911
Orrin Quest's mother.

6
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,472
Wants her little boy back.

7
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,066
Cop??

8
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:04,575
PHILIP MARLOWE
Private Investigator

9
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,764
Hmm. I'm unhappy.

10
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:22,565
Get out more. Dance in the streets. Take a cop to lunch.

11
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,040
I got friends.

12
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,960
You got a master key?

13
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:45,863
Hello.

14
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,823
Let me speak to the doctor.

15
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,262
Klausen.

16
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,374
Doctor?

17
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:58,574
The key.

18
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,577
I run a legit hotel here
-Come on, the key!

19
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,371
All these private rooms.
- Do not be silly.

20
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,912
Excuse me, the manager said
that Orrin Quest was here.

21
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,947
The manager said that
Orrin Quest was in here!

22
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:44,540
Talkie that way, ain't he?

23
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:47,018
He's still registered.

24
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,734
So what am I doin' here?

25
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,334
You ask the question.

26
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,527
Close the lid.

27
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:58,852
I got a permit for the gun.

28
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:00,572
Let me see it.

29
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,561
Let me see it!

30
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,086
Quest left ten days ago.

31
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,876
I was across the hall, in 215.

32
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:16,031
This is a better room.
So I switched. You satisfied?

33
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,394
I'll sleep like a lamb.

34
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,595
You're Hicks, right?

35
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,788
The register - Grant. W. Hicks.
215.

36
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,462
Did Quest leave any forwarding
address?

37
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,385
These kids, y'know. They freak
out, disappear.

38
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,618
You narco squad?

39
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,669
Thanks.

40
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,489
For not spitting on it!

41
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:28,973
Going up?

42
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,281
The little one, darling.
Don't want another big roller.

43
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:48,911
Oh my God!
- Anything for me, Chuck?

44
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:51,309
She's back. The one from Kansas.

45
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:55,672
Hi.
- Well?

46
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:57,304
Hold it.

47
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:00,763
Well?

48
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:05,382
What happened? I've been waiting hours and hours.

49
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,537
All shadow no substance.

50
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,094
Not even a trace?

51
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:12,495
No satisfaction, no charge.

52
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,814
<i>Dr. Lagardie's Office. </i>

53
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,811
I'd like to speak to the doctor, please.

54
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:19,856
<i> Can I tell him who's calling? </i>

55
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:22,964
Tell him it's about Mr. Klausen.

56
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,090
<i>Will you hold?
- Yes, I'll hold. </i>

57
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,883
No wonder you haven't
found my brother.

58
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,402
You've been working on other cases.

59
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,237
That's me, just buried alive in success.

60
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:36,398
The luxurious appointments,
executive secretary

61
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,360
the electronic devices?

62
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:39,913
Drink?

63
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,156
I don't like you, Mr. Marlowe.

64
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,506
The minute I walked into this
grubby little office...

65
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,631
I knew I should never
have hired you.

66
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,950
Well, there's your retainer.
All $ 55.

67
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:53,988
Now some people would keep it. But I just get a little shaky

68
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:58,026
running around with that much loose money in my pocket.

69
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,254
You didn't even really try to find Orrin!

70
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:08,092
<i>Doctor Lagardie.
- Doc?</i>

71
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,526
Just this morning a Mr. Havin Klausen tried to talk to you...

72
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:13,931
... He got cut off?

73
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:17,247
Havin Klausen?

74
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,968
I'm afraid I don't know a Havin Klausen.

75
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,838
<i> Then you have nothing to fear, Doc. </i>

76
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,397
Unless it was your ice pick.

77
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,274
Who is this?

78
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:30,598
Hicks. Grant Hicks.

79
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,480
A former tenant of Mr. Klausen's rooming house.

80
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:37,630
I was just checking out when he tried to call you.

81
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:41,309
That was before someone mistook him for an ice block.

82
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:45,780
<i>You might want to know
before someone wanted</i>

83
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,143
<i>... why Klausen tried
call you. </i>

84
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:50,382
But Doc?

85
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:54,337
Don't get me wrong, this is no shakedown.

86
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:57,454
I'm just a cat looking for a connection.

87
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:58,853
Y'know.

88
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,655
Please feel free to consult me.

89
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,052
Anytime.

90
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,166
<i>Goodbye.
- Goodbye. </i>

91
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:17,958
Do you mind?

92
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:20,352
Filthy habit.

93
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,998
My father used to smoke a pipe.

94
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:27,515
Momma never let him smoke in the house.

95
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:31,392
The last two years, after he had the stroke, he used to sit on the porch...

96
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,111
... with an empty pipe in his mouth.

97
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:34,786
Probably didn't like that, either.

98
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,469
We owed a lot of money.

99
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:40,016
We couldn't afford
useless things like tobacco.

100
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:43,415
Well, stick your $50 back and forget we ever met.

101
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:45,175
Hey, the town's full of detectives.

102
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,410
Fine.

103
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:07,322
I used up my vacation
time looking for him.

104
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:10,282
And most of my money, too.

105
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:12,433
And I have to go back home Saturday!

106
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:16,195
I'm sure something happened!
I can feel it, Mr. Marlowe!

107
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,187
I found a boarding house.
He slept there ten days ago.

108
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:24,108
Now, you go home, Miss Quest.

109
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,308
Sooner or later he will shuck his sandals, cut his hair. .

110
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:31,707
Ten years you won't know him from anyone else in Kansas.

111
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,133
<i>Marlowe.
- Grant Hicks, Marlowe. </i>

112
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,013
<i>You in the market for a quick $100? </i>

113
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:40,090
How quick?

114
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,612
Fifteen minutes quick enough?

115
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,449
<i>- Is that panel to panel pay? </i>

116
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,093
Marlowe, I'm in the Alvarado hotel.

117
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:47,607
<i>- Just five minutes from your place. </i>

118
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,410
<i>- A couple of minutes of your time and you're home free. </i>

119
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe
- I'm in Room 22.

120
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,967
But hurry, huh?

121
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,046
It's two minutes with you where your story breaks down.

122
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:00,397
Look, I'll give you something to hold and $100.

123
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,480
Tomorrow, next day, give it back.

124
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:05,240
Stricly legit. Nothing hot.

125
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:11,944
Look. Gotta hang up.

126
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,945
I'm counting on you, Marlowe. Get over here right now.

127
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,304
$50 is all I've got.

128
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:29,144
I guess not enough
to keep you interested, right?

129
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:33,575
It's not the money that bothers me. It's icepicks.

130
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:42,090
If you won't take my money, what will you take?

131
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,883
A simple goodbye.

132
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,750
Does it bother you if a girl makes the first overture?

133
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:01,991
I've got a low threshold of boredom. It usually helps.

134
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,465
Does it mean that you want me too?

135
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:12,221
It means, that I keep thinking of your old man...

136
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:15,895
sitting out on a porch...
with an empty pipe.

137
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:18,340
Goodbye, Miss Quest.

138
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,417
But if you don't help me find Orrin, who will?

139
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,775
The department of missing persons or the FBI...

140
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:26,767
Mr. Marlowe!

141
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:49,677
Excuse me, room 22?
Who's registered, please?

142
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,630
Around here the concession for
transom peeking

143
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:54,833
Has been given to Oliver J. Hady.

144
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,030
That little concession ought to bring a fortune at auction.

145
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,423
Past the stairs on your left.

146
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:11,778
Hady??

147
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:21,770
So?

148
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,765
I want to get a line on one of your customers.

149
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:25,647
What name?

150
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,166
Could be Naster for all I know.
Room 22.

151
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,841
So?
- He wants to see me.

152
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,520
Don't let me keep you.

153
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:37,114
Would you mind holding your finger there on this thing?

154
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:41,477
Ollie, a man in my business has enemies. You know that.

155
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,553
Anybody calls me to come over, wants something done

156
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,943
... and neglects to give me his name.

157
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,308
You think I'm wrong to think of that?

158
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:52,066
It could be a way to get me into a room and... zap!

159
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,058
Party checks out and your left with me on the floor in 22.

160
00:15:57,387 --> 00:16:00,854
Wouldn't want a case of rigor in your hotel, would you Ollie?

161
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:02,813
Give me the box.

162
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:04,490
Will you hold this a minute?

163
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:18,450
Checked in 5:47. One local phone call. No Room Service.

164
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:23,040
Dr. G. W. Hamilton, El Centro.

165
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,196
What did he look like?

166
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,877
That's right, I stay out there with a Brownie when they register.

167
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,443
Don't move.

168
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:11,326
A 45 I wouldn't argue, but a 32 I can get in a couple of words.

169
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:13,562
I've said them all.

170
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:17,803
Please. Don't forget you're a lady.

171
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:22,236
I like the perfume.

172
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:23,436
What is it?

173
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:13,747
BENSON's
Camera Shop

174
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,013
Whoever did this is a performer.

175
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,051
Cut the spinal cord first try.

176
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,324
They developed the technique in Brooklyn.

177
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:40,561
You don't say.

178
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,046
Sonny Steelgrave's Boys
were specialists.

179
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,525
You're aren't trying to connect Steelgrave with this?

180
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:48,203
Pretty fragile, isn't it?
- Yes

181
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:51,597
Anyway, he definitely wasn't the last of the big spenders.

182
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:55,389
Fourteen dollars and change,
Seven master keys...

183
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,351
Maybe he thought he'd clean out the hotel.

184
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,388
Eddie, do any of these keys fit this dump?

185
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,348
You can unlock our doors with your little finger.

186
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,270
Well, he knew somebody was after him.

187
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,144
Spotted them getting close.

188
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:12,096
Calls Marlowe and offers him $100 to safekeep something.

189
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:13,620
Is that your story, Marlowe?

190
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:14,763
That's it.

191
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,778
Only he hasn't got $100 on him.

192
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,137
Maybe he was figuring on getting you to gamble along.

193
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:29,446
Eddie, could the desk give us a rundown on any visitors?

194
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,807
You don't have to pass the desk to go in or out.

195
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,291
No wonder he stayed in here.

196
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:36,321
That, and all the atmosphere.

197
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:39,880
I guess that just about does it for the first runthrough.

198
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,040
Oh not quite.

199
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:57,148
What do you know.

200
00:20:58,512 --> 00:20:59,660
Maliway Mushtom.

201
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:00,661
Used to be a runner for Ace Devore.

202
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:05,380
How you been, Maliway?

203
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,895
Gonna miss you at the morning lineup.

204
00:21:09,863 --> 00:21:11,534
Well, that takes the pressure off.

205
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,092
This punk won't be a 24 hour a day job.

206
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,568
How did you know about that wig?

207
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,250
I'm a trained detective.

208
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,730
That's your exit line, Marlowe. Follow it out.

209
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,955
And don't leave town, you hear me?

210
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,724
Go on, Hady, You too.

211
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:42,713
What's bugging you?
- The 150.

212
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:46,031
Don't get funny in the wrong place.

213
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:54,858
Oliver, when I checked him he had $164.

214
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:56,666
Now there's only 14 left.
- So?

215
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,940
So where were you while
I was calling the Lieutenant?

216
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:03,333
Are you accusing me?
- Just checking for crimes.

217
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:17,680
Fifty-fifty?

218
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,876
Okay, here you go. I'll remember you!

219
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:26,313
Ollie!

220
00:22:30,878 --> 00:22:32,755
I don't want the money.
I want something else.

221
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,668
What?
- The girl.

222
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:37,824
Went out of here by these stairs. She had to pass you.

223
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:40,383
She'd have been running, you'd have been following.

224
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,817
What makes you so wonderful?
- I'm a trained detective.

225
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:47,145
All right. I follwed her
and she got the car.

226
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:50,616
How do I know that this isn't a number you already had?

227
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:53,090
Just take my word for it.
- What kind of car?

228
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,410
Jaguar convertible, XKE, yellow.

229
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,014
Describe the girl.

230
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,772
You want a lot for your bread.
- Grant Hicks's bread.

231
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:04,606
Wide felt black hat with a black patent leather band.

232
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:06,799
Dark glasses.

233
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,761
Black coat and black patent leather buttons and trimming.

234
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:12,041
White gloves.

235
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:17,074
Height 5'6"-5'6-1/2". Built like a model.

236
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,830
Don't waste it.

237
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:25,394
Five, six, seven, eight.

238
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:28,986
Five, six, seven, eight.

239
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:30,824
Okay, relax a bit.

240
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:34,539
Hi. How are you. Hello.

241
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,696
Thank you. You're right, you're right.

242
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:41,901
Can you get me the name and address with this license?

243
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:43,853
Sure, I'll be through in half an hour.

244
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:47,256
Julie, tonight I couldn't lead a kindergarten marching band.

245
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,216
What if I lead, you follow?

246
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,885
Good night, girls.

247
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,044
And then we apply the color along the part.

248
00:23:57,372 --> 00:23:59,361
And notice how I help it with my thumb.

249
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,779
See?

250
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:03,476
Good morning, Chuck.
- Hold it a minute, girls.

251
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,318
Good morning, Philip.
- Good morning, all.

252
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:10,240
Special delivery for you. Alvarado Hotel. Really, Philip.

253
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,549
Hey...
- Do you like?

254
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:13,755
Yeah!

255
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:17,430
Another day another dollar.
Let me go.

256
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:44,570
Benson Camera Shop.

257
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,006
Good morning, this is Grant Hicks.

258
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:52,004
Order ready on claim A1654?
- Hold on sir.

259
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:58,512
Marlowe.
- I figured it would be a girl.

260
00:24:58,683 --> 00:24:59,717
Why?
- Mr. Hicks?

261
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:00,949
Why?
- Yes, I'm Hicks.

262
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:02,839
Your order's ready, sir.
- Who's Mr. Hicks?

263
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,513
It's something I've been working on.

264
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:05,827
Why'd you say it had to be a girl?

265
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:06,793
Are you kidding?

266
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,595
I'm sorry, I'm on another line.

267
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:11,790
Should I call you back?
- I need the information now.

268
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:14,591
Sir, are you speaking to me?
- Yes, I will be in before noon.

269
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:17,422
That'll be fine.
- I have to be back by one.

270
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:19,021
How's 12?
- I can't make it.

271
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,257
You can't make it.
We close at six.

272
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:23,732
No, I will be there to pick them up before noon.

273
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:25,018
How?
- I'll be here.

274
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:25,953
Goodbye.

275
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:28,694
Don't hang up yet! Hello?
- Honey,

276
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:32,805
I'm sorry, I can't make it for lunch, but who's the girl?

277
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:33,965
Mavis Wald.

278
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,611
The Mavis Wald?

279
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,166
<i>My luck. </i>

280
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,479
What's the address?

281
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,238
2720 Nelson Avenue. I hope they pitch you off the balcony.

282
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,355
<i> Goodbye. </i>

283
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:14,898
Your change, Mr. Hicks.

284
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:18,970
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Keep the change...

285
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,246
... and mail the photos to me
at this address.

286
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:24,925
Alright Mr. Hicks.

287
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:28,132
It's Marlowe.
- Alright, Mr. Marlowe.

288
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:49,949
I have some stills for Ms. Wald.

289
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,704
You can leave them with me.
- No, not these.

290
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,546
I'll phone, wait a minute.

291
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:58,616
It's the ones we shot at the Alvarado Hotel last night.

292
00:26:58,788 --> 00:26:59,760
Okay.

293
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,259
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:10,733
Sir, you can go right up.

295
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:13,493
Penthouse.

296
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,401
Hi.
- Mavis Wald?

297
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,916
She's busy making panic calls.

298
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,795
You really shook her. What's up?

299
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,871
I am the father of her triplets.

300
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,663
Do you have a name?

301
00:27:43,314 --> 00:27:44,907
It wouldn't do anything for you.

302
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,710
Sugar?
- Yes, please.

303
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:50,067
I am Dolores, with an "o".

304
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,980
Dolores Gonzales.

305
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,303
Is that Spanish for pain?

306
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,812
You've picked a nice place to suffer.

307
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:03,053
You jumped to that conclusion, but it's Mavis's pad, not mine.

308
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,410
Which makes you?

309
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,853
Something you don't see every day.

310
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:09,052
An old friend.

311
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:13,491
My friend asked me to keep you occupied.

312
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:17,767
Are you hard to occupy?
- As hard to get. as a haircut.

313
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:23,281
Has anybody ever told you that you have a sensuous underlip?

314
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:24,716
Everybody mentions it.

315
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,953
Do nice uncomplicated girls turn you on?

316
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,153
I come all unglued.

317
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,997
Are you looking for something?

318
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:36,024
I just don't want to see Mavis get hurt.

319
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:37,465
Now who are you?

320
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,657
His name is Philip Marlowe.

321
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:48,137
Private Detective.

322
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,813
Well, I hope everybody's happy.

323
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:52,777
Goodbye.

324
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:58,809
Philip Marlowe.

325
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:02,364
What can I buy you with?
- The money helps.

326
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:06,878
How much?
- Say... $ 100.

327
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:12,644
$ 100 is money tor you?
- Make it $200 and I'll retire.

328
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:15,554
I work for my money.

329
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,636
What am I buying?

330
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:19,871
I do not think you killed him.

331
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:23,865
Help to have some reason not to tell the police you were there.

332
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,949
Am I supposed to have killed somebody?

333
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,625
You're going to find this hard to believe, but I came up

334
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:36,423
with the idea that you might need some help.

335
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:40,698
I figured you went to the room to make a payoff.

336
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:44,578
You went there alone and took a chance on being recognized.

337
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,571
That made me think you could be in a king-sized jam.

338
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:54,841
I said a king-sized jam as a cue.

339
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,636
You're good, Ms. Wald...

340
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:08,480
You could act your way out of a safe deposit box.

341
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,470
Good day.

342
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:19,705
You're out of work again, Philip.

343
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:28,303
Car.

344
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:36,728
Car.

345
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:43,131
A man with a limited vocabulary you do make your point.

346
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,770
Car.

347
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:05,268
They tell me there was a disturbance upstairs.

348
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,116
In Miss Wald's apartment.

349
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:08,784
They tell you wrong.

350
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,785
We were bombing craps.

351
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:13,429
Where are the pictures?

352
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:16,628
Who makes your ice picks, Mr. Steelgrave?

353
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:20,979
Too bad.

354
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,601
Does your mother know what you do for a living...

355
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:38,474
Mr. Marlowe?

356
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:39,752
Yes.

357
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:48,795
What can I do for you?

358
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,663
Good grief! What are you boys up to?

359
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,386
Just renovating, Chuck.

360
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:02,661
Yes? It's about time.

361
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:05,735
Come on girls, back to work!

362
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:07,979
Don't stand looking back to work.

363
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:12,411
You won't need that.

364
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:18,489
The word is you are a cool cat.

365
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:21,967
The word is wrong, I go all to pieces over nothing.

366
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,199
That coat rack has been my family for years.

367
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:29,280
Would you like it if your coat rack was disassembled?

368
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:32,195
I've come to make a proposition.

369
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,393
May I reach for my pocket??

370
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,189
It would give me pleasure to do you do something foolish.

371
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,866
$ 500.

372
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,816
For that you can kick the ceiling.

373
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:55,939
It's yours.

374
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:57,452
For what?

375
00:33:57,822 --> 00:34:01,732
You are not looking for anybody and can't find anybody.

376
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:05,015
You do not have time to work for anybody.

377
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,968
You have not heard anything or seen anything.

378
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,568
And what do I for an encore?
- Nothing.

379
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:13,887
Keep on doing nothing for a reasonable time...

380
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,005
and I'll come back and place another 500 on your desk.

381
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,521
Side by side.

382
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:24,354
And for whom am I doing this?
- Winslow Wong, ...

383
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,836
... that is I.

384
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,753
I like a man who uses good grammar. You impress me.

385
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,436
... Whom sent you?

386
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:36,870
A man who would rather spill money than blood.

387
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,827
But...

388
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:43,541
also a man who would spill blood if he had no choice.

389
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,933
Take this back to your leader, Mr. Wong.

390
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:59,292
Tell him you met the last of a dying Dynasty...

391
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:04,529
... King of the fools. Unassailably virtuous...

392
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,767
... invariably broke.

393
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:13,719
Okay.

394
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:50,405
Come on, everybody. Break it up. Let me in there.

395
00:35:58,128 --> 00:35:59,356
Termites, Lieutenant.

396
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:02,164
Want to come in, sit down?

397
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,644
We'd better go for a walk.

398
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:05,199
Why?

399
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:08,433
Because I say we'd better take a walk. Right?

400
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,547
Well, let's take a walk.

401
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,348
This, uhh?- Be my guest, Lieutenant.

402
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,183
Alright.

403
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:32,533
Ever read the Bay City paper?

404
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,818
All that rape and homicide?

405
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:37,332
There's an article in there about a party named Klausen.

406
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,373
Ice pick case, Marlowe.

407
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,046
That's two in a row. A trend, maybe?

408
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:46,759
What did you hear from that hotel cop, Hady?

409
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,561
We lack rapport.

410
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,236
Okay, let's get off Hady and concentrate on you.

411
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:55,280
Hicks was dead when you got there, right?

412
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:57,716
Well, as we trained detectives say, he was terminal.

413
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:03,232
So he could hardly have taken one of your visiting cards?

414
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,340
Stop trying to scare me.
- No, tell me about this.

415
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:14,262
You found my card on Hicks' body?
- That's your card isn't it?

416
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:16,100
Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator.

417
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,904
We missed it the first time.

418
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:25,615
I gave him one of my cards to Hady.

419
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:30,610
We went upstairs while I called you, he searched the body.

420
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,209
You figure that he could have...

421
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:38,325
... taken the money and put my card on Hicks' body...

422
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:40,403
... while my back was turned?

423
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:42,957
Well, it's a possibility.

424
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,193
Would you know Sonny Steelgrave if you saw him?

425
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:50,270
Yes, why?

426
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,993
Was he dark, late 30s...

427
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,306
... slick, something for the girls?

428
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,704
Still punching around with that icepick theory?

429
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:01,989
Trying to tie Steelgrave into with Klausen and Hicks?

430
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,223
Does he get out in public much?
- No, not much.

431
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:09,060
Where does he go?
- He owns The Dancers.

432
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:14,295
Steelgrave sometimes takes little chicken broads up there.

433
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:24,848
Marlowe.
- Yes, Mr. Marlowe, this way.

434
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:44,154
Mr. Marlowe...
- What is this?

435
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:45,949
Compliments of Mr. Steelgrave.

436
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:49,430
Thank you.

437
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:52,263
Friends in high places. Who is it? He rich?

438
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:56,864
He is. Even his tax bracket is elevated.

439
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:07,216
Delicious.

440
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:09,374
Might say baroque.

441
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:18,168
To a late breakfast.
- I'll drink to that.

442
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:20,321
All my friends are going to Lake Tropsure.

443
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:25,117
I see a trial balloon. I 'll make the coffee.

444
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:28,755
Mr. Marlowe, phone call please.
- Thank you.

445
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,305
Did you tell anyone we were here?
- No.

446
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:36,751
Well, that makes two of us.

447
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:38,952
It's just a way to get you alone.

448
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,186
I didn't come here for the cherry jubilee.

449
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,061
Okay. But take care of yourself.

450
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,427
Winslow, you suckered me out here, you devil.

451
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:30,787
Take the money Marlowe.
- Not a chance.

452
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,070
You can't refuse me this time.
- You watch me closely.

453
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,384
Can you remember the alternative, Mr. Marlowe?

454
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,060
You're a paper tiger, Winslow.

455
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:44,419
You can't do anything in your boss's restaurant.

456
00:40:46,982 --> 00:40:49,700
Mr. Marlowe, I have my instructions.

457
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:52,809
That's what I'm counting on, Winslow.

458
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:57,690
What are you going to do, break another coat rack?

459
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,365
You're very effective, but I've seen dogs do better on television.

460
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:14,033
You're light on your feet, Winslow.

461
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,234
Are you just a little gay?

462
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:09,352
I didn't come to seduce you.
-Good...

463
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:12,066
Can I come in?

464
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:15,824
I had to walk miles the other night.

465
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:20,383
All steps in the right direction?
- I've never suspected anybody.

466
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:22,778
There's someone here.

467
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:25,381
Coffee?

468
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,536
No thanks, I have a taxi with the meter running.

469
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:29,936
I've heard from Orrin.

470
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:34,453
He decided to rejoin the establishment?
- He's staying with a doctor.

471
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:37,295
Your mother ought to be happy.

472
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,933
A Dr. Vincent Lagardie.

473
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:43,486
Okay, so he's staying with a Dr. Lagardie.

474
00:42:43,651 --> 00:42:44,843
The mob is after him.

475
00:42:45,049 --> 00:42:47,278
They're are all busy making movies!

476
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:50,040
Please, we have to go there right now to help.

477
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:51,473
He's afraid to leave.

478
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:55,482
After all, I did pay you!
- I gave it back.

479
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:57,677
I offered it to you again.

480
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:03,987
And a lot more.

481
00:43:04,674 --> 00:43:06,186
You'd never have forgiven me.

482
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:13,537
You don't know me, but when a man rejects a woman...

483
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,345
... he owes her something.

484
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,779
An old Kansas proverb?
- Philip, I'm frantic!

485
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:20,774
Philip?
- They're going to kill him.

486
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:23,613
I have the address right here.
- I already have the address.

487
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:26,973
You have a taxi waiting outside and the meter is running.

488
00:43:28,736 --> 00:43:31,328
Philip, you don't know me.

489
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:33,324
But then that's your loss.

490
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:45,838
What was that?

491
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:48,593
Sorta glad she did that.

492
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:51,193
I noticed your left jab was a little slow.

493
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:55,950
She reminded me of somebody.
- Don't we all?

494
00:43:58,951 --> 00:43:59,986
Want to have some breakfast?

495
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,969
All I see is two people.

496
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:23,321
Hardly disastrous to Miss Wald's reputation.

497
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:27,483
Nothing for the sponsors or the network to be concerned about.

498
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,440
Then why are you talking to me?

499
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:34,443
I still enjoy talking to the man in the street.

500
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:37,879
Then you won't mind if I show these to Homicide.

501
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,394
Why should they be interested?

502
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,275
I don't think we'll be doing business, Mr. Crowell.

503
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:46,823
But thanks for taking my call.
- Wait a minute.

504
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:50,388
What might happen if you show those pictures to the police?

505
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:55,179
I'd have to connect it with something they are working on.

506
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:57,581
Something that happened a couple nights ago...

507
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,100
... one of the cheap sin spots in town.

508
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:01,782
The Alvarado Hotel.

509
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:04,140
I'd connect it up through the girl.

510
00:45:05,658 --> 00:45:06,648
Miss Wald?

511
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,127
Won't talk to me.

512
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:10,134
That's why I'm talking to you.

513
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:11,814
She told me about it.

514
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:14,652
She told me you tried to force her into hiring you...

515
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:18,766
... on the grounds that she had been close to the murder scene.

516
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:20,687
Did she say how close?

517
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:24,875
She didn't say.

518
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:27,394
<i>What?
- The 11:30</i>

519
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:28,433
Yes, thank you.

520
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:31,997
You amuse the hell out of me, Marlowe. You really do.

521
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,153
Trying to use me as a shovel to dig yourself out of a jam.

522
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,870
The jam I am in is nothing compared...

523
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,310
... to what the star of your show would be in...

524
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:42,465
... if I hadn't done the thing that got me into it.

525
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,621
What are you doing in the next hour?

526
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:47,946
Recounting my trumps.

527
00:45:50,504 --> 00:45:51,654
Well, let's count them together.

528
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:02,011
We got to where you were thinking of going downtown with those pictures.

529
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,086
What then?
- We didn't get that far.

530
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:05,653
We only got as far as her calling you.

531
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:09,565
Did she tell you she also called the man in the pictures.

532
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,761
She neglected to mention it.

533
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,278
He and some of his soldiers were waiting outside when I left.

534
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:18,993
Do you know who he is?

535
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:20,875
Don't you?

536
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:25,392
You're making me more unhappy by the minute, Mr. Marlowe.

537
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,990
Hold it back there, please!

538
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,103
I can't do anything until I get back from London.

539
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:41,102
You were saying?

540
00:46:41,664 --> 00:46:45,098
Her boy friend tried to buy me first, then bury me.

541
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:47,053
I resent both overtures.

542
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,331
Where does it stand right now?

543
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:53,124
You tell me.

544
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,445
She was great, wasn't she?

545
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:00,482
On the film?

546
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:03,726
<i>But he must answer. </i>

547
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:07,959
Fine.

548
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:13,318
<i> Why don't you answer the phone?
- The show is out there. </i>

549
00:47:15,078 --> 00:47:17,226
Yes.
- good?

550
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:26,989
<i> Where are you? </i>

551
00:47:28,427 --> 00:47:33,135
Well the darling of millions has got herself and the rest of us...

552
00:47:33,305 --> 00:47:35,771
... who put her where she is in one hell of a mess.

553
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,176
If it were any actress it would be bad enough, ...

554
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,573
... but in this series? The part she plays?

555
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:48,769
Did you ever see the show?
- No, I haven't.

556
00:47:49,092 --> 00:47:50,683
It's the top rated sitcom in the country.

557
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,567
A situation comedy.

558
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:57,878
Can you imagine what would happen if it got out that our poor little Mary...

559
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:00,603
... was shacking up with public enemy number one?

560
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:18,186
Everything's set, Mr. Crowell!

561
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:21,621
You don't really want the cops to have those pictures, do you?

562
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:24,016
No, Marlowe, that's the last thing I... .

563
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:27,022
Little Mavis Wald. The public would chew her to pieces.

564
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,649
Not to mention the sponsor and network.

565
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,450
The federal gangster's girl.

566
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:34,726
The number one gangster, no less.

567
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:38,971
What do you want?
- Same thing I wanted from the start.

568
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:41,685
What she wouldn't give me: the right to work in her best interests.

569
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,364
By supressing evidence.

570
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:47,236
If it was evidence. The police can't determine that...

571
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:48,124
... without smearing. Maybe I can.

572
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:51,154
They don't have time to worry about reputations.

573
00:48:51,484 --> 00:48:52,279
You do.

574
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:55,030
Come on. Why are you doing this?

575
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,510
Steelgrave's boys spoiled the coat in my best suit.

576
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:02,709
Where would I be if I didn't put a stop to things like that?

577
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:03,870
What is your price?

578
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:05,712
$ 100 a day and expenses.

579
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:10,386
And a letter employing me to investigate blackmail of one of your stars.

580
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:16,694
that a man in my spot dreads over

581
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:17,932
all other mistakes.

582
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:21,418
I will find myself doing business with somebody I can trust.

583
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,612
and I'm going to be too damned smart to trust him.

584
00:49:25,216 --> 00:49:27,524
Take this letter to
Mr. Philip Marlowe.

585
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:29,490
" Dear Mr. Marlowe.

586
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:33,201
This agency employs you to investigate...

587
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:36,644
on behalf of one its television personalities, a certain matter...

588
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,240
... the particulars of which you have been given verbally.

589
00:49:39,406 --> 00:49:42,159
You fee is to be $ 100
day plus expenses...

590
00:49:42,325 --> 00:49:44,516
... plus a deposit of $ 500.

591
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:45,909
Sincerely, etc... . "

592
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,553
My driver will take you to the office.

593
00:49:53,995 --> 00:49:55,586
I'm just going to have to trust you, Marlowe.

594
00:49:56,992 --> 00:49:58,628
I hate making mistakes.

595
00:50:33,684 --> 00:50:35,718
<i>Alright, lunch everybody. </i>

596
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:37,752
<i> 40 minutes for the crew. </i>

597
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:39,592
<i> time for the rest of you. </i>

598
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,557
<i> first shot after lunch
will be Miss Wald. </i>

599
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:44,592
<i> Please be back punctually. </i>

600
00:50:56,865 --> 00:50:59,139
Who let you in?
- Mr Crowell.

601
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,455
I do not want you to work for me.

602
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:08,930
I go to ridiculous extremes to get clients.

603
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:10,493
Even collect rare photos.

604
00:51:24,725 --> 00:51:26,280
You like a drink?
- No, thank you.

605
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,394
Alright, so you know.

606
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:34,350
It could happen to any red-blooded girl.

607
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:37,153
Do you love him?
- You mean will I give him up?

608
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:38,149
Something like that.

609
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:41,784
Do not know if I could, or that I want to.

610
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:44,980
Anyway, what good will that do now?

611
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:47,262
Who took the pictures?
- I don't know.

612
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:52,174
Who's trying to blackmail you?
- I don't know.

613
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:57,168
Could you be persuaded to give those negatives to me?

614
00:51:57,337 --> 00:52:00,372
Mr. Crowell hired me to decide what's in your best interests.

615
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,604
I know what's in my best interests.

616
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:06,925
Fold that letter up and forget this job. Go away, Mr. Marlowe.

617
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:10,204
You can't win them all!
- Did Steelgrave have Hicks killed?

618
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:12,686
You remember Hicks?

619
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:15,153
He was stretched out on the bed in the Alvarado hotel.

620
00:52:15,324 --> 00:52:17,314
Sonny did not know there was a picture of us...

621
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:20,041
... not until you came to my place and I called him.

622
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:23,588
Leaves the blackmailer, and whoever else is in this with him.

623
00:52:23,758 --> 00:52:26,109
You don't think he will let you off the easy way, do you?

624
00:52:26,516 --> 00:52:29,744
You aren't going to follow my advice?
- In one ear and out the other.

625
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,283
What?

626
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:32,863
You're on, Miss Wald.
- Thank you.

627
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:36,185
Thank you very much for coming by.

628
00:52:38,546 --> 00:52:40,216
You know, Miss Wald, ...
- Excuse me.

629
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:44,494
You could make life easier for all of us by laying your cards on the table.

630
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,292
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

631
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:48,807
I'll be in touch.

632
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:52,411
Yes?

633
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:56,960
I'll be right there.

634
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,066
Stay with it.

635
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,680
Hello.
- Hello, I'm Dr. Lagardie.

636
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,911
How do you do. I'm looking for a Mr. Quest.

637
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,274
Orrin Quest.

638
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:14,516
Who?
- Quest.

639
00:53:14,678 --> 00:53:17,429
" Q " as in quintessential, ...

640
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,742
... "U" as in uninhibited, ...

641
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:22,266
... "E" as in extrasensory...

642
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,348
... " S " as in subliminal, ...

643
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,498
... and " T" as inTruth.

644
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,897
We chatted on the phone. About a Mr. Klausen.

645
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:31,577
Please, come along.

646
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,417
There is no Orrin Quest among our patients.

647
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:37,298
You don't know him at all?

648
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,529
The name is completely unfamiliar to me.

649
00:53:41,378 --> 00:53:43,332
Sit down.
- Thank you.

650
00:53:44,093 --> 00:53:46,891
That's funny. His sister says he was here.

651
00:53:47,613 --> 00:53:48,839
Hiding out.

652
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:50,839
From what?

653
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,476
You tell me.

654
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:57,883
I could be wrong, but smelling all that pot smoke in Klausen's place...

655
00:53:58,683 --> 00:54:03,036
... and his calling you, I jumped to conclusions.

656
00:54:03,279 --> 00:54:07,156
I told you I don't know a Havin Klausen, or an Orrin Quest.

657
00:54:07,516 --> 00:54:08,744
I think you're wasting your time.

658
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:12,745
You don't mind if I call you a liar, doctor?

659
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,505
I should I call the police and have them run you out.

660
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:20,740
But my field is special children. Unusual children.

661
00:54:21,306 --> 00:54:24,897
Sometimes it`s better to let them bang on the walls and scream their heads off.

662
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:28,257
Until they`re prepared for reason.
Scream away, Mr. Marlowe.

663
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,125
A fellow named Klausen and
a grifter named Hicks...

664
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:34,331
both killed...
by the same man, ...

665
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,687
... but not necessarily for the same reason.

666
00:54:37,132 --> 00:54:40,362
Hicks because he muscled in on somebody else`s schtick.

667
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:43,878
And Klausen because he was a babbling junkie.

668
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:47,679
Not exactly a master of the zipped lip. Any good so far?

669
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:49,996
What is all this to do with me?

670
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:54,318
Question: what was the schtick?

671
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,549
Answer: Some photographs.

672
00:54:57,157 --> 00:54:59,465
A good man could make a fortune...

673
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:01,034
... out of these particular photographs.

674
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:03,907
Question: Who took the photographs?

675
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:06,710
Presumption: Orrin Quest,
the boy I'm looking for.

676
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,897
And why this particular subject...

677
00:55:11,065 --> 00:55:13,579
without their knowing they were being photographed?

678
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:17,576
Time to take a flier. Let's say Quest knew the girl...

679
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,492
. . let's even say the girl was his sister.

680
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:24,652
Pretty well screamed out by now?

681
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:27,204
Not quite.

682
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:31,728
These ice pick jobs.

683
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:37,202
They say the Steelgrave gang was taught the technique

684
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:39,722
by a young intern in Brooklyn.

685
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,874
And it worked...

686
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:49,384
What happened...

687
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:51,988
to a bright young medic like that?

688
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:56,582
Did he come west when they did?

689
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,140
Did he come to...

690
00:56:02,627 --> 00:56:07,378
open a clinic... for kids...

691
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:15,410
well... to cover illegal activities?

692
00:56:42,077 --> 00:56:44,348
Don't worry, it's not lethal.

693
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,670
I need a little more time.

694
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:50,303
Not much, just to clear things up.

695
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,968
What's the matter?
- Have you got a band aid?

696
01:00:30,178 --> 01:00:32,133
Ooh, you'd better take that off.
- In here?

697
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:38,199
Oh honey. First aid, rubbing alcohol, bandaids...

698
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,121
You should get a tetanus shot. That looks deep.

699
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,485
Where I can find Mavis?

700
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:46,599
Mavis??
- She's not at her place.

701
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:48,754
And why should I turn you over to her?

702
01:00:49,322 --> 01:00:52,438
Because underneath those pasties there's a size 40 heart.

703
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:54,951
I thought you liked Mavis.

704
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:58,073
I do like her but why should she get all the goodies?

705
01:00:58,515 --> 01:01:01,311
She's a star. Give me that.

706
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:06,348
If you believe that Mavis and I studied at Lee Strasbourg...

707
01:01:07,388 --> 01:01:10,104
Thank you, nurse. You're wanted in the premmies.

708
01:01:12,224 --> 01:01:15,295
Will you come back tonight?

709
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:18,816
Am I under oath?
- Sure.

710
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:21,485
Probably not.

711
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,247
They'll be shooting late at the studio.

712
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:27,565
Very well.

713
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,325
Thank you, Doctor.
- My pleasure.

714
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:33,446
Thank you, nurse.
- Any time. Call me.

715
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:37,439
Honey, that is a no-no.

716
01:01:41,443 --> 01:01:43,237
Okay, kids, that's fine.

717
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,671
Give me a minute, huh? How long did...

718
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,299
Miss Wald...

719
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:02,025
Your brother...
- Don't you have anything else to do?

720
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:05,052
He took the pictures of you and Steelgrave, right?

721
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:07,176
He's dead.

722
01:02:12,338 --> 01:02:14,645
Someone shot him a couple of hours ago.

723
01:02:15,894 --> 01:02:17,042
You're making that up.

724
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:24,402
I have to tell Orfamay too. You want to come along?

725
01:02:24,686 --> 01:02:25,835
All set, Miss Wald?

726
01:02:29,644 --> 01:02:30,918
Where is Steelgrave tonight?

727
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:35,473
Don't try to blame him.

728
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,669
I talked to him on the phone more than an hour ago.

729
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:40,473
. . in his place at Mount Wilson.

730
01:02:40,915 --> 01:02:42,506
That's one thing about Steelgrave.

731
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:44,703
He's never around when the shooting starts.

732
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:48,786
Maybe that's because he knows when it will start.

733
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:50,467
Please Miss Wald.

734
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:10,680
Orfamay Quest?

735
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,688
Checked out.
- To where, did she say?

736
01:03:14,848 --> 01:03:16,884
She asked for a train schedule to Kansas.

737
01:03:17,368 --> 01:03:20,438
If that's any help...
- Every little bit helps. Thank you.

738
01:03:20,723 --> 01:03:21,518
Any time.

739
01:03:53,778 --> 01:03:56,051
Are you going to leave without saying goodbye?

740
01:03:56,216 --> 01:03:59,683
After all we've meant to each other?
- I told you I leave Saturday.

741
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:01,362
But it's only Friday.

742
01:04:01,932 --> 01:04:03,126
I ran out of money.

743
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,560
And out of friends.

744
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:07,077
I'm going home. My train
leaves in an hour.

745
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:09,316
And I can do without your company.

746
01:04:09,485 --> 01:04:11,554
Here, I'll help you.
- No, thank you.

747
01:04:11,724 --> 01:04:12,599
Orfamay.

748
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:14,551
Orfamay!

749
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:17,473
What do you want?

750
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:20,352
I thought we could go up
to my place and have a drink.

751
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,354
I'll give you a shoulder to cry on.
Oh!

752
01:04:28,191 --> 01:04:30,577
Miss!

753
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:32,105
Miss!

754
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:34,495
Hot chocolate, please.
- Coffee.

755
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,064
I'm sick of this stupid city

756
01:04:36,225 --> 01:04:37,737
It's can be a meat grinder.

757
01:04:38,344 --> 01:04:40,378
How come you're being so nice to me all of a sudden?

758
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:43,213
I get an attack of the nices every now and then.

759
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:46,767
You're getting ready to tell me something nasty, isn't it?

760
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:48,644
Yes.

761
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:51,881
About Orrin, isn't it?

762
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:53,728
Yes.

763
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:56,797
They killed him, didn't they?

764
01:04:58,129 --> 01:04:59,163
Yes.

765
01:05:01,805 --> 01:05:04,602
When?
- Tonight at Lagardie clinic.

766
01:05:05,004 --> 01:05:07,673
You could have saved him had you gone there when I told you!

767
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,273
But you had that girl in your place!

768
01:05:09,518 --> 01:05:11,551
You couldn't bother to save a fellow human being.

769
01:05:11,716 --> 01:05:13,706
Not when it might interfere with your animal pleasures!

770
01:05:14,276 --> 01:05:16,869
He was alive when I got there with an ice pick in his hand.

771
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:18,544
Doesn't that tell you anything?

772
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,703
Are you accusing my brother?

773
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:22,461
You know about those ice pick murders?

774
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,300
Why shouldn't I, they're all over the papers.

775
01:05:24,827 --> 01:05:28,704
When do the tears start to flow for your long-lost brother?

776
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,900
Officer, I believe this man knows about a murder.

777
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:33,770
This a joke?

778
01:05:33,939 --> 01:05:36,293
My brother's been killed
and he was there.

779
01:05:37,339 --> 01:05:38,529
Is she putting me on?

780
01:05:38,736 --> 01:05:40,851
I was just about to call Homicide.

781
01:05:41,613 --> 01:05:43,285
Oh, you were, were you?

782
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:46,800
I hope they lock you up forever.

783
01:05:46,969 --> 01:05:49,642
License 643 295.

784
01:05:51,766 --> 01:05:53,880
Okay, Lieutenant, it's all yours.
- Alright.

785
01:05:55,842 --> 01:05:58,231
Now you just start to talk.

786
01:05:58,399 --> 01:06:00,389
Let it flow. You know what I mean.

787
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,833
Want me to make a statement?
- Yes, full statement.

788
01:06:02,997 --> 01:06:05,272
A voluntary and without coercion.

789
01:06:05,474 --> 01:06:06,748
Everything you know, alright?

790
01:06:06,914 --> 01:06:09,266
Then ask. If you don't like the answers book me.

791
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:10,910
And if you book me I get to make a phone call.

792
01:06:11,072 --> 01:06:14,823
Wait. Don't tell me that you've been strictly legal in this...

793
01:06:15,227 --> 01:06:16,376
Case??
- Yes

794
01:06:16,446 --> 01:06:17,138
No.

795
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:19,296
I suppose you have a client to protect?

796
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:21,418
Maybe.
- He did. She dropped...

797
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:24,970
Ask the questions, please.
- What happened at Klausen's place?

798
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,848
I went out there looking for her brother.

799
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:31,722
His sister told me she got a call from him at the Lagardie clinic...

800
01:06:31,975 --> 01:06:33,123
... and I went out there.

801
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:35,363
Care to see my back?
- Wait a minute.

802
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:38,640
Why would he try to pick you? You were his pal, come to save him.

803
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:41,446
I was just something between him and the light. Something that moved.

804
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:44,245
Maybe he thought I was the person who shot him.

805
01:06:44,404 --> 01:06:47,678
A man in his condition acts from instinct.

806
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:49,433
He does not invent new techniques.

807
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:52,829
So I believe Orrin Quest killed both Klausen and Hicks.

808
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:56,631
What about Lagardie? You got anything on him?

809
01:06:59,075 --> 01:06:59,823
We checked on him.

810
01:06:59,993 --> 01:07:03,505
He could have killed me and he didn't, so he probably hasn't killed anybody.

811
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:07,545
But finding an icepick in his place, made me think of Steelgrave.

812
01:07:07,707 --> 01:07:10,822
That's pretty wild, Marlowe.
That's tenacious, you know.

813
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:15,099
Would I do myself any good if I went out and tried to tighten it up?

814
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:17,447
I won't leave town.

815
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:21,012
Thanks.

816
01:07:25,612 --> 01:07:27,682
I don't want to run this into the ground

817
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,886
One more little favor?
- Yes, what?

818
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,444
Orfamay Quest.

819
01:07:32,968 --> 01:07:36,478
Could you arrange to keep her around town for a day or two?

820
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:37,554
On what grounds?

821
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:40,320
Well, I don't know...

822
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:45,432
Tell her you've decided to draw and quarter me and you want her to whip the horses.

823
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,188
She won't be able to pass that up.

824
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:10,317
Is the party over?

825
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:21,467
Trying to break a lease, right?

826
01:10:22,873 --> 01:10:24,544
Speak softly, please.

827
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:26,540
Sorry.

828
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,174
Tough day at the office?

829
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:36,296
Tough day? An average day in a detective's life.

830
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:37,819
I've been, ...

831
01:10:39,662 --> 01:10:42,014
stabbed... ...

832
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:44,655
mugged... and generally snookered.

833
01:10:46,816 --> 01:10:48,373
I ache all over.

834
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,126
My office qualifies for urban renewal...

835
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:56,165
the cops... envy my successes, ...

836
01:10:58,008 --> 01:11:00,121
they're trying to take my license away, ...

837
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:01,764
... I'd say that's an average day.

838
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,187
I'm almost afraid to ask why you're here.

839
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,993
I'm almost afraid to tell you.

840
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:15,263
Mavis??

841
01:11:17,832 --> 01:11:21,424
She tried to call you, couldn't find you, and she got me.

842
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:26,253
I'll wait a minute.

843
01:11:40,135 --> 01:11:41,885
I think you can service her.

844
01:11:43,372 --> 01:11:45,165
All my clients have troubles.

845
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:46,927
That's why they come to me.

846
01:11:51,365 --> 01:11:53,035
Why do you bother with them?

847
01:11:54,963 --> 01:11:56,439
Why don't you get out of it?

848
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,872
Stock options.

849
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:01,593
Pension plan.

850
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,717
What kind of trouble is Mavis in?

851
01:12:52,358 --> 01:12:55,313
I don't know. I was
on stage when called.

852
01:12:55,474 --> 01:12:58,384
The message was: get Philip Marlowe. I need him now.

853
01:13:00,912 --> 01:13:03,946
You do a lot of fetching and carrying for Mavis, don't you?

854
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:07,982
Why not?
We go waaay back.

855
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:11,015
What are friends for?

856
01:13:12,942 --> 01:13:13,896
Something like that.

857
01:13:22,973 --> 01:13:24,531
The Steelgrave place.
- Yes

858
01:13:49,912 --> 01:13:51,184
She's not alone in there.

859
01:13:53,269 --> 01:13:54,383
He's there too.

860
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,657
It's not like Steelgrave to leave the gate unlatched.

861
01:13:58,864 --> 01:14:00,012
Where are all his troops?

862
01:14:01,463 --> 01:14:03,179
Now and then he likes to be alone.

863
01:14:03,942 --> 01:14:05,658
Speaking from experience?

864
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,928
Once upon a time he was mine.

865
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:14,611
Until Mavis took him.

866
01:14:16,412 --> 01:14:17,240
You know?

867
01:14:17,889 --> 01:14:19,288
I'm great between the lines.

868
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:23,001
I only suffer. Every winner has to be a loser, right?

869
01:14:26,603 --> 01:14:28,275
Be careful in there.

870
01:14:34,758 --> 01:14:35,667
I'll wait.

871
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:37,991
No, go on home, Dolores.

872
01:16:05,846 --> 01:16:06,675
Miss Wald...

873
01:16:07,923 --> 01:16:09,720
I got word you tried to call me.

874
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:16,987
Mavis??

875
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:23,987
Come on!

876
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:39,895
Hear, drink it.

877
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:41,289
Come on.

878
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:45,685
More.

879
01:16:53,927 --> 01:16:54,995
Where's yours?

880
01:16:55,885 --> 01:16:57,399
Someone has to drive.

881
01:16:59,325 --> 01:17:01,961
You're rather nice for what you are.

882
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:06,673
Well, it could be the brandy, the altitude, or shock ...

883
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,313
... You're stalling for time.

884
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:14,421
For someone to get here or get away from here.

885
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:15,779
Where is Steelgrave?

886
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:20,783
I liked him.

887
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:23,863
I liked him a lot.

888
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:33,733
Going to wrap it in a handkerchief?

889
01:17:36,496 --> 01:17:37,404
Where'd you leave him?

890
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,326
Behind that chair.

891
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:41,964
In the corner.

892
01:18:05,872 --> 01:18:08,907
Well it's been one hell of a day.
- What did you expect?

893
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:11,980
He killed my brother.
- Your brother was pushing too hard.

894
01:18:12,148 --> 01:18:13,135
But to kill him?

895
01:18:13,386 --> 01:18:16,376
Did you tell Steelgrave that it was your brother blackmailing you?

896
01:18:16,545 --> 01:18:17,736
Of course I didn't.

897
01:18:18,183 --> 01:18:19,296
Somebody did.

898
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:22,490
He did not care about those pictures except for your sake.

899
01:18:22,938 --> 01:18:24,928
He was only trying to protect you.

900
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:27,448
Well, he certainly proved that.

901
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:28,967
Yes, he did in his own way.

902
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:32,601
The same way he came after me
when he thought I was pressing.

903
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:36,322
It will cost a lot to fix this.

904
01:18:37,727 --> 01:18:38,841
I'm not worth it.

905
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:40,917
Tell me why you had the gun with you.

906
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:45,041
The gun?
- Don't stop to think.

907
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,395
Tell me: did you mean to kill him!
- Why not?

908
01:18:47,559 --> 01:18:50,117
I thought I meant something to him. I guess I was vain.

909
01:18:50,278 --> 01:18:51,027
Fool.

910
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:54,666
Go home, Miss Wald.
- What?

911
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,629
Go on home.
- You say!

912
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:58,508
You're my client. Do as you're told.

913
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,383
Go on! Get out!
-I'm going, okay?

914
01:19:58,863 --> 01:19:59,694
Homicide, please.

915
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:08,685
Yes, this baby's been working.

916
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:20,527
What is the story, Marlowe?

917
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:25,956
A girl came to my office to tell me that a client of mine was in danger.

918
01:20:26,601 --> 01:20:29,591
Drove me up here, dropped me off and went home.

919
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,589
The girl's name?

920
01:20:31,519 --> 01:20:33,348
Dolores Gonzales.
- Your client?

921
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:36,110
Another party altogether.
- Your client's name?

922
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,022
Not yet, Lieutenant.

923
01:20:38,314 --> 01:20:39,540
Your rules, right?

924
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:42,384
You here when he got it?

925
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:44,746
No.
- Who was?

926
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:48,263
He was.
- Who else?

927
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:52,694
I won't lie, I don't know who was here when he got it.

928
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,537
Who was here when you got here?

929
01:20:57,378 --> 01:20:58,331
He was.

930
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:04,641
Alright, Fred, put
the cuffs on this guy.

931
01:21:05,452 --> 01:21:06,327
Behind.

932
01:21:09,889 --> 01:21:10,842
Alright, Marlowe.

933
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:12,677
Let's go.

934
01:21:15,365 --> 01:21:18,398
If I didn't have enough trouble, I have to worry about you too.

935
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,030
Do you know how I spend my days?

936
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:25,033
Turning over dirty underwear.

937
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,029
And my nights?

938
01:21:27,955 --> 01:21:30,749
Spent snooping rotten teeth.|- Alright.

939
01:21:30,912 --> 01:21:34,662
I go up a dark stairway after some gun punk with a skin full of horse

940
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:37,295
Maybe tomorrow I don't get up the stairs.

941
01:21:37,467 --> 01:21:39,741
Or I get a confession from some guy...

942
01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:41,655
they swear I beat it out of the bastard.

943
01:21:41,823 --> 01:21:43,414
Nothing I do is right. Never. Not once.

944
01:21:43,579 --> 01:21:45,095
If I make one mistake, ...

945
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:49,012
I'm back in uniform, out in the streets with the hookers yelling at me.

946
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:51,564
I taking tire chains away from tough kids. But that's not enough...

947
01:21:51,736 --> 01:21:56,044
... I have you. I gotta have me a shark with a private license...

948
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:57,327
... suppressing information.

949
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:00,878
Concealing evidence, framing setups that wouldn't fool a baby.
impossible to believe.

950
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:05,118
You wouldn't mind if I call you a cheap double-crossing keyhole peeper!

951
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:06,843
You want me to mind?
- I'd love it. I'd love it.

952
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:07,833
Okay, then I mind.

953
01:22:08,003 --> 01:22:10,754
Your license is dead as of now!
- When the commissioner says it's dead!

954
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,671
Let's get one thing straight!
-I'm doing this my way!

955
01:22:13,959 --> 01:22:16,469
I'm waiting for this bird to crack wise. He hasn't cracked wise yet.

956
01:22:16,635 --> 01:22:17,590
The price of partice!

957
01:22:17,755 --> 01:22:20,109
Not as fast.
- Come on...

958
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:22,102
Not so good tonight are you lieutenant?
-Shut the hell up!

959
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,578
Lieutenant, calm down.
- I don't need any excuse...

960
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,183
I'll take care of this comedian.

961
01:22:32,224 --> 01:22:36,294
The new type of third degree. The police beat the hell out of each other...

962
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:38,773
... the suspect cracks up from the agony of watching.

963
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:40,693
It never fails.

964
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:45,243
You knew I hit, Fred.
-  Nobody hit me, Christy.

965
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:47,769
Nobody I can remember, Fred...

966
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,966
Tell this character to get out of here. He's on short rope.

967
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:55,520
Tell him to get his ass home. Directly home!

968
01:22:55,884 --> 01:22:58,795
Tell him I'll be in touch with him. Very close touch.

969
01:23:02,921 --> 01:23:03,749
Get out of here, baby.

970
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,908
Get out now.
-  How? I don't have transportation.

971
01:23:06,077 --> 01:23:08,066
Try hitchhiking and don't press your luck.

972
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:28,895
What?

973
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:37,329
Who do you suppose will clean up this mess?

974
01:23:38,732 --> 01:23:39,482
Where are they?

975
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:40,918
Looking for something?

976
01:23:41,409 --> 01:23:42,726
You know what I'm looking for.

977
01:23:43,446 --> 01:23:44,323
The pictures.

978
01:23:44,727 --> 01:23:46,363
Now that your brother is dead...

979
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:49,842
Grab the pictures and blackmail your own sister.

980
01:23:51,243 --> 01:23:54,515
Well I burned the pictures and negatives, and they made a lovely flame.

981
01:23:54,679 --> 01:23:55,633
You what?

982
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:00,067
Give me your purse, little sister.

983
01:24:00,317 --> 01:24:01,951
Don't come any closer to me.

984
01:24:02,434 --> 01:24:03,263
Get away from me!

985
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:04,586
Drops it Mavis!

986
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:07,184
It's my purse!

987
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:09,339
It's mine, Mavis!

988
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:10,496
It's mine!

989
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:12,179
It's mine!

990
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:16,262
It's mine!
- Sonny gave you that money, didn't he?

991
01:24:16,422 --> 01:24:17,614
I don't know any Sonny.

992
01:24:17,782 --> 01:24:20,852
The smell of lilacs in his place that night was a little girl smell.

993
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,326
You went up there to tell where Orrin was hiding.

994
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:25,134
How much did he pay you to tell?

995
01:24:25,297 --> 01:24:26,410
About an even $ 1,000.

996
01:24:27,534 --> 01:24:29,523
Well, it was Orrin's own fault.

997
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:32,046
He took the pictures of you with that gangster.

998
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:33,765
And he promised me some of the money.

999
01:24:33,928 --> 01:24:36,885
And I didn't hear from him any more. So I came to find him.

1000
01:24:37,207 --> 01:24:40,832
Sister, you got our brother killed!
- Mavis, that's not true.

1001
01:24:41,003 --> 01:24:42,356
I warned Orrin.

1002
01:24:42,522 --> 01:24:44,591
I said that if you don't take care of me

1003
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,794
I'll tell Mr. Steelgrave where you are.

1004
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,635
He said he had lost the pictures.

1005
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:49,832
And I didn't believe him.

1006
01:24:49,996 --> 01:24:53,271
So I took a taxi and went to see Mr. Steelgrave.

1007
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:55,669
You know how expensive that is?

1008
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:59,099
Then I talked to Philip to go by the clinic and protect Orrin...

1009
01:24:59,268 --> 01:25:00,586
... even though he didn't deserve it!

1010
01:25:00,748 --> 01:25:03,499
It's not my fault your boys got there before Philip!

1011
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:06,337
He was our brother?
-Don't you go blaming me!

1012
01:25:06,504 --> 01:25:08,732
You had no business going off and leaving us!

1013
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:11,652
Orfamay, when did I forget about you or Mom?

1014
01:25:11,818 --> 01:25:12,854
Or even poor Orrin?

1015
01:25:13,018 --> 01:25:15,134
And I always came to see you whenever...

1016
01:25:15,298 --> 01:25:16,887
Oh, sure...

1017
01:25:17,055 --> 01:25:18,373
Always ask and no guilt feelings...

1018
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:21,000
pardoned now!

1019
01:25:21,171 --> 01:25:24,049
I tried to take the blame for you after you shot Sonny.

1020
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:27,680
After I what?
- I kept the gun in my apartment...

1021
01:25:27,846 --> 01:25:29,836
... and after you came to see me it was gone.

1022
01:25:30,004 --> 01:25:31,197
Well I didn't take it.

1023
01:25:34,842 --> 01:25:36,637
I hope your mother will be very happy.

1024
01:25:44,313 --> 01:25:46,143
Anyway,
Who can prove it?

1025
01:25:46,311 --> 01:25:47,710
What can prove it? You?

1026
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:51,191
Who are you?
- Nobody.

1027
01:25:51,429 --> 01:25:53,860
That's right a nobody!
A cheap nobody!

1028
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:54,979
I said it first.

1029
01:25:55,344 --> 01:25:57,379
$ 50 means bye to you.

1030
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:01,816
You! You!

1031
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:03,968
You! Get away from me!

1032
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:06,695
I hate you, Mavis!

1033
01:26:06,855 --> 01:26:08,686
I hate you!

1034
01:26:10,973 --> 01:26:14,246
Come on...
-Let go of me!

1035
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:25,395
Now stay there!

1036
01:26:30,516 --> 01:26:34,268
Kansas is due east.

1037
01:26:56,179 --> 01:26:57,450
Come here.

1038
01:27:04,132 --> 01:27:06,882
I tried to make things better for her.

1039
01:27:07,368 --> 01:27:09,561
I used to tell her how pretty she was.

1040
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:13,116
You really thought that your little sister killed Steelgrave?

1041
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,790
So you went out on stage and played the big guilty.

1042
01:27:19,638 --> 01:27:21,037
Trying to cover for her.

1043
01:27:21,957 --> 01:27:24,789
Those little 32s kick out a lot of graphite.

1044
01:27:25,675 --> 01:27:29,950
Last night your hand was a pure snow white.

1045
01:27:33,827 --> 01:27:35,864
But if Orfamay didn't kill him...

1046
01:27:36,947 --> 01:27:38,061
... then who did?

1047
01:27:38,424 --> 01:27:40,378
Forget it, Mavis, forget it.

1048
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:42,414
You've got plenty of time.

1049
01:27:43,102 --> 01:27:45,738
You've got old bullfighters to meet, jets to fly...

1050
01:27:45,897 --> 01:27:47,935
Magazine covers to pose for...

1051
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:51,290
Do it, make it work for you.

1052
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,760
Thank you very much, Philip Marlowe.

1053
01:28:17,954 --> 01:28:20,910
Reservations.
No, she's not here today.

1054
01:28:21,152 --> 01:28:23,947
Hi, Joe. Dolores is expecting me.
- Go right in.

1055
01:28:44,732 --> 01:28:46,801
Our night?
- All ours.

1056
01:29:43,367 --> 01:29:44,845
There's one piece still missing.

1057
01:29:45,284 --> 01:29:46,080
Lagardie.

1058
01:29:47,164 --> 01:29:49,312
It would help if he used to be your husband.

1059
01:29:49,562 --> 01:29:51,950
Back in Brooklyn, a young doctor with the mob, ...

1060
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,551
a wife like you, a man like Steelgrave?

1061
01:29:54,718 --> 01:29:56,069
It makes a tidy package.

1062
01:29:56,796 --> 01:29:59,228
The streets are paved with forgotten husbands.

1063
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:46,270
You must have loved him a lot.

1064
01:30:46,718 --> 01:30:48,911
My husband?
- Steelgrave.

1065
01:31:32,883 --> 01:31:36,187
It had to be someone who knew
both Steelgrave and Mavis.

1066
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:40,029
Who could come and go in her apartment as they pleased.

1067
01:31:41,075 --> 01:31:43,541
Who had access to the
gun Steelgrave gave her.

1068
01:31:44,431 --> 01:31:45,831
It comes up you.

1069
01:31:58,661 --> 01:32:01,538
Like I said, Mavis
is a nice girl, but...

1070
01:32:01,701 --> 01:32:03,256
... Why should she get hold of him?

1071
01:32:03,777 --> 01:32:05,368
You went to a lot of trouble.

1072
01:32:06,893 --> 01:32:09,726
And there is nothing you can do
about it. Is there?

1073
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:12,402
... unless you want to destroy her.

1074
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:14,806
And you wouldn't do that, would you?

1075
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:18,237
You'd dream of those great big eyes of hers!

1076
01:33:21,036 --> 01:33:22,310
Police department, please.

1077
01:33:38,862 --> 01:33:40,851
<i> Police department. Sergeant Parrish. </i>

1078
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:55,405
<i> Hello, hello. </i>
