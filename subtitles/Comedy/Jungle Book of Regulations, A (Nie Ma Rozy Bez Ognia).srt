1
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,371
2017, New Year's special.

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:08,431
This is the second part of Zero Base, Three No's.

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,331
Survival without power.

4
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:13,871
The Tribe faces an obstacle from the beginning.

5
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:16,501
They must cross the ocean using only manpower.

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,831
And the Tribe does not give up.

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,401
They remove a part of the tambak ikan and make a raft out of it.

8
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,101
They finally arrive on land after much difficulty.

9
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,631
We're on land.

10
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,301
However, their happiness doesn't last long.

11
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:32,701
The darkness surrounds the Tribe and they're terrified.

12
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,271
Didn't they say they'll give us light if we catch something?

13
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,931
The only way for them to get some light...

14
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,201
is to catch a living creature.

15
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,971
Would the jungle family manage to catch something...

16
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:45,571
in the dark?

17
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,401
Hold on.

18
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,501
(The Chief looks determined.)

19
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:52,171
I'll go in the water.

20
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,631
Really?

21
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:55,631
(He's planning to go in the water when it's this dark?)

22
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:57,071
Make sure you leave this on.

23
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,801
- I have to know where I am. - Okay.

24
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:01,001
Can you see?

25
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,101
It's blurry. I can't really see.

26
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,901
The night ocean is pitch black.

27
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,931
The Chief sets out to find a prey.

28
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,571
Meanwhile, what are the rest of the members doing on land?

29
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,271
Shouldn't you go this way?

30
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,001
(They're also busy looking for something to catch.)

31
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,071
- There's something here. - It's a crab.

32
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,271
(Crab?)

33
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:20,871
I just saw something.

34
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,971
If we catch this,

35
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:26,701
would you turn on the light for us?

36
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,501
(He's obsessed about getting the light.)

37
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,601
(It runs away.)

38
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,801
It went in.

39
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,531
It went in the hole.

40
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:33,731
(Their only light of hope disappears.)

41
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:36,801
These guys are so small. We can't catch them.

42
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,071
- It's a mini crab. - They're too tiny.

43
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,071
I'm hungry.

44
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,601
(They had taken power for granted in the city.)

45
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:45,471
We have no power so we can't do anything.

46
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:49,531
(They have to keep working to get some light.)

47
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,201
- Gong Myoung. - Yes.

48
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:52,471
Did you catch anything?

49
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,071
No.

50
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,931
- You have nothing? - No.

51
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:00,631
They caught something. Come here.

52
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,301
(They caught something.)

53
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:04,031
(Is it a prey?)

54
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,801
They caught something. Hurry up.

55
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:07,571
They'll give us electricity.

56
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:11,531
(Chief's flashlight shines through...)

57
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,741
(the rocking waves.)

58
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,001
Did you catch something?

59
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,741
What did you catch?

60
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:19,741
(Chief is their hope.)

61
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,301
I caught something unique.

62
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:24,571
(His net looks heavy.)

63
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,601
Did you catch something?

64
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:27,701
What's that?

65
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,701
(Swinging)

66
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:33,031
I think we should ask though.

67
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,571
- Is this fish? - What is it?

68
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,001
(The Chief is persistent.)

69
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,301
- What's that? - It's edible.

70
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,431
What is it?

71
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,501
(He takes it out of the net.)

72
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,201
- What's that? - What's that?

73
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,471
(It's a bizarre looking creature that resembles a stone.)

74
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,501
- Is this alive? - It is.

75
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,031
(They're on full alert.)

76
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,031
For goodness' sake.

77
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,931
- These are the eyes. - This is the mouth.

78
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:58,031
- It looks sad. - It looks like a person's face.

79
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,271
(it's almost arguing that it's alive.)

80
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,301
It looks like a stone.

81
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:03,731
How did you find it?

82
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,231
It's a fish.

83
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,101
I don't know if it was poisonous...

84
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,201
or felt confident in itself. It wasn't moving at all.

85
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,101
I hit it a few times and it flinched.

86
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,931
That's when I knew it was alive.

87
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,371
My goodness.

88
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,771
We caught a living creature so are you going to turn on the light?

89
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,671
- Turn on the light. - Turn on the light.

90
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:21,801
(Give us light.)

91
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,371
We approve.

92
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,771
(It's a successful hunt.)

93
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,271
(They turn on the light as promised.)

94
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:30,601
(They haven't seen light for a while.)

95
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,601
(That's too bright for my eyes.)

96
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:38,031
(It feels like they can finally live again.)

97
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,001
(Thank you for your patience, viewers.)

98
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,671
Is this how we looked?

99
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:45,801
I...

100
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,531
couldn't handle being in the dark.

101
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,671
We have light.

102
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,371
(The light shines on Cheng Xiao.)

103
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:55,271
- We caught a unique creature. - What is it?

104
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:58,201
I wonder how the inside looks like.

105
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,001
(We call it the stonefish.)

106
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,431
- Stonefish? - Stonefish.

107
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,901
(Why is the Chief surprised to hear that?)

108
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:10,531
Aren't stonefish venomous?

109
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,071
Yes, they are.

110
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,731
- They're venomous. - Imagine if you got stung.

111
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,771
What is this strange creature...

112
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,431
that shocked the entire jungle family?

113
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:23,501
They're difficult to tell underwater.

114
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,041
They look like stones so they're called stonefish.

115
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:31,801
This is the first time we've come across them on the show.

116
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:35,071
It has 14 venomous spikes on its back.

117
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,331
It's the deadliest venom of all fish, and...

118
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,831
it is also known as scorpionfish.

119
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,201
It also sheds its skin every 50 days.

120
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,041
It sure has a strange ability.

121
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,701
It looks like a coral underwater...

122
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,931
and lives hidden in it.

123
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,271
Be careful, jungle family.

124
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,601
Imagine if I got stung by it.

125
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,601
I'm getting scared.

126
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,801
(She takes a step back.)

127
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:02,731
The venom is deadly.

128
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:03,901
(Good thing he handled it with caution.)

129
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,401
Let's not eat it.

130
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,571
(It starts dancing at the news.)

131
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,201
(Chief puts it back in the net.)

132
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,701
Thank you. Bye.

133
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,271
- Bye. - Bye.

134
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,171
(They're still sad to let it go.)

135
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,431
- The stonefish gave us light. - Bye.

136
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,301
- I won't see you off. - See you again.

137
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,371
(They're thankful.)

138
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:27,671
Give a round of applause to our Little Aunt.

139
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:29,271
Thank you.

140
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,701
(They give him a round of applause.)

141
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,001
(Chief is tonight's hero along with the stonefish.)

142
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,901
Thanks to the Chief, who caught the stonefish in the dark,

143
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,871
the light finally comes on.

144
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,471
They can now make out the various features of the island.

145
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,431
Before it's too late, they must secure a shelter.

146
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:45,371
I'm hungry.

147
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,771
Let's go.

148
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,101
(The coconuts are way up high.)

149
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:51,901
It's too high.

150
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,601
Would you be okay?

151
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,071
I'm okay.

152
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:58,171
Locals have carved holes in the tree so it's okay.

153
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,801
Go slowly.

154
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:04,801
(He reaches the top in no time.)

155
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:05,901
Move away.

156
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,271
Move.

157
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,771
(When did he reach the top?)

158
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:12,771
(Twisting)

159
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,571
Hey, take it.

160
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,101
(He starts throwing coconuts down.)

161
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,101
My gosh.

162
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:20,231
- He has regular shoes on, right? - Yes.

163
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,701
How did he get up there?

164
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,371
(Chief drops them...)

165
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,171
(and Gong Myoung picks them up.)

166
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,301
(Cracking)

167
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,171
(Five coconuts)

168
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,271
That's six.

169
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,001
(Seven coconuts)

170
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:36,801
He's incredible.

171
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:38,801
Be careful.

172
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,731
(Chief moved all day from making the raft and hunting underwater.)

173
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,101
(Gasping)

174
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,571
(He must be getting tired.)

175
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,931
- You can stop. - Come down.

176
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:51,001
Okay. How many was that?

177
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,771
- There are 8. - There are 8.

178
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,201
(He picks a total of nine coconuts.)

179
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,601
Be careful. Slow down.

180
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:01,271
(He finally climbs down the tree.)

181
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,601
(Sliding)

182
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,631
But...

183
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,731
(He's exhausted.)

184
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,131
I'm starving.

185
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,001
- He must be tired. - You're the best.

186
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,501
Let's gather them.

187
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,031
Wash them and take one each.

188
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,631
How do we carry them?

189
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,371
- It's heavy. - It's no joke.

190
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,831
It's different from the ones before.

191
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,901
I want to try carrying it.

192
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,401
- We're good, right? - Let's go.

193
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,571
Can we put them down here?

194
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,631
Put it down here.

195
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,501
- I'm thankful. - Da Hoon, put it in the middle.

196
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,401
Should we make a table?

197
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,431
How?

198
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:32,001
(They bring the big stones to the center.)

199
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,771
- Lift it. - Turn it around.

200
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,671
- Like this? - It looks so nice.

201
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,001
(It goes on top of the stones.)

202
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,801
(We need chairs for the table.)

203
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,101
(Here are more chairs.)

204
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,131
- Here? - You're so strong, Gong Myoung.

205
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,571
- It looks amazing. - Doesn't it look good?

206
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,331
(They try to make it as cozy as possible.)

207
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:53,901
(They decorate the house with antiques.)

208
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,001
- It looks like a perfect table. - It's perfect.

209
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,101
This is worth 5,000 dollars in Gangnam.

210
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,471
I want to take it home.

211
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,201
Can I take it home?

212
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,001
We'll light the fire.

213
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,571
- Me too. - Go ahead.

214
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,231
(They're hoping that the weather will be warm tonight.)

215
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,271
Blaze it up.

216
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:13,271
(This is going to be a new Sol Bi.)

217
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:18,101
(She tried to look smart yesterday by lighting a fire.)

218
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:21,001
(She wants to be like Wonder Woman.)

219
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,201
Why wouldn't it work?

220
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,571
I did it at home.

221
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,031
(Big Aunt was being mean to her after her continued failures.)

222
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,901
(She ended up being humiliated.)

223
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,101
Seriously.

224
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:35,831
(Nothing worked out as she had hoped.)

225
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,031
(I'll show you today.)

226
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,571
I want to look different and be like Wonder Woman.

227
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,401
I want to do everything.

228
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,641
(Sol Bi is about to transform.)

229
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,471
(Sparkling)

230
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,201
(She looks so cool.)

231
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:56,501
(Her eyes are on fire.)

232
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,101
(She's fully concentrated.)

233
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,101
Give it to me.

234
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:00,901
(He comes out of nowhere.)

235
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,831
- Let me try. - I want to try it.

236
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,171
(Sleepy thought it looked cool.)

237
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,571
(Don't touch me.)

238
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,671
Don't light it.

239
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,701
(She's not fazed.)

240
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,431
Let me try it.

241
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,001
(He has no idea what's going on.)

242
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,901
Is there paper?

243
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:20,031
(Sleepy's ambitious trial begins.)

244
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,031
(Sparkling)

245
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:24,201
(Here I go.)

246
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,031
(He slows down.)

247
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:31,601
(Here you go.)

248
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,531
(Sorry for annoying you.)

249
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,501
My hands. My hands hurt.

250
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:41,601
(Sol Bi goes at it again.)

251
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,601
Why is it not lighting up?

252
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,031
It's not easy.

253
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:52,101
It took 30 minutes to an hour yesterday.

254
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,301
(He's on her side.)

255
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,301
All right.

256
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,031
(He blows on the flame for her.)

257
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,271
What's wrong?

258
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:02,671
(He even puts his hand by the fire.)

259
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:04,571
All right. Keep going.

260
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,601
(Sol Bi earned herself a good assistant.)

261
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,731
(I'm the leader today.)

262
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:12,101
- It worked. - Turn it around.

263
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,801
Don't blow too hard.

264
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,931
(Da Hoon cheers them on.)

265
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,401
It goes out so quickly.

266
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,571
No way.

267
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:20,931
Don't you have a notebook?

268
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,901
(That's what everybody wanted to ask.)

269
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:24,901
Did you use it up?

270
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,201
(They were all gone yesterday.)

271
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:28,531
Where's her notebook?

272
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,931
Should I try?

273
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,601
No, I'll do it.

274
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:32,801
She won't give up the notebook.

275
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:33,801
(Will she become the Wonder Woman today?)

276
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,531
I'll teach you something. Look.

277
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:37,641
Let's learn from him.

278
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:38,901
(Chief's field trip lesson)

279
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:41,401
This is how it hangs from the tree.

280
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,801
Since it hangs like this,

281
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,401
the meat is near the bottom.

282
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,801
You shouldn't be cutting the top. When you buy it from a stand,

283
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,331
they cut the top off to make it look nice.

284
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,601
But if you cut the bottom, the meat comes out easily.

285
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:57,471
If you just want the coconut water,

286
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:01,171
cut here...

287
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,631
(He puts it to practice.)

288
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,531
(The meat shows itself as soon as he strikes down.)

289
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,601
It's different.

290
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,631
(He's fascinated.)

291
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:11,331
It's soft.

292
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,571
If you poke at it, it'll spurt out.

293
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,101
(Spurting)

294
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:16,271
(It's just as the Chief said.)

295
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:17,301
What was that?

296
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:19,571
Cut around it.

297
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:23,501
(He did as he was told.)

298
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,631
(The senior student discovers his love for learning.)

299
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:28,271
It should taste better than water.

300
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,701
(All they had this morning...)

301
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,671
(was squid.)

302
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:36,101
(They thought they were going to turn into squids themselves.)

303
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,571
(They longed for fruits.)

304
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:40,731
Drink all the water first...

305
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:43,671
and cut it in half.

306
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:46,031
(He gulps it down.)

307
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,031
Split it.

308
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:51,071
(It's soft to swallow. A sense of refreshment rushes over him.)

309
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,731
(Let me taste it, too.)

310
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,301
(My goodness.)

311
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:01,801
(The drink liberates him. A sense of refreshment rushes over him.)

312
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,971
I was so hungry. It's nice to drink something sweet.

313
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,371
(Everyone's interested in drinking it.)

314
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:12,271
- Here you go. - How did you do that?

315
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,671
(Pupil Gong Myoung wants to learn.)

316
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:15,231
(Master Byung Man wants to teach.)

317
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,301
Watch your hand.

318
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,001
(The inside is covered by the endocarp.)

319
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,231
(It escapes.)

320
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:22,871
- You can eat that. - What is it?

321
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:25,131
- This is... - You're throwing it out?

322
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,271
No. This is edible as well.

323
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,871
Every part of this fruit tastes different.

324
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:32,201
Coconut milk is made with this part.

325
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,431
(He stores this information as well.)

326
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:35,931
(We need something to chew.)

327
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,331
This tastes different.

328
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,331
(He recommends it.)

329
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,671
(How delicious will this taste?)

330
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,271
Try it.

331
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,401
(He wrinkles his face.)

332
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,031
I don't like this.

333
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:51,771
(They start spitting out.)

334
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,401
I agree.

335
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:55,871
(Byung Man wouldn't give it to us if it wasn't delicious.)

336
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,731
How does it taste?

337
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:59,201
It tastes weird. Have you tried it?

338
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,371
(He's puzzled.)

339
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:01,471
- Is it tasty? - It's spoiled.

340
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:03,671
Give me some.

341
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,301
Give me some.

342
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,631
- Sleepy, this is really delicious. - I'm hungry.

343
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,801
- What is it? - Try it.

344
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:13,971
(He doesn't hesitate to try.)

345
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,331
(It's yucky.)

346
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:19,271
(He won't accept any returns.)

347
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,831
Everyone should taste this at least once.

348
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,371
We should taste two or three times.

349
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,871
(He forces himself to eat.)

350
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,601
(Sol Bi is still struggling with the fire.)

351
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,231
I will succeed by all means.

352
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:37,601
(I will dedicate my everything for this moment.)

353
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:44,171
(I've risked my body and spirit to keep this fire.)

354
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:49,901
(I will get rid of my former reputation and make a new one.)

355
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:53,731
(I yearned for...)

356
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:54,771
(a fire.)

357
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:57,801
- You did it. You did it at last. - I lit the fire.

358
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,071
(Sol Bi finally manages to start a fire.)

359
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:02,601
You did it at last.

360
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,601
(What a surprise.)

361
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,201
Sol Bi and Cheng Xiao are good at making a fire.

362
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,831
It's hard without the wax droppings.

363
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,101
(What a victory for Sol Bi.)

364
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:12,101
Before the fire goes out,

365
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:14,331
let's make it big.

366
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:20,201
(Let her reputation to be changed.)

367
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:23,371
The fire got onto the wood. It's amazing. It caught onto the wood.

368
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:26,431
- You did it at the end. - Cheng Xiao.

369
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:28,031
Forget her reputation as a dummy.

370
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:30,631
She devoted herself to make a fire.

371
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:31,931
(Sol Bi started this fire with perseverance.)

372
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,571
It will keep them warm and chase away bugs.

373
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,501
Her preparation is at last paid off.

374
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:42,331
This is so beautiful and the coconut...

375
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,201
I guess you come here for that.

376
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,001
(Sol Bi also drinks it.)

377
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,701
My gosh. This tastes so good.

378
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,371
It's delicious.

379
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:53,631
It's filling me up a bit.

380
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:56,571
No matter where we are, being on the land is the best.

381
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,131
Of course, it is.

382
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,931
- We can make a big fire. - This is...

383
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,171
the plainest meal in the jungle.

384
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,171
(It's the plainest meal.)

385
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,971
However, I'm so happy.

386
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,231
- Land is the best. - It is, right?

387
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,831
We all have a fickle mind.

388
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,831
Look. Look at this.

389
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:15,131
Look at this.

390
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,231
(She seems to have found something.)

391
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,301
What is it?

392
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,771
(Everyone focuses as she calls them.)

393
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:22,071
(It moves very quickly.)

394
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,031
- Is it a crab? - No, it's not.

395
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:25,501
- A lizard? - It's a lizard?

396
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:27,901
Do you want to eat it?

397
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,331
(Look!)

398
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:30,901
It went to the stomach.

399
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,901
(Let me inspect it.)

400
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,501
- It climbed. - I got it.

401
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,701
- She's amazing. - It's too fast.

402
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,671
- How can she catch with her hands? - I know, right?

403
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,471
You're great. Don't bring it near me.

404
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:42,731
(He refused to be introduced.)

405
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,831
- Stop it. Please don't. - She sure is brave.

406
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:46,931
- Give it to Sleepy. - Jin, this is a gift for you.

407
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,431
I don't need that sort of gift.

408
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:56,171
Stop it. I'm really scared of it. It really scares me.

409
00:15:57,531 --> 00:16:00,131
- Jin, you are my senior. - I'm not your senior.

410
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:05,201
- The tide is rising. - It's coming near us.

411
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,001
Shouldn't we unpack?

412
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:11,031
(What kind of tact will the Chief take?)

413
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,071
Da Hoon.

414
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,501
Let's only get the bottom.

415
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,531
Okay.

416
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,731
Do you want that?

417
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:18,771
(What is 'the bottom' the Chief referred to?)

418
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:21,701
(They bring the barrels from the shore.)

419
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:22,801
Bring these barrels.

420
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,731
He plans to use the raft that they brought...

421
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,631
as a wooden bench.

422
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:29,701
(They stick in the barrels to lift the bench from the ground.)

423
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:30,771
Their efforts...

424
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,631
to cut and bring the raft has finally paid off.

425
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,571
I had no idea...

426
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,171
that we would be dragging this raft along.

427
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:43,731
We don't know what will happen tomorrow. Let's hunt.

428
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:44,731
- Okay. - Let's do it.

429
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,771
(They are about to hunt putting confident Sol Bi in the lead.)

430
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,831
Is it out of battery?

431
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:50,171
I kept spinning it.

432
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,831
(It takes labor to survive. Surviving without power is a labor.)

433
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:55,771
- Should we get going? - Where are you going?

434
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:57,631
Join us.

435
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,971
I searched online, and...

436
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:02,871
- My goodness. - Gosh.

437
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,171
- What a surprise. - My goodness.

438
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:07,001
(Did they find something to hunt already as they just set out?)

439
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:08,601
(Wobbling)

440
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:12,701
(A snake-looking creature is on the branch.)

441
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:15,371
- It's my bag. - What is it?

442
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,701
- It's my bag. - You scared me.

443
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,471
I was startled to see it on the branch.

444
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,801
Why did you hit me in the stomach?

445
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:24,501
I should've brought the straw cutter.

446
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,871
(He's saying anything.)

447
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,001
- Wait. I meant the knife. - I agree. We're blocked.

448
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:31,471
- My goodness. - What? What is it?

449
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,901
- Why? - What's wrong?

450
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:36,171
- It's a snake. - Really?

451
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,371
(Sleepy gets away at an incredible speed.)

452
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,231
(He's terrified.)

453
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,001
(An unwelcome guest shows up.)

454
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,841
- Be quiet. - I'm so scared.

455
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:46,931
- It's a real snake. - Let me see.

456
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:49,501
- Come here. Don't go near it. - Snakes are really fast.

457
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,701
(Reticulated pythons are one of the few snakes that prey on humans.)

458
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:54,171
Where is it? Where?

459
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:57,401
- Stop. - Don't go near it.

460
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:59,931
- It's amazing. - It is not venomous.

461
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:01,431
(Goodness)

462
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:04,571
(It splits its mouth open to mark its boundary.)

463
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:05,631
I'm terrified.

464
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,431
We must catch it or do something. It might come to us when we sleep.

465
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:13,231
Gong Myoung, you are too brave.

466
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,901
It's disappointing if we don't continue. We came this far.

467
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:17,931
Something is moving.

468
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,731
- What is it? - What is this?

469
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,571
Birds lay eggs on the ground.

470
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,101
- Birds? - On the ground?

471
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,301
There are eggs on the ground. Since there are eggs,

472
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:29,231
- be careful. - There are a lot of bird eggs.

473
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:32,231
- There are so many. Look. - They do it in groups.

474
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,371
If eggs are here,

475
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:36,301
then snakes must be here as well.

476
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,131
- They might be here. - Right.

477
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,431
What if there are snakes here?

478
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:42,031
- What? - What is it?

479
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,101
(They are a tall coward and a good-looking coward.)

480
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,841
(They are in perfect unison.)

481
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,371
- What's the matter with you? - It's so scary here.

482
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:52,101
- I want to go home now. - So do I.

483
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,841
Since they are scared,

484
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:56,671
they decided to go back for the night.

485
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,531
Can all of us sleep here?

486
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:02,101
Two of us will have to sleep on this side.

487
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,171
We're lucky to have this wooden bench.

488
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:06,971
- Yes, we are. - We certainly are.

489
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:10,801
(He's spinning the generator at this hour?)

490
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,501
(To save is to live well?)

491
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,401
Since it's the end of the day, we can use the speaker.

492
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,501
(The speaker?)

493
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,571
We can listen to music.

494
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:23,931
(Last night, for his family members who were all tired...)

495
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:25,671
(Hey guys, I have music.)

496
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:31,071
(He played music with a portable speaker and acted as a DJ.)

497
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:33,871
(Thanks to music, they felt better and it relieved their stress.)

498
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:39,201
(In order to listen to music, he must charge the battery first.)

499
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:42,341
(Will it work?)

500
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:46,001
(Perseverance and patience are needed.)

501
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:50,341
(They start to lose interest.)

502
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,841
(My gosh. It will strengthen my muscles.)

503
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,431
(Music starts.)

504
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,071
- It's starting. - My gosh.

505
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,971
Da Hoon. Thank you. Please continue spinning.

506
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,231
- Thank you. - Spin it all night long.

507
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,571
(Isn't good to listen to music?)

508
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,001
Can you hold this?

509
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,301
(He pairs up with Cheng Xiao.)

510
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,231
It's charging. The light is red.

511
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,871
- It's charging. - The red light is gone. It's back.

512
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:22,531
(Spinning)

513
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,731
When the light turned blue, the lyrics matched.

514
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,931
- Lower the volume. - The volume?

515
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,201
If it's loud,

516
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,131
- wouldn't it take more energy? - Would it?

517
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,901
- Should we try it? - Okay. Let's turn up the volume.

518
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,971
(It stops.)

519
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,801
Let's turn up the volume as high as it can go.

520
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,531
(It only lasts for a moment.)

521
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:43,301
What happened?

522
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:44,731
(What's the matter with this?)

523
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:45,841
Spin it.

524
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:49,001
- Give it to us. - Let's take turns.

525
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,131
- We can't even rest for a moment. - Then, it will stop.

526
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,901
Let's switch every 15 minutes.

527
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,001
It's like keeping a night watch.

528
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:59,771
We should listen to music at the end of the day.

529
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,701
- It's starting again. - Where did you go, Seung Hun.

530
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:08,601
Should I do it now?

531
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,601
If we spin it slow, will it stop?

532
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,631
(He's trying his best.)

533
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:16,471
If we keep this up...

534
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,301
I want to listen to just one song. Don't stop.

535
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,671
It's so different from yesterday.

536
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:21,971
(Do we have to listen to this song?)

537
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:23,031
You can do it.

538
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:25,501
(As they try to listen to a song,)

539
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,531
(they get exhausted.)

540
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:27,571
This is...

541
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,971
The battery's out.

542
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:32,601
Let's just sing. There are so many singers here.

543
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:33,671
Let's listen to it live.

544
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,571
(He's disappointed.)

545
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:37,901
No, stop it. Don't do it.

546
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:39,401
I'm hungry again.

547
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:42,271
We still managed to listen to it for a bit.

548
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:44,341
We did it without any power.

549
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,771
Good night.

550
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,931
- Good night. - Good night.

551
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:50,001
(Tonight's music stops here.)

552
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:52,071
You can put your head there.

553
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:55,801
(They are getting ready to sleep.)

554
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:59,631
- It's cold. - You'll sleep there?

555
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:01,731
(Little Aunt decides to sleep on the ground.)

556
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:05,071
(The sisters lie down side by side.)

557
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,031
(Buzzing)

558
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,231
(A mosquito shows up around Sleepy.)

559
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,501
(Exhaling)

560
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:15,531
Are there a lot of mosquitoes?

561
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:17,531
(A mosquito might've gone into her mouth.)

562
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,331
(As they acquired land, they also acquired mosquitoes.)

563
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:26,601
We have to still fight with bugs here...

564
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,171
even though I'm fully covered.

565
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,531
(Even her feet are covered.)

566
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:32,571
I covered myself completely.

567
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:34,101
(She covers Cheng Xiao's face for her.)

568
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,931
(The veteran, Byung Man, is covering himself.)

569
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,171
(Meanwhile...)

570
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:47,731
Mosquitoes must survive as well.

571
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:50,871
I think of it as the mosquitoes having their meals.

572
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,401
(Gong Myoung is a philanthropist.)

573
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:54,801
I want to sleep and I will.

574
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:57,971
I will sleep as I become the mosquitoes' prey.

575
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:00,431
(He has an extreme environment-friendly attitude.)

576
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:11,301
(Since they were exhausted, they fall asleep quickly.)

577
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,631
(At that moment when he's about to fall into a deep sleep,)

578
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,231
(he moves.)

579
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,601
(He scratches.)

580
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:25,501
(He takes turns scratching his right and left foot.)

581
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,301
(He's bitten by a mosquito again.)

582
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:32,701
(It's itchy.)

583
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,001
(I can't endure it anymore.)

584
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:40,071
(All the mosquitoes must die.)

585
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:44,771
(Please let me sleep.)

586
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:49,101
(Is Sleepy scratching again?)

587
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,231
(This time, it's Gong Myoung.)

588
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:57,531
(Did the mosquitoes change their target since he asked for it?)

589
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:01,731
(They attack Sleepy, Gong Myoung, and Sol Bi at the same time.)

590
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,001
(Everyone's scratching as they sleep.)

591
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,431
(Even Byung Man is scratching.)

592
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,571
(Who do you think I am?)

593
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,631
(He starts to hunt the mosquitoes.)

594
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:16,971
(In the meantime, Da Hoon is soundly asleep.)

595
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:21,831
(Byung Man gets up at last.)

596
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:25,931
(He's moving his mouth.)

597
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:28,201
Are there a lot of mosquitoes?

598
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,671
Yes, a lot of mosquitoes are here. It bit my lip.

599
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,531
(His upper lip is swollen and bulging.)

600
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:40,771
(Gong Myoung and Cheng Xiao are tortured constantly.)

601
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:43,671
It bit me on my lip.

602
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,671
(Byung Man tells Gong Myoung about the mosquito bite.)

603
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:47,171
(I have a lot to say as well.)

604
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:52,801
(I have so many mosquito bites.)

605
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,201
(He's about to cry.)

606
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,431
He had an interview before he went to sleep.

607
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,801
He said confidently that he will donate his blood to the mosquitoes.

608
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:04,901
Mosquitoes must survive as well.

609
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:05,901
(He looked confident a few hours ago.)

610
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,171
I can't sleep.

611
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,401
(Byung Man scratches his lip and Gong Myoung scratches his ankle.)

612
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:19,001
(These two can't sleep for a while.)

613
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:26,331
(I can't let this happen.)

614
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:29,501
(The Chief moves his sleeping spot.)

615
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:35,301
(He's fully prepared next to the fire.)

616
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,531
(Okay, then I will prepare myself as well.)

617
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:47,631
(Hopefully, you will sleep well.)

618
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:52,771
After a long battle with mosquitoes,

619
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:54,201
(They are bound to sleep somehow.)

620
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:57,001
their first morning on land has come.

621
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:58,471
(A new day has started again.)

622
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,801
(He gets up.)

623
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:07,401
(Da Hoon gets up first.)

624
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,431
Why did you get up so early?

625
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:10,471
(Sol Bi is the second one to wake up.)

626
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,531
I usually wake up early.

627
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,631
(The early bird...)

628
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:14,631
Most of the time...

629
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,231
(The early bird spins the generator?)

630
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:18,501
I wake up early even at home.

631
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:19,671
(He spins it unconsciously.)

632
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,701
Did you get bitten during the night?

633
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:25,671
I don't have a single bite. Not even one.

634
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,031
(He slept well.)

635
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,601
I guess I belong on land.

636
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,871
I didn't get bitten at all.

637
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:32,931
(Groaning)

638
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:36,131
(Jin gets up, covering his face.)

639
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:38,471
(I'm so worried about my face.)

640
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,131
Can I see the mirror?

641
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:44,931
(He looks at his face, reflected in the camera.)

642
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:46,401
Why would they bite my lip?

643
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:48,771
(His upper lip is swollen.)

644
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,431
- It's swollen, right? - Yes.

645
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:55,871
(He's at a loss.)

646
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:59,771
The mosquito knew my lips are attractive. It's why it bit my lip.

647
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:01,231
(He sure loves himself.)

648
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,771
This is unbelievable. How can I not get any bite?

649
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:06,431
I feel like they ignored me.

650
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:08,131
(Are you mad now?)

651
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,471
Does the bite itch?

652
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:12,101
(You win, Da Hoon.)

653
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:17,731
Mosquitoes must survive as well.

654
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:19,271
The mosquitoes are...

655
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,101
(I talked without thinking at that time.)

656
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:24,471
There were so many of them.

657
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:25,871
(He can't think straight because of them.)

658
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,171
I must hunt the best I can.

659
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:29,771
(Mosquitoes ruined everything.)

660
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:31,031
I didn't sleep a wink.

661
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:33,771
(I hate mosquitoes. I can't hunt now. I didn't sleep at all.)

662
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:37,431
What's the hardest part?

663
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:39,871
(What is the hardest part?)

664
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:41,331
Not being able to eat.

665
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,171
(He can't give up his food even in the jungle.)

666
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:49,871
(Cheng Xiao gets up.)

667
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,001
(She's half asleep and half awake.)

668
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:54,631
(Meanwhile,)

669
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,131
(she takes something out.)

670
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,471
(What will she do?)

671
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,601
(She's rolling her bangs.)

672
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,871
(What is that?)

673
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:11,271
This? When I roll it like this,

674
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:13,731
my bangs look nice like this.

675
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,431
(Like this. Isn't it pretty?)

676
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:18,531
I have to have my bangs.

677
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,801
I always had bangs ever since I was a baby.

678
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,601
(She can't give up her bangs even in the jungle.)

679
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,701
You didn't do this yesterday.

680
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,071
That's why I looked so ugly.

681
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,631
(Sol Bi is eating.)

682
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,701
Thank you.

683
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:36,731
(Jin also has a bite.)

684
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,971
(Everyone is awake and eating coconuts.)

685
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:40,531
I feel like I am a bird now.

686
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:43,901
(Is this person still sleeping?)

687
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:46,031
Did Sleepy sleep late last night?

688
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,031
He said he will wake up at 11:40am. So we are not to wake him up.

689
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:52,801
(Sleepy is in a deep sleep again today.)

690
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:54,731
He said he had a lot to ponder on.

691
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,631
He said he will reflect about his day.

692
00:28:58,631 --> 00:28:59,931
(Last night, he said he will reflect about his day.)

693
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,331
At some point, he stopped talking and fell asleep.

694
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:03,431
(He stopped talking and fell asleep.)

695
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:04,731
(Until this moment, he slept well.)

696
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:07,931
This...

697
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,771
(Little Aunt, also known as the owner of the general store)

698
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:14,431
My teacher who's instructing me these days made this.

699
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,971
I'm learning how to sew.

700
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:18,571
(He only sewed, but it looks amazing.)

701
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:21,031
- Are you learning leather crafts? - Yes.

702
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:28,931
(The Chief is planning to create his own hunting tools.)

703
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:32,701
(You can see the products he's producing now in Kota Manado.)

704
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,701
It's too tight. My chest is bulging out.

705
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:35,701
(Da Hoon gets an upgrade.)

706
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,031
This looks a bit awkward.

707
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:38,131
You can tighten it up if it's loose.

708
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,531
- No, it's perfect. - Is it?

709
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:40,601
(Where did he get the sunglasses?)

710
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,671
This...

711
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:42,831
(With the equipment, he gets confident.)

712
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:43,831
(I'm completely ready.)

713
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:47,601
(Yoon Da Hoon, the Big Aunt, can defeat the mosquitoes the best.)

714
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,471
- Cheng Xiao. - Put this on.

715
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,731
Doesn't she look like a warrior?

716
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:51,801
Put it on.

717
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:54,331
(It's customized just for her. It's for a female warrior.)

718
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,431
(He opens his eyes wide.)

719
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:58,931
(Aren't I scary?)

720
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,871
(Cheng Xiao, the youngest daughter, is fixing her bangs.)

721
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:05,471
(Sol Bi gets a customized gear as well.)

722
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,701
As I put this gear on,

723
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:09,331
I feel like I can hunt.

724
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:11,431
I can also be a female warrior.

725
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:13,571
(Swinging)

726
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,601
You don't look like one.

727
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,901
You're not a female warrior. A lady died in a battle.

728
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:19,871
When you swung, you are as good as dead.

729
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,631
"As good as dead"?

730
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,831
Since your dagger is small,

731
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:26,231
you need to swing it with only one hand.

732
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:27,801
Don't do it with both your hands.

733
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,071
- With only one hand? - Yes.

734
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,401
Do it with only one hand.

735
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:35,271
- It looks weird. - Use your arm, not your body.

736
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,531
Hold your body and swing.

737
00:30:36,531 --> 00:30:37,971
(Don't forget to use your arm.)

738
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:40,101
There you go. You look strong.

739
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:42,501
No, that's not how you should do it.

740
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:44,431
(His eyes, nose, and mouth are open wide.)

741
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,331
Don't do this. Don't open your mouth.

742
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,531
- Right. Don't do that. - When you swing hard...

743
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:50,201
- Should I try again? - Yes.

744
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:51,831
(Try again.)

745
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:52,871
(She swings with all her might.)

746
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:58,631
(Sol Bi, the cousin, can make her eyes very big.)

747
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,531
(We agree.)

748
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:03,601
Having this weapon gives me courage.

749
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:04,731
(Everyone can see she's courageous now.)

750
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:06,231
What if you see a snake?

751
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,471
A snake?

752
00:31:07,471 --> 00:31:09,731
When you see a snake, you can't use your dagger.

753
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,101
You need to press its neck with your fingers making a Y.

754
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:14,471
You have to press it down.

755
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:15,901
- Press its neck? - Yes.

756
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:18,471
- But what if... - Don't worry. I can catch it.

757
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:21,071
- it turns its neck and bites me? - I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

758
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,201
Look. Let's pretend you are the snake.

759
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,101
I made Y-shape with my fingers.

760
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,931
- I'm pressing you down. - Okay.

761
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:27,971
Try to bite me now.

762
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,001
(Trying)

763
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:30,001
Try to bite me.

764
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,071
(She tries her best.)

765
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:32,071
Try to bite me.

766
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:33,201
(Snake Sol Bi fails to attack him.)

767
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,201
This is what happens.

768
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,571
(She tries with all her might.)

769
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,131
- This is what happens. - Really?

770
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,471
- However, look. - I see.

771
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:43,301
Let's pretend I hold this part. Try to bite me now.

772
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,671
You can bite me, then.

773
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:45,901
That's why you can't grab its body.

774
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:48,001
- Its head won't turn. - That's right.

775
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,471
Press the back of the snake's head.

776
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:53,901
It's similar to how you grab a person.

777
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:56,171
I will go hunting today.

778
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,531
Sleepy, who finally woke up,

779
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:02,571
and the trio of Jungle Rangers head to the jungle.

780
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:05,001
The ace members, Gong Myoung and Jin,

781
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:07,631
follow Chief Byung Man to the sea.

782
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:08,771
(Look forward to the family's hunt.)

783
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:10,401
Let's go.

784
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:11,831
Let's go hunting.

785
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:14,831
- Let's go. - We haven't gone this way.

786
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,301
Let's go somewhere we haven't gone.

787
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,271
Let's catch something.

788
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,371
Here is an important thing...

789
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,301
you should remember.

790
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:23,301
(Da Hoon stops the members prior to the hunt.)

791
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:25,601
A jungle is not an easy place.

792
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:27,631
Be careful at all times.

793
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:29,231
Tell the others when you find something.

794
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:33,071
Snakes often rest on trees.

795
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:35,671
- That's why... - Are we allowed to pick plants?

796
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:38,731
Before you pick plants, check with the government...

797
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:42,901
to see if they are in a nature reserve.

798
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:44,871
- Da Hoon, let's go. - Don't make rash decisions.

799
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:46,901
(Sol Bi starts before the guide.)

800
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:50,101
You should listen to the guide.

801
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:51,801
They don't concentrate.

802
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,931
Da Hoon, this place is...

803
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:56,471
- Why are there concave areas? - I can explain.

804
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:59,731
- Birds come here to lay eggs. - They lay eggs.

805
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:02,201
Birds lay eggs here...

806
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:04,831
and snakes appear to eat the eggs.

807
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:09,331
These are bird tracks,

808
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:10,571
right?

809
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,901
- These are bird tracks. - You are right.

810
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,001
Look.

811
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:16,571
I will dig deep.

812
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:18,301
I will dig deep.

813
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:21,531
I have no strength in my arms.

814
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,401
(It's hard to dig the earth on an empty stomach.)

815
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,401
I didn't eat a meal.

816
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:25,731
I know.

817
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:28,631
I don't think bird eggs would be at a place that is too sunny.

818
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,071
The sun is too bright.

819
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,671
Don't you think they would have laid eggs in the shade...

820
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:34,801
to keep them cool?

821
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:36,771
There would be eggs in the shade.

822
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,431
(They keep repeating same words.)

823
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,471
There are tracks here as well.

824
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:46,301
There are tracks.

825
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:49,201
Don't they look like an animal's?

826
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:52,231
I found animal tracks.

827
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,531
We will find something if we follow the tracks.

828
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,271
Did this animal come to steal the eggs?

829
00:33:57,531 --> 00:33:59,831
It's possible. This tells us...

830
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,931
there are animals on this island.

831
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:04,271
I don't think it's this way.

832
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,571
Let's not go this way.

833
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:06,901
Wait a minute.

834
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:08,431
(The hunter in a male menopause searches the area.)

835
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:09,701
It's a bit scary.

836
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,171
Get out of the way.

837
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,401
Get out of the way. I will go.

838
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:16,371
(He is a brave hunter.)

839
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,171
(He boldly walks into the forest.)

840
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,371
- The ground... - My goodness.

841
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:20,371
(My goodness.)

842
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:25,831
Ants built a house inside this rotten log.

843
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:27,901
There are holes.

844
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,531
This log has rotted.

845
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,601
There is a path.

846
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,241
There is a path.

847
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:37,501
Guys, there are a lot of insects.

848
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:39,741
There are insects like mosquitoes.

849
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:42,101
This place is a swamp.

850
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:43,871
(He stops searching for an animal and becomes a tour guide.)

851
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:46,131
That's right. My feet are sinking.

852
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,631
Look at this.

853
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,871
This place...

854
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:51,801
is a swamp.

855
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:53,631
(I will go before the guide.)

856
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:57,031
It's wet over there, too.

857
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:58,431
It's a wetland.

858
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:01,301
I think we can go this way.

859
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:03,571
There are animals roaming around.

860
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:04,771
(There are animals on this island.)

861
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,771
Let's have a meeting.

862
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:08,831
Come here, Cheng Xiao.

863
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:11,131
(The family gathers around for a meeting.)

864
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:12,131
(Squealing)

865
00:35:12,871 --> 00:35:14,331
(Squealing)

866
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:17,401
What was that sound?

867
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,401
What was that sound?

868
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:20,531
- My goodness. - Everyone heard it, right?

869
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:22,101
It sounded like a boar.

870
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,571
(A boar?)

871
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,301
- It's the sound of a boar. - Really?

872
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:27,931
It's the sound of a boar.

873
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:29,371
It came from that way.

874
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:33,831
It's a boar. I know what a boar sounds like.

875
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,931
(There were animals.)

876
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,571
It's a boar.

877
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:38,531
It's the sound of a boar.

878
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:40,301
Boars are very loud.

879
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:41,401
(I will catch you.)

880
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,901
(Everyone follows Da Hoon.)

881
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:46,831
(However, their pace is slow since the road is rough.)

882
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,031
(Screaming)

883
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:51,401
- Be careful. - There are a lot of snakes.

884
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:53,431
Be careful.

885
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:56,131
It was the sound of a boar.

886
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,741
(I certainly heard it.)

887
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,331
(Where did it go?)

888
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:03,071
Is there a boar?

889
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:05,371
You heard the sound, right?

890
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,471
Yes.

891
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:10,101
Wouldn't it be a smaller animal than a boar?

892
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:12,271
It could be a small boar.

893
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,831
It didn't sound like...

894
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:17,801
a big animal.

895
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:20,001
It could be a goat.

896
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:22,071
No, it was the sound of a pig.

897
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,471
Shall we keep on going?

898
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:27,401
Let's go this way.

899
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,431
(Actually,)

900
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:34,931
(Sleepy has been running ever since he woke up.)

901
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:37,631
(Dizzy)

902
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:39,241
(He feels faint.)

903
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:41,931
It's exhausting.

904
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:43,801
That's because our stomachs are empty.

905
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,571
I have no energy left.

906
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:47,631
(Squealing)

907
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:49,671
(Squealing)

908
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:51,371
(The sound came from the back this time.)

909
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:55,131
Run quickly.

910
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,671
(Running on an instant)

911
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:57,931
What is it?

912
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:00,631
Do you see anything moving?

913
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:03,031
What is it?

914
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:04,241
(It's in the forest.)

915
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,131
Come this way.

916
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:07,801
- Where is it? - Come on.

917
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:10,131
(What could it be?)

918
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:11,201
(It's a wild goat.)

919
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:13,741
- It's too far away. - It really is a goat.

920
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:15,931
Where is it?

921
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,801
(He runs at full speed.)

922
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,001
(Running)

923
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,501
(Sleepy's adrenaline surges.)

924
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:25,371
(Disappearing)

925
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:28,101
(The wild goat disappears into the forest.)

926
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,001
(As the musician has guessed, it was a goat.)

927
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:33,001
(Screaming)

928
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:35,531
- What was that? - It will run away.

929
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:38,031
Don't scream.

930
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:40,631
Did you see it?

931
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:42,401
I saw it go that way.

932
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,831
It went that way.

933
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:49,131
However, I don't know which path it took.

934
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:51,101
From here, it could have gone that way.

935
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:52,901
(Sleepy tries to predict which way the goat went.)

936
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:56,601
Hey.

937
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:58,431
Hey.

938
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,331
Hey.

939
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,501
(The goat won't come just because he is calling for it.)

940
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:07,201
I feel like there would be something up there.

941
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:12,201
(The fragile man decides to climb a mountain.)

942
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,271
(My goodness.)

943
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:14,401
(My goodness.)

944
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:17,431
(Shaking)

945
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:20,131
(It had better be a very slow goat.)

946
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,001
No, it went this way.

947
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:24,741
I am 100 percent certain.

948
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:27,701
We will go to the mountain.

949
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,301
That's because...

950
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:33,271
there is a lot of grass in the mountain.

951
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:36,331
Goats eat grass.

952
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,831
The mountain has their food.

953
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:39,571
- Shall we go up? - Let's do that.

954
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:40,801
Are we going up that mountain?

955
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,531
Yes, we are. The goat will be up there.

956
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,401
Goats live on a high mountain.

957
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,831
Be careful.

958
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:49,531
(Sleepy and the group will trap the goat from both sides.)

959
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,571
Stay here. I will go up and look.

960
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,401
I will go up to that point.

961
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:56,901
Goat.

962
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:59,271
(Bleating)

963
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,431
Goat!

964
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:04,201
Where are you?

965
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,531
(No matter how much she calls,)

966
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:08,931
(the goat doesn't respond.)

967
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,601
I don't think it came this far.

968
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:14,931
The scenery is really pretty.

969
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:17,271
The sea is beautiful.

970
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,571
It's really pretty.

971
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:19,631
(They get a bird's-eye view.)

972
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,901
I want to go snorkeling.

973
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,571
It's really nice.

974
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:26,001
The team that chased after a goat...

975
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:29,241
is entranced by the beautiful scenery.

976
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,741
What is the team of ace members doing...

977
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:32,901
- right now? - Chief Byung Man.

978
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,741
- Yes? - Let's go.

979
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,401
Wait a second. There is something I want to take.

980
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:40,131
- Okay. - I really wanted to do this.

981
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:42,601
I saw it on the internet.

982
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:45,971
You use a pump...

983
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:49,901
and inject air with manual labor.

984
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,741
To follow the theme of the survival,

985
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:54,031
they will hunt in the water without electric power.

986
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:57,071
A rubber hose will be attached to a water container.

987
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:00,171
Then air will be pumped into it...

988
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,631
so that they can hunt...

989
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,241
without coming up for air.

990
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,831
Byung Man borrowed the necessary items from the crew.

991
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:09,931
I am going to use this.

992
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:12,571
Then he got to making a tool without electric power.

993
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:13,931
I wanted to try it.

994
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,171
Do we put it over our head and stay in water?

995
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:17,631
Yes, you walk around like that.

996
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:21,301
(He cuts the base of the water container.)

997
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,331
(Concentrating)

998
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:31,131
You are meticulous.

999
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:33,771
You're like the son of a divine being.

1000
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,931
(A divine being?)

1001
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,101
(Embarrassed)

1002
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:40,741
- I am not that great. - Do you think that?

1003
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:43,071
Do you know what a divine baby is called?

1004
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:46,931
- Was it a joke? - I am telling you a joke.

1005
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:48,301
(Jin is thorough.)

1006
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,531
(Thinking)

1007
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:53,671
(I really want to get it right.)

1008
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:54,771
Well...

1009
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:56,801
Well...

1010
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:59,471
A newborn.

1011
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:01,631
(The answer is "A newborn".)

1012
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:05,271
That's what you are, Chief Byung Man.

1013
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,671
You are good at telling jokes. There isn't anything you can't do.

1014
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:11,001
I can't dance very well.

1015
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:13,431
(Jin is the best idol singer.)

1016
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:17,131
Jin's dad jokes kept the team entertained.

1017
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:21,801
They focus on making the air container.

1018
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:22,931
That's right.

1019
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,271
So that the buoyant water container...

1020
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,241
can sink,

1021
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,301
they attach a heavy hammer to it.

1022
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:33,101
The air container is complete.

1023
00:41:33,631 --> 00:41:35,401
It's time for a test drive.

1024
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:38,401
The team tests its effectiveness.

1025
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,631
(How will the handmade air container turn out?)

1026
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,001
We will use it.

1027
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:45,471
We spent a few hours to make it.

1028
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:47,971
Chief Byung Man will put it on.

1029
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:49,631
- Pump the air into it. - Okay.

1030
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,101
(Pump the air into it.)

1031
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:52,401
(You can trust us.)

1032
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:55,631
It will be dangerous for the Chief if we take a break.

1033
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:56,701
That's right.

1034
00:41:58,631 --> 00:41:59,801
We should begin pumping.

1035
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,031
(Jin pumps air before Byung Man goes into the water.)

1036
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:06,831
(It's his first time.)

1037
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:07,901
All right.

1038
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:09,671
(It's on his head.)

1039
00:42:09,671 --> 00:42:11,171
(He's a bit nervous.)

1040
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:14,971
All right. I am going in.

1041
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:16,031
Okay.

1042
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,031
(Splashing)

1043
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:20,971
(He jumps into the water.)

1044
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:26,871
(A handmade air container is like something from a comic book.)

1045
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:28,631
(Will it work?)

1046
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:30,371
What is happening?

1047
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:32,601
What is happening?

1048
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:36,241
(He went in the water.)

1049
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:41,371
(Is Chief Byung Man breathing?)

1050
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:47,201
It works.

1051
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:49,001
(Does it really work?)

1052
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,931
- Does it work? - Yes.

1053
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:52,901
I was breathing the whole time.

1054
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:54,571
My goodness. Really?

1055
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:57,401
(He enters the water again.)

1056
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:01,331
(The water only comes up to his chin.)

1057
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:07,631
(He is breathing with his mouth.)

1058
00:43:09,971 --> 00:43:11,001
(It really works.)

1059
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:12,241
I am breathing.

1060
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:16,471
I am breathing.

1061
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:17,531
(Laughing)

1062
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:19,631
(He is excited.)

1063
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:20,701
This is funny.

1064
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:22,471
(Jin is getting exhausted.)

1065
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:25,431
This is interesting.

1066
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,801
That's good. Pull the hose.

1067
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,741
(He is satisfied with his creation.)

1068
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:32,531
(The person who is pumping air is exhausted.)

1069
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:33,571
I am exhausted.

1070
00:43:35,131 --> 00:43:36,371
(Someone help me.)

1071
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:40,631
(Unaware of what is happening, Byung Man is excited.)

1072
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:42,601
If you rest,

1073
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:45,231
Chief Byung Man won't be able to breathe.

1074
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,331
(Chief Byung Man's fate lies in my hand.)

1075
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:50,471
You need to come out.

1076
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:52,601
(You need to come out if you want to live.)

1077
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:54,271
(Otherwise, I will die.)

1078
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:55,301
You need to come out.

1079
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:05,101
(Chief Byung Man comes out of the water.)

1080
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:07,831
(I am saved.)

1081
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,501
- We can't hear you. - Can you hear me?

1082
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:16,501
We can't hear you.

1083
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,871
Please pump the air well.

1084
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,601
- You can trust me. - Okay.

1085
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:24,331
(Gong Myoung tries on the handmade air container.)

1086
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,101
Go into the water.

1087
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:29,201
(He enters the water without hesitating.)

1088
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:32,971
(He is the ace member.)

1089
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:35,501
(Pumping began anew.)

1090
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,431
(Relaxed)

1091
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:42,431
This is fascinating.

1092
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:46,271
Can you hear me?

1093
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:48,731
I am breathing well.

1094
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:52,531
I will give my line from "Drinking Solo".

1095
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:57,031
Shall we begin dating from today on?

1096
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:00,671
I can see the bottom of the sea.

1097
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,401
Can you hear me?

1098
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:06,601
There is a current.

1099
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:07,671
(He keeps rising to the surface.)

1100
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,201
This is fascinating.

1101
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,801
(The hammer isn't heavy enough to fight the buoyancy.)

1102
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:16,171
(Moreover,)

1103
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,371
(pumping air is exhausting.)

1104
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:22,231
Let's put on snorkeling masks.

1105
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,171
(Byung Man's invention was a big success.)

1106
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:28,331
This is fascinating.

1107
00:45:28,331 --> 00:45:30,771
I could breathe and look at the bottom.

1108
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:32,831
Really? We should still wear snorkeling masks.

1109
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,971
(Jin's arms will be too exhausted if they use the air container.)

1110
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:40,131
The water is coming in...

1111
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:42,071
in this area.

1112
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:43,831
Let's go someplace else.

1113
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:45,001
I am hungry.

1114
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,731
- We must hunt. - Let's dive.

1115
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:54,031
Meanwhile, the team that was chasing after a goat...

1116
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:56,831
travel deeper into the jungle.

1117
00:45:58,731 --> 00:45:59,971
(Screaming)

1118
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:01,971
What is it? Is it a snake?

1119
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:03,971
No. Look at this.

1120
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,431
- It's really long. - Hold on!

1121
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:09,831
- What is that? - What is it?

1122
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:11,571
- It's a centipede. - A centipede?

1123
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:14,031
- This centipede is really big. - Be careful.

1124
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:17,271
It looks like a pill bug.

1125
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:21,201
I feel like there would be snakes, too.

1126
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:24,201
I am scared of insects. I am really scared of them.

1127
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:27,331
- Be careful. - I don't think it will be here.

1128
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:28,371
Be careful.

1129
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:31,971
- Move to the side. - There is nothing here.

1130
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,431
- Be careful. - I am...

1131
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:35,801
looking for a goat.

1132
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:36,901
(He only cares about the goat.)

1133
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:38,071
I really want to catch it.

1134
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:40,671
- It will be nice if we have fruits. - You can...

1135
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:41,731
look for fruits.

1136
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:45,501
I will look for the goat.

1137
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:49,031
What is that?

1138
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:52,001
- What is that green thing? - That one?

1139
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:54,871
- Isn't it a young coconut tree? - What is that?

1140
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:56,301
- What is that? - Where is it?

1141
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:57,371
- Over there. - It's over there.

1142
00:46:57,371 --> 00:47:00,371
- What is that? - On the bottom,

1143
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:03,371
- there are bigger ones. - What are those?

1144
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,531
I know.

1145
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,201
- Are those mangoes? - No.

1146
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,601
- Aren't those mangoes? - Aren't those mangoes?

1147
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:10,071
I only know its Chinese name.

1148
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:13,971
Those are papayas. That's incredible.

1149
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,501
Wait a minute. How do we get them?

1150
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,071
- How do we get them? - Move out of the way.

1151
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:20,971
(Sleepy is excited to hear the familiar name.)

1152
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,201
Move out of the way.

1153
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:26,001
- They are up too high. - They are inedible.

1154
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:28,431
(Are they inedible?)

1155
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:29,571
Why not?

1156
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:32,101
They are green. You eat them when they are yellow.

1157
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:33,771
Will they become yellow if we wait?

1158
00:47:33,771 --> 00:47:35,601
Why don't we take them and wait?

1159
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:37,701
Pick the lower one.

1160
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,631
I love fruits.

1161
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:44,471
I ate a lot of papayas when I was in China.

1162
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:47,071
I eat fruits every day.

1163
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:49,831
That's what a papaya looks like.

1164
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:51,971
They look edible.

1165
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:54,471
They will be sweet, right?

1166
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:56,531
(How will we pick them?)

1167
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,231
What should we do?

1168
00:47:58,971 --> 00:48:01,401
(They can only look.)

1169
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,871
I see bananas.

1170
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:06,471
(I see bananas.)

1171
00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:07,901
- What? - Where?

1172
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:09,271
- Where? - Where?

1173
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:11,371
- There they are. They are green. - Where?

1174
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:13,301
I see bananas.

1175
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:14,731
(I came and saw...)

1176
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:16,371
(bananas in the jungle.)

1177
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:18,631
- There are so many bananas. - Should we go over there?

1178
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,671
Wait a minute.

1179
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:23,801
Let's go after we pick these.

1180
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,831
- I will climb the tree. - Don't do that.

1181
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,101
Step over here. It's the middle.

1182
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:30,571
That's right.

1183
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:33,001
(Taking a big step)

1184
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:35,601
There we go.

1185
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:36,931
(He reaches the papayas in one step.)

1186
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:38,001
They will be sweet.

1187
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:39,801
(The jobless brother helped.)

1188
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:41,931
That one looks nice.

1189
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:43,301
(Sleepy picks the papaya Cheng Xiao pointed out.)

1190
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:46,101
- There you go. - Pick the bottom one.

1191
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:48,971
(Sleepy is Cheng Xiao's avatar.)

1192
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:50,731
Cheng Xiao, you are speaking well.

1193
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:54,031
Your Korean improved all of a sudden.

1194
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,431
(Her Korean became fluent at the sight of her favorite fruit.)

1195
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:00,571
- Go left. - No, pick the one on the right.

1196
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:02,431
It's the biggest one.

1197
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,171
Stop picking them. They won't be edible.

1198
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:06,571
(Cheng Xiao is speaking Korean like a native.)

1199
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:10,331
Okay. Good job.

1200
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,571
How do we cut it? Do we cut it like an apple?

1201
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:14,831
You can cut it in half.

1202
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:18,001
It looks edible.

1203
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:20,601
- It's edible. - Give me a piece.

1204
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:21,601
Give me a piece.

1205
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:22,671
(They judge that it's ripe.)

1206
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:24,171
The color is nice.

1207
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:26,201
Does it taste good?

1208
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,231
(How does it taste?)

1209
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:29,571
How is it?

1210
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:32,271
It's sweet.

1211
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:33,971
My goodness.

1212
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:36,671
- Is it edible? - Yes.

1213
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:38,601
- It's sweet. - It's perfect.

1214
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,071
It's edible.

1215
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:44,371
It's nice.

1216
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:45,831
(The papaya expert approves of the taste.)

1217
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,931
All right. Eat this.

1218
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:49,471
(Sleepy played a big role and acquiring the papayas.)

1219
00:49:50,431 --> 00:49:53,631
(He broke out in sweats.)

1220
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:58,901
- It's tasty. - It's really tasty.

1221
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:00,701
It's like a mix between persimmon and peach.

1222
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:03,431
It's a million times tastier than coconuts.

1223
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:04,901
Really?

1224
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:08,131
It will be better to discard the seeds.

1225
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:09,631
Try it.

1226
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:12,031
That one is fully ripe.

1227
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:15,531
(Sol Bi has a taste.)

1228
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:16,931
My goodness.

1229
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,671
It's really tasty in the middle.

1230
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:20,771
All right. Then I will...

1231
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:22,201
(The soft and sweet fruit makes her shudder.)

1232
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:23,231
My goodness.

1233
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,431
These seeds are edible,

1234
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,671
but inconvenient.

1235
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:31,371
Will papaya trees grow if I plant these seeds?

1236
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,131
It will take forever for them to germinate.

1237
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,771
They won't germinate before we leave.

1238
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:40,431
(Sleepy gnaws on an unripe papaya.)

1239
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:42,271
Leave some behind.

1240
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,271
That one is inedible.

1241
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,271
(She feels bad.)

1242
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:48,601
(He tries hard to eat a papaya.)

1243
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:51,931
(Da Hoon, here is a goat.)

1244
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:53,201
(It's tasty.)

1245
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:56,131
I took out the seeds.

1246
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,971
You did a good job, but it sounded like a swear word.

1247
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,171
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

1248
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:05,131
- I took out the seeds. - Make sure you enunciate.

1249
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:09,131
Shall we pick bananas this time?

1250
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:12,101
We forgot about bananas.

1251
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:15,501
- Be careful. - Go, go, go.

1252
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:19,371
Look at those bananas.

1253
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:21,871
We will be able to eat them until tomorrow.

1254
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,071
(There is a bunch of bananas.)

1255
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,531
(They march towards the bananas.)

1256
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:28,001
How will we pick them?

1257
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:30,201
They are up too high. What should we do?

1258
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:32,571
Let's use a rod.

1259
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:33,731
(The tree is very tall.)

1260
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:35,471
They are up too high.

1261
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:37,671
Would it be possible to climb the tree?

1262
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:38,871
(They only stare.)

1263
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:41,471
(Da Hoon shakes the banana leaves.)

1264
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:43,471
- My goodness. - What should we do?

1265
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:46,031
There are too many.

1266
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:47,131
There's no way up.

1267
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:48,731
Nothing is easy.

1268
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,971
There are red ants everywhere.

1269
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:52,671
- There are. - Look.

1270
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:55,271
Of course, there are. There's food up here.

1271
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:56,671
I've got ants on me, too.

1272
00:51:56,671 --> 00:51:58,501
(There are red ants on the ground, too.)

1273
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:01,201
How do we get the bananas?

1274
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:02,271
Let's have a meeting.

1275
00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:04,571
Let's use bamboo.

1276
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:05,731
(They're addicted to meetings.)

1277
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:07,671
How about we tie a piece...

1278
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:11,031
to the saw and saw the tree down?

1279
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:12,971
(No reaction)

1280
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:14,071
From there.

1281
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:17,431
(You don't like that idea.)

1282
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,701
Cheng Xiao's a gymnast. Why don't you jump?

1283
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:24,001
- Me, jump up there? - I'll crouch underneath.

1284
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:27,631
(Jump up in one fluid movement...)

1285
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:31,931
(like a woman in a martial arts movie.)

1286
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:35,031
(I didn't train at the Shaolin Monastery.)

1287
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:38,371
Do you see the thing hanging beneath the bananas?

1288
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:40,931
Shall we try using that?

1289
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:42,531
We could pull it down.

1290
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:44,671
Let's use this.

1291
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,071
(Sol Bi jumps into action.)

1292
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:48,771
(It's time to prove that she's smart.)

1293
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:52,771
(Using a branch with a curved tip...)

1294
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:53,971
(she'll pull the flower.)

1295
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:55,301
How do we get that?

1296
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:57,831
Give me that.

1297
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:01,031
You do it. You hook it up.

1298
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:02,431
(Sleepy steps up yet again.)

1299
00:53:02,431 --> 00:53:04,801
(This is my day!)

1300
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:06,901
(We're coming for you, bananas.)

1301
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:09,001
Hook it right there.

1302
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:10,231
(They got the flower.)

1303
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:11,301
(Slipping)

1304
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,401
(How dare you!)

1305
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:15,471
Give me just one.

1306
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:17,231
Just one banana.

1307
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:19,401
I think you have it.

1308
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,201
- Wait. - Can you lift him up?

1309
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,931
Let's have a meeting.

1310
00:53:22,931 --> 00:53:24,101
(Obsessed with meetings)

1311
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,431
What? Now?

1312
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:26,731
Cheng Xiao, you climb up.

1313
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:29,331
- Me? - Yes, you're the lightest.

1314
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,471
How much do you weigh?

1315
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:32,131
(Pardon?)

1316
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:33,731
Don't ask things like that.

1317
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:37,071
Let's have a meeting. Is this really the right way?

1318
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:38,771
Give me that belt.

1319
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:40,601
- Give me that. - Let's try.

1320
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:41,601
Let's see.

1321
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,631
(Using Byung Man's belt)

1322
00:53:43,631 --> 00:53:45,331
Think about this.

1323
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:48,131
What if the belt remains hanging?

1324
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:50,571
The falling knife could hurt someone.

1325
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:51,731
- We took it out. - It's here.

1326
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:52,771
Good.

1327
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,301
Let's give it a go.

1328
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,871
(The wooden hook got an upgrade.)

1329
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,371
(Now it has a leather belt noose.)

1330
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,001
(It's hooked.)

1331
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:03,031
Pull.

1332
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,771
Twist it a few times.

1333
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:08,171
(He twists the belt to keep it tight.)

1334
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:09,431
Make it tight.

1335
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:10,431
(Spinning)

1336
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:11,901
Yes, that's it.

1337
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:13,771
(Carefully and lightly)

1338
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:17,371
He may wake up late but he does his worth.

1339
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:19,031
(He makes himself useful.)

1340
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:20,971
- That's it. - You did it.

1341
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:22,231
Now pull.

1342
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:24,471
- You did it. - Now pull.

1343
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:26,631
(Will Sleepy's noose do the trick?)

1344
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,471
(Please)

1345
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:33,001
We'll just get the flower. See?

1346
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:35,271
(The belt came off.)

1347
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:38,271
You tried, at least.

1348
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:40,131
- Well done. - Well done.

1349
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:42,731
I bet you'll sleep all day tomorrow.

1350
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:45,601
(He's already sickly.)

1351
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:46,801
You'll wake up at 2:30pm.

1352
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,631
I'll need to sleep until 3pm.

1353
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:53,801
(Da Hoon decides to cut down that one branch.)

1354
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:56,201
(Big Aunt is going full steam ahead.)

1355
00:54:57,901 --> 00:54:59,601
(Will it work?)

1356
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:01,371
Stay away from that area.

1357
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:03,331
I'm halfway through.

1358
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,471
(Banana trees live for many years and branches are cut regularly.)

1359
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,701
It's going over!

1360
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:09,601
- Move, move! - It's going!

1361
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:11,501
(It's going down.)

1362
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:16,571
(The bananas seemed out of reach.)

1363
00:55:16,571 --> 00:55:18,031
(Crashing down)

1364
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:20,671
- Unbelievable. - No way.

1365
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:23,231
(That was hard work.)

1366
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:25,731
- How did you do that? - The ants are going crazy.

1367
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:27,401
These ants are huge.

1368
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:28,471
(They're in a frenzy.)

1369
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:29,501
Let's take some.

1370
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:32,701
(They check the condition the bananas are in.)

1371
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:34,301
It's not ripe at all.

1372
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:35,471
(Not ripe at all)

1373
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:37,201
We should let them grow.

1374
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,031
Is there a way to ripen them?

1375
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:42,131
- In the skin? - Put them in the sun.

1376
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:44,301
- They ripen right away. - You're right.

1377
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,801
- This much? - That's perfect.

1378
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,901
Let's take that much.

1379
00:55:47,901 --> 00:55:48,971
(They scored!)

1380
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:53,571
It's so happy.

1381
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:56,301
It's sucking the sap.

1382
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:58,471
As if the tree's like sugar cane.

1383
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:00,131
It's a long-headed grasshopper.

1384
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:01,971
(I'm just a grasshopper.)

1385
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:03,201
It's having a drink.

1386
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:06,501
(He grabs it.)

1387
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,831
Look at how fat it is.

1388
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,201
Isn't this edible?

1389
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,431
- This is huge. - It's massive.

1390
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:18,531
It was gulping the sap.

1391
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:20,131
It's huge.

1392
00:56:20,801 --> 00:56:21,901
Let's take it.

1393
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:23,831
- Let's go. - Take this.

1394
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:27,131
Nothing is impossible when the family works together.

1395
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:30,031
The Land Team returns with fruit...

1396
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:31,801
and a huge grasshopper...

1397
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:34,501
that will provide the family with some protein.

1398
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:37,231
They return light-heartedly.

1399
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:38,371
That was quite productive.

1400
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:41,471
How is the Sea Team faring?

1401
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,931
(Deep-sea hunting class)

1402
00:56:45,231 --> 00:56:46,701
(Shall we begin?)

1403
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:48,301
(Byung Man's camera)

1404
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:50,031
(Scanning for prey)

1405
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:53,631
(He sees something and dives straight down.)

1406
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:59,331
(What is the Chief's first target?)

1407
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:03,331
(A giant clam)

1408
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,231
(He plucks it easily.)

1409
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:09,871
(Where's Gong Myoung, his star pupil?)

1410
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:14,371
(He can't find any prey and is...)

1411
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:16,101
(floating on the surface.)

1412
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:22,331
(Jin grabs his nose to dive.)

1413
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,371
(But he surfaces right away with nothing.)

1414
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:28,901
(Flapping around)

1415
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:32,501
(Did you get anything?)

1416
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:35,101
I can't see properly. I can't see.

1417
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:38,571
(I should teach them what to do.)

1418
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:41,201
Come over here! Come here.

1419
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,931
Come to where I am.

1420
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:48,331
(The lesson commences.)

1421
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:51,501
(Byung Man's camera)

1422
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,201
(Calmly scan the ocean floor.)

1423
00:57:54,201 --> 00:57:55,671
(Prey spotted)

1424
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:58,031
(There's something!)

1425
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:02,001
(Locate the prey.)

1426
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:03,931
(Gong Myoung, go!)

1427
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:07,131
(Yes, Sir.)

1428
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:12,301
(Diving gracefully)

1429
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:18,331
(It was an easy success.)

1430
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:22,671
(I got it.)

1431
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:26,531
(Byung Man's lesson was a success.)

1432
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:29,831
(This time...)

1433
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:32,001
(Jin, you go.)

1434
00:58:33,231 --> 00:58:36,531
(On Byung Man's signal, he dives right down.)

1435
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:41,171
(Swimming close to the ocean floor)

1436
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:46,331
(Jin found a conch.)

1437
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:52,171
(The lesson yields results right away.)

1438
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,171
- Do you have something? - This.

1439
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:57,931
What is it?

1440
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,471
- A conch? - A conch.

1441
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:00,471
(Byung Man's proud.)

1442
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,731
They're good. They're quick learners.

1443
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:06,871
(He puts his catch in his bag.)

1444
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,501
(The next target...)

1445
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:12,601
(was an easy one.)

1446
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:15,771
Byung Man was a great leader.

1447
00:59:15,771 --> 00:59:17,871
He's an amazing guy.

1448
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,431
It was so fascinating and such a great experience.

1449
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:25,471
He taught me step by step and I managed to keep up.

1450
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:27,401
I saw that it's actually possible.

1451
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:31,501
(Aunt Byung Man's pleased with the boys' success.)

1452
00:59:33,271 --> 00:59:34,331
Do you have something?

1453
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:35,901
(Each dive yields a result.)

1454
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:38,571
(Byung Man's awesome.)

1455
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:43,201
If Byung Man teaches them one thing, Jin and Gong Myoung...

1456
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:45,001
master 10 on their own.

1457
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,431
Byung Man leaves them...

1458
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:50,531
to catch clams and conchs while he looks...

1459
00:59:50,531 --> 00:59:52,301
between the coral and rocks.

1460
00:59:58,801 --> 01:00:00,231
(He saw something!)

1461
01:00:01,571 --> 01:00:04,071
(He tries shoving the net in.)

1462
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:10,101
(There's a lot of dust.)

1463
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,271
(What's hiding between the rocks?)

1464
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:14,531
(Gasping)

1465
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:17,331
(A stingray)

1466
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:23,701
(This is a huge find!)

1467
01:00:27,131 --> 01:00:28,531
(Hang on)

1468
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:30,931
(The stingray got away!)

1469
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,501
(It slipped out of the net.)

1470
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:35,371
(It's really fast!)

1471
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:39,201
(It's here in just one second!)

1472
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:42,101
(Gong Myoung heard the scream and rushed over.)

1473
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,431
(He lost a stingray.)

1474
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:52,431
(The stingray's nowhere to be seen.)

1475
01:00:55,871 --> 01:00:58,931
(Byung Man searches between the rocks just in case,)

1476
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:01,501
(but the sea is too wide for them to meet again.)

1477
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,931
That was so close and such a pity.

1478
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:07,771
They lost a stingray,

1479
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:10,431
but Byung Man and his two sidekicks...

1480
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:12,601
found a few clams and conchs.

1481
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:17,071
On today's menu is Kota Manado-style shellfish soup.

1482
01:01:17,201 --> 01:01:18,431
It should be good.

1483
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:21,371
- Once it opens up... - Clean it?

1484
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:22,801
That's right.

1485
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:26,471
(The clam and conchs slowly open up.)

1486
01:01:28,931 --> 01:01:30,601
(Grumbling stomachs)

1487
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:32,131
This one opened up.

1488
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:33,201
(An open clam)

1489
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:36,301
(Remove the flesh from the shell.)

1490
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:38,601
- Is it an oyster? - It looks like one, doesn't it?

1491
01:01:39,271 --> 01:01:41,171
(Pulling)

1492
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,171
Tear the adductor muscle.

1493
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:46,571
- Do we tear it all up? - Yes.

1494
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:47,671
(Add water.)

1495
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:48,831
It's done.

1496
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,371
(Bring to the boil and eat.)

1497
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:53,171
- Leave it like this. - To boil?

1498
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:55,601
Yes. So the flavor seeps out.

1499
01:01:57,101 --> 01:01:58,971
(While they wait for the soup to cook...)

1500
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:01,501
- Welcome back. - You're back.

1501
01:02:01,571 --> 01:02:03,701
We just finished cooking something.

1502
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:05,901
- They found something. - Not much.

1503
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:07,901
- Ta-da. - What's that?

1504
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:09,831
- Papayas. - You found papayas?

1505
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:12,631
Yes. We plucked them from over there.

1506
01:02:12,631 --> 01:02:13,801
Cheng Xiao.

1507
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:15,171
Bananas.

1508
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,371
(The bananas make an entrance.)

1509
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:18,301
Give me your hand.

1510
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:20,201
(This is for you.)

1511
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:22,001
- For you. - Thank you.

1512
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:23,731
There's something else.

1513
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:25,271
(The grasshopper)

1514
01:02:26,931 --> 01:02:29,571
(Scared out of his wits)

1515
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,071
(Gong Myoung's calm)

1516
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:34,171
- What's that? A locust? - Isn't it cute?

1517
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:35,531
Eat it.

1518
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:37,931
Eat it.

1519
01:02:37,931 --> 01:02:40,031
(He runs away.)

1520
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:43,201
- Come back here. - Go away!

1521
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,071
- Sorry. - I'm tired.

1522
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:46,431
(Still alert)

1523
01:02:46,731 --> 01:02:48,031
What do you have, Sleepy?

1524
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,971
- Stop hiding things. - That's all we have.

1525
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:53,171
(He smiles all of a sudden.)

1526
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,271
(A huge bunch of bananas)

1527
01:02:57,101 --> 01:02:58,901
(Gaping)

1528
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,001
Are you a monkey?

1529
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:02,871
- Taste this. - How?

1530
01:03:02,871 --> 01:03:04,531
It's really good. Take a bite.

1531
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,671
You'll be shocked. It's really sweet.

1532
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:09,671
It's good. It tastes a bit like a squash.

1533
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:13,431
The unripe ones taste like persimmons and the ripe ones...

1534
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:15,771
- taste like peaches and persimmons. - Really?

1535
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,431
Eat it all up.

1536
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:19,001
(Da Hoon cares for the young ones.)

1537
01:03:19,001 --> 01:03:20,271
It's really good.

1538
01:03:20,271 --> 01:03:23,031
- Isn't it sweet? - It's really sweet.

1539
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:26,571
(Cheng Xiao's working on something.)

1540
01:03:26,571 --> 01:03:27,671
Is it too big?

1541
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:29,071
(She's communicating with the grasshopper.)

1542
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,531
What do you eat?

1543
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:32,531
Look at this.

1544
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:34,831
(She's feeding it like it's a pet.)

1545
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:36,131
What is it eating?

1546
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:38,101
A piece of wood.

1547
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,401
I named it "Bana".

1548
01:03:40,431 --> 01:03:43,771
I called it that because we caught it...

1549
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:47,571
while it was feeding off the banana tree.

1550
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:49,331
Say hello.

1551
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:50,971
(She treats it like a puppy.)

1552
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:53,101
It might escape.

1553
01:03:53,301 --> 01:03:55,701
It's really strong. Hello.

1554
01:03:58,031 --> 01:03:59,201
(I'm so tired.)

1555
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:03,071
We should cook that.

1556
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:05,871
How do we cook it?

1557
01:04:06,871 --> 01:04:08,831
(And that is how...)

1558
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:10,101
(Bana ended up in the fire.)

1559
01:04:10,301 --> 01:04:11,371
It's a banana feast.

1560
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:14,271
(The family waits for the food to cook.)

1561
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:18,901
(Gong Myoung drifts off to sleep.)

1562
01:04:20,471 --> 01:04:21,901
(Dozing off)

1563
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,031
How many are there?

1564
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:24,631
(Dozing off)

1565
01:04:25,671 --> 01:04:27,771
(His head slowly dips.)

1566
01:04:27,771 --> 01:04:29,931
I've never seen this insect before.

1567
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:30,931
(Look at him.)

1568
01:04:31,571 --> 01:04:32,771
(Glancing over)

1569
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:36,171
(He must be so tired.)

1570
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:37,231
He's asleep.

1571
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:38,671
It's heartbreaking.

1572
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:40,931
He was like this on the boat, too.

1573
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:42,471
Really?

1574
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:44,031
You didn't sleep much.

1575
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,501
- Did you? - Were you praying?

1576
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:47,471
He slept in the water.

1577
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,171
He slept while floating around.

1578
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:51,431
Shouldn't we take it out?

1579
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:54,471
We have to wait until the stomach puffs up.

1580
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:58,531
- Are you cooking the grasshopper? - Yes.

1581
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:01,271
It's cooked.

1582
01:05:01,271 --> 01:05:02,831
(The grasshopper's cooked.)

1583
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,171
(He can't wait to eat it.)

1584
01:05:07,431 --> 01:05:10,301
Aren't there a lot of these in China?

1585
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:11,431
These?

1586
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:14,431
There are a lot but I've never seen one this huge.

1587
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:16,971
(It's a massive grasshopper.)

1588
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:19,971
- What's this? - A leg.

1589
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:21,071
I'll try a leg.

1590
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,331
It's nice.

1591
01:05:22,731 --> 01:05:25,831
- Me, too. - It's like chicken jerky.

1592
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:27,031
It's hot.

1593
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:29,531
(She holds a twig-like leg...)

1594
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,571
(and smacks her lips.)

1595
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,171
I'll eat it because I'm hungry.

1596
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:35,671
It's got a nutty flavor.

1597
01:05:35,671 --> 01:05:37,671
I saw this alive just a while ago.

1598
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,901
But now I can't help but eat it.

1599
01:05:41,431 --> 01:05:43,831
(How does the grasshopper taste?)

1600
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:48,301
It's really good. Why is this?

1601
01:05:48,771 --> 01:05:50,731
(Shocked by the unexpected taste)

1602
01:05:51,471 --> 01:05:53,171
Why does this taste good?

1603
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:54,171
(What's this flavor?)

1604
01:05:54,171 --> 01:05:55,371
I'm shocked.

1605
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:57,801
(Everyone rushes in for a taste.)

1606
01:05:57,801 --> 01:06:00,301
- It's good. - The older generation ate these.

1607
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:02,931
Even I used to. They were sold deep-fried.

1608
01:06:02,931 --> 01:06:04,471
Why is it salty?

1609
01:06:04,471 --> 01:06:05,571
(It's salted.)

1610
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:06,631
It's like dried fish.

1611
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:08,801
A squid's spine.

1612
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:10,631
Right?

1613
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:12,971
(That's the taste of the jungle.)

1614
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:15,631
Can I eat this part?

1615
01:06:15,631 --> 01:06:17,531
(Sol Bi's fallen in love.)

1616
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:19,371
(She might want it whole.)

1617
01:06:19,371 --> 01:06:21,671
- You must like it. - Wait, I'll tear it off.

1618
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:23,101
I didn't know it's this good.

1619
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:25,831
It's tasty and high in protein.

1620
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:27,701
Can we get these in Korea?

1621
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:29,131
Not in Seoul.

1622
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:30,571
(A new horizon is opened.)

1623
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:31,601
Do you want some?

1624
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,171
Who wants half?

1625
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:37,001
It tastes just like the leg.

1626
01:06:37,531 --> 01:06:39,071
(Staring)

1627
01:06:39,271 --> 01:06:40,471
I ate one as a kid.

1628
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:43,071
Do you see all this flesh?

1629
01:06:45,531 --> 01:06:47,231
I'm going to eat the head.

1630
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:50,531
- Isn't that the good part? - You eat it, then.

1631
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:51,531
- No. - It's just meat.

1632
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:54,001
- It tastes good. - Do you want it?

1633
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:55,471
(Do you want the body?)

1634
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:56,831
(He goes for it.)

1635
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:59,031
It'll taste just like the leg.

1636
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:02,731
(Da Hoon savors it as if he's used to the taste.)

1637
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:05,571
(Jin may be afraid...)

1638
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:06,731
(but hunger fuels him.)

1639
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,871
Well done.

1640
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:09,531
(Gasping)

1641
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,101
(What's wrong, Jin?)

1642
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:15,201
(Trembling lips)

1643
01:07:15,871 --> 01:07:18,301
I saw inside his mouth. Something burst.

1644
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,531
There's nothing to burst but the head.

1645
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:21,801
Something burst.

1646
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:24,301
- Something burst. - The guts, right?

1647
01:07:24,301 --> 01:07:26,331
I ate all the guts.

1648
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:29,271
I plucked it out of the belly when I separated the head.

1649
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:30,671
It's just the head.

1650
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,001
What does it taste like?

1651
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:33,931
Like a grasshopper...

1652
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:36,201
jumped into my mouth and...

1653
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:37,871
I bit it by accident.

1654
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:40,031
- A bit like death, then. - Yes.

1655
01:07:40,101 --> 01:07:41,201
Death?

1656
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:42,971
(Yes. Something like that.)

1657
01:07:44,871 --> 01:07:46,471
(The sound stimulates your appetite.)

1658
01:07:46,471 --> 01:07:48,831
Chief, shall we take the soup off the fire?

1659
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:50,001
Yes.

1660
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:51,171
(The soup's ready.)

1661
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:52,931
- What's this? - Shellfish soup.

1662
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:57,431
I don't want it all but I'd love to taste the broth.

1663
01:07:57,431 --> 01:07:58,431
(Their first soup)

1664
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:00,131
I'm so excited.

1665
01:08:01,971 --> 01:08:03,301
(Everyone's gulping)

1666
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:04,431
Just a bit.

1667
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:07,471
That must be good.

1668
01:08:07,471 --> 01:08:09,271
(The eldest gets to taste first.)

1669
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:10,631
(Gulping)

1670
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,131
It's really rich.

1671
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,771
The flavor's all there.

1672
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:20,571
It's slightly salty...

1673
01:08:20,671 --> 01:08:22,271
but not too much.

1674
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:25,801
I taste more kelp than shellfish.

1675
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:27,631
- Right? - Yes.

1676
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:31,201
I love the smell of the shellfish.

1677
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:33,431
(The smell of shellfish)

1678
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:37,471
You had too much.

1679
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:38,471
(Glaring)

1680
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:42,071
(Making a snide remark because he wants some.)

1681
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:44,271
(She just laughs.)

1682
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:47,201
Shellfish soup.

1683
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:49,301
(It washes all the fatigue away.)

1684
01:08:50,771 --> 01:08:53,371
(Is it good, Cheng Xiao?)

1685

1686
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:57,971
- How is it? - Good.

1687
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:00,631
(It's Sleepy's turn at last.)

1688
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:01,931
It's like soju.

1689
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:05,131
Try some shellfish. It's good.

1690

(Open wide, Gong Myoung.)

1691
01:09:07,631 --> 01:09:08,771
That's the tasty bit.

1692
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,631
- Did you doze off? - Yes.

1693
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:12,271

(Nice and chewy)

1696
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:20,971
This isn't something...

1697
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,271
we can buy at a market.

1698
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:24,541
That's what's important.

1699
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:27,541
(It's amazing.)

1700
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:28,601
It's delicious.

1701
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:32,831
It's delicious.

1702
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:34,731
That's incredible.

1703
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:37,871
On a rainy day...

1704
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:42,041
a bowl of this by the sea with waves crashing in the back.

1705
01:09:42,101 --> 01:09:43,301
That would be nice.

1710
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:50,971
Is it that good?

1711

What does it taste like?

1712

I can't describe it.

1713

It's such a pity I have to swallow it.

(They're anxious.)

1806
01:13:41,571 --> 01:13:42,571
Live without food?

1807
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:43,771
(Live without food?)

1808
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:45,101
We're already doing that.

1809
01:13:45,371 --> 01:13:46,931
Live without fire?

1810
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:48,931
- Live without light. - It's fire.

1811
01:13:49,431 --> 01:13:52,471
- What if it's no clothes? - Live without clothes?

1812
01:13:52,671 --> 01:13:54,671
- Live fleetingly. - "Live fleetingly"?

1813
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:56,071

1815

The third and last rule...

1817
01:14:02,831 --> 01:14:05,801
(They're anxious and nervous.)

1818
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:07,231
The third and last rule...

1819
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:10,831
(What?)

1820
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:14,601
See?

1821
01:14:14,601 --> 01:14:15,731
(They're shocked and terrified.)

1822
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,041
- That makes no sense. - That's...

1823
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:19,231
- nonsense. - You're telling us to starve.

1824
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:21,701
- All of a sudden? - This is ridiculous.

1825
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:23,831
(It's the worst rule you can imagine.)

1826
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:24,901
What have I done wrong?

1827
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:27,701
Next week.

1828
01:14:28,801 --> 01:14:31,801
(This is the last of Zero Base, Three No's.)

1829
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:36,901
(They're in chaos and confusion. They can't let their guards down.)

1830
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:38,401
(Groaning)

1831
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:40,071
(Weather is awful.)

1832
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,701
I'm cold.

1833
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:44,231
(It pours in Kota Manado due to the rainy season.)

1834
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:47,801
(They're exhausted.)

1835
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:49,371
(Even their ace member goes down.)

1836
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:52,301
(Is there a conflict amongst the members?)

1837
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:55,041
