1
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,218
- Unbelievable.
- I can't hold it much longer.

2
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,219
You've almost got the record.

3
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,760
Come on, 20 more seconds.
Hold on tight...

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I think I'm about to pass out!

5
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:16,302
I can't!

6
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:19,719
Oh...

7
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,303
Mm... Oh, my God!
This is so good!

8
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:34,012
I put a little Cointreau in.

9
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,970
- Mm.
- That's the secret.

10
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,137
Mm. I have to
go in a minute,

11
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:40,762
- do you want to dance?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:44,428
<i>Just blows me away</i>

13
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,096
<i>Unskinny bop, bop</i>

14
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,721
<i>All night and day</i>

15
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,346
<i>Unskinny bop, bop, bop</i>

16
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,846
<i>She just loves to play</i>

17
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:59,263
<i>Unskinny bop Nothing more to say</i>

18
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:03,179
<i>You look at me so funny</i>

19
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,763
<i>Love bite got you acting oh so strange</i>

20
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,972
<i>You got too many
bees in your honey...</i>

21
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:14,847
You're a fucking hot one, ain't ya?

22
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:20,307
Oh, I'm OK.

23
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:29,140
Check us out.

24
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,306
Can you... put that away?
You're scaring me.

25
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,724
Well, you should be scared.

26
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:38,349
It's a healthy reaction
to a big ass gun like this.

27
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,348
Yeah.

28
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,850
OK.

29
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,308
I'm going to go now, time's up.

30
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,975
I guess you've got to go.

31
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,975
OK.

32
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,017
I enjoyed your company!

33
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,767
I hope you come back!

34
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,309
Get me out of here.

35
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:09,184
OK, Otis, we're going.

36
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,225
We are going, right now.
Come on, honey.

37
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:24,185
- Hi, Dad.
- Beth! Bethanna...

38
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:26,311
- Hey.
- Hello.

39
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:31,144
- OK, what's up?
- I need to do something else.

40
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,977
What's wrong with the pet sitting?

41
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:35,727
I never knew anyone who could
make so much off that.

42
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:38,061
Yeah, the money's good,

43
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,978
but the pets are not always that nice.

44
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:43,020
I'm burned out.

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,478
Take it from me, now is not the
time to put down a good job.

46
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,978
You still haven't found anything?

47
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,271
No, nobody's buying cars.

48
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,979
Hell, they're barely making them.

49
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,312
Well, it's more than just my job.

50
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:57,311
I need like a big change.

51
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:01,313
I have to, I don't know...

52
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:05,314
I want stimulation.

53
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:07,105
And I want good money.

54
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:11,479
And I want a change of
scenery that's interesting.

55
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,980
OK... OK, let me think if I
know anybody over at the mall.

56
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,314
Yeah, it's not going to do it.

57
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:24,356
I want to move to Las Vegas
and be a cocktail waitress.

58
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:29,356
Beth Anne...

59
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:34,313
...goddamn,
that is a great idea!

60
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:36,940
Wow! Yeah, Oh...
Caesars Palace.

61
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,148
- That's where you got to get in!
- Caesars would be amazing!

62
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:41,815
Oh...

63
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:39,194
- I think the hot plate works.
- I'll take it.

64
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:50,486
Go! Go...
Oh, so close.

65
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:54,236
Go! Yes... Oh! Oh.

66
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:56,487
Please... Go on!

67
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,321
Hey. I advise you to
stop playing this thing.

68
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,987
Why? Am I in trouble
or something?

69
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,821
No, no. It's just...
You seem like a nice girl,

70
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,320
and flip's for retards.

71
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,196
Oh... OK.

72
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:11,029
- Thank you.
- No problem. Have a nice evening.

73
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,986
Hey, wait.

74
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:16,821
Do you know where I could find
a job as a cocktail waitress?

75
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,821
I think you pretty much have to grab the tray

76
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:21,364
the exact second one of these
golden girls kicks the bucket.

77
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,947
This is a union town.

78
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,488
Take it easy.

79
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:27,280
Huh.

80
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,364
Why don't you strip?
It's good money.

81
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:44,324
Yeah, I don't think I want to do that.

82
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,198
You've done it before, right?

83
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,156
Why do you say that?

84
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:50,823
- 'Cause it's kind of obvious.
- It is? Really?

85
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:54,865
Just to us girls in the club.

86
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:59,991
I just want to do something
exciting and different.

87
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,325
- I came here to...
- Yeah, change everything.

88
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,490
Hey, Holly, what about Dink?

89
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,074
- What's Dink?
- Doesn't he need anybody?

90
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,449
Well, that's kind of...

91
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,158
You know, I kind of need to know someone

92
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,324
before I send them to Dink.

93
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,992
It requires a great deal of trustworthiness.

94
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:19,909
Oh, my God, you guys...
I am super trustworthy.

95
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,201
All right.

96
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,867
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Dink?

97
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:38,159
I am Dink, yes.
You must be Beth. Come in.

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,285
So, how much do you know about gambling?

99
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:45,160
Uh, I played some
Flip-It the other night...

100
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,827
How'd you do?

101
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:48,036
I was told it was for retards,

102
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:49,535
but I got really into it.

103
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,828
I might not trust you with my money.

104
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,369
You're going to rob me and
go play Flip-It all night.

105
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,327
No, no, I'm not.

106
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:59,787
Come on, I need this Louisiana
game to stay under...

107
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:03,244
- Not for a little.
- So, you're a bookie.

108
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:06,495
Absolutely not.
Bookmaking's illegal.

109
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:09,037
I'm a gambler.
Everything I do here

110
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:10,912
is completely legal in the state of Nevada.

111
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,370
So, do you play poker or blackjack?

112
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,496
Some poker... blackjack,
not really gambling.

113
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,328
It's just no skill, no odds.

114
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:20,245
Just a racket for the casinos to make money.

115
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,454
Well, my dad played a lot of blackjack.

116
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,245
Sorry to hear that.

117
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,913
Ah, this San Francisco line is way too high.

118
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:29,830
Look at something.

119
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,246
You see that little patch
of yellow skin right there?

120
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:33,747
- Nope.
- Well, maybe not in this light.

121
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:37,165
Anyway, I make my lines. Then
I compare them to the books.

122
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,830
- To the books?
- Sports books.

123
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,163
A sports book is where you go to
make a bet on a sporting game.

124
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:44,956
You can do that here in Vegas,

125
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,331
or you can do it online overseas,
but I gotta do it here.

126
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,956
So, I gotta send guys that run and take the

127
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:51,955
money down there and make the bets for me.

128
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:54,206
Maybe that's something you could
do, if you come down here to work.

129
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:58,206
I can't believe you can't see
this little yellow mark.

130
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:01,498
So, I specialize in horse racing,

131
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:04,331
hockey and baseball, but
we bet on all sports here.

132
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,375
- Can I?
- NFL, NBA, the PGA,

133
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,499
NCAA Football, NCAA Basketball,

134
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,832
tennis, the WNBA,

135
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,333
Little League World Series,

136
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,332
the National Spelling Bee Competition,

137
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:19,207
the Miss America Beauty Pageant,

138
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:22,332
the... Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Contest.

139
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:26,375
Pretty much anything, always odds can be made.

140
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,208
That is a lot of stuff.

141
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:34,084
Yes, but all I have to do is make 55
percent, and I am very, very happy.

142
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:38,084
It's about time!

143
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:40,834
- You're both late.
- Construction!

144
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,001
- Hi...
- Beth, say hi to Frankie and Scott.

145
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,335
Hey, do not fall in love with me.

146
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,335
- OK.
- Don't believe a word he says.

147
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:51,210
Frankie is a much better person than he seems.

148
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,336
Scott, on the other hand, is the sensible one.

149
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:57,044
If you ever need me for something and I'm busy?

150
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:00,295
I'm going to bet this seven horse.

151
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:04,419
First time starter.
Could be a total zero.

152
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,168
- New York's moving big time.
- Call Jazz.

153
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:08,002
I wish you guys weren't late...

154
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:09,461
One-six-four
Ivy sixth race...

155
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:25,837
OK, here's what just happened in New York.

156
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,879
They're moving their line, so now we're
trying to move our lines accordingly

157
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,004
to adjust for a couple of outs that
haven't moved their lines yet.

158
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:33,004
- You understand?
- Uh-uh.

159
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,171
The rules at Dink Inc.
are responsibility

160
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:37,129
to come on time is job is number one.

161
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,088
Number two, keep your head around the numbers.

162
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,421
You've got to learn the numbers.

163
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:42,796
Very important to get the numbers down.

164
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,463
Rule number three, do not steal.

165
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:47,338
Most people fail at one of those.

166
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,963
- Is that a guinea pig?
- That is my hamster, Jyrki.

167
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,338
I named him Jyrki Lumme

168
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,756
after the defenseman from Vancouver Canucks.

169
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,339
- Oh.
- And that is my wife, Tulip.

170
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,506
She's on a cruise in the Bahamas right now.

171
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:03,173
Dinky, Dinky. This nag you
bet on is coming up fast!

172
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:06,464
- Go, go, go...
- Wow, wow, wow...

173
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:10,132
Come on! Come on...

174
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:28,008
You won!

175
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,175
- You won!
- Genius.

176
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,508
Just like that. Wow.

177
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:35,883
I have to pay attention to this now.

178
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:39,509
Um, meet me at the sports book at the Rio.

179
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,342
8 am sharp, OK?
Do you need some money?

180
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:42,842
- No.
- Everybody needs money.

181
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:45,550
Take it. OK? Bye.

182
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,050
- Thank you.
- Yeah, take it easy.

183
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,302
You're lucky if Dinky hires you.

184
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,052
He's a good guy to work for.

185
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:07,344
He buys his crew breakfast and lunch.

186
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:11,843
And how does a girl like you
get along with Dinky's wife?

187
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,178
I haven't met her yet.

188
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:15,343
- Is that right?
- Hey, Dinky!

189
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:19,177
There she is! I thought I
scared you off yesterday.

190
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:21,427
Hey, I know you.
It's the Flip-It girl.

191
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,386
Oh, no. You're not
still playing Flip-It?

192
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:26,303
- No.
- Just do me a favor, go into the counter...

193
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:29,844
Belmont, race two. 50 dollars
quinella on the five and seven.

194
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:31,512
- And keep this for yourself.
- Oh no, I'll do it for free.

195
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:33,512
- I need to learn.
- Take the money.

196
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:37,178
He's on a roll.
You're struggling.

197
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:40,846
Take the money. Come on,
I'll walk you up there.

198
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,012
So...

199
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:46,805
...when someone
gives you their money,

200
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,930
it's a... a sign of trust.

201
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,180
You understand that, don't you?

202
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,138
Yeah, I understand.

203
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:55,971
Belmont, race two.

204
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:58,555
Fifty dollar quinella
for the five and the seven.

205
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,223
What?
I'm good with numbers.

206
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:05,514
Hm.

207
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:08,013
All these sports,

208
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:13,015
hockey, racing, football, basketball, whatever.

209
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:17,848
Over there on the board are the lines
the casino is offering. The odds.

210
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:21,390
You can bet on anything.
Who wins, who wins by how much.

211
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,849
The team with the best finish.
Anything. Look, see?

212
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:30,349
Someone's laying a lot of money,
so the casino's changing the odds.

213
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:34,016
I make my money by working
out where they're wrong.

214
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:39,391
God, that was so exciting! And the
money, you won so much money!

215
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,850
I had a bad day yesterday.
The money's not that important.

216
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,890
Oh, well, that's what people
with money love to say.

217
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,349
You are good with numbers.

218
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:47,934
Yeah, I'm pretty good with letters, too.

219
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,934
- What?
- Say a word.

220
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,392
- Lose.
- No, a long one.

221
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:56,267
Louisiana.

222
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,351
Double A, double I, L, N, O with U.

223
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:00,768
- I don't get it.
- It's the letters of Louisiana,

224
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,518
put in alphabetical order.

225
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:04,809
- I know, it's weird, right?
- Do it again.

226
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,892
Well, give me a word.

227
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:10,851
- Suicide.
- C, D, E, double I, S, U.

228
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,060
That was amazing.

229
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:20,477
So, after Ohio, I moved back to Florida again,

230
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:24,059
where my dad lives. And I got
a job in a Thai restaurant,

231
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,394
but when I broke up with
their son, they fired me.

232
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:32,185
- OK.
- OK.

233
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,020
What?

234
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,854
OK, so after I got fired,
I had to find another job.

235
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:45,769
And I found one in the paper.

236
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,854
And, it was...

237
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,187
...private dancing.

238
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:53,521
You know, going to clients houses and stripping.

239
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:57,021
- Basically.
- OK.

240
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,771
And then also I had a pornographic website,

241
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,230
which was pictures of me naked,

242
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,021
Photoshopped to look like I was giving oral sex

243
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,272
to my twin and stuff.

244
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:07,521
Eventually, a few other girls joined it, too.

245
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,188
Nobody knows about that.

246
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:14,021
- Nobody.
- You're a gonif.

247
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:18,064
Gonif. Yiddish for a
small time loveable thief.

248
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:20,772
You'll do very well in this business.

249
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:22,855
Well, you don't think it's
something I should be ashamed of?

250
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,230
No, no. You're a kid.

251
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,231
You're just doing kid things.

252
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,522
I mean, it's dangerous.
Not that happy about that.

253
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:31,397
If my parents ever found out,

254
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,232
they would feel like they
have no idea who I really am.

255
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:38,065
I freebased a couple of times.

256
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:40,189
I never told my mom.

257
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,524
I was a bookie, back in New York.

258
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,774
Harmless, but illegal.

259
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:49,024
As it turns out, I took some
bets from this guy in Detroit.

260
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:52,233
I never met him, turns out he's a mob guy.

261
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,232
When they bust him, they go
through his phone records.

262
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:57,400
- They end up busting me.
- Did you go to jail?

263
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,025
No, a felony conviction, but I
was only in a halfway house.

264
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,150
But my mom was devastated.

265
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,442
At least she never thought
she had no idea who I am.

266
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,526
- OK?
- OK.

267
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,151
- OK, then.
- Oh, OK. Bye.

268
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:15,984
OK, bye.

269
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:20,235
All right, see you in the morning.

270
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:23,859
- Don't be late.
- Wait! Are you hiring me?

271
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:27,528
- Still want the job?
- Yes! I want the job.

272
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,152
Then yes, I'm hiring you.

273
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:30,985
Hours are from 8 to 5,

274
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,026
you get four hours off for lunch, 10 to 2,

275
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,361
Monday through Saturday,
Sundays we go all day, 8 to 4.

276
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,944
You get paid 20 dollars an hour...

277
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,277
- Really?
- ...Bonuses, vacations.

278
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:42,361
- Yes. And three meals.
- Really?

279
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:44,820
Oh, my God, yes, really.

280
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,069
Bye.

281
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:55,986
- OK.
- All right, I'll call you back in 10.

282
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:58,987
Oh shit, shit's popping off!
Let's get ready to rumble!

283
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:02,070
OK, there's my Minnesota, minus six.

284
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,405
Are you ready for this, sweet thing?

285
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,779
- No, I don't get it.
- You don't get what?

286
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,363
This! All of it! How to do it.
You should fire me.

287
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,447
- No.
- Dink, Dink, Dink. Let me fire her.

288
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,946
I'm not going to fire you, OK?

289
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:16,946
I've just been talking to you too
much and you're mired in theory.

290
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:19,155
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
You are gonna make this bet.

291
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,322
Just use your phone,
pick it up. OK?

292
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:23,363
- We're gonna call...
- Try Top of the World, they're slow.

293
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,154
That's your speed dial for Top of the
World, you're going to call them.

294
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:28,447
It's a sports book in Costa Rica.

295
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,364
Ask about Minnesota game, 224.

296
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:34,281
You lay the minus six, but two dimes.

297
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:38,489
OK, hi. Six, four, six,
double D.

298
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:41,948
Uh, game 224, Minnesota.

299
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:44,990
OK, I'll take the six with Minnesota.

300
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,990
- No, no, don't...
- What? What...

301
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,865
Don't say take. You're doing great.
You're doing great, OK?

302
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:53,324
Minnesota is the favorite, you don't
take the favorite, you lay the favorite.

303
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:56,991
OK, so we're going to lay two dimes.

304
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:01,449
Hi. Actually, can I lay
the six for two dime?

305
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:06,242
Uh-huh. Six, four,
six, double D.

306
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:09,241
OK, OK.
Watch, now watch this.

307
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:12,283
Wait... Wait...

308
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,826
You see that?
Wait for it.

309
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,951
- And, boom.
- What?

310
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,908
- You just changed that line.
- I did?

311
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:21,201
Our $2000 bet just moved those odds.

312
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,868
And that's what we did, OK?
You just made your first bet.

313
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:27,535
- For $2000?
- $2000.

314
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:33,409
The way the numbers keep changing on the screen.

315
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:36,077
You just make it into what you want it to be.

316
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,910
I don't know, it's the first place that's ever

317
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,410
made any sense of how my brain works.

318
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,327
Well, next thing you know he'll be
taking you to Magic's for game day.

319
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,368
We're going there on Sunday.

320
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:48,827
He asked the guys.
They couldn't come.

321
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,286
- Hey, you're not...
- What?

322
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,369
Are you?

323
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,370
God, no.

324
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,328
Mm-hm.

325
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:02,870
All right.

326
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,453
'Cause I wouldn't if I were you.

327
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,412
If you last long enough to meet Tulip,

328
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,245
- you'll know what I mean.
- Well, I'm not.

329
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:12,036
The thought never entered my mind.

330
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:14,079
Mm-hm.

331
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,329
Dominic kicks...

332
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,329
- Hey, Dink!
- Dinky!

333
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,454
Everybody meet Beth.

334
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,829
Dink Inc's newest employee

335
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,955
and Flip-It aficionado.
Say hi to everybody.

336
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,997
Hi.

337
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:35,831
I don't think your friends like me.

338
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,039
They like you.

339
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,455
They like you.

340
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,080
They can just barely tolerate women.

341
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,914
- Forgot about that.
- I got too much on the under.

342
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:45,164
- Anybody want a piece of this?
- I'll take two dimes.

343
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,539
- Done.
- How the fuck you got two dimes to bet on the game

344
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:50,248
when you ain't paid me back the
money from Saratoga, you fat fuck.

345
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,874
Dinky! I'm back!

346
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:58,040
- Uh-oh.
- Who is that?

347
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Rosie, the bookmaker from New York.

348
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,541
I thought that was illegal.

349
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,332
It is. Last year,
he went on a big broke.

350
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,874
I mean, I can't believe he'd
show his face here, broke.

351
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,083
Still owes me 70 grand.

352
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,832
Aren't you mad at him?

353
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,375
No, it's not that kind of thing.

354
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,915
Oh...

355
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,833
I believe this is yours.

356
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,041
Me handing over to you, now that is a switch.

357
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,208
Are you trying to tell me
I didn't beat you on Charlotte?

358
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,834
- Fair and square, Dink.
- Fair and square.

359
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,250
Wow. Can you put
this in your bag?

360
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,876
I just don't have enough room in
my pockets for all that money.

361
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,376
Dinky...

362
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,042
Did you know this man is one of my heroes?

363
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,208
When I was 16 I wanted to
be Dink when I grew up.

364
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,543
A real classic thing...
What the fuck is that?

365
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,417
Is that a fucking ticker?

366
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,209
Holy shit! They still
have that service?

367
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,835
What is there a fucking mouse on
a treadmill inside that thing?

368
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,335
It gives you the latest
scores from when? 1997?

369
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:57,085
Still works for me.

370
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,420
I just won $114,000!

371
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,170
Oh, fuck you, Rosie.

372
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,878
Dinky, I had to change my phone number.

373
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,962
This is my recent contact info.

374
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:20,378
My name is Troy Roseland,
you get to call me Rosie.

375
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,087
- Hi, I'm Beth.
- She works for me.

376
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:24,795
It's great seeing you, Dink.

377
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:41,212
Oh, hi... I'm Beth.

378
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:44,088
- You're Beth.
- Mm-hm.

379
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,423
Oh.

380
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:51,256
Did you have a nice time on your boating trip?

381
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,464
Yes, yes. Beautiful.

382
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:56,006
Beautiful.

383
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:58,382
- So, who've you worked for?
- Oh, you mean where have I...

384
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:00,131
Have you ever worked for a gambler?

385
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:03,131
No, no... but I'm loving
working for your husband.

386
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,338
He's so great, honest, wonderful.

387
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:08,840
- Wonderful boss.
- So, who've you called so far for rundowns?

388
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,798
- Oh...
- That is the first thing you do

389
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,881
when you get to the office.

390
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,550
Um, minus two.

391
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,341
- There's nothing for me.
- No, Knox's line was better.

392
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:27,215
- I'll call him back.
- Forget it. We missed it.

393
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:29,050
We're already on the other side.

394
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,800
I'm down $50,000 today.

395
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,883
You! Park it!

396
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:43,175
No more scores.

397
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:46,051
And that goes for you, too!

398
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:49,550
You stay put! I mean, both of
youse just stay put, you hear me?

399
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:55,343
Oh, no...

400
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:57,926
No!

401
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,385
Oh, touchdown, Dinky.
Twenty-nine seconds...

402
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:04,010
Oh, perfect!

403
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,010
- Tulip! You're a jinx!
- No, I'm not.

404
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,969
Either you're a jinx, or God hates me.

405
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,051
You tell me which one it is.

406
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:13,052
Would you turn that thing off?

407
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:19,344
I'm gonna go broke this winter,
we're gonna have to sell a house.

408
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:24,886
- You say that every winter.
- Yeah, this year I know. We are gonna go broke.

409
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,803
And it's gonna sneak up on
us quietly, very quietly!

410
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:30,137
You know what?
I didn't come here for this.

411
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:34,304
I'm going to fit in some Pilates before golf.
I didn't come here for this.

412
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:47,305
I know something that'll make you feel better.

413
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:51,054
- A bullet?
- No.

414
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,221
Chinese poker.

415
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:54,306
I haven't been doing very good lately.

416
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:59,055
Oh, come on. You're just
having a little moment.

417
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,888
A slump. It's called a slump
and it's not getting any better.

418
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:06,222
And it doesn't help to have a wife who's a jinx.

419
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:11,890
I deal with it as best I can.

420
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,390
Oh, this is good, this is good.
We need this field goal.

421
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,891
Hughes did very good in the first half.
Sit right here.

422
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,557
Oh, I did very well just now.

423
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:38,558
So, why didn't you go into the
stock market or something?

424
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,057
- It seems like the same thing.
- Stock market's a racket,

425
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:43,099
and I'd rather bet on professional wrestling.

426
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:46,976
So, why don't you have your
own sports book somewhere?

427
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:50,892
The operators in Costa Rica sound
so nice and happy on the phone.

428
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:52,309
I bet it's beautiful down there.

429
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,226
I went down to San Jose one time.

430
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:57,809
It's not what you think when
you think of Costa Rica.

431
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,434
Very grim, very sad.

432
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:01,518
But you'd make so much money from your own book.

433
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:04,892
Sure, yeah, but then I'd
have to live in San Jose.

434
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:06,892
You know, I could be a lot richer in general

435
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:10,269
if I'd made most of my decisions based on money.

436
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,060
My hugest defect.

437
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:18,185
No! No! That's what
makes you so... great.

438
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,269
I'm not so great.

439
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:26,893
- You what now?
- It was just hands!

440
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:30,311
With Dink? Are you
out of your mind?

441
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:34,228
God, I'm sorry I ever told you.

442
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:36,353
That's what you're sorry for?

443
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:39,229
Do you think I should confess my love

444
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:41,979
and see if he'll leave Tulip
and run away with me?

445
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:45,229
Do you have some kind of
fucked up thing with your dad?

446
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,895
No! God, my dad
was my best friend.

447
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:54,355
- We did everything together.
- Can you do me a favor?

448
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:58,521
Can you make sure Tulip never finds
out it was me who brought you around?

449
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,563
- Yes! Go!
- Go, Berto!

450
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:11,897
I can't believe you picked this Berto fight.

451
00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:15,398
Oh, come on!
He is a stallion.

452
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:19,190
How could anyone lay odds on him
being out by the fifth round.

453
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:26,315
Plus, he trains around the corner from my motel.

454
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:30,272
You could be my new downtown sports consultant.

455
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,940
Sure, if you want me to.

456
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,566
Hi.

457
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:52,566
You have no fucking reason
to be out so late with her!

458
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:55,024
Tulip, every night you go
to bed at nine o'clock.

459
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:56,566
Now, just because I have a new friend,

460
00:26:56,566 --> 00:27:00,233
you're going to call me
up and... tell me...

461
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:02,025
You're making yourself crazy!

462
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:03,983
Come on, you're missing the
best part. Hang up on her.

463
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:06,943
Did I just hear that little cunt?!

464
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:09,443
Tulip, you're forcing yourself...

465
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:12,609
Fuck you, Dink!

466
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:25,902
I have to go home now.

467
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:28,234
She's losing her mind.

468
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:29,943
Just don't tell me who wins this fight, OK?

469
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,360
No, come on. No, no, no. Come on.
Stay for one more round.

470
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,069
One more round.
She'll live.

471
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:39,319
Plus, I'm making you money.

472
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:47,903
I owe this guy Leon down in Costa Rica, $80,000.

473
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:52,278
You're going to take this over to
a guy named Rudy at the Paris.

474
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:57,279
Take this to him and I'll be even with Leon.
It's $80,000. Count it.

475
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,071
...And then
race fourteen...

476
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,029
No, no, make Frankie do the run.
We need Beth on the phones.

477
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,570
Oh what? Now Beth's better
than me on the phones?

478
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,238
Well, you said that, not me.

479
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:11,279
Now go fuck yourself, OK?
I never liked you.

480
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,280
It's OK, Dink.
I'll make the run.

481
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,988
Oh, for God's sake.
Stop sniffing money.

482
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,572
Jesus, I can't take this.

483
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:36,490
I'm gonna go work out a little later,

484
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,406
and then I'm going to go home and get a massage.

485
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:42,906
Uh, after you make this drop, you wanna
meet me over at Caesars parking lot?

486
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,531
Go get something to eat?

487
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,658
Uh-huh, sure.

488
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,201
I love you.

489
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,368
Oh...

490
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:39,034
So, what?

491
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,827
Never stopped anybody.

492
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:44,327
We had a deal.

493
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,453
We had a deal.

494
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:55,829
I can't believe I have to say this.

495
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,911
All I was supposed to do is take care of you.

496
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:04,287
And you take care of me.

497
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:09,161
That's why I picked you.

498
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:14,579
That was our deal.

499
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:22,913
I can't believe you made me say this.

500
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:37,497
Look at this! Spring training
in lovely Scottsdale, Arizona.

501
00:30:37,497 --> 00:30:40,373
Let's go!

502
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,164
- Beth.
- Mm-hm?

503
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:47,873
I have to fire you.

504
00:30:56,874 --> 00:30:58,498
No crying.

505
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:03,041
This has been fun, but it's just not good.

506
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,457
It's just not good. Tulip says
you're coming between us.

507
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:12,042
And she's right. So, do yourself a
favor and just take the money...

508
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:13,916
Why don't you do yourself a favor,

509
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,915
and get rid of your miserable fucking wife.

510
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,250
OK, out of the car.

511
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,417
You are so fun, you love to have fun.

512
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,250
You do!
And you're wonderful,

513
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,084
and she doesn't want you to have fun.

514
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,249
That's not true.

515
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:34,376
Look, come on.
Just stop crying.

516
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:37,333
Get out.
Get out of the car.

517
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,584
- OK!
- I'm a married man.

518
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:47,043
Why are you so afraid of losing her?

519
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:49,211
She's not afraid of losing you...

520
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,418
Beth...

521
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:56,420
It doesn't always help when someone
thinks you're the greatest,

522
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,377
and you don't think you're the greatest.

523
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,586
Bye Beth.

524
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:07,544
Watch your toes.

525
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:13,504
<i>There you go baby</i>

526
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:16,878
<i>Here and now Well you</i>

527
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:20,087
<i>Left me here So I could</i>

528
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,920
<i>Sit and cry</i>

529
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,546
<i>Golly gee...</i>

530
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:29,088
Beth.
Come on, open up.

531
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:34,421
<i>I guess it doesn't matter anymore</i>

532
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:38,463
<i>Do you remember, baby</i>

533
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:41,922
<i>Last September, how you</i>

534
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:47,505
<i>Held me tight Each and every night</i>

535
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:53,090
<i>Oh baby, how you drove me crazy</i>

536
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,131
<i>But I guess it doesn't matter anymore</i>

537
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:10,007
Anyway, to hell with Dink.

538
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,924
- Fuck him.
- Fuck him!

539
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,507
I mean, when you're in love with somebody

540
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:16,465
you overlook certain things
but there would've been

541
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:19,258
a lot to overlook with Dink.

542
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:21,217
I mean, Tulip definitely earns her money.

543
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:23,883
You don't clip nose hair for money.

544
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:26,924
You clip nose hair for love.

545
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:29,216
Tulip loves him, girl.

546
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,633
- You want to hit the head?
- No, I'll wait here.

547
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:55,300
Hey, I just wanted to let you know
that this game is for retards.

548
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,969
- Really?
- Yeah, it always looks like it's just about to fall,

549
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,259
but it never does, that's the hook.

550
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:05,303
Huh. It's so well-designed.

551
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:08,427
Yeah.

552
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,427
OK.

553
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:22,095
Back on the horse?
Go Beth.

554
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:24,845
No, I was just saving him
from Flip-It.

555
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:30,262
But he was cute, right?
Sweet.

556
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:32,219
It was nice to talk to somebody
for a minute, who's not...

557
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,012
Yeah, I know.

558
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:36,096
- One of us?
- Yeah, who're you texting?

559
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:40,221
My shrink. He's got a tip
about a game tomorrow.

560
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:44,263
Hey, your boyfriend's looking over here.
The Flip-It guy.

561
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:51,097
The rooms here got Toblerone
candy in the minibar.

562
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:55,096
- Bring me back one in the morning.
- Stop it, shut up.

563
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:56,597
Bye.

564
00:34:56,597 --> 00:35:00,014
I just have to make sure

565
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,596
that you got home OK.

566
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:06,932
- Wait.
- Going down.

567
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,931
You should definitely, definitely
take me to your room right now.

568
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:18,889
Should we just talk about this for one second?

569
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:21,099
- Why?
- Well, you are a little drunk.

570
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,057
Yeah, but it just makes me more
articulate about my feelings.

571
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:26,224
And right now, I have a huge amount

572
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,517
of sexual tension built up inside of me,

573
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:33,515
and I think you're very, very
handsome and really nice, and...

574
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:35,100
Can we be done talking now?

575
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,058
Yeah.

576
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:39,100
- Wait, are you single?
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,016
Come on, Ten!

578
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:45,934
Come on, Ten! Come on, baby!
Come on! Go!

579
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:49,558
Go! Go! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

580
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:55,600
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Back to one!

581
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,976
Way to go, Dinky!

582
00:35:57,976 --> 00:36:02,059
Way to come back from Santa Anita!

583
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,267
- Yeah!
- Yes!

584
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,560
I didn't bet it.

585
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,601
What?

586
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,476
No, but you picked the ten to win.

587
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:13,143
But then I didn't bet it.

588
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:19,435
Just get back to your phones,

589
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:21,187
and stay out of my fucking bets.

590
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,936
The fucker!

591
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,102
One-point-two remaining.

592
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,603
They need to go the length of the floor.

593
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:47,979
Oh, no!
Now I'm down 172.

594
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,936
And just for the last five days, Scotty.

595
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:51,564
And nobody takes it seriously!

596
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:54,312
Where's Frankie?
We gotta make these runs!

597
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,271
He's at Celine Dion.

598
00:36:56,271 --> 00:37:00,854
On a Saturday? During the
NCAA Basketball playoffs?

599
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:02,897
That's when he's going to Celine Dion?

600
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:05,105
During the NCAA Basketball tournament?

601
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:07,023
Well, you told him last week he could go.

602
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:09,023
It's the only show he could get orchestra seats.

603
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:11,230
How many time does this guy
gotta go see Celine Dion?

604
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,938
Dink, maybe I should just make the run myself.

605
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,981
Scotty, will you shut up?
No, we need somebody here

606
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:17,481
by 11, at least, or today is a wash.

607
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:19,564
And this day was the only way I
had of making up for this week.

608
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:24,440
So, Jesus fucking Christ, God!

609
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,441
- Flagstaff Aaron.
- He's working for Dave the Rave.

610
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:30,482
- Call Holly.
- Uh...

611
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,107
I don't think it's a good idea

612
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:33,940
to send Holly out with this kind of money,

613
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,024
I think it actually may be a bad idea.
Look, Dink.

614
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:38,607
I can do the run really fast, get back here...

615
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:40,899
No, no.
These lines are changing.

616
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:44,150
I need you on the phone.
Just get Holly over here.

617
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:53,566
- This is baby oil.
- Yeah?

618
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:55,566
Why don't you use sun screen.

619
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,275
Because it screens the sun.

620
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:03,317
OK Holly, this is the $9,000
for the horses at Bally's.

621
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:06,068
- All right.
- Take this $31,000 over to the Golden Nugget

622
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,109
and call me once you get over there.

623
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,609
Gimme the line on Kentucky and
I'll tell you where to put it.

624
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:12,359
- OK.
- All right, hurry please.

625
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,859
- Unleashing a furious late kick...
- Get up.

626
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,193
...up on the outside, the tenth
lead in the shadow of The Liar.

627
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:24,527
- Mr. Jazz...
- Good?

628
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:26,360
So that's plus 80, right?

629
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,860
What line did Holly give
you on the Kentucky game?

630
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,445
She hasn't called yet.

631
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:32,278
What? What are you
talking about?

632
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:34,360
She hasn't called. I've
been trying her for an hour

633
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,236
and she's going straight to voice mail.

634
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:36,486
You haven't talked to Holly for an hour,

635
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:39,361
and you're just telling me right now?

636
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,403
Call her back, Scotty.

637
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,445
- Call her back!
- Yeah, all right.

638
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:48,111
And I hope you're precious Celine Dion

639
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:49,445
chokes on a wire coat hanger tonight.

640
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:53,321
Huh?

641
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,946
Nothing. Sorry, man.

642
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:01,320
Still voice mail.

643
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,154
Dave the Rave's at Bally's.

644
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:07,322
I've been here since, like 11.

645
00:39:09,322 --> 00:39:11,363
I ain't seen her, Dinky.

646
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:13,571
She was here.

647
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:15,280
She was watching the game.

648
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,447
She bet Toronto?!

649
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,321
Magic, is that what you just said?

650
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:22,865
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.
- I got her.

651
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:24,614
Oh, God...

652
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:28,405
Fucking asshole.
Come on, take it.

653
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:31,406
No, you didn't, no, you didn't!

654
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:32,906
You did not get robbed, Holly!

655
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,281
What you did was take $40,000 of my money,

656
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:39,282
and go and make a bet for yourself on Toronto.
That is what you did.

657
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:41,948
My shrink said it was a sure thing.

658
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:45,323
God.

659
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:49,074
Just come back to the office.

660
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:51,282
I'm never coming to the office.

661
00:39:51,282 --> 00:39:55,116
Jesus, Dink.
I should just fucking off myself, I should!

662
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:58,324
Don't do that, don't do that.
Just please,

663
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:01,450
come back to the office, Holly, and we'll
work out some kind of payment plan.

664
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:07,492
- Don't say it.
- I didn't say anything.

665
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,908
I could hear you thinkin' it.

666
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:14,408
Me? I wouldn't send Holly out with
money like that. She's just not...

667
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,409
- It's not like me or Frankie.
- Or Beth.

668
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:23,951
Yeah, you have to stay
here and watch the phones.

669
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:26,868
So, you...

670
00:40:27,868 --> 00:40:29,325
...you...

671
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:33,160
...and Celine Dion,
and Beth are all fired.

672
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,451
So get out!
Get out!

673
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:39,203
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

674
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,243
God damn it!

675
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,619
- No way.
- Tulip, please.

676
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,619
Do you think I would even ask
for something like this,

677
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:02,162
unless I really needed it desperately?

678
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:05,120
And what do I get?

679
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:10,163
Whatever you want.

680
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:23,164
OK, I'll get Otis,

681
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:25,871
and everything else goes in a laundry bag.
I'll be right back.

682
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,954
And you can really do this?
Just pick up and leave town?

683
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:31,122
Yes. That's what's so great about
living in a motel and getting fired.

684
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,080
If I didn't do this I'd be crazy.

685
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,122
I can hear the logic rattling
around in there somewhere.

686
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:39,248
Uh-huh. Your trip back is going to be
a lot more fun then your trip out.

687
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:41,413
Of that, I am completely assured.

688
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:08,082
Hi. What are you doing?

689
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:09,582
I was about to check out.

690
00:42:09,582 --> 00:42:12,583
Good. This place is a dump.

691
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:17,125
- Where are you moving to?
- New York City.

692
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,625
When'd you decide that?

693
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,626
About two hours ago.

694
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,918
I need you back.

695
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,167
- You were really mean to me.
- I know, I know.

696
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,126
I'm sorry, it couldn't be helped.

697
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:41,418
But the way we were,
it just... wasn't going right.

698
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:46,960
We had to snap out of it,
but I need you back. Now.

699
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,543
And what about Tulip.

700
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:50,627
We worked it out.

701
00:42:50,627 --> 00:42:56,127
We came to terms that we could agree upon.

702
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,461
Unromantic terms.

703
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,003
For me and you, yeah.

704
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:06,461
So, why do you want me back?

705
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,337
How could you even ask that?

706
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,379
Beth, you are terrific with numbers.

707
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,086
You're great on the phone.
People love talking to you.

708
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:17,296
You keep your cool.
I trust you.

709
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:20,295
And you bring me good luck.

710
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:24,004
Beth, you are crucial to Dink, Inc.

711
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:26,295
Isn't that enough?

712
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:40,422
- Hi...
- Is that a loan shark?

713
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:43,089
'Cause you could use me as a human shield,
but I'm not sure I could take him.

714
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:45,963
No...
He's not a loan shark.

715
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:48,297
I know.

716
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:50,588
Pretty sure that's the famous Dink.

717
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:52,630
Yeah.

718
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,340
Not exactly what I was picturing.

719
00:43:57,339 --> 00:43:59,172
So, where's Otis?

720
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,132
Take this.
Put it on shuffle.

721
00:44:07,132 --> 00:44:09,966
I thought you were over it.

722
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:13,632
I'm over him, but not over it.

723
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:15,423
I kind of thought it was the same thing.

724
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:19,299
Yeah, I did too. But I just
found out that it's not.

725
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:22,466
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

726
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:26,175
Well...

727
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:30,133
- Call me sometime?
- I will.

728
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:35,300
I, I will.

729
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,175
Adios, muchacha.

730
00:44:45,175 --> 00:44:47,177
- Is she mad at me?
- No.

731
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:49,260
Not allowed to be.

732
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,010
What do you mean, that was part of the deal

733
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,135
for me coming back to work?
She can't be mad at me?

734
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:54,969
Yeah, sort of.

735
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:56,301
So, what does she get in the deal?

736
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:59,135
Jesus, how do you know these things?

737
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:01,384
Shopping spree?

738
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:04,220
I wish. Face lift.

739
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,302
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

740
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:09,470
I must really mean a lot to you.

741
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:15,052
I missed you.

742
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,970
Say you missed me, too.

743
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,011
I missed you, too.

744
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,969
We're friends, right?

745
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,595
Whatever.

746
00:45:29,595 --> 00:45:34,512
I got to stop by and drop off
Jyrki's hamster food at the house.

747
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:48,971
Go upstairs and say hi.

748
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:51,472
It's important.

749
00:45:54,471 --> 00:45:56,139
- OK.
- Be nice.

750
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,471
Yeah.

751
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,308
Do not fuck my husband.

752
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,059
OK.

753
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,391
He says you're good luck.

754
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:58,351
He told me he doesn't
really think you're a jinx.

755
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:08,351
The bag of frozen peas in the cooler.

756
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:11,353
Stick it on my face.

757
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:21,144
Sorry.

758
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:36,103
Bethy!

759
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,103
- Did you miss me, sweet stuff?
- Yes.

760
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:40,979
Hey, kid. Welcome
back, welcome back.

761
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:47,645
Five dimes on Miss Israel
and she can't make the top 10?

762
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:51,145
It's so good that you're back,
because things have just not been...

763
00:47:51,145 --> 00:47:52,437
...good.

764
00:47:56,438 --> 00:48:00,355
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing here?

765
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:03,147
Uh... I live here.

766
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:05,397
That's what the fuck I'm doing here.

767
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:07,981
- Where should I be?
- I don't know.

768
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,147
Taking your clothes off somewhere
until you pay Dink back?

769
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:12,982
Dink and I will work it out.

770
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:18,607
What? So you're just cool with
stealing his money from him?

771
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,023
And you're just cool trying
to steal him from Tulip?

772
00:48:24,023 --> 00:48:27,274
Hey, that's not the same thing.

773
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:29,274
Oh, you got that right.

774
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:34,899
Come on, Beth.
It's all good.

775
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:38,899
We all got away from some kind
of fucking bullshit some place.

776
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:41,234
And we all came here because
this is where you get a break.

777
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:46,149
But sometimes, you got to give one, too.

778
00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:48,149
Take a penny, leave a penny.
Know what I mean?

779
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:53,108
I mean, you want to hold
people to a higher standard?

780
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:55,066
I'd first take a look in the mirror.

781
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:59,983
Next thing I'd do is move some place else.

782
00:48:59,983 --> 00:49:02,317
You stay here?

783
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:05,276
You're one of us.

784
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,651
Have a great day, honey.

785
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,317
I spent the whole day,
the whole day with a 103 fever!

786
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:21,276
Now, then KC, I gotta lose on a fumble?
Are you kidding me?

787
00:49:21,276 --> 00:49:24,985
Are you kidding me right now?!

788
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:27,153
Sunday! All day Sunday.

789
00:49:27,153 --> 00:49:30,152
Sunday night I wanted to
kill myself, I swear to God.

790
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:32,319
And then I gotta take this game.

791
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,528
We are officially on damage
control conditions right now...

792
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:37,486
- I, I...
- You what?!

793
00:49:37,486 --> 00:49:39,945
You what? You what? You were
supposed to bring me luck.

794
00:49:39,945 --> 00:49:41,487
- Me?
- That's what you were supposed to bring back.

795
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:43,404
Like the cat that came back, but you didn't.

796
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:45,611
- You just brought me bad luck.
- Come on, it was one bet.

797
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:47,361
Just one bet?
Oh, is that what it was?

798
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:49,237
- Yeah, it was just one bet!
- What do you know about gaming?

799
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:50,653
Do you think you understand how this works?

800
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:53,654
How my business works?
You don't. Get out!

801
00:49:53,654 --> 00:49:57,405
Just get out! Get, get out!

802
00:49:57,405 --> 00:50:00,238
Help her out. You, too. Get out!
You, too. Scott!

803
00:50:00,238 --> 00:50:03,195
Get out! Get out! Hurry up!
Get your fucking bag!

804
00:50:03,195 --> 00:50:07,655
Get out! Get out! Scott, go!
Please! Get out!

805
00:50:07,655 --> 00:50:10,488
My God, what was that?

806
00:50:10,488 --> 00:50:12,363
He's been firing everybody every couple of days.

807
00:50:12,363 --> 00:50:14,655
- Only lasts an hour or two.
- Why is he being like this?

808
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,405
- It's like he's not Dink.
- That is Dink. That is Dink losing.

809
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:21,030
Bad, like he'd be heading towards broke if
he doesn't pull out of this debt spiral.

810
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,572
Well, what do we do?
How do we help him?

811
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:24,322
There's nothing we can do for him.

812
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,114
What do you mean? What are we
going to do if he goes broke?

813
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:27,657
Go and work for somebody else.
Take it easy, Beth.

814
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,406
- Take it easy?
- This happens at some point

815
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:31,405
and lots of points to everybody.
You should know that by now.

816
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:34,114
- This is gambling.
- Call this gambling for a reason.

817
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,032
Yeah, I just...
I didn't think...

818
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,990
Didn't think what?
That it'd happen to Dink?

819
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,156
Yeah, it happens to the good guys, too.
Maybe more, even.

820
00:50:40,156 --> 00:50:42,240
- If anything, you come back.
- Hell yeah.

821
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,032
And that's the best feeling in the world, man.

822
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:45,490
- Let's grab a date shake.
- All right.

823
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:46,949
You're buying, you cheap bastard.

824
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:05,284
You were supposed to bring it back.

825
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:10,158
Bring what back?
Your luck?

826
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,909
I can't do that.
It's not my responsibility.

827
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,492
So, you're just going to leave
me now that I'm falling apart?

828
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:27,411
Well, I can't stay here when
you're like this. It's too...

829
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:30,535
...depressing.

830
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:33,493
You are a very selfish person.

831
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:36,078
What?

832
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:40,243
Hey, what do you want me to do?

833
00:51:40,243 --> 00:51:44,077
What do you want me to do?

834
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:47,660
Take it. I accept
your resignation.

835
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:52,536
It's been nice knowing you.
Bye, Beth.

836
00:51:52,536 --> 00:51:55,495
Hey Dink, you sure you want to
be giving away money right now?

837
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,995
Just get out.

838
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:03,536
If you want to quit,
that's fine. OK?

839
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:08,246
Just don't go do one of your
stupid hustles for money.

840
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:12,287
- Mm-hm.
- Just go do something.

841
00:52:12,287 --> 00:52:14,913
Are you done?

842
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:25,914
Cashing them all in, yeah?

843
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:44,664
Well, hello.

844
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,664
Um, hi.

845
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,999
It's Beth. From Las Vegas.

846
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:54,498
Yeah, I know who Beth is.

847
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:57,499
If I came to New York...

848
00:52:58,499 --> 00:53:00,499
...would you hang out with me?

849
00:53:11,499 --> 00:53:14,625
I mean, there are people
with MBAs waiting tables

850
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,666
at the Olive Garden. What is
someone going to hire me to do?

851
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:20,291
How did you finagle getting your job?

852
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:22,459
Well, it wasn't exactly
a finagling kind of thing.

853
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:24,375
Well then, what was it?

854
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,917
It's what I've always done.
I went to journalism school,

855
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:28,417
I interned and I got a job.

856
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,959
- Ugh.
- What ugh?

857
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:33,375
I don't understand why
that sounds so crazy to you.

858
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:36,502
It's not crazy. I just
wish that I had a path,

859
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:39,543
like you do, you know?
You're lucky.

860
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:42,501
Look, you just got out of a shitty situation.

861
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:44,377
- You got fired...
- I didn't get fired.

862
00:53:44,377 --> 00:53:48,919
- You quit.
- I don't know what happened.

863
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:51,461
I gotta say,

864
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:54,626
I don't want to be around
him if he can be like that.

865
00:53:55,627 --> 00:53:59,211
I don't want to see him like that.

866
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:07,003
Gamblers.

867
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:09,170
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

868
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,629
For bitching and moaning.
I'll find something to do.

869
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,962
Six months ago, all I wanted to
do was be a cocktail waitress.

870
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,337
And now you want something more.
That's a good thing, right?

871
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:20,919
Yes, definitely.

872
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:26,046
You're so...
great, Jeremy.

873
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:27,587
Let's just focus on you and me...

874
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:32,922
...having a
really good time.

875
00:54:32,922 --> 00:54:35,296
I fucking love that plan.

876
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:48,673
Up top!

877
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:54,382
- Yes!
- Good shot!

878
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,422
Hey, good game, man.

879
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:01,299
You're like Spud Webb out there.

880
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:03,256
- You play ball?
- Uh-huh.

881
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:05,673
Junior college, I had a
scholarship but I lost it.

882
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:06,550
You play for St. John's?

883
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:12,215
Yep, class of '87.
They're playing tonight.

884
00:55:12,215 --> 00:55:15,050
Man, I'd lay some big money on that
game if I could find that action.

885
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,216
- They are a lock.
- Really? You like to bet?

886
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:21,634
On anything that moves.

887
00:55:24,632 --> 00:55:28,300
Hi, I'm Beth.

888
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,509
Dave Greenberg.

889
00:55:30,509 --> 00:55:33,051
Beth.

890
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,968
I am not religious,
and I don't want to speculate

891
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:52,219
on what kind of chosen person I am,

892
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:54,427
or what kind of power center is inside of me.

893
00:55:54,427 --> 00:55:58,677
But the truth is the truth,
I needed you and you came.

894
00:55:58,677 --> 00:56:01,635
- OK...
- This is temporary right here.

895
00:56:01,635 --> 00:56:03,594
I have a much more permanent,

896
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,927
more epic situation that is in the works.

897
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:08,635
But I'm not at liberty to discuss it right now.

898
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,177
So, for God's sakes, do not ask me about it.

899
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:15,595
So, now, Beth. How do you
suggest I re-imagine my vortex

900
00:56:15,595 --> 00:56:17,678
in a way that indispensably, includes you.

901
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:20,220
Well, I'm good on the phone

902
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,179
and I like going on pay and collects...

903
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:26,012
Hey. Yo, Gids.

904
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:29,554
Why not? I'll give you
six points. Later, fool.

905
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:32,263
Pay and collect, some phone, I like it.

906
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,679
I like where this is going.
Yes. How's 40 an hour to start?

907
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:38,305
Oh, great. Didn't you
just make a bet?

908
00:56:38,305 --> 00:56:40,680
- Yes.
- So, aren't you going to write it down?

909
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,929
Oh.

910
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:45,389
I can see there's something
that you're thinking,

911
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:47,638
- but you're not saying.
- Yeah.

912
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,680
Well, there's this guy I know,

913
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,222
and he likes to bet like crazy
and he can't find any action,

914
00:56:53,222 --> 00:56:55,347
and he has friends that want to get down, too.
And I thought, maybe,

915
00:56:55,347 --> 00:56:59,681
I could put them onto you? And, um,
they seem ready to bet, like, a, a lot.

916
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:03,597
- Fun, great. You agent it.
- Me, really?

917
00:57:03,597 --> 00:57:05,222
This'll be a nice thing on the side for you.

918
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,931
Whatever he loses, I'll give you 25 percent,

919
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:08,432
but these guys are your responsibility.

920
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:11,182
Oh, my God, this is great.

921
00:57:11,182 --> 00:57:14,472
Beth, dude. Your initiative,
it is impressive.

922
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,348
- Yes.
- You started working for me,

923
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:18,974
before you started working for me.
That is unprecedented.

924
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:21,014
You're like a hungry woman lying on the prowl,

925
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:23,307
but you listen to things,
and you smell everything.

926
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:25,015
Look at this line here on Boston.

927
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:27,182
I'm going to salvage this, right now.

928
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:30,308
Rosie, 651.

929
00:57:30,308 --> 00:57:33,309
Take me 200k Boston...

930
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:37,684
...Rosie, 651.
Right motherfucking now!

931
00:57:37,684 --> 00:57:40,267
Thank you. Bang!

932
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:42,516
So, anyway... What?

933
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:44,392
Well, you just made a bet for $200,000
in the middle of our conversation.

934
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:49,059
- And is there a problem?
- No, but you do not bet like Dink.

935
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:50,976
Listen, I mean no disrespect.

936
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:53,684
Dink is a famous classic.
He is a hero of mine.

937
00:57:53,684 --> 00:57:57,351
He is the '57 Chevy of gambling.

938
00:57:57,351 --> 00:58:00,685
But, all modesty aside, I am the Ferrari.

939
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,060
Or if Ferrari made a super fast tank

940
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:07,059
with laser blasters sticking out.
I would be that of gambling!

941
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:08,520
We are done for today.

942
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,352
This should be in the vicinity of $6,000.

943
00:58:12,352 --> 00:58:15,519
Assigning bonus, some clothes, some food.

944
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:17,685
I don't want you with the stress.

945
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:21,020
And it's so exciting. Do you have
any idea how big Rosie's bets are?

946
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,978
It's New York, where gambling is illegal,

947
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:25,937
and bookmaking is a felony.

948
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:28,144
You know, because of you
I'm finally good at something.

949
00:58:28,144 --> 00:58:31,187
but I can't do it in Las Vegas
because you banned me.

950
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:35,519
Rosie is taking action across state
lines, which of course he is doing,

951
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,021
then you are opening yourself up to a
conspiracy and that's a slam dunk for Rico

952
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:43,062
Does that sound familiar? Does
that sound like anybody you know?

953
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:46,646
- You're jealous of Rosie.
- Beth! When you go to jail

954
00:58:46,646 --> 00:58:48,688
it will not be my fault. OK?

955
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:52,021
You sound like your mother.

956
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,979
- Goodbye.
- Oh, come on!

957
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,063
Hi, Dave.

958
00:59:06,063 --> 00:59:08,105
So, how about that Philly game last night?

959
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:10,273
You must be happy to see me, huh?

960
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:13,272
- What?
- Thanks a lot.

961
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:19,981
What?

962
00:59:30,982 --> 00:59:34,399
What? Dave you're actually making
us look kind of suspicious.

963
00:59:34,399 --> 00:59:36,357
Well, excuse me, Miss Mata Hari, for not wanting

964
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:39,525
to receive illegal cash in front of cops.

965
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:41,191
My car's over here.
Come on.

966
00:59:41,191 --> 00:59:44,691
Dave Greenberg's a prick.

967
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:47,233
And he never loses.

968
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:48,984
I like it when they keep winning.

969
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:50,984
That means when they lose, they lose huge.

970
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:53,400
Rosie, do you ever worry about

971
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,441
getting caught by the police or the FBI?

972
00:59:56,441 --> 00:59:58,566
Eh, never happens.
We're too cautious.

973
00:59:58,566 --> 01:00:01,067
- You're not cautious.
- Well, we're semi-cautious.

974
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:04,401
No, you're not. Rosie, you play
Guitar Hero with the delivery guys

975
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,193
while you take bets on the phone.

976
01:00:06,193 --> 01:00:08,568
You left our "who owes who what" cheats

977
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:10,027
in the booth at the Sizzler.

978
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:12,193
Everybody knows you're a bookie.

979
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:15,527
I do not like having these
kinds of conversations.

980
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:17,985
And Beth, I think you know that.

981
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:21,693
And besides, as far as
what is legal or not legal,

982
01:00:21,693 --> 01:00:23,693
it's about to become a moot point,
but I will not talk about that.

983
01:00:23,693 --> 01:00:25,319
Because that, that is a secret!

984
01:00:29,319 --> 01:00:30,235
Tell me...

985
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:33,944
OK, the Curacao thing is getting very real.

986
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:35,485
My license, it just came through down there.

987
01:00:35,485 --> 01:00:37,652
I have an investor that may cover the setup.

988
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:43,028
My sports book shall be called, ASAP!

989
01:00:43,028 --> 01:00:46,277
All Serious Action Players!
Completely legal.

990
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:48,487
- Oh, that's incredible.
- Look at the eight horse.

991
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:51,029
Where the heck did she come from?
She's going to mess up my Perfecta.

992
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:53,653
Curacao, that's a beautiful
island in the Caribbean, right?

993
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:56,447
- Beautiful, legit island.
- Oh... Oh, God.

994
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,154
- Come on...
- You got it...

995
01:01:01,154 --> 01:01:02,947
- You got it, you got it...
- Yes!

996
01:01:02,947 --> 01:01:04,404
- There it goes!
- Yes! Yes!

997
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:06,321
Oh, yes!

998
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:13,530
- Yes! Yes!
- How did you do that?

999
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,697
How'd you pick the eight horse to win?
She looked like absolute shit to me.

1000
01:01:15,697 --> 01:01:18,197
That was like so surreal and
yesterday it was Cleveland.

1001
01:01:18,197 --> 01:01:21,989
- You're back. You are back.
- Two weeks ago, she looked like a mess.

1002
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:24,322
But I thought she was starting to get
her head around the whole thing.

1003
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:30,072
Ruby Lane, Ruby Lane.
Ruby Lane...

1004
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:32,074
What does Dink think?

1005
01:01:32,074 --> 01:01:36,365
Well, I'm not really talking to Dink right now.

1006
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:40,032
Beth, you made a lot of money
in the last couple of months.

1007
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:43,032
- Why don't you just stay here with me?
- And do what?

1008
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,199
Continue to have the completely fantastic
time we've been having together.

1009
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:50,658
Look, Jeremy, I don't think you realize what
a huge deal this Curacao thing is for me.

1010
01:01:50,658 --> 01:01:55,241
I mean, I'm going to actually
be in charge of something.

1011
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:57,033
Something that's going to
take you someplace else.

1012
01:01:57,033 --> 01:02:00,949
Yeah, but I'll come back.
I'll miss you.

1013
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:05,200
- So, what about...
- Otis. I know.

1014
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,658
I have to find somewhere for him to stay.

1015
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:10,034
I'll take care of Otis. I don't
want him to stay with strangers.

1016
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:11,576
- Really?
- Yeah.

1017
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:14,201
Oh, my God, that would be great.
He loves you.

1018
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:16,034
- You know that, right?
- And I love him.

1019
01:02:16,034 --> 01:02:21,576
Aww...
Otis, you lucky dog.

1020
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:25,326
Now my only problem is finding
someone to do my pay and collects.

1021
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:28,660
Hey. You could do that too.

1022
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,618
- Me?
- Yeah.

1023
01:02:30,618 --> 01:02:33,245
You can keep my cut and
feed Otis, and we're even.

1024
01:02:33,245 --> 01:02:35,370
It's easy money.

1025
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,702
I'll talk you through the whole thing.

1026
01:02:43,703 --> 01:02:45,453
Hi, Dave.

1027
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:48,412
This is Jeremy...

1028
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:58,037
Bye.

1029
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:02,203
So, what's your number?

1030
01:03:02,203 --> 01:03:04,204
I'm gonna have a plain burger.

1031
01:03:04,204 --> 01:03:06,454
No bun, no sauce, no nothing on it.

1032
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:07,996
I know.

1033
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,537
It had some barbecue sauce on it last time,

1034
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,538
and I really don't want
to go through that again.

1035
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:15,704
So, a very plain burger and
nothing else, and a regular Coke.

1036
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:18,038
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1037
01:03:18,038 --> 01:03:20,538
- Stomach?
- Oh, yeah.

1038
01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:23,705
Why? What's on your mind?
You're doing so good.

1039
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:27,247
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a
little worried about Beth.

1040
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:29,414
Dink.

1041
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:31,706
She's working for that maniac Rosie in New York.

1042
01:03:31,706 --> 01:03:35,997
I blew up at her and now
she's not calling me back.

1043
01:03:35,997 --> 01:03:37,997
Look, I wasn't going to say
anything, but do you notice

1044
01:03:37,997 --> 01:03:41,207
when Beth is around, you
were doing a lot of losing.

1045
01:03:41,207 --> 01:03:44,539
And now that she's gone,
you're doing really good.

1046
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:47,415
Hey, if anyone's the jinx, it's Beth.

1047
01:03:47,415 --> 01:03:49,416
But I owe her.

1048
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:51,249
Owe her for what?

1049
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:53,623
I owe her for messing everything up.

1050
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:57,541
I usually just think about how
much money I could've made

1051
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,415
if I'd just focused a little
bit more when I was younger.

1052
01:04:00,415 --> 01:04:02,624
And I usually give myself a hard time about it.

1053
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:07,083
But now, I'm looking at all the
things I've got to do instead.

1054
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,374
I got to be with you.

1055
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:12,333
And it's not like I don't appreciate you

1056
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:14,708
on a daily basis, because I do.

1057
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,542
But for the first time, since our wedding,

1058
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:21,042
I look at my situation, and I'm looking
at it from an oddsmaker's perspective.

1059
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:24,709
And I am a really lucky guy.

1060
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:31,293
And to be honest, a big part
of that is because of Beth.

1061
01:04:31,293 --> 01:04:34,209
Hey, how you doin'?

1062
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:36,376
I wanted to say hi.

1063
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:38,710
And tell you that, um, I hope you don't think

1064
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,585
that we're in some kind of fight,
because I don't think that.

1065
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:43,210
And, just wanted to call...

1066
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,710
...and see
how you're doing.

1067
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,418
Um, give me a shout if you have a minute.

1068
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:51,668
And I also wanted you to know that I'm not mad

1069
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:54,127
that you're working for Rosie in New York.

1070
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:56,295
So, that's about it.

1071
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:58,211
Call me, I'm at the office,

1072
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:02,294
and hope you're OK and having fun.

1073
01:05:02,294 --> 01:05:04,546
OK, bye.

1074
01:05:08,545 --> 01:05:10,378
Hello, ASAP?

1075
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:13,420
- Hello, sport?
- Hello, ASAP?

1076
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:17,379
Can you turn the music off!

1077
01:05:17,379 --> 01:05:20,212
Hey, there are phones ringing
and you're playing video games

1078
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:22,254
and... what? Doing coke?!

1079
01:05:22,254 --> 01:05:24,421
Oh, my God, what are they doing here?

1080
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,672
All the plumbing at their place is backing up.

1081
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,213
What, so you just move them out
of the brothel and into here?

1082
01:05:29,213 --> 01:05:31,004
If you think about it for two seconds, Beth,

1083
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:34,130
you'll see this saves time
and money for everybody.

1084
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,963
Hey! Where've
you been for four days?

1085
01:05:36,964 --> 01:05:40,380
Bethy, I have been in love.
What is wrong with me?

1086
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,256
Why is it that all of my dreams come true?

1087
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:45,089
Look at this line here on Cleveland.

1088
01:05:45,089 --> 01:05:47,381
This is terrible.
Who made this line?

1089
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:50,382
Bob made it. Look, Rosie,
when you disappear,

1090
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:53,255
these fucking assholes you brought
down here just make shitty lines,

1091
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:57,214
do coke, have sex with 17 year
olds, and steal from you.

1092
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:59,382
Easy. Beth,
these are my friends.

1093
01:05:59,382 --> 01:06:01,590
Rosie, this was your big move.

1094
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,132
The only important thing you've
ever done in your whole life,

1095
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:07,133
and you're letting it fucking disintegrate!
What is wrong with you?!

1096
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:10,049
Beth, you are the gum that
holds this all together.

1097
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,466
You put up with a lot, and you
deserve respect for that.

1098
01:06:13,466 --> 01:06:16,965
I'm giving a raise to $5,000
a week, effective last week.

1099
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:19,091
But just do not tell anybody.

1100
01:06:21,092 --> 01:06:23,217
All right, check on Motown!

1101
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:27,551
Check on the Cuban! Somebody
call HBC and give 20 dimes to...

1102
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:29,008
Fuck! We're getting
buried on this game!

1103
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:34,301
Hello?

1104
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:36,426
Did you know that Otis runs in his sleep?

1105
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:39,717
Yes.

1106
01:06:39,717 --> 01:06:45,302
Jeremy, how are you?
I miss you.

1107
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,342
- You miss me?
- Of course I do.

1108
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:52,468
Could you tell me something normal?

1109
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:54,052
Sure, like what?

1110
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:57,052
I don't know, about
your day? Anything?

1111
01:06:57,052 --> 01:06:59,511
Have you checked Greenberg's bets lately?

1112
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:01,636
No.

1113
01:07:01,636 --> 01:07:03,719
He and his friends are losing finally.

1114
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,470
And big time, like 75 grand worth.

1115
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:08,469
Really? That's nice.

1116
01:07:08,469 --> 01:07:12,262
I can't get any of those
guys on the phone, though.

1117
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:15,011
You're their only action,
and they're idiot addicts.

1118
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:16,636
They'll call.

1119
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,595
I gotta go.

1120
01:07:23,595 --> 01:07:26,471
Rosie's friends are destroying the place.

1121
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:30,679
Don't worry about Greenberg.

1122
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:36,012
146, 152, 155 total.

1123
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:44,097
...Minus 13. No, leave it
just at 7 and a half flat.

1124
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:50,306
Rosie, can you turn it down?!

1125
01:07:50,306 --> 01:07:54,556
I can't Beth. This song
is the rhythm of victory!

1126
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:58,098
Don't let the rhythm not get you and move!

1127
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:17,266
Beth, Dave Greenberg here.
We got a problem.

1128
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:20,349
I, uh... got into some trouble
a couple of years ago.

1129
01:08:20,349 --> 01:08:23,641
It's a long story, but my
parole officer called me in.

1130
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:28,100
And he wants to know about you
and who's running your office.

1131
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,599
Now, don't worry I didn't give you up,

1132
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:33,016
but this is a fucking mess.

1133
01:08:33,016 --> 01:08:34,725
He's got all the numbers from my phone,

1134
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:35,726
including yours and Jeremy's.

1135
01:08:35,726 --> 01:08:40,058
So, if he calls...
just play dumb.

1136
01:08:40,058 --> 01:08:42,559
But whatever you do, don't call me.

1137
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:45,726
I'll call you.

1138
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:49,226
It's not a big deal. The
Seattle game's about to start.

1139
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:51,143
Why don't you go upstairs?

1140
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:52,684
It's...

1141
01:08:56,685 --> 01:08:59,518
My life is over, even if I don't go to jail.

1142
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:01,060
If I get arrested on a felony charge,

1143
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,018
I am done forever as a journalist.

1144
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,435
I'm 98 percent sure that
Dave Greenberg is lying.

1145
01:09:05,435 --> 01:09:07,602
He just doesn't want to pay, or he can't pay.

1146
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,727
If Dave Greenberg has a parole
officer, it does seem plausible

1147
01:09:10,727 --> 01:09:13,561
that he would want to know who Dave's
bookie is, and that Dave would tell him.

1148
01:09:13,561 --> 01:09:17,561
Look! I'm going to...

1149
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:19,977
I'm going to call Dink.

1150
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:21,603
Wait, what? You're
going to call Dink?

1151
01:09:21,603 --> 01:09:23,561
You said you haven't been talking to him.

1152
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:28,061
I haven't.
But I'll just... call him.

1153
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:29,521
- I'll call you back.
- No, no! No.

1154
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:32,062
Do not call me back.
I am at a payphone.

1155
01:09:32,062 --> 01:09:33,687
Do not call my phone from Curacao,

1156
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:36,312
the gambling mecca of the Caribbean!

1157
01:09:36,312 --> 01:09:39,604
No, no. It's not,
not a big deal.

1158
01:09:39,604 --> 01:09:41,353
That's just Rosie saying that,

1159
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:43,061
so you'll forget about it and go back to work.

1160
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:46,230
Look, I'm sorry that I abandoned you.

1161
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,646
Now will you please calm down and talk to me...

1162
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:51,398
I appreciate your apology.

1163
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:54,730
But I want you to know this is
a very serious situation, OK?

1164
01:09:54,730 --> 01:10:00,397
You had a felon, paroled, the FBI...

1165
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:03,397
I've seen go down just like this in the past,

1166
01:10:03,397 --> 01:10:06,690
and I'm not just talking
about my circumstances, OK?

1167
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:09,647
This is a very big problem.

1168
01:10:09,647 --> 01:10:12,231
How is it down there?

1169
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:14,981
What, what the heck's going on?

1170
01:10:14,981 --> 01:10:17,732
I'm earning $5,000 a week.

1171
01:10:17,732 --> 01:10:19,649
Beth, you never cared about money.

1172
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:22,398
I thought you went down there
because it's paradise?

1173
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:24,982
Is it paradise?

1174
01:10:24,982 --> 01:10:28,399
- No.
- Don't cry.

1175
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:30,982
Don't cry, just...

1176
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:34,066
Listen to me, Beth. You are the
book in this New York thing.

1177
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:36,233
You have got to take care of your people.

1178
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:39,608
Your decisions are no longer
just about you anymore.

1179
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:43,649
- You have to handle this.
- But I don't know how to handle it.

1180
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:47,692
Yes you do, or you will.

1181
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:52,651
Hold on one second.

1182
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:57,233
Hey Beth?

1183
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,651
Look, it's Dink's mom's birthday on Thursday.

1184
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:04,108
She was going to come out to Vegas, but she...
she hates flying.

1185
01:11:04,108 --> 01:11:06,066
So, if we come out to New York, she doesn't

1186
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:08,443
have to come out here for her birthday, which...

1187
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:10,568
- ...she'd love, right honey?
- Yeah.

1188
01:11:10,568 --> 01:11:13,484
We could meet you there.

1189
01:11:15,485 --> 01:11:18,236
You'd... You'd help me?

1190
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,361
Yes, we'll help you help Jeremy.

1191
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:33,194
Hey, you know when you don't need
to be taken care of anymore?

1192
01:11:33,194 --> 01:11:36,652
It's when you decide to start
taking care of someone else.

1193
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:44,363
You still there Beth?

1194
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:50,069
Beth, you're being crazy.

1195
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:53,071
It's $75,000 this idiot Greenberg owes me.

1196
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:56,280
Who cares? I need you here.
I forgive you the Greenberg.

1197
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,363
A clean slate, you owe me nothing.

1198
01:11:58,363 --> 01:12:00,489
- But you have to stay.
- It's not about the money.

1199
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:03,279
Well, what's it about?
Jeremy the non-boyfriend?

1200
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:06,571
Jeremy may be in huge trouble because of me.

1201
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:09,571
He chose to do something not completely
legal in the state of New York.

1202
01:12:09,571 --> 01:12:11,489
You didn't force him to do that!

1203
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:14,030
Yeah, well he did it for me!

1204
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:18,157
Come on, Beth! People do
things for themselves.

1205
01:12:18,157 --> 01:12:22,073
Yeah, what about saints?
And famously selfless people?

1206
01:12:22,073 --> 01:12:23,614
They do things so people
think that they're saints

1207
01:12:23,614 --> 01:12:26,573
or selfless people. People who
do things for themselves,

1208
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:28,657
being nice, that's just another racket!

1209
01:12:28,657 --> 01:12:32,656
Now, listen to me, Beth. I forgive the $75,000.
As long as you stay.

1210
01:12:32,656 --> 01:12:35,989
- What does that mean?
- It means if you stay,

1211
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:39,074
you're Beth. My Beth.

1212
01:12:39,074 --> 01:12:41,282
And all is forgiven.

1213
01:12:41,282 --> 01:12:46,367
But if you leave, well, then you're just another

1214
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:49,741
New York agent on the hook
for her losers losses.

1215
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:53,492
Fuck you, Rosie!

1216
01:12:53,492 --> 01:12:56,283
No, actually, Beth.
Fuck you!

1217
01:12:56,283 --> 01:12:58,575
All of your pay is in the ASAP account.

1218
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,075
Which means, I have it!

1219
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:03,659
It's like, what is it?
Is it $60,000, give or take?

1220
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:05,742
So you're just going to steal my money from me?

1221
01:13:05,742 --> 01:13:09,201
Of course not. I'm
going to hold on to it

1222
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:12,326
as collateral, for your loser's losses.

1223
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:15,451
You wanna go to New York?
Fine.

1224
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:17,492
Give me my Greenberg money!

1225
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:19,701
Then you get your Beth money!

1226
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:21,701
You know, I am going to deal with it.

1227
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,244
And then I'm going to come back to you,

1228
01:13:23,244 --> 01:13:25,493
and then I am going to...

1229
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:29,743
...stab you in the groin
artery with a steak knife

1230
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:34,744
and watch TV while you bleed out,
you fucking horrible person!

1231
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,619
- Come on, let's go.
- Whoa, Beth! I think everyone is saying things here

1232
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:39,286
that they don't mean!
Except for me!

1233
01:13:39,286 --> 01:13:43,244
Beth, you are being very selfish!

1234
01:13:45,245 --> 01:13:48,036
- Safe flight, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1235
01:13:50,037 --> 01:13:53,079
- Watch your step.
- Got it, honey.

1236
01:13:56,371 --> 01:13:58,579
- Hey.
- We're on the red-eye.

1237
01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:00,580
Does she know where the guy lives?

1238
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:03,620
Do you know where Dave Greenberg lives?

1239
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,037
I don't know, but he has to watch New
Jersey games at his cousin's bar.

1240
01:14:08,037 --> 01:14:11,705
They play tomorrow night.
He'll be there.

1241
01:14:11,705 --> 01:14:15,413
We'll see you at the airport, Beth.

1242
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:17,205
All right.

1243
01:14:28,205 --> 01:14:30,122
- Hey.
- Hey.

1244
01:14:30,122 --> 01:14:31,748
- Hi.
- Bethy.

1245
01:14:31,748 --> 01:14:32,747
Hey.

1246
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:55,000
There's 8,000 David Greenbergs in Long Island.

1247
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,707
That's the name he's listed
under, if he's listed at all.

1248
01:14:57,707 --> 01:15:01,500
Why? Why would you
put all your money

1249
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,208
into an account that Rosie controls?

1250
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,999
No shit, why?

1251
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:07,124
Well, because it was
earning 11 percent interest.

1252
01:15:07,124 --> 01:15:09,334
Wow. Well,
that's a good reason.

1253
01:15:09,334 --> 01:15:11,624
- You must be Dink.
- Yeah. Jeremy, have a seat.

1254
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:13,749
He's cute.

1255
01:15:13,749 --> 01:15:16,750
I'm sure you have a lot on
your mind right now, but...

1256
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:20,042
- ...try not to worry.
- Why are you doing this?

1257
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:22,000
We're just here visiting family.

1258
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,251
You already got a felony conviction,

1259
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:26,043
if this thing doesn't go down
nicely and you're anywhere near by,

1260
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,417
you're going to go to prison for
a lot longer than we would.

1261
01:15:28,418 --> 01:15:31,084
Well, then let's just stop.
Let's just give up, right now.

1262
01:15:31,084 --> 01:15:32,335
Anyway, we can't even find Dave Greenberg...

1263
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:34,418
I know Greenberg is.

1264
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:36,585
- What?
- You do? Let me see, let me see.

1265
01:15:36,585 --> 01:15:40,001
Massa-fucking-pequa?
How did you...

1266
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:42,001
I have access to a government website at work,

1267
01:15:42,001 --> 01:15:44,085
and I can get in a lot of
trouble for showing you this,

1268
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:47,127
but that's Greenberg. It's everything.
It's his home address,

1269
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:50,336
property records, employment records,
phone numbers, family, everything.

1270
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:52,544
I can never lay a hand on this douche, because
of my personal relationship with God,

1271
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:54,503
but I know two guys about four stops from here

1272
01:15:54,503 --> 01:15:56,545
who'll come and threaten to
saw his feet off for $900.

1273
01:15:56,587 --> 01:15:58,587
- Yes.
- If you're seriously considering doing something

1274
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,420
like that, I'm going to take the file and leave.

1275
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,587
- Why, is he some kind of cop?
- No, he's a reporter.

1276
01:16:02,587 --> 01:16:05,212
Greenberg has a felony conviction.

1277
01:16:05,212 --> 01:16:06,753
And he's on parole.

1278
01:16:06,753 --> 01:16:09,463
That's very bad.

1279
01:16:09,463 --> 01:16:11,421
We can't go anywhere near this guy.

1280
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:14,087
And if he's working with the Feds,

1281
01:16:14,087 --> 01:16:16,630
we can't even walk on his lawn
without getting in trouble.

1282
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:23,088
Thank you very much.
You can keep the change.

1283
01:16:23,088 --> 01:16:25,297
We have to go back to the hotel.

1284
01:16:25,297 --> 01:16:27,463
You've got to call this guy on the phone.

1285
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:29,672
It's the only choice we have.

1286
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,631
Come on.

1287
01:16:44,589 --> 01:16:47,298
You are going to have to
talk hard to these people.

1288
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:49,257
- Yeah, I know.
- And you don't appreciate the parole officer,

1289
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:51,048
don't call me, I'll call you bullshit.

1290
01:16:51,048 --> 01:16:52,589
- I know.
- And whether or not his phone is tapped,

1291
01:16:52,589 --> 01:16:54,590
or not, tell him you could care less...

1292
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,216
I know, I know.

1293
01:16:56,216 --> 01:16:57,341
Where are you going?

1294
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,049
Will you make sure that I stay assertive?

1295
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:06,674
Sure. I didn't expect Jeremy
to be such a normal guy.

1296
01:17:06,674 --> 01:17:09,007
I know, he's my first.

1297
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:10,758
Do you think that's why I brought
him on the brink of federal prison?

1298
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:13,383
Maybe.

1299
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:16,424
Look, between Frankie and Dink,
it'll get handled, OK?

1300
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,591
I'm the only one who can
deal with Dave Greenberg.

1301
01:17:31,591 --> 01:17:33,343
Dave!

1302
01:17:33,343 --> 01:17:36,093
It's Beth.

1303
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:39,301
Beth, you're calling me at home.

1304
01:17:40,301 --> 01:17:42,760
You know, we're having my
son's birthday party here.

1305
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,552
What you're doing is the most scumbag
fucking thing you can do in this business.

1306
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:49,719
You and your buddies win five weeks in a row,

1307
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:52,385
and get paid the exact amount on time,

1308
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:55,178
and now, the first time you lose,

1309
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:57,469
you turn your cell phones off?!

1310
01:17:57,469 --> 01:17:59,719
I'll call you back in five minutes.

1311
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:02,177
Four minutes!

1312
01:18:08,177 --> 01:18:10,637
Get off the money thing.
Get back on the Fed thing,

1313
01:18:10,637 --> 01:18:12,137
it's the only thing we really care about.

1314
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:15,469
He's scared.
I can taste it.

1315
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:17,762
I'm going to make him more
scared of me than the Feds.

1316
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,679
I got this.

1317
01:18:51,014 --> 01:18:52,638
- Dave.
- Beth.

1318
01:18:52,638 --> 01:18:54,431
My phone line are still tapped,

1319
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:55,223
I'm calling you from the neighbors.

1320
01:18:56,223 --> 01:18:57,764
Dave, stop lying to me right now.

1321
01:18:57,764 --> 01:18:59,597
I don't believe a word that's
coming out of your mouth.

1322
01:18:59,597 --> 01:19:01,347
You owe me $75,000.

1323
01:19:01,347 --> 01:19:03,182
Hey!

1324
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:06,431
Hey, I owe you $10,000.

1325
01:19:06,431 --> 01:19:09,265
Whatever the other guys lost,
whatever they're not paying you,

1326
01:19:09,265 --> 01:19:12,182
I am not responsible. If you want,
I'll give you their numbers.

1327
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:14,432
Oh, I have all the numbers I need, Dave.

1328
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:15,223
I have your boss's phone number,

1329
01:19:16,224 --> 01:19:17,598
I have your sister's phone number,

1330
01:19:17,598 --> 01:19:22,016
I have your wife's parents
numbers in Great Neck.

1331
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:24,265
And if you don't stop fucking with me,

1332
01:19:24,265 --> 01:19:27,724
I will call each one of them and
tell them what a degenerate you are.

1333
01:19:27,724 --> 01:19:29,640
Christ, where do you get off
calling me a degenerate?

1334
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,225
Dave, Dave, do you think I'm just some idiot

1335
01:19:33,225 --> 01:19:37,058
running around the street all day, handing
out thousands of dollars in credit limits?

1336
01:19:37,058 --> 01:19:39,392
Is that what you fucking think I am?!

1337
01:19:39,392 --> 01:19:42,351
You don't think that I work for someone?

1338
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:45,433
Someone who can find out anything about you,

1339
01:19:45,433 --> 01:19:47,558
do anything to you.

1340
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:50,101
Do you really want to play that guy?

1341
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:54,517
Dave, it's because of me that
you can still walk right now.

1342
01:19:58,518 --> 01:20:02,394
Beth, I told you. I have a
parole officer that is on...

1343
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:05,602
Even if you do have a parole officer,

1344
01:20:05,602 --> 01:20:07,560
he is not my problem.

1345
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,393
I don't think you get what's going on here.

1346
01:20:10,393 --> 01:20:14,519
Dave, listen to me. Look me
in the eye over the phone.

1347
01:20:16,519 --> 01:20:19,770
You're an adult.

1348
01:20:20,769 --> 01:20:23,437
And you make decisions.

1349
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:28,270
And those decisions have consequences,

1350
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:31,561
for you and for people around you.

1351
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:34,355
When you put your money down,

1352
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:39,271
you cannot pick and choose which of
your bets count and which ones don't.

1353
01:20:41,272 --> 01:20:44,438
'Cause all of your bets are yours.

1354
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:47,521
All of them.

1355
01:20:47,521 --> 01:20:50,439
Win or lose.

1356
01:20:53,438 --> 01:20:54,522
Dave?

1357
01:20:57,522 --> 01:20:58,606
Dave?

1358
01:21:08,188 --> 01:21:11,273
Dave?

1359
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:16,440
You, you're right.

1360
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:21,690
You're right, but I can't...

1361
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:24,565
I can't pay.

1362
01:21:25,566 --> 01:21:27,066
I don't have the money.

1363
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:31,024
He's crying.
I feel bad.

1364
01:21:31,024 --> 01:21:33,607
No. Go, go, go...

1365
01:21:35,608 --> 01:21:38,441
Dave, be completely honest
with me about the Fed thing

1366
01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:41,274
and the parole officer, right now...

1367
01:21:41,274 --> 01:21:44,275
...and I will knock
$10,000 off the debt.

1368
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:46,567
This is a one time only offer.

1369
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:58,276
I have a parole officer.
That's the truth.

1370
01:22:05,276 --> 01:22:09,068
But he doesn't know anything about you.

1371
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:12,360
That Fed thing, that's bullshit.

1372
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,777
That's what I thought.

1373
01:22:14,777 --> 01:22:20,361
OK. So, now we're done with the
games and you only owe me $65,000.

1374
01:22:20,361 --> 01:22:22,652
So, how are we going to work this out?

1375
01:22:22,652 --> 01:22:24,527
Do I have to call all your
relatives or have somebody come

1376
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:26,736
and punch a fucking sunroof into your head?!

1377
01:22:26,736 --> 01:22:28,069
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1378
01:22:30,069 --> 01:22:32,111
The only way you're going to get your money,

1379
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:34,027
is if you reopen my account.

1380
01:22:35,028 --> 01:22:39,070
I want to take New Jersey tonight to win

1381
01:22:39,112 --> 01:22:41,570
for $20,000. It is a lock.

1382
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:44,487
Now, if I win,

1383
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:47,612
that's $40,000, and you can have all of it.

1384
01:22:47,612 --> 01:22:49,571
Take it or leave it.

1385
01:22:49,571 --> 01:22:51,779
- What?
- Please hold.

1386
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:55,113
What are you doing? Just let it go.
It's Rosie's money.

1387
01:22:55,113 --> 01:22:57,489
No, no, no. Look, if I
don't get Rosie his money,

1388
01:22:57,489 --> 01:22:59,239
he won't give me my money.

1389
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:01,405
If I hang up now, I lose everything.

1390
01:23:01,405 --> 01:23:04,656
If Dave loses, I still lose everything.

1391
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:06,613
But if Dave wins...

1392
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:12,198
I see your logic, but New Jersey?

1393
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:16,156
- New Jersey...
- Wait, if Dave wins will Rosie give me my money?

1394
01:23:16,156 --> 01:23:19,698
Yeah, Rosie's a scumbag, he's not a thief.

1395
01:23:21,698 --> 01:23:24,697
OK, I'll do it.

1396
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:26,614
If I can put you down for $40,000,

1397
01:23:26,614 --> 01:23:28,698
that way you win 80, and we're even.

1398
01:23:28,698 --> 01:23:32,324
If I win, that makes me up 15.

1399
01:23:32,324 --> 01:23:33,740
I don't think you're very good at math.

1400
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,491
Oh no, I'm good at math.

1401
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:39,282
And I'm even better at dealing with degenerates.

1402
01:23:39,282 --> 01:23:43,200
That $15,000 goes to me for putting
up with your amateur bullshit.

1403
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,741
And you're in the clear.
Take it or leave it.

1404
01:23:51,742 --> 01:23:53,784
I'll take it.

1405
01:23:55,783 --> 01:23:57,450
New Jersey.

1406
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:02,200
New Jersey, desperately trying to hang on

1407
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,409
for the upset win over Los Angeles.

1408
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:07,243
96-95!

1409
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:10,200
New Jersey has to play better defense.

1410
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,369
For New Jersey they have
played hard all night long!

1411
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:16,327
Now their lead down to one, and it is gone...

1412
01:24:16,327 --> 01:24:18,784
I can't believe it, you're kidding me!

1413
01:24:21,577 --> 01:24:23,285
I can't take this.

1414
01:24:23,285 --> 01:24:25,243
Again, a lack of defense transition.

1415
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:29,412
You've got to slow down the basketball.

1416
01:24:29,412 --> 01:24:34,452
Los Angeles with a
97-96 lead over New Jersey!

1417
01:24:34,452 --> 01:24:37,286
What are you doing?
Come back and watch!

1418
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:39,494
This is the part I just can't watch.

1419
01:24:39,494 --> 01:24:41,619
I'd rather sit alone in a dark room
for three hours with the phone off

1420
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:45,078
- after a game.
- Yeah, when you have money on it.

1421
01:24:50,078 --> 01:24:52,162
You have money on this game?

1422
01:24:52,162 --> 01:24:55,037
- Mm-hm.
- You bet against me?

1423
01:24:55,037 --> 01:24:59,246
No. Bet $70,000 on New Jersey
to win the game out right.

1424
01:24:59,246 --> 01:25:00,621
- Who with?
- Rosie.

1425
01:25:00,621 --> 01:25:02,121
- Oh, my God...
- My God...

1426
01:25:02,121 --> 01:25:05,663
Why would you do that?
Why?

1427
01:25:05,663 --> 01:25:08,122
I don't know.

1428
01:25:08,122 --> 01:25:10,705
You can't bet sentimentally.

1429
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:13,497
You taught me that.

1430
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:17,122
Here you see Reedmore in the act,

1431
01:25:17,122 --> 01:25:19,705
get stripped and put him at the free throw line

1432
01:25:19,705 --> 01:25:23,331
and two main free throws, can
win this game for New Jersey.

1433
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:25,080
Reedmore just got fouled!

1434
01:25:25,122 --> 01:25:28,331
Come on! Come on, come on!
Come on!

1435
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:30,790
Making the play late in the game.

1436
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:33,414
Come on, we've got to watch this now.

1437
01:25:33,414 --> 01:25:35,288
Come on, come on.
Watch.

1438
01:25:35,288 --> 01:25:37,207
Look, he's gonna get this in.

1439
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:40,331
Sucks. I just want you to be
prepared if he doesn't...

1440
01:25:40,331 --> 01:25:42,664
- Watch, watch...
- ...make it.

1441
01:25:42,664 --> 01:25:45,249
...and at least try
and force overtime.

1442
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:47,665
Reedmore's first...

1443
01:25:47,665 --> 01:25:51,624
Yes!

1444
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:55,624
New Jersey, they've had such a difficult year...

1445
01:25:55,624 --> 01:25:57,457
OK, OK, now make the second one.

1446
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:59,707
- I'm going to go sit down.
- No. Dink, you stay here.

1447
01:25:59,707 --> 01:26:01,292
They're going to make both.

1448
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:02,708
You've got to protect yourself.

1449
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:04,541
No, I know he's going to make it.

1450
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:06,083
- I know.
- Can't think like that.

1451
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,250
Because I deserve this.

1452
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:10,791
- Can't think like that.
- Dink. I have to think like that.

1453
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:15,334
The chance to put them on
his shoulders and win it.

1454
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:19,042
To cap off this miraculous upset,

1455
01:26:19,042 --> 01:26:22,543
New Jersey playing from in front.

1456
01:26:22,543 --> 01:26:26,375
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

1457
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,375
We're doomed.

1458
01:26:50,294 --> 01:26:52,378
One, two, three...

1459
01:26:52,378 --> 01:26:55,295
<i>Well I heard about the girl
you've been dancing with</i>

1460
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:58,253
<i>All over the neighborhood</i>

1461
01:26:58,253 --> 01:27:01,295
<i>Tell me why didn't you ask me baby</i>

1462
01:27:01,295 --> 01:27:03,795
<i>Or didn't you think I could</i>

1463
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:07,088
<i>Well I know that your
partner won't stop aside</i>

1464
01:27:07,129 --> 01:27:09,712
<i>I've seen her with the jerk all night</i>

1465
01:27:09,712 --> 01:27:11,754
<i>Why didn't you ask me baby</i>

1466
01:27:12,754 --> 01:27:15,547
<i>I would've shown you how to do it right</i>

1467
01:27:15,547 --> 01:27:18,296
<i>Yeah, do it right</i>

1468
01:27:18,296 --> 01:27:21,588
 ?

1469
01:27:21,588 --> 01:27:26,338
<i>Yeah Do it right</i>

1470
01:27:26,338 --> 01:27:30,506
 ?

1471
01:27:30,506 --> 01:27:34,464
<i>Shakin', shakin', shakin', shakin' baby</i>

1472
01:27:34,464 --> 01:27:37,631
<i>Here we go loop de loop</i>

<i>Here we go loop de lie</i>

01:27:43,339 --> 01:27:46,673
<i>Bend over let me see you

1476
01:27:46,673 --> 01:27:49,631
<i>Bend over let me see you
