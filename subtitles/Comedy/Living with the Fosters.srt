1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:01,551
Previously on The Fosters:

2
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:03,321
Don't feel to bad. He
knows everyone's name.

3
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:05,457
I mean, except mine.

4
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,325
Kelsey told Principal
Sanchez about everything.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,560
You are suspended.

6
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:10,295
If you keep making decisions

7
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:11,596
the way you've been making decisions,

8
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,265
you're gonna ruin every good
thing that comes your way.

9
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:15,732
You've got a family that wants you.

10
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,400
I know where I need to be now.

11
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:18,668
Jesus kicked me out of my room.

12
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,570
He called it his room.

13
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,705
Um, hi. This is Brandon Foster.

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,374
I can't take piano
lessons from you anymore.

15
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,575
My family just can't afford it.

16
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,445
- I love you, Brandon.
- I never realized until today

17
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,347
that for us to be together
you have to give up everything.

18
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,316
Dad?

19
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,617
What was your mom's funeral like?

20
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:36,386
Everyone just kept telling us

21
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,454
she's in a better place now.

22
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,422
Some article in the newspaper today?

23
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,558
Make me some overzealous
cop with a vendetta.

24
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:43,726
I thought this was supposed to go away.

25
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,463
Isn't there something that
you need to say to your wife?

26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,764
Something about a baby?

27
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,633
You wanna have a baby?

28
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,279
So, Callie, you're
going home. How you feel?

29
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,248
Good. Excited.

30
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,583
- Yeah.
- Scared?

31
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:08,384
No.

32
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,353
A little.

33
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:15,458
Be sure to tell Jesus I say hi.

34
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,628
Oh, really, Gabi, why don't we talk about

35
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,497
what scares us all about going home.

36
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,499
Anybody?

37
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,634
- Temptations.
- Yeah.

38
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,303
Like Brandon. How's that gonna work?

39
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,638
Yeah, how is that gonna work, Callie?

40
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,707
Have you had any time
to think that through?

41
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:34,410
I mean, he's gonna be my brother.

42
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,513
Once Jude and I are adopted. So...

43
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,481
You're gonna be sleeping
under the same roof,

44
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,517
he's right next door.

45
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,485
You're not gonna be like laying awake

46
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,288
thinking you could just
sneak into his bedroom?

47
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,390
- Ok, Gabi, enough.
- Come on.

48
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:49,325
Are you like, really over him?

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,294
I know what I want.

50
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,296
I mean, it's great that you're leaving here

51
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,498
knowing what you want,
it really is a good start.

52
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,667
But it's easy to get confused.

53
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,469
You're not going to have group twice a day.

54
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,304
You're not going to be confronted

55
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,473
by any of these lovely young ladies,

56
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:05,375
trying to get you to
talk about how you feel.

57
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,243
You gotta hold yourself accountable.

58
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:08,411
Mm, that's right.

59
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:09,646
Least you got people.

60
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,348
- You're lucky.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,450
The mistake most girls
make when they go home

62
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,487
is they underestimate just how tough
it's gonna be out there in the real world.

63
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,522
So don't be cocky.

64
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,692
And that goes for you too, Daph. Right?

65
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,157
Why don't we go around now

66
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:26,460
and everybody can tell Callie
what it is they learned from her.

67
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:28,381
Ok, well,

68
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,735
Callie, I learned from
you to shut up and listen.

69
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,638
- Gab?
- And to not to interrupt.

70
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:37,774
- Ok, well, you know, it's still a work in progress.
- Yeah.

71
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:41,711
I learned we've all got addictions.

72
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,681
And, I could trust you.

73
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:45,682
Carmen?

74
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:50,386
I, um, learned to not judge

75
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,389
just on, you know, looks.

76
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,758
She looked like she didn't belong here...

77
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,594
but she did.

78
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:01,397
I didn't really learn anything from you.

79
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,267
Except I learned how to look
like all blank and superior.

80
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,535
- That's harsh.
- Come on.

81
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,472
No, that's like a really good skill

82
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,474
to have in certain situations.

83
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,410
Mm. Yeah, that was a nice save.

84
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,346
Really, good. Cole.

85
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,680
You're up.

86
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:19,682
I learned...

87
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:22,719
that you're my friend.

88
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:27,657
And I learned about forgiveness.

89
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:34,364
Callie, why don't you share with
the girls what you learned from them.

90
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,300
Um, yeah.

91
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,537
Well, you all, um...

92
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,741
taught me what courage is.

93
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,277
Every one of you,

94
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:52,298
you're so brave and awesome.

95
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:55,318
Even you Becka.

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,322
And Rita. Um...

97
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,227
you taught me that compassion

98
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:05,428
is given for free...

99
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,296
but...

100
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,700
respect has to be earned.

101
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,470
I really respect you.

102
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,305
Thank you, Callie.

103
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,376
I really respect you, too.

104
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:23,346
- And we're gonna miss you, right?
- Yeah.

105
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,581
- Yeah, you better come back and visit.
- Yeah.

106
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,500
Come on, group hug, let's go.

107
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,586
Everybody, Becka, Cole.

108
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,655
The last one for Callie, make it good.

109
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,323
Ohh!

110
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,676
Remember you've got people who love you!

111
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,334
Welcome home! I missed you.

112
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,687
I missed you too, big time.

113
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,338
Welcome back.

114
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:55,511
I have to, uh, finish my book report.

115
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:01,384
- It's due tomorrow.
- Sweetheart, can't you finish that after dinner?

116
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:06,355
Oh, it's ok. We'll catch up later, right?

117
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,360
Jesus wanted to be here,
but he had practice.

118
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,562
It's cool.

119
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:15,231
So let's go set the table.

120
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:16,566
Ok, I'll take this for you.

121
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,367
Thank you. Thank you.

122
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,473
I'm really glad you're back.

123
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:26,375
Thanks, me too.

124
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:30,613
What's up?

125
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:33,349
Look, um...

126
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,485
this is just something
I needed to do, for me.

127
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,253
Ok, it's not your fault or anything.

128
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:38,721
What's not my fault?

129
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,490
I asked my moms...

130
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:42,391
uh...

131
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,261
our... moms,

132
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,530
uh... not to tell you, because I
didn't want to affect your decision.

133
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:48,698
Brandon, what?

134
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:52,668
I just need some time to figure things out.

135
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,273
So I moved in with my Dad.

136
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:42,871


137
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,257
Thanks you for cleaning up, sweetheart.

138
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,725
Why don't you come sit
down with us, Callie.

139
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,648
Um...

140
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,733
I just want to say I'm really...

141
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:01,337
really sorry about Brandon moving out.

142
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,306
I feel terrible.

143
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,308
It's ok. It's only temporary.

144
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,542
But he's gonna be around here a lot

145
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,344
so you guys are gonna have to...

146
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,314
Stick to the ground rules, I know.

147
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,616
So listen, things are going to
be a little different around here.

148
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,686
We're going to need to know where
you are at all times, all right?

149
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:21,290
You have wireless and you
can text but no Internet.

150
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,259
And we're going to need you to leave

151
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,696
the Find My Phone app on so we can...

152
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,365
Track me down if you need to find me.

153
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,667
- We know that this is a little bit...
- No, I get it.

154
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,638
I have to earn back your trust.

155
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,707
Everyone's trust.

156
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,669
- ... and you need a comma right here.
- Ok.

157
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:09,238
I think you could cut this sentence shorter

158
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:11,240
and just get to the theme quicker.

159
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,541
- Right.
- Hey.

160
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,411
Hey.

161
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,214
Mariana's been helping me with my paper.

162
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,249
That's great.

163
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,320
- See you in the morning.
- Yes, you will.

164
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,258
He's just...

165
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:33,229
I know. It's ok.

166
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,500
Where's Jesus?

167
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,502
He's still getting ready.

168
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:42,288
Don't forget you need to take
him to acupuncture after school.

169
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,673
Yeah, he swears that it's not working.

170
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,626
Well, that is part of the deal.
He's not been meditating either.

171
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,678
Jude, your book report's perfect.

172
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:51,246
Thanks.

173
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,383
My stomach's in knots,

174
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,302
I've been suspended for a
week but it feels like forever.

175
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,437
Are you afraid that
they're talking about you?

176
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:01,524
No, I mean... maybe.

177
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:05,561
- Do you think they were?
- What are people saying about Callie?

178
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,263
It doesn't matter, honey?

179
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,465
I think all they heard was
that you ran away with Wyatt

180
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,534
and, you know, not anything else.

181
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,569
I don't really care
what other people think.

182
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,488
Good for you.

183
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:18,491
Yeah, me either. Let the
whole school talk about us.

184
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,660
We can be like notorious together.

185
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,461
See, I've been notorious.

186
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,629
Ain't all it's cracked up to be.

187
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,249
Ok, where is, uh...

188
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,218
Jesus, come on, dude!

189
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,587
Where are you? Let's go, shake a leg!

190
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,436
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Stefanie Foster?

191
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,604
Yeah.

192
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,373
You've been served.

193
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,700
What's that?

194
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,353
Uh, it's a summons.

195
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,555
I've been called by the D.A.
to testify in Mike's case.

196
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,691
Why? You were unconscious.

197
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,297
I wasn't unconscious.

198
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,534
Ana's boyfriend shot me
and then dropped the gun.

199
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:19,735
Mike came into the room firing,

200
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,738
and did not see that
the shooter was unarmed.

201
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,408
I was afraid he might've said something

202
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,309
and then I would contradict him.

203
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,346
I just... I don't...

204
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,517
It was a judgment call and...

205
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,419
It was a terrible judgment call.

206
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,754
Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,559
You were heavily sedated when
they talked to you, right?

208
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:46,429
You weren't thinking clearly.

209
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:49,465
I wish that were the case.

210
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:50,566
Mike did the right thing.

211
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,568
I should have trusted
the system, that's all.

212
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:53,702
You were just trying to protect Mike.

213
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,337
Well, it doesn't matter, I lied.

214
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,705
And now, they're gonna
question me under oath.

215
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,408
So what happens if you come clean?

216
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:02,411
I get fired.

217
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,945
Whoa! Uh, jeez.

218
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:14,080
Hey. Hi.

219
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:19,886
Sorry. I'm Dani. I'm a,
friend, of your dad's.

220
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:23,723
Oh, uh, it's cool. I just didn't...

221
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:24,925
Yeah, I meant to get up and out.

222
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,861
So it wouldn't be awkward.

223
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,030
Too late.

224
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,165
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,102
Nice jacket.

226
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,688
Except for your collar is crooked.

227
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:39,940
Oh.

228
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:42,042
Men just aren't good
at dressing themselves.

229
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:46,846
- Hey.
- I overslept!

230
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:50,817
It's ok. Hey, uh, I see
you met Hurricane Dani.

231
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,703
Shut up! All right, I'm
gonna go get dressed.

232
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:55,739
I'm gonna be late and
Pilates is my religion.

233
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,757
Gotta keep everything high and tight.

234
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,893
Don't be late for school!

235
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,933
You have a girlfriend?

236
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,668
She's my sober buddy.

237
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,937
Well, do you sleep with
all your sober buddies?

238
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,073
Excuse me?

239
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,809
I'm sorry, I thought that you
weren't supposed to be getting into

240
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:18,879
any kind of relationships
when you're getting sober?

241
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,947
It's not a relationship.

242
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:24,017
I'm not drinking. That's
the most important thing. Ok?

243
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:27,737
Now get moving. You're not
gonna be late on my watch.

244
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:30,824
Oh, uh, for lessons this week.

245
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,896
Um... I was actually thinking
maybe I could, you know,

246
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,999
take a break from piano.

247
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:41,134
What do you mean? You love piano.

248
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,737
You worked your ass off to
get this teacher to take you.

249
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:46,840
Yeah, I know, I'm just a little burned out.

250
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,942
Should I be worried?

251
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,943
No.

252
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,077
Is this about Callie?

253
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:54,748
No, Dad, I'm ok. I...

254
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,784
Thank you for paying for the lessons but...

255
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,855
it's not forever. Ok?

256
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,024
Ok.

257
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,726
- All right. Yep. See you.
- All right, I'll see you later.

258
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,068
Ignore them.

259
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:20,040
I have no intentions of
acknowledging her miserable existence,

260
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,660
or her questionnable taste in leggings.

261
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,685
Look, I just, what if she's telling
Chase terrible things about me?

262
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:30,050
You know that feeling in
the pit of your stomach?

263
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:32,819
That is what it feels like to be notorious.

264
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,807
Hey, welcome back.

265
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,793
Aw, you noticed I was gone?

266
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,696
So, cast party tonight. We still on?

267
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,681
Oh, uh, I don't know.

268
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:47,767
I'm mean, Kelsey's gonna be there

269
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,736
and I think I'll just feel weird or...

270
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,806
I couldn't care less about the cast party.

271
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,742
Maybe we could, go see
a movie or something?

272
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,645
Yeah. Sure. That sounds good.

273
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,747
Sweet! I'll see you at lunch?

274
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,970
Hey.

275
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:25,005
Hey.

276
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,740
How are you?

277
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:28,675
I'm, great.

278
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:31,011
Oh. Good.

279
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:34,898
What about you? How's your dad's?

280
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,883
Oh, um...

281
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,152
You know, it's...

282
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:43,073
I gotta...

283
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,791
Yeah.

284
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:45,859
See ya.

285
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:48,028
Ok.

286
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:04,678
Hey, uh, Professor Marshall, this
is Mike Foster, Brandon's dad.

287
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:09,766
Uh, today, he told me that he wanted
to take a break from his lessons.

288
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,951
And I'm not sure I should let him.

289
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,987
Um, I'd like to discuss that with you,

290
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,989
if you can call me back
that would be great.

291
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,857
Uh, thanks.

292
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:30,088
- Sorry man.
- What the hell, man?

293
00:15:30,122 --> 00:15:32,758
Faulty boomerang. Maybe
I'm not throwing it right.

294
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,009
Mind throwing it somewhere else?

295
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,198
Want a hit?

296
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,033
No, thanks.

297
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,071
How does that work?

298
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,807
Ditching class when your
mom's the vice principal?

299
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,011
- Don't know.
- You're not gonna narc on me, are ya?

300
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,212
No.

301
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:59,985
That Callie girl, she's
your foster sister, right?

302
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:04,689
Did she really run away with
the mop head? You know, Wyatt.

303
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,758
Yeah, I know. She didn't run away with him.

304
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:09,010
Hey, I don't know why
everyone keeps saying that.

305
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,934
Look, I'm buying the
booze for a party tonight.

306
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:17,035
You should come check it out.

307
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:20,038
Sounds like you need
to blow off some steam.

308
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:22,007
You're buying the booze?

309
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,183
Twenty-three?

310
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:35,987
I look young for my age. Good genes.

311
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:37,789
Where'd you get this?

312
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,758
A buddy of mine uses his school ID maker.

313
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,894
And it really works? You
don't get busted or anything?

314
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:47,032
I use it at liquor stores,
bars, never had a problem.

315
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,201
If you want one, I could hook you up?

316
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:56,925
I had to say it. It was so cool.

317
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,878
- Is one of you, Jude?
- Uh, he is.

318
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:01,713
Then these are for you.

319
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:03,932
- Thank you.
- Enjoy!

320
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,784
What was that?

321
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:06,985
I don't know.

322
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:11,723
Well, actually, tomorrow
is kinda my birthday.

323
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:13,909
How does the cupcake
delivery girl know before me?

324
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,727
I don't think that's her actual job.

325
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:19,980
My mom gave birth to me at home and

326
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,572
when she went to file the paperwork,

327
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,119
they messed up the date by a couple weeks.

328
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,972
So when Callie and I went
into the foster system,

329
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:30,959
we never told anyone my real birth date.

330
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,045
We kept it a secret, you know, just for us.

331
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,696
- So can we eat them?
- Hold on.

332
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:38,900
She must be trying to send me
some type of message or something.

333
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:39,618
What does it mean?

334
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,116
I have no idea.

335
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,930
Here.

336
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:47,322
Now, can we eat 'em?

337
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,548
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:01,419
So, how's it going at your dad's?

339
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:05,290
Ok. Um, he has a girlfriend.

340
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:06,658
Wait, really?

341
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,476
It's kinda weird.

342
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,264
Well, I mean, he's not working
and he's under investigation,

343
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,299
I guess he kind of deserves a girlfriend.

344
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,353
What's going on with the
D.A. and all that, anyway?

345
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:20,405
I mean, is everything ok?

346
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah, seems like it.

347
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:25,243
Um, you know, he says they have nothing,

348
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,512
except for Ana's testimony.

349
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:30,648
So it should blow over.

350
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:35,353
You know, if it wasn't for me,

351
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:36,588
Mom would've never gotten shot

352
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:39,357
and your dad wouldn't be
going through all this.

353
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:40,592
I just...

354
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,562
I wish there was something I could do.

355
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,367
Maybe if I talked to her...

356
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:53,471
No, don't even think about
it. No way. Stay away from her.

357
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,392
Yeah, you're right.

358
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,278
She'd probably just ask me for more money.

359
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,470
Whoa. Hey.

360
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,372
Hey. What are you doing home?

361
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:30,475
Um, I'm... I needed something from my room.

362
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:34,379
- Ok.
- What about you?

363
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,348
I, um...

364
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,550
I'm being questioned by
the D.A. this afternoon.

365
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:41,653
And the lawyer told me to come as a person,

366
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,389
not a cop, no uniform.

367
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,523
This is going away right?

368
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:46,658
I mean, Dad said they have no case.

369
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:51,448
Yeah. Yeah, it's just politics, you know?

370
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,483
Nothing to worry about.

371
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,619
- Ok.
- Ok.

372
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,458
Good to see you.

373
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,328
Did you find any more clues at school?

374
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,764
I don't think so. I looked all over.

375
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,433
Here's one.

376
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:15,388
It says 'anxiety'. That's what I'm
getting looking for these clues.

377
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,776
I don't see any more ducks.

378
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,395
- Look for candy!
- Ok.

379
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:25,732
Oh, I got one.

380
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,617
Up here!

381
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,521
I don't see any more.

382
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,822
Oh, here's one.

383
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:42,465
Hmm. "And... all... anxiety... "

384
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,668
they... was... perfect"?

385
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,637
How about...

386
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:52,408
"Perfect... anxiety... "

387
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,444
they all...

388
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:57,714
and was.

389
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:01,384
I don't think that's it.

390
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,759
Hey, Chase.

391
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:13,763
Um, I just wanted to apologize

392
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:16,432
for the whole stolen fedora thing.

393
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,434
I don't want you to think
I'm that kind of person.

394
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:21,804
Kelsey actually took it, but I should
have made her take it back to the store.

395
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,634
But you loved it so much
and now I'm babbling so...

396
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:27,837
It's fine. No harm done.

397
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,873
I just miss you working on the play.

398
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,610
I missed that smile, too.

399
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:36,546
You gonna come to the cast party tonight?

400
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,448
Yeah, totally. I wouldn't miss it.

401
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,815
Sweet, see you there.

402
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,790
Do you solemnly state that
the testimony you will give

403
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,593
in this deposition proceeding
is the truth, the whole truth,

404
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,845
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

405
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,431
Please state your name, rank and
position in the police department.

406
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:58,551
My name is Stefanie Foster.
I am a corporal with...

407
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:01,521
At which point, you were
in the second bedroom

408
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,473
by yourself, is that correct?

409
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:05,375
Where was your partner at the time?

410
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:07,810
He was clearing the kitchen.

411
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,781
And it was at this moment you were shot,

412
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:16,552
fell to the ground, unconscious, correct?

413
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,758
No.

414
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:24,560
- I'm sorry?
- No, I was not unconscious.

415
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:28,381
I have here your statement to Internal
Affairs, and you clearly state...

416
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,700
I lied. I was awake. I saw the whole thing.

417
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:36,806
After firing on me, the shooter
dropped his gun and it misfired.

418
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,410
He did not have his hands up in
surrender when Officer Foster entered

419
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,880
and fired on him, as we were trained to do.

420
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:48,484
I see. And how do I know
you're not lying now?

421
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,620
Because I'm under oath.

422
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:56,592
And because by telling you this,
I could very well lose my job.

423
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,666
I was surprised to hear from you.

424
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,736
Thanks for meeting me on such sort notice.

425
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:12,575
Is this about Jesus and
Mariana? Are they ok?

426
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,478
They are.

427
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:18,514
I mean, they're pretty upset
about our mom getting shot.

428
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:21,384
Of course, I'm sure.

429
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:24,487
Can you just tell them that I'm sorry?

430
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,522
If you're sorry then why are you lying?

431
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:28,691
Lying? About...

432
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:31,494
Being at the house when
my dad shot your boyfriend.

433
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:35,398
- I was.
- With Jesus. At the Women's Shelter.

434
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,735
You wouldn't have gone to meet him,

435
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:43,473
knowing that our mom could be dying.

436
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,841
Just to get money from him.

437
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,777
You wouldn't do that.

438
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,679
Right? Because I mean...

439
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:51,881
they would hate you.

440
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,420
I mean, right?

441
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:01,424
Right. I wouldn't do that.

442
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,825
Because, you care about them.

443
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,829
I do. I love them.

444
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,598
And you want to maybe

445
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:10,767
someday be a part of their lives.

446
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:15,671
So you gotta tell the D.A. the truth.

447
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,508
That you weren't there.

448
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,543
Because if you were there...

449
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,581
they would never forgive you.

450
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:32,822
I want to tell the truth.

451
00:24:33,857 --> 00:24:35,558
It's just...

452
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:39,662
they really want me to testify

453
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:42,799
and I don't... I'm scared that
they're gonna cut off my food stamps...

454
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,500
Maybe I can help you.

455
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,346
That's a lot of money.

456
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:02,418
I just want you to feel safe,

457
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:03,719
you know, to do what's right.

458
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,189
The last time you went to a
party, Mariana, you got drunk.

459
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:22,292
And I also got grounded
and learned my lesson.

460
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:25,312
Besides, it's the cast party, there's
not gonna be any alcohol there.

461
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,133
Ok, what if Callie goes with me?

462
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:32,402
She didn't drink last time. She can
be like my chaperone or something.

463
00:25:32,437 --> 00:25:36,139
Yeah, um, I don't think I
want that responsibility.

464
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:38,191
You know, I'm on probation, remember?

465
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:41,244
Yeah, I agree. It's not Callie's
job to babysit you, honey.

466
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,147
Ok, well, you can like
drive us off and pick us up.

467
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:46,049
We can even take a
Breathalyzer test if you want.

468
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,285
- Mariana...
- How are you gonna know if you can ever trust us

469
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,154
if you don't give us the
chance to prove ourselves?

470
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:54,057
I mean, you want Callie to
make friends and get involved.

471
00:25:54,091 --> 00:25:57,093
How is she going to do that
if she's locked up at home?

472
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:01,965
All right, I will discuss it
with mom when she gets home.

473
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,976
I found 11 clues. Are there more?

474
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,377
I don't know what you're talking about.

475
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,179
At least tell me if there are 13.

476
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:19,182
Maybe. Have you figured
out what it says yet?

477
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:20,283
No. What does it say?

478
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,351
- What does what say?
- The puzzle.

479
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,153
- What puzzle?
- You just admitted...

480
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:24,955
I admit nothing.

481
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:38,969
Well, if you... if you lose
your job, we'll figure it out.

482
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:41,972
- It's just...
- I won't have a baby.

483
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:44,007
I don't want to be the reason
that you don't have a baby.

484
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,142
It's... life is the reason, ok?

485
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:48,178
Sometimes things are just not meant to be.

486
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:54,217
Hey. Did you talk about
the cast party? Can I go?

487
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:57,320
What's wrong? Am I in trouble?

488
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,122
No, love.

489
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:02,993
Hey.

490
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:04,995
Hey. What're you grinning about?

491
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,263
Ana recanted.

492
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,398
Said she's wasn't even there

493
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:11,201
at the time of the shooting.
D.A.'s dropping the investigation.

494
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:12,369
Oh, my God.

495
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:14,337
You're kidding me?

496
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:19,075
Wow. Congratulations, Mike. I'm so happy.

497
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,410
Me too.

498
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:22,262
There's something you don't see every day.

499
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:24,147
- Right?
- Hey, bud.

500
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:25,982
I got your text, what's up?

501
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:29,019
Ana changed her story. It's all over.

502
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,353
That's great news.

503
00:27:32,223 --> 00:27:33,356
So, how does this affect your deposition?

504
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:34,958
Well, it's dead, right?

505
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:37,360
Yeah, it's dead.

506
00:27:37,428 --> 00:27:40,096
I'm gonna open a bottle of champagne.

507
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:41,965
- Apple juice for me.
- You got it.

508
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,134
Wow, so...

509
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:45,435
- Roberts called.
- You're kidding.

510
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:49,439
Yeah, said the D.A.'s
office called her and...

511
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,293
Hello?

512
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:55,045
Yes.

513
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:58,214
My dad called you?

514
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:02,052
No, I understand.

515
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,924
If you could just let me tell him first...

516
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,159
Please.

517
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:12,329
No, I will. I promise.

518
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:15,031
Thank you.

519
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,233
And I'm sorry to put you in this position.

520
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:21,972
Put who in what position?

521
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:23,974
No one.

522
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:25,942
You just had a conversation with no one?

523
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:34,084
That was my piano teacher.

524
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:36,419
I stopped going a few weeks
ago but I didn't tell my dad.

525
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:38,088
And I kept the money.

526
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:39,956
Why would you do that?

527
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:44,361
I was gonna give it to Callie when
she was getting her own apartment.

528
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:46,129
Oh, Brandon.

529
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:48,365
I know. It was dumb.

530
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:53,069
I'm going to tell my dad
and I'll give the money back.

531
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:56,339
Ok, good. At least you didn't spend it.

532
00:28:57,408 --> 00:28:59,175
Just let me know how it goes, ok?

533
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,649
I thought it was supposed
to be a small party.

534
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,620
There were only four people in the
cast, that's not much of a party.

535
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,490
Dude, help me get the rest.

536
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,644
Ok, I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

537
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,981
Oh, there's Chase. I'm gonna
go say hi. Be right back.

538
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,619
So you think there's anything
to drink other than beer?

539
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,722
There was a refreshments budget but
clearly I wasn't on that committee.

540
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:56,727
Hey, um, I'm sorry if I crashed
your... thing with Mariana.

541
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,796
It's the only way our
moms would let her come.

542
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,632
Yeah, yeah, no, I mean,
the more the merrier.

543
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,852
You were so brilliant in the play.

544
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,704
Did you always know you wanted to act?

545
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,989
I always knew I wanted to change lives.

546
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,941
You do. Every night.

547
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,578
Hey, I got you a beer and one for myself.

548
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,915
I would have gotten you one, but I
remember the last time you drank at a party.

549
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,018
- Two words: Projectile vomit.
- Not true.

550
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,854
It's ok, there's nothing to be ashamed
of, some girls are just lightweights.

551
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,791
Um...

552
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,678
you know, I'm gonna go
say hi to my leading lady.

553
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:33,997
Back off.

554
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,634
Or what? I can't believe I ever
thought that you were friend.

555
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,036
You know, you're just embarrassing
yourself in front of Chase.

556
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,740
He sees you as a sophomore
fan girl and that's it.

557
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:43,411
Oh yeah?

558
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:46,711
Then why did you feel so threatened
you had to get me kicked off the play?

559
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,780
Do I need to hose you two down with water?

560
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,848
Hashtag cat fight.

561
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:56,787
Cat fight? That was incredibly sexist.

562
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,655
Is one of those for me?

563
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,858
Well, one of them was, but
I don't want to be accused

564
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,594
of being sexist for not
letting you get your own.

565
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,936
Hey bro. You made it.

566
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:32,890
What're you doing here?

567
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,993
- I'm with Mariana.
- What's she doing here?

568
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:40,631
- This is the cast party.
- This is the cast party?

569
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,835
Nothing gets past you,
man. Here, have a beer.

570
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,739
Um, I should probably go check on her.

571
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,652
You got a thing for her.

572
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,986
So listen. When can I get that fake IDs?

573
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,622
How soon do you need it?

574
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,049
I'm looking to make some quick cash so,

575
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,025
I don't know, I thought maybe I could

576
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,860
buy some beer for parties like you do.

577
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,830
Don't bogart my business, man.

578
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,998
Look, if you want to make some fast bank,

579
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,633
why don't we sell some I.D.s?

580
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,901
Isn't that, like, a felony?

581
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,637
Only if we get caught.

582
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,640
Dude, your mom's the school veep.

583
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,642
You have access to her keys,

584
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,745
we have access to the
ID maker at Anchor Beach.

585
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,847
There's no end to the demand.

586
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,648
We can make a major business out of this.

587
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,751
I only need like a thousand bucks.

588
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,688
Well, if you want to think small...

589
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:43,644
Hey.

590
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,730
I'm so glad you came!

591
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,607
You need to make a bold move.

592
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,808
Like what?

593
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,843
Well, this one time, I went to
a party and there was this guy

594
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,945
I liked and I wasn't
sure if he was into me.

595
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:05,849
So, I went in the bathroom and took off my
panties and slid them in his front pocket.

596
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:06,984
That's a thing?

597
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,919
It worked for me.

598
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,555
Who was the guy? Wait, don't
tell me it was my brother.

599
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,825
I'm gonna get another beer. You want one?

600
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,761
No, thanks.

601
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:28,939
- Hi.
- Hey.

602
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,709
I was just talking about
you. Your sister's in here.

603
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,678
I know. She's with Callie.

604
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,848
Oh. So that's why you're here.

605
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:41,685
- I didn't know she was gonna be here.
- What a coincidence.

606
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:45,789
Callie shows up and you follow her
around like a sad, little puppy.

607
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,724
I think you've had enough to drink.

608
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,761
I should probably just walk
away right now but I told you.

609
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,864
I told you she wasn't into you and
you were just going to get hurt.

610
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,667
You know what? I'm so sick

611
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,003
of you and everyone else
telling me about my business.

612
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,905
Ok, Callie is into me.

613
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,575
We kissed at the wedding and
that's why she ran away with Wyatt.

614
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,677
Because she didn't want
to mess up Jude's adoption.

615
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,512
And the only reason we're
not together right now

616
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,847
is because she needs a
family more than a boyfriend.

617
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,984
So don't talk about things
you don't understand, ok?

618
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,578
If you're interested,
I'll be waiting upstairs.

619
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:35,870
- Hello, captain, come on in.
- Thanks.

620
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:38,139
- Thank you for letting me swing by.
- Absolutely.

621
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:42,010
I didn't want to have this
discussion at the station.

622
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:46,014
- The D.A. e-mailed me your deposition.
- I see.

623
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:49,017
Strangest thing, I...

624
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:52,186
I can't get the damn thing
to open on my computer.

625
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:55,823
But with Ana recanting and
the charges being dropped,

626
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,825
I can't think of a reason to read it.

627
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,962
Thank you.

628
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:06,000
One thing, though, Foster, I.A.
took a lot of heat during all this.

629
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,869
They're gonna keep their
eyes on both you and Mike.

630
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:11,172
So I wouldn't give out so much as a
parking ticket without following procedure.

631
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:13,207
- You got it.
- I'm serious,

632
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:16,844
Not a whiff of impropriety,
or heads are going to roll.

633
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,212
- Am I clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

634
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,949
All right, I'll see you on Monday.

635
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:22,817
Yes you will.

636
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,886
Have a good night.

637
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
You too.

638
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:27,221
Thank you.

639
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:43,171
What are you doing up here?

640
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,906
Oh, um, nothing.

641
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,042
I was just looking for
someplace quiet to hang.

642
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:51,045
Oh, cool. Oh, do you mind if I join you?

643
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,048
So I...

644
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,985
I just want you to know, that,

645
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,087
like in case you were wondering...

646
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,056
Well, the thing is, I...

647
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:03,992
Oh. Sorry, am I interrupting something?

648
00:36:04,026 --> 00:36:05,126
Kind of.

649
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,097
No. Not really. We can
finish this later. Right, Zac?

650
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:13,868
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

651
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:18,072
It wasn't important. It's
just, Callie's looking for you.

652
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:30,251
I believe...

653
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,886
these belong to you?

654
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:44,789
You're pathetic and disgusting.

655
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:46,074
I knew it the first time I saw you,

656
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:48,710
and I let everyone convince me I was wrong.

657
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,845
But I wasn't wrong. I was right.

658
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:54,782
Hey girls, watch your backs with this one.

659
00:36:54,817 --> 00:36:56,784
She's a two-faced whore,
who will kiss your boyfriend,

660
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:58,920
then lie to your face about it.

661
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,989
You know, I hope the next
time you go back to juvie,

662
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:02,790
that they let you rot in there, bitch.

663
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:17,972
Wait. What are you doing?

664
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,190
Taking my pants off.

665
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:20,875
Why?

666
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:23,027
'Cause it's kinda hard
to have sex with them on.

667
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:25,196
Ok, whoa, sex?

668
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,115
I though we could just make-out a little.

669
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:28,950
You put your underwear in my pocket.

670
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:31,853
I was, you know, flirting.

671
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:34,989
That's not flirting.
That's like... it's on.

672
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:36,124
Ok, well, it's not.

673
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:39,844
So what, you're just
like a tease, is that it?

674
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:41,829
No. I'm...

675
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:43,765
What, a virgin?

676
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:44,849
I'm not surprised.

677
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,768
That's funny?

678
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:50,071
Who put you up to this?
Is this a joke or... ?

679
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,774
So this is not gonna happen?

680
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:56,744
I thought you liked me.

681
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:01,182
All right, look. Can you
at least, like, help me out?

682
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,151
Um, no.

683
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:06,704
Whatever. Thanks for wasting my time.

684
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,838
Hey, you ok?

685
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:26,941
Did Talya say something?

686
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:29,043
It's fine.

687
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,180
- Where is she?!
- She left.

688
00:38:32,214 --> 00:38:34,015
Don't!

689
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:37,852
Don't make a thing out of this, ok?

690
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:40,221
I understand why she's mad.

691
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,824
It's my fault. I'm so stupid.

692
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,927
- I told her about us.
- Why?

693
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:49,063
Because I can't stand how everyone
thinks you ran away to be with Wyatt.

694
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:51,032
And I can't stand you avoiding me.

695
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,034
And...

696
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:55,036
How this easy for you?

697
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,737
It's not easy.

698
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:02,910
You're not the only one who
needs some space to get over this.

699
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:06,848
I'm sorry it hurts you.

700
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:09,917
Ok, it hurts me, too.

701
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:13,154
How long do we have to feel this way?

702
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:17,925
Until we don't.

703
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,767
Hey.

704
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:27,576
What are you doing here?

705
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:29,740
Did Moms send you to check up on me?

706
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:33,141
No. I go to parties too, you know.

707
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:34,909
Oh, ok.

708
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:37,211
Good, I'm glad you're here.
Can you give us a ride home?

709
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,183
Sure.

710
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:06,974
Wake up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

711
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:09,026
It's your birthday!

712
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:10,244
Here.

713
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:15,783
More clues? Or is it, like,
a bomb I have to defuse?

714
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:17,785
Open it.

715
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:28,996
Mom used to read it to us all the time.

716
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:36,037
So you left me birthday breadcrumbs?

717
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:37,972
Something like that, yeah.

718
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:39,907
And the puzzle?

719
00:40:44,146 --> 00:40:46,914
"Then all anxiety was at an end,

720
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:50,952
and they lived together
in perfect happiness."

721
00:40:52,988 --> 00:40:56,123
Wait, you forgot one of the words.

722
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:57,225
I never got, "Happiness."

723
00:40:57,259 --> 00:41:00,027
Yeah, it's downstairs.

724
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:12,206
Surprise!

725
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:14,892
Happy birthday!

726
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:18,045
Aww.

727
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:20,848
Jesus has an early practice
but he'll be back to celebrate.

728
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:24,986
You told everyone?
About my secret birthday?

729
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,087
Oh, yeah.

730
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:29,257
We don't have to keep secrets anymore,

731
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,992
- we have a family.
- Here we go.

732
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:35,780
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

733
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:38,899

00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:42,954
