Weren't you going to wait for Gou Zhui outside?

42

Aren't you afraid that he'll never be able to find you again by coming here?

Hurry and hand my dad over!

48
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,980
Your capabilities

49
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,540
are even worse than my two daughters who like to play pretend all day.

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,460
You want to become the king of the Pure-Blooded Day-Walkers

00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,070
and dominate the whole Copper Dimension?

00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,430
Zhui!

53
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,350
Da Wei, are you okay?

54
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,110
Didn't you tell me that you were going to wait for me outside? Why did you run off?

55
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,050
I wanted to keep my promise,

56
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,410
but I was thinking that you would want to see me alive more,

57
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,450
so I made a run for it to buy some time.

58
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,530
Zhui, be careful.

59
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,850
He's Ri Yue Wang.

60
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,550
I know.

61
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,550
Your abilities aren't bad for a member of the Gou family,

62
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,070
but why are you with Da Wei as a loyal puppy who comes only when called?

63
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,100
Why not come with me?

64
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,850
I can give you double what he could give you. No,

65
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,330
I could give you a hundred times what he could give you.

66
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,750
You can't afford what he has to give.

67
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,090
Since that's how it is,

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,070
then don't blame me for doing things old-school style.

69
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,590
People can't have the things that I can't have.

70
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,920
Zhui, are you okay?

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,480
Run.

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,430
You're so heavy. I can't carry you.

73
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,490
Leave by yourself. Hurry!

74
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,310
You want to escape? Could it be that simple?

75
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,320
But if you could obediently hand over the Some Spirit Some Soul,

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,300
I could spare your friend's life.

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,900
What Some Spirit Some Soul? I don't understand what you're talking about!

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,780
You don't understand?

79
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,910
Do you really have to be punished before you tell me?

80
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,380
Zhui!

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,860
I already told you that I really don't understand what you're talking about!

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,100
Since you're so persistent, I'll just have to end his life first.

83
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,550
Who is it?

84
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,960
Me, A Tian Wang.

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,740
Zhui!

86
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,330
I used to think that that piece of trash was already ugly enough.

87
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,830
Who would have thought that you're even uglier than he is?

88
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,210
Let's be fair, okay?

89
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,410
We're clearly identical twins, but you could tell who looks uglier and who doesn't?

90
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,510
If I, A Tian Wang, didn't have that ability, how would I have survived as a mafia leader for so long?

91
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,330
We meet again, little friend Ming Wang.

92
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,110
The Ri Yin Wang whom I met was you, right?

93
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,710
Bingo.

94
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,850
Did you know that

95
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,730
your father wasn't really as strong as people said he was?

96
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,510
- Because I easily killed him!<br>- You!

97
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,150
You liar! If you hadn't used tricks back then,

98
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,960
you wouldn't even have been able to touch You Wang.

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,910
So what if I used tricks?

100
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,620
The winner is the king, and the loser is the servant. I was the one who survived.

101
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,730
Who cares if you're the king or the servant?

102
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,710
I just want to ask you why you had to kill Xiao Yang.

103
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh, her.

104
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,670
My daughter returned Xiao Yang to you, didn't she?

105
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,850
Don't you know what you're talking about?

106
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,490
Because of you, Xiao Yang will never be able to come back!

107
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,290
- Dad! <br>- Boss!

108
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,650
That's enough.

109
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,840
Since things turned out like this today,

110
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,480
I'm bored. I'll come back

111
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,700

It's okay. His chi is just temporarily locked up.

We'll just give him an "A Tian Wang's Pill for Replenishing Chi",

and he'll be as good as new by tomorrow.

119
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,890

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,810
I'm fine,

as long as this guy doesn't come bother me again.

125
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,710
My uncle must have captured my dad. What do I do?

126
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,800
Even if he's been taken by Ri Yue Wang,

127
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't think he'll do anything to Ri Yin Wang yet.

128
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,780
Gou Zhui, did you say anything to Xiao Xiong before he left?

129
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,920
I just told him to pay more attention to your boss, Gabriel.

130
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,570
So the reason why we can't be in contact with Xiao Xiong is Gabriel?

131
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,970
Aren't you curious of who Gabriel really is?

132
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,430
How could he fulfill your wishes? Is he really a good person?

133
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,130
If he is a good guy, then why did he have to make contracts with you,

134
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,680
and make you guys risk your lives to collect seeds?

135
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,520
What are you trying to say?

136
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,400
If my guess is correct, then Gabriel is Ri Yue Wang.

137
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,530
So my uncle didn't only capture my dad,

138
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,410
but he also took Classmate Xiong Ya?

139
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,990
What exactly does he want?

140
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,970
No matter what it is, it can't be good.

141
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,630
If that's how it is, we have to hurry.

142
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,850
We have to find Ri Yue Wang's secret base.

143
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,390
But how will we find such a mysterious person?

144
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,590
We need everybody's help to try and find him.

145

The more people we have helping, the stronger we'll be.

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,980
For the sake of world peace,

156
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,500
would I have to sacrifice my love? Oh, my god!

157
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,570
Ding Dang! What are you screaming about?

158
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,410
- Actually, I do have a way to find Teacher Ji An. <br>- Really?

159
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,470
Really?

160
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,870
Yeah, because

161
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,110
I put Teacher Ji An under a black magic spell of love, <br><i>[Black Magic of Love?]</i>

162
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,630
- so whenever I call him, no matter where he is, <br>- Black magic?

163
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,870
he'll immediately come back to my side.

164
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,050
My god, you put a black magic spell on Teacher Ji An?

165
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,410
That's so evil.

166
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,770
Hey, Zhui. Do people from Thai all know how to use black magic?

167
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,200
People from Thai really do know how to do these useless things, don't they?

168
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,080
Hey, it's not "black magic".

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,950
Listen clearly. It's "delivered like this", <br><i>[Delivered Like This: correct]</i>

170
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,710
not "black magic". ("Delivered like this" and "black magic" sound alike)

171
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,710
They sound the same when you say them.

172
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,350
Aiya, let's not worry about what they sound like.

173
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,580
Ding Dang, what are you worried about? Would there be a problem?

174
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,860
There is a big problem.

175
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,380
Forced love is prone to failure.

176
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,360
Once I use the Love is Delivered Like This,

177
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,960
and force Teacher Ji An to come back,

178
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,740
Teacher Ji An will always hate me,

179
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,430
and he'll never like me back.

180
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,390
Ding Dang, even if you used the Love is Delivered Like This,

181
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,670
it's not like Teacher Ji An will like you.

182
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,330
Hey, Xiao Yan! How could you say that?

183
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,890
You completely murdered my fragile, female heart, understand?

184
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,410
Ding Dang, we have to do things for the greater good.

185
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,870
That's right. For world peace, there must be some sacrifice.

186
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,770
(Thai) You guys said it yourselves.

187
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,700
(Thai) You have to do it, okay? Don't try to escape.

188
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,660
You guys said it yourselves, okay?

189
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,740
Come! Come! Come!

190
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,720
Hurry up. Come here!

191
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,440
Come!

192
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,630
Whoa, I don't want to.

193
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,630
Hey, didn't you just say that it was for the greater good?

194
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,720
I-- I'm dropping out of K.O. Bad Girls.

195
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,660
Hey, for world peace, you have to make sacrifices.

196
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,020
I promised my brother that I would go visit my dad.

197
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,840
Hey, what time is it right now?

198
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,040
It's far from the end of school.

199
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,570
O-Okay.

200
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,710
That's how it's settled, then.

201
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,070
Let's start.

202
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,020
Music!

203
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,270

209
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,970
Hey, I think it's working.

210
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,750
Dropping from the sky? That's so cool.

211
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,490
What kind of inexperienced person called me here?

212
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,030
Why was the location of the call in midair?

213
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,150
- Teacher Ji An! <br>- Hey!

214
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,560
Please let him be.

215
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,000
Also, please don't tell him

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,050
that you called him here, okay?

217
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,790
What? My first love hasn't even started and it's about to end.

218
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,990
- Teacher Ji An! <br>- No!

219
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,290
- Teacher Ji An! <br>- Calm down!

220
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,350
Love is Delivered Like This.

221
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,030
It's too tragic.

222
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,820
Why is it you again? You still dare to come?

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,930
- What are you doing? <br> - Forgive me.

224
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,880
W-What are you doing?

225
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,460
Let me go! What do you really want?

226
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,150
<i>Let me go! What do you want? Let go! Let go!</i>

227
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,750
What are you doing? I'm going to call the police!

228
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,820
Sister! What happened?

229
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,920
Hu Po?

230
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Xiang Ning, call the police right now!

231
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,170
Why are you doing this?

232
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,970
It's not what you think it is. Let me explain.

233
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,480
You guys...

234
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,060
I'm sorry. I surrender.

235
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,810
You're laughing?

236
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,770
No, it's because you two are really so similar.

237
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,930
Why are you at my house?

238
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,670
Isn't bullying me enough? Now you want to bully my sister, too.

239
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,940
Xiang Qing, I'm really sorry.

240
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,360
I had to use you to let Xiang Ning come out.

241
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,010
If you're still mad, let me explain myself.

242
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,120
I'll let you beat me up later, okay?

243
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,530
Xiang Ning,

244
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,250
you finally came outside.

245
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,150
Do you how much trouble you caused me these few days?

246
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,500
Sister, I'm sorry.

247
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm sorry...

248
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,190
You dummy!

249
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,490
Do you know how worried I was about you?

250
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,970
Sister, I'm sorry.

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,880
Stop!

255
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,330
They are my prey.

256
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,910
You're a Pure-Blooded Day-Walker, right?

257
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,830
I don't care what you do outside,

258
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,750
but this is school, which is also my territory.

259
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,130
I won't allow you to hurt my students!

260
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,750
Why can't I? They only know to bully weaker people.

261
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,470
What's the point of their existence?

262
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,420
You purposely made them bully you

263
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,440
to arose hatred form them.

264
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,190
Stop acting like a hero.

265
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,010
Unless you want a share, too?

266
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,450
It's fine. I can share some.

267
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,470
I already told you to stop!

268
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,960
You're a high-ranked Pure-Blooded Day-Walker? Why are you helping these humans?

269
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,600
Because they are my students.

270
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,130
Stop testing my patience.

271
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,230
You're the one who's testing my patience!

272
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,640
Based on your skills,

273
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,970
normal humans wouldn't be able to hurt you like this.

274
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,490
Who created these scars on you?

Don't let me see this happening again. Next time,

I wonder what's going on outside.

281

This should be the only exit to this cell,

282
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,890
but what should we do to release Ri Yue Wang's lock?

283
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,530
That's right. What can we do

284
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,310
to release that cloud and that fog?

285
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,770
Impossible.

286
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,590

287
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,610
Shao Hui! (Name of a song)

293
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,490
That's how simple it is?

294
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,190
I don't even know what goes on inside Ri Yue Wang's brain.

295
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,530
Let's hurry and leave this place.

296
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,890
But-- This--

297
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,390
See? See?

298
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,550
I told you. I don't even know what goes on inside his brain. Boring!

299
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,250
Since Ri Yue Wang locked us up,

300
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,050
then this lock could only be opened by him,

301
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,170
but there's no lock on here. Could it be voice recognition?

302
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,550
Impossible. That's too old-schooled.

303
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,600
I don't think that Ri Yue Wang would be so uncreative.

304
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,550
How would we know if we haven't tried?

305
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,300
Since Ri Yue Wang has been unconscious for fifty years, he still might be living in the past.

You two are twins. You can try to imitate his voice.

I don't want to.

308
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,910
That's dumb.

309
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,650
It's okay. There's only us two in here.

310
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,100
No one will laugh at you.

311

I--

313
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,470
Fine,

314
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,570
I'll try it, but if it doesn't work or if I don't sound like him,

315
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,850
don't ask me to do it again, okay?

316
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,670
I'm going to start now.

317
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,550
I say--

318
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,910
I say,

319
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,370
open the door.

320
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,150
See? It doesn't work.

321
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,430
Wait,

322
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,730
could it be another one of Ri Yue Wang's tricks?

323
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,430
Let's try it.

324
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,790
- You go. <br>- Me?

325
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,850
Please.

326
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,760
Classmate Xiong Ya, wait for me.

327
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,470
<i>[Mystery Forest]</i>

328
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:07,910
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Minions Of The Devils Team @ Viki</i>

329
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,390
Aiya.

330
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,090
Principal, there's no road there.

331
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,130
What--

332
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,370
What kind of crooked road is this?

333
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,330
Human beings are supposed to face forward and go straight ahead.

334
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,050
Listen to me.

335
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,130
As long as we find the north star, we'll be able to leave this forest by following it.

336
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,890
Believe me.

337
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,090
Principal, I think we've already been there.

338
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,280
Classmate Xiong Ya, haven't you noticed that

339
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,730
we're lost in this forest?

340
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,050
Principal, we're lost in here because

341
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,510
you keep insisting on going in straight lines and turning at right angles.

342
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,270
That's not how it is. Let me tell you,

343
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,070
this is definitely a maze created by my brother,

344
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,850
so that we'll never be able to leave this forest.

345
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,310
Principal, I really think that if we followed the mountain path,

346
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,110
we'll be able to leave this forest.

347
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,110
Is that so?

348
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,870
Definitely.

349
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,850
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,400
I didn't know that that's how things were. I misunderstood you for so long.

351
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,360
No, I'm at fault, too.

352
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,990
If I had explained myself to you back then, you wouldn't have had to bear so much pain,

353
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,810
but why did you have to lie to me?

354
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,090
If I hadn't thought that you were dead, I would have found you earlier.

355
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,330
Because nobody liked that ugly Xiang Ning.

356
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,470
I thought that as long as I turn pretty,

357
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,650
I'll be able to hide that ugly Xiang Ning.

358
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:13,050
That way, people will like me, but turns out,

359
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,850
I still couldn't deceive you.

360
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,270
No, I was clearly tricked by you many times,

361
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,410
but no matter what you turn into next time,

362
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,040
I'll always be able to recognize you.

363
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,050
Oh.

364
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,230
You randomly disappeared for so long.

365
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,110
I wish that other than playing, you didn't forget to accomplish some things.

366
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,370
Don't mix me with people like you, who play around while accomplishing missions.

367
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,590
Of course I left to take care of business.

368
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,570
Get back on topic. Tell us your plan.

369
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,710
There's a solution, but we'll need some help.

370
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,490
Right now, we could only wait.

371
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,180
Charlie Wang!

372
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,540
I finally found you.

373
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,720
What do you want?

374
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,350
I need to figure out something first.

375
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,650
What is it? Explain yourself.

376
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,120
There's no time. Come with me!

377
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,780
Hey! Hey!

378
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,350
<i>But this isn't fair at all.</i>

379
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,880
<i>How come I, who wanted to die could live, but Xiang Ming, who wanted to live had to die?</i>

380
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,960
<i>Is Brother Xiang Ming's friend still at this hospital?</i>

381
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,190
<i>Are you talking about Jack? She's already discharged from the hospital.</i>

382
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:55,130
<i>The person whom Brother Xiang Ming said would be very, very sad for him</i>

383
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,510
<i>is actually Jack.</i>

384
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,180
<i>What in the world?</i>

385
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,090
Allie! What are you doing? Don't do anything stupid!

386
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,170
Please.

387
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,510
Don't worry, I wasn't going to jump.

388
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,410
I promised Brother Xiang Ming

389
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,530
that I wouldn't do dumb and stupid things anymore.

390
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,890
Xiang Ming? Are you talking about Xiang Ming?

391
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,130
Are you saying that

392
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,430
because Jack was able to live, Xiang Ming had to die?

393
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,730
How is that possible?

394
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,670
If it was through the Concluding Contract, then it's possible.

395
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,290
That explains why Jack would rather die

396
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,230
than stay in the K.O. Bad Girls.

397
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,010
How could he? How could Ri Yue Wang do that?

398
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,310
He's a devil!

399
00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:00,720
Xiao Feng, if he's the devil,

400
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
then what does that make the ones who made the Concluding Contract with him?

401
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,880
Allie!

402
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,900
How could you disappear without a trace?

403
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,180
Don't do that again, okay?

404
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,290
I'm sorry. I made you guys worry.

405
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,510
You'd better not scare us like this again, understand?

406
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,970
That's right. Who cares about that dumb contract? Who cares if it gets canceled?

407
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,750
I believe that as long as we're all together, with our combined willpower,

408
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,370
we'll be able to solve every problem.

409
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,420
That's right, Allie. Even if you can't walk again,

410
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,940
I'll carry you to and from school, right?

411
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,330
My legs are really sore. Do you want to carry me first?

412
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,710
- Come on. <br>- Try it. See if she can do it.

413
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,640
<i>You have to remember that in this world,</i>

414
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,920
<i>somebody would be upset because of the dumb and wrong choices you've made.</i>

415
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,550
- Wait! Wait! Carry Allie first! <br><i>- Brother Xiang Ming,</i>

416
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,950
<i>I think I've found that person,</i>

417
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,170
<i>and there's more than one.</i>

418
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,140
<i>And she went like this!</i>

419
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,490
<i>[Still in the forest~]</i>

420
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,680
Seriously.

421
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,230
I, Ri Yin Wang, at this age,

422
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,990
have always fought against my urge to suck human blood,

423
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,350
but turns out, I'm being sucked of blood from mosquito right now.

424
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,640
I didn't think that my healing abilities would be used for this, either.

425
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,280
Oh.

426
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,450
Who would have known that that would work? Thank you.

427
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,570
What should we do? If we keep walking around, it'll turn nighttime.

428
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,870
Classmate Xiong Ya, come behind me.

429
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,470
I sense something unusual.

430
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,350
That's weird. This feeling

431
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,690
feels like deja vu.

432
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:47,420
♫<i> I want more action, action. I want less complaints, complaints. Then I want you to change, change for us, for we are devils.</i>

433
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,560
An, have you been well these days?

434
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,460
Okay,

435
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,650
I, A Tian Wang, take responsibility of my actions.

436
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,190
I apologize to you. It was all my fault.

437
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,620
I shouldn't have blamed you for everything.

438
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,220
What's worse, I always called you a piece of trash,

439
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,650
but I'm so used to calling you trash,

440
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,490
so it's kind of hard to change.

441
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,420
Also, I was ignorant when I was young,

442
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,930
but lately, after a lot of investigation,

443
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:38,420
I figured out that turns out,

444
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,050
you have a twin brother.

445
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,390
The bad things that I thought you did before were actually all done by him,

446
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:52,350
so I apologize to you.

447
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,490
That's right. You were wrong. You were very wrong.

448
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,960
Growing up, I always thought that you were my best friend whom I could trust,

449
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,550
but how do you treat me? Huh? You--

450
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,140
You covered me with a bag!

451
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,420
Hey, l-listen to me explain myself.

452
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,310
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

453
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,220
You know about your OCD. You can't walk in those crooked paths on the mountains. That's why I had to--

454
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,200
- Stop! <br>- I--

455
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,940
That's not the point, my friend. Wait, you--

456
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,880
Are you even my friend? Do you know

457
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,500
how dirty that bag was?

458
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,340
Don't you know that the germs on that bag could take my life?

459
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,700
You-- You-- Be fair, okay?

460
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,750
I did that to save you!

461
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,530
My god, there are hundreds of ways to save people.

462
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,540
As a mafia leader, couldn't you at least have bought a new bag?

463
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,600
You-- You-- That's murder, okay? You cheapo.

464
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,280
I should have just left you on the mountains to feed mosquitoes! Why did I rescue you?

465
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,240
You shouldn't have saved me, then. Why did you rescue me?

466
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,630
Don't rescue me. Don't rescue me. Don't rescue me.

467
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,560
I said it three times because it's very important.

468
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,900
Would this work, Brother Wei Yi? Are you sure?

469
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,190
No matter what, this is our only solution so far.

470
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm looking forward to it, since...

471
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,830
Da Wei Wang, what happened?

472
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,570
I don't know. I just suddenly

473
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,820
feel like throwing up.

474
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,180
Hey, shouldn't you go to the hospital for a checkup?

475
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,750
Is it morning sickness? Who's baby is it?

476
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,320
Why are you guys looking at me like that?

477
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,720
Hey!

478
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,090
As a man, you should have been responsible.

479
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,780
Why are you trying to act cool? Explain yourself!

480
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,310
Also, you! Why didn't you help me explain?

481
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,580
Why were you looking at me along with them?

482
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,700
Da Wei, my son!

483
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,800
Who are you?

484
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,930
I'm your dad.

485
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,750
Don't try to trick me again. I won't be tricked!

486
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,030
You're a fake!

487
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,080
What could I do to make you believe me?

488
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,780
How about this, you name it and I'll cooperate.

489
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,120
Okay. If you're Uncle, no matter how well you understand my dad,

490
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,880
you wouldn't understand me, so

491
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm going to ask you a few questions. If you get them all right,

492
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,220
then you're my dad.

493
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,790
No problem. Let's go.

494
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,030
Number one, what's my record of the highest number of hamburgers that I've eaten in one sitting?

495
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,310
<i>[Time's up]</i><br>It depends on how much money you have and how many you could buy.

496
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,660
Number two, do I eat the strawberry on strawberry cakes

497
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,280
first or last?

498
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,840
Y-You stuff everything in. If you stuff it in, there's no order.

499
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,850
<i>[Time's up]</i><br>Y-You stuff everything in. If you stuff it in, there's no order.

500
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,160
Number three, do I add sugar in my millet congee?

501
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,600
Millet congee... You don't like millet congee. You said that it's not filling.

502
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,970
<i>[Time's up]</i><br>Millet congee... You don't like millet congee. You said that it's not filling.

503
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:22,010
- Dad. Dad! <br> - It's me, my son!

504
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
<i>[It's really my dad]</i>

505
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,850
<i>[It's really my dad]</i><br>What is this?

506
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,240
How about it? Dad understands you the best, don't I?

507
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,170
I got all the questions right, didn't I?

508
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,880
No,

509
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,090
dad, you didn't get any of them right. You had 0 points.

510
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,440
How could I have 0 points? I graduated as a student of the Ivy League.

511
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,340
But dad, your habit of having to answer each question within three seconds

512
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,240
hasn't changed at all.

513
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,500
It's really my dad.

514
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,770
Dad,

515
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,820
good thing you're okay, or else... I have to throw up.

516
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,110
You child... Throw up?

517
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,080
Da Wei, what's wrong?

518
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,280
I don't know, either. I keep having to throw up these days.

519
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,260
Have you been eating the vitamins that I gave you?

520
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:21,100
Yeah, but you haven't been here these days, so I ran out and I didn't know where to go buy more.

521
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:31,240
<i>Oh, no. The Some Spirit Some Soul can't be suppressed any longer.</i>

522
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,550
Dad, what are you doing?

523
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,560
Oh, it's nothing.

524
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,580
Don't worry, I'll go buy some more vitamins for you.

525
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,530
You'll get better after you've replenish your nutrients.

526
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,600
I found it, didn't I?

527
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,370
Dad, is that why you purposely let Ri Yin Wang escape?

528
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:09,360
My dear brother, you want to fight with me? You're still lacking too much.

529
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,310
The smoke has already risen.

530
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,100
Do you know what to do now?

531
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,560
Yes, I won't disappoint you.

532
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:29,400
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Minions of the Devils Team @ Viki </i>

533
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,380
You're really gone.

534
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,210
I can't sense you anymore.

535
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,060
I'm sorry.

536
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,470
I couldn't protect you.

537
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,090
Xiao Xiong.

538
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,100
We heard that you and Principal were captured by the devil.

539
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,610
Good thing you're okay.

540
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm sorry. I made you guys worry.

541
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,890
Aiyo, it's okay. We're glad you're back.

542
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,180
Let's go eat and celebrate now.

543
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,730
Yay!

544
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,470
Yeah, it's about time we celebrate. We're all back together.

545
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,080
K.O. Bad Girls, I have something to tell you guys.

546
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,780
Xiao Xiong, so many things happened lately.

547
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,100
We have a lot of things to tell you, too.

548
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,310
Let me go first.

549
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,030
K.O. Bad Girls,

550
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,590
I'm going to give you guys one last command.

551
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,050
Why is it the last one?

552
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,300
The K.O. Bad Girls,

553
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,450
from this moment onward,

554
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,560
will disband.

555
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,320
What?

556
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,190
Disband?

557
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,170
Xiao Xiong, why are you saying that?

558
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,900
Because I made the Concluding Contract with a demon.

559
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,730
I caused you guys to become used by demons.

560
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,660
Our so-called justice

561
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,450
was actually just helping the evil.

562
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,040
Xiao Xiong, we've already known that.

563
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,920
Even if that were true, we don't have to disband.

564
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,080
Also, we need to unite the most right now to defeat Ri Yue Wang.

565
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,550
I won't let you guys risk your lives for me again.

566
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,510
I brought all this pain unto you guys.

567
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,920
I'll bring everything back to its original position.

568
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,470
Please accept my last act of selfishness.

569
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,470
I'm sorry. I want you guys to return to the peaceful lives that once belonged to you,

570
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,920
away from the demons that Gabriel and I brought to you.

571
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,100
Welcome back.

572
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,020
Please let the K.O. Bad Girls return to their original, peaceful lives.

573
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,540
What did Xiao Xiong mean by that?

574
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,780
Why did he say that he could promise

575
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,070
to return our original lives to us?

576
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,250
Do you not want to return to your original life, then?

577
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,240
It's you.

578
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,060
I'm here to return your shoes.

579
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,150
I already told you that you could keep those shoes.

580
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,460
I won't use them.

581
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,890
You'll use it very soon.

582
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,000
Hey, wait.

583
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,960
Name.

584
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,790
I still don't know your name.

585
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,760
Why do you want to know my name?

586
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,980
Aren't we friends?

587
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,080
Isn't it very weird for friends not to know each others' names?

588
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,680
I'm Allie. What's your name?

589
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,760
Are we friends?

590
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,780
Of course.

591
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,990

592
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,020
<i>hearing that somebody wants to be my friend.</i>

593
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,730
My name is Tu Mi. Tu Mi as in the blackberry roses.

594
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,070
It represents that all good things end when they reach me.

595
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,200
You can't trick me.

596
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,910
Don't judge me by what I'm like right now. I actually skipped a lot of grades.

597
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,340
Blackberry roses are flowers grown in heaven.

598
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,410
The people who have seen these flowers are removed of all evils,

599
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,280
just like the feeling that you give off.

600
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,630
Removed of all evils?

601
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,480
How is that possible?

602
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,080
Hey, where are you going? I wasn't done talking!

603
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,050
My legs...

604
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,040
Why don't they hurt at all?
