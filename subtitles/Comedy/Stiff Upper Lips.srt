1
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,023
SEDIM. Can I help you?

2
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:11,636
Hold on, I'll see.

3
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:17,310
It's Andreux from Stelmex.

4
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,836
Sorry?

5
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:23,314
I didn't quite hear.
could you say that again?

6
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,412
Just a moment.

7
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,356
SEDIM. Can I help you?

8
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:36,361
He's just taken a call.
Shall I ask him to call you back?

9
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,143
I'll put you through.

10
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:18,328
Bastards!

11
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,628
Yes, sir.
I'll be right in.

12
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,857
Feeling better?

13
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:56,299
What's the matter? Are you ill?

14
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,062
Sorry, sir.

15
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:05,804
-I don't know what came over me.
-Why not take a few days off?

16
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,509
-Not now.
-Not now?

17
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,315
You prefer when you're rested?

18
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,354
I have so much paperwork,
the Chesnais site about to start....

19
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:19,820
could you use some help?

20
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:27,334
help?
Why, is there anything wrong?

21
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:31,797
No, everything's fine.

22
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,603
I'm suggesting we hire someone.

23
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:43,444
-To replace me?
-Not replace you. help you.

24
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:47,550
An extra person.
An assistant, if you like.

25
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,052
Trainees are cheap.
We'd even save on messengers.

26
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:58,096
-What kind of work?
-Secretarial.

27
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:03,932
-To help me. I'm a secretary.
-Secretarial assistant.

28
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,968
-Preferably male.
-Sorry?

29
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:14,007
-A man would be best.
-We can't do that.

30
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,949
The Employment Office
can't specify gender.

31
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:21,084
-Discrimination is against the law.
-I see.

32
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,254
What age?

33
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,992
25 to 30.

34
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:32,926
Make that 25.

35
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,073
-What else?
-He should be friendly...

36
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,838
...not too tall, nice hands.

37
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:47,244
You mean well-groomed?

38
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,280
Yes. Well-groomed.

39
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,333
It doesn't work. Oh. Yes.

40
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:46,743
Sorry! Had a rush job
blow-drying a real cow.

41
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,444
There's a jar
and a bottle in the bag.

42
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:57,913
If she won't eat, just give her
the bottle. Okay?

43
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,784
Bye.

44
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:04,027
-You know him?
-No, why? Because he's deaf?

45
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:08,294
-He said hi. Something bugging you?
-No, I'm okay.

46
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,629
-What are you doing tonight?
-GirIs' night out.

47
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,433
With Sophie and Arielle, you know?

48
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,200
-Who?
-Sophie and Arielle.

49
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,869
I don't know them.

50
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:22,504
Then Sophie has a date at a salsa
club.
I may tag along.

51
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:24,945
Are things okay
with Jean-Francois?

52
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,487
He has work problems but we don't
talk.

53
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:30,454
For all I care.

54
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:33,921
I feel dead.
Six months without sex.

55
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,129
I can't stand him touching me.
Not that he tries.

56
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:46,602
But it bugs me, just knowing
he's thinking about it.

57
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,538
Living together is complicated.

58
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:52,738
Too hot?

59
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:37,612
Paula.
Little sweetie pie.

60
00:10:57,881 --> 00:11:01,213
-Carla, there's a messenger for you.
-I'm coming.

61
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,715
Excuse me.

62
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,321
SEDIM, can I help you?

63
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:14,494
Mr. Quentin's out.
Can I take a message?

64
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:20,091
I know all about it.
Mr. Douze's new zoning proposal.

65
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,938
Yes, Mr. Millet's lawyer.

66
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,811
I'll hold.
Envelope.

67
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:35,383
I'll find out
and call you this afternoon.

68
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:38,347
Slip.

69
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:41,650
-What slip?
-To sign.

70
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,261
I've got nothing to sign.

71
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,125
-What?
-I've got no slip.

72
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,327
-Who sent you?
-The Employment Office.

73
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,557
I'm Paul Angeli.

74
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:55,332
-For the training job.
-I see.

75
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:57,832
-I'm still here.
-Wrong place?

76
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,134
No, right place.

77
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:01,938
Okay, thanks. Goodbye.

78
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:05,382
I asked them to call
before sending somebody.

79
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,148
They never told me.
Do I sign something?

80
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,414
No, my mistake.
Don't worry about it.

81
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,890
-Let's go to a cafe.
-No problem.

82
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,154
So....

83
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:22,664
-You can type?
-Sure.

84
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:28,430
-And use a computer?
-Yeah.

85
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,209
-Make photocopies?
-No sweat. I've done loads.

86
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:40,809
Have you worked with spreadsheets?

87
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,243
Spreadsheets....

88
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:46,791
-For calculations.
-Sure, loads of spreadsheets.

89
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,292
For calculations, I'm....
I'm good.

90
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:56,235
-What programs?
-Funny, I can't remember.

91
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:58,200
The programs....

92
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:03,466
The usual programs.

93
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:06,135
German ones, maybe?

94
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:07,904
You haven't worked
for two years.

95
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,047
-Why not?
-Why not? I was in Fleury.

96
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:21,720
Fleury?

97
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:29,524
I was in Fleury. Doing time.

98
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,933
-What kind of time?
-Time Magazine.

99
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,068
I was in jail!
Are you shitting me?

100
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:48,580
-You were in prison?
-The Employment Office didn't tell
you?

101
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:56,327
-Okay, I get it.
-I just....

102
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:02,235
You know how parole works?

103
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,969
I have to see you every week
for six months.

104
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:12,102
You miss one time,
you better have a good excuse.

105
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:16,917
You miss twice, forget about excuses,
you're back inside.

106
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:18,246
That clear?

107
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:25,623
-Yeah.
-You have anything to say?

108
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,891
-Like what?
-I don't know.

109
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,928
About yourself. Got any plans?

110
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,162
No.

111
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,505
The office opens at 8:30.
I normally get here at 8.

112
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,614
Hello, Mrs. Renee.

113
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,577
First thing,
go around the offices.

114
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:51,581
-Outgoing mail, you bring to me.
-Outgoing male, me?

115
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:54,554
Outgoing letters to put in the mail.

116
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:59,962
Check the stocks of paper,
toner level and plotter inks.

117
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:02,257
Bring all incoming faxes to me.

118
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,363
Stationery is here.

119
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:10,270
Equipment supplies are here.
Ink, paper, et cetera.

120
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,735
Got that
or should I write it down?

121
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,070
No problem.

122
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:25,145
Another thing: If anyone asks you
to do anything, say yes.

123
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,786
Even if you don't know how,
say yes.

124
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,789
Ask me and I'll show you.

125
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,055
Mr. Morel?

126
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,493
This is Paul Angeli,
our new trainee.

127
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,638
-He was at Rank Xerox.
-Glad to meet you.

128
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,840
-My coffee coming?
-It's on your desk.

129
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,703
-Why did you say that?
-What would you rather I said?

130
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,809
You'll have to wear a tie.

131
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,585
-Where did you get the clothes?
-At the hostel.

132
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,186
Shoes are a bit big....

133
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,418
-What's your size?
-Eleven.

134
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,050
I'll see if I have some.

135
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,130
-You know how to type?
-No.

136
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:10,860
-How about faxes, et cetera?
-I don't know either.

137
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,705
-Did you tell them?
-Yeah.

138
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,134
And they still hired you?

139
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,102
What's so funny?

140
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:25,078
You want me to take a shitty job...

141
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,343
...like sweeping out a chicken
factory?

142
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,238
Get the blue folders and films.

143
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,315
We're low on paper.
Get a new pack ready.

144
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,808
Give me that.

145
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:18,004
-Don't you think that'll do?
-I'm hungry!

146
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:28,044
Can I ask you something?
Why were you in prison?

147
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:36,584
-Sorry, it's silly of me....
-No, it's okay.

148
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,796
-You don't have to answer.
-I'll answer.

149
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:46,660
I went down for aggravated robbery
and receiving.

150
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,361
-What kind of robbery?
-Aggravated and receiving.

151
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:55,875
I did banks, cars,
stickups, anything.

152
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:03,606
Nothing too heavy.
Nobody got killed.

153
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:08,416
What's up?
Did I say something wrong?

154
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,388
They're making fun of me.

155
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,460
-How do you know?
-I lip-read.

156
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,126
I read people's lips.

157
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,901
-You kidding me?
-You asked, I answered.

158
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:28,101
-You mean you're deaf?
-What are these? Earrings?

159
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,635
-Not just kind of deaf?
-Yes, well....

160
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:36,276
I was deaf.
Now I'm kind of deaf.

161
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:40,651
-Deaf, like deaf?
-Deaf! Can we drop it now?

162
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:46,525
Over there, for example.
What are they saying?

163
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:56,867
In a nutshell:

164
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,473
Keller is saying
I've done well for myself.

165
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,910
A dog like me is lucky
to get a guy like you.

166
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:18,290
Maybe I'm a good number
and they've been missing out.

167
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,957
He said something else,
but it's obvious.

168
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:28,465
Do they know you...?

169
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:34,039
Have you eaten your fill?
Can we go?

170
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:48,956
-What are they fighting about?
-The work's held up by a supplier.

171
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:51,186
Lehaleur, the mayor's son-in-law.

172
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:55,291
To get a building permit
you have to use his company.

173
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:59,197
Morel did,
but Lehaleur wants more money.

174
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,266
Off the books?

175
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:05,338
-Is that straight?
-Is it what?

176
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:07,509
Straight business practice?

177
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,745
-I only know his name is Richard.
-Richard.

178
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:16,781
The guy from the salsa club?

179
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,787
That's all I know.
It's always him that calls me.

180
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:25,597
We meet in clubs
or go straight to hotels...

181
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,665
...and we fuck.

182
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,470
I've never known anything like it.

183
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:32,927
It's so....

184
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:37,568
I want to end it, but two days
without him, I go nuts!

185
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:47,884
I'd never imagined it.

186
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:50,023
-What?
-Sex!

187
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,053
Like that.
Being a mindless piece of meat.

188
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:57,458
Great.

189
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,127
You're already here?

190
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:17,102
-What are you doing here?
-Just checking....

191
00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:06,353
-Since when?
-What?

192
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,930
Sleeping in the closet.
Since when?

193
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:13,297
-I don't know.
-How can you not know?

194
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:16,205
Since the beginning.

195
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:20,002
-Ever since you joined the company?
-Yeah.

196
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:23,602
I don't understand.
Aren't you in a hostel?

197
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:27,282
I'm locked out after 9.
It's like jail.

198
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:29,978
-I'm not going back.
-Why didn't you tell me?

199
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:35,088
Don't pitch a fit.
I don't give a shit where I sleep.

200
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:38,991
Don't you realise?
If you're caught, who pays? Me!

201
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,462
You'll be fired
but I'm in trouble!

202
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:42,599
Okay, sorry.

203
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:48,063
-Where did you wash?
-Here.

204
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,733
You're insane.

205
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:00,450
There's a phone.
You can put it in your name.

206
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,848
Put your name on the mailbox too.

207
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:05,882
This is it.

208
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:19,296
It's nice. Clean, light.
It still smells like cement.

209
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:21,194
Do you like it?

210
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,740
You're sure I can stay?

211
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:28,238
Until the building work's done.

212
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,006
-How long's that?
-The work?

213
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:33,141
They say five or six months.

214
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:38,624
Is that all you've got?

215
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:41,424
Here's a big closet.

216
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:48,625
These are for you.

217
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,437
And take this too.

218
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:56,803
-What is it?
-An advance on your pay.

219
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:05,413
Weekends may be noisy.
They work around the clock.

220
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:06,918
No water yet.

221
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,861
Are you pleased?

222
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:33,646
What's the matter?

223
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:57,667
Fuck!

224
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,565
Isn't that what you want?

225
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,913
What are you after?
Apartment, job, money....

226
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:09,343
What do you want?
I don't get it.

227
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,679
Wait, damn it!

228
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:33,409
The dampness and cracks
are due to a sublayer of clay.

229
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,902
The dampness and cracks
are due to a sublayer of clay.

230
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,945
-Did Guibert know?
-I've no idea.

231
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:42,346
-If so, he's not saying.
-Do we inform the client?

232
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:46,079
That they'll need galoshes
to use their parking lot?

233
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,347
Carla? Where's Le Henry?

234
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:52,918
Stuck in Grenoble. His meeting
with the zoning office was delayed.

235
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:54,120
He'll call you.

236
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:57,164
Keller, where's the Flerets job at?

237
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:59,996
All wrapped up, almost.

238
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,465
I should have
the cadastral survey tomorrow.

239
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:06,466
-Let's hear it.
-I fixed everything...

240
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:10,204
...including one last snag
about the alignment.

241
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,944
-May I speak to you, Mr. Keller?
-Sure.

242
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:22,190
Wasn't I handling the Flerets job?

243
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:28,496
Since then, we've lost two contracts
and a third site's on hold.

244
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,568
So please,
let's each stick to our job.

245
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:35,432
What's it to you if I see
a project through for once?

246
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:40,803
I'm in sales, Carla. The name
of the game is ''commission''.

247
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,643
I work on commission.
Do I hassle you to take a pay cut?

248
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:49,442
Hi, honey.

249
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,248
Hang on a second.

250
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:55,489
You want to bitch at me?
Let's go see Morel about it.

251
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,943
Cool it!

252
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:27,585
Listen.

253
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:31,725
If you want to fire me,
I understand...

254
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,965
...but please don't say why.

255
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:41,398
Keller's a shit. I was handling
the Flerets project.

256
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:46,476
Just as I'm ready to submit it,
the creep gets it back from Morel.

257
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:49,646
For three years
I've slaved for them!

258
00:28:49,817 --> 00:28:53,810
Doing all their work,
lying to their wives!

259
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:55,285
I've had enough!

260
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,161
Can you steal the file from Keller?

261
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:13,871
-Steal the file. It's nothing to you.
-I'm not stealing.

262
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,065
-Why?
-You know why.

263
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:19,645
One false move, I'm back in jail.
Don't mess me around.

264
00:29:19,815 --> 00:29:21,145
I'm not stealing anything.

265
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:27,746
When you grabbed me yesterday,
I was scared and shocked.

266
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:32,149
But I understand, in a way.

267
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,391
You think you owe me.
You pay with what you've got.

268
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,232
You got me wrong.
I don't blame you...

269
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,672
...but it's true, you do owe me.

270
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,013
Bitch!

271
00:29:58,388 --> 00:29:59,945
You're quiet today.

272
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:02,789
Nothing to say?

273
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,598
How's the job going?

274
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,730
-You're not too lost?
-It's okay.

275
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:18,770
-You're adapting?
-Yeah, I'm....

276
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm adapting.

277
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:07,256
SEDIM, can I help you?

278
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:13,460
Hello, Mr. Keller.
I can't. He's in a meeting.

279
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:16,728
All right.

280
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,933
It's Mr. Keller. Very urgent.

281
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,232
I'll put you through.

282
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,718
You lost the file?
Are you that stupid?

283
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:47,396
Carla?

284
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,557
Is there a copy
of the Flerets file?

285
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:54,763
-I must have the original. Why?
-Take it straight to City Hall.

286
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:56,363
Yes, sir.

287
00:31:57,477 --> 00:32:00,207
Don't worry, Mr. Keller.
I'm on my way.

288
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:04,614
I've got everything.
Meet me in the bar opposite.

289
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,115
See you there.

290
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,654
-could you turn it down?
-Take your aids out.

291
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,833
Madam Mayor...

292
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:28,272
...members of the council...

293
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:33,178
...we're here to discuss
the city's call for bids...

294
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:37,373
...to develop the district
known as ''Les Flerets.''

295
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,477
What the fuck?

296
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:43,748
-Where were you?
-We missed each other.

297
00:32:43,924 --> 00:32:46,415
-I was waiting in the bar.
-We looked there.

298
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:49,686
-Where's Carla?
-Miss Behm is in there.

299
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,962
-What's she playing at?
-Relax, it's okay.

300
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:55,423
Everything's cool.

301
00:32:56,902 --> 00:33:00,933
The raised roof on the right
contains a machinery room...

302
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,544
...and the ventilating system
for the parking lot.

303
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:07,237
Our objective was to....

304
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:10,040
Fucking bitch!

305
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,977
-Get off me!
-I'll kill you!

306
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,683
Now, now.

307
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:19,651
You okay?

308
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,422
I see!

309
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,190
You won't get away with this.

310
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:30,096
Morel's going to hear all about it.

311
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,840
Trust me.

312
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:35,910
Here are all the expenses...

313
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,167
...and all--

314
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:40,975
All the commissions you've been paid
for three years.

315
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,585
Mr. Morel will be interested.
Trust me!

316
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:48,316
Let him go, Paul.
Let's go.

317
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:58,295
Keller has chosen to leave us,
so we'll have to share his files.

318
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:01,061
Quentin, you can take over
Grenoble and Drancy.

319
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:04,841
I know it's extra work,
but I see no alternative.

320
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:07,875
Miss Behm,
can you take over Les Flerets?

321
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:09,499
Yes, sir.

322
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:12,842
Now, Les Mureaux.
You saw the mayor?

323
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:17,345
It's me.

324
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:23,855
-Are you busy tonight?
-I don't know. Why?

325
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,427
Like to come out with me?

326
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,492
Depends. Is it work?

327
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,728
Coming out with me is work?

328
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:39,931
Well?

329
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,481
Carla!

330
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,782
There's a guy at the door for you.

331
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:27,114
Hi.

332
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:32,358
Act like we're friends!

333
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:46,008
-Paul, Annie, Boubou.
-Hi, Paul.

334
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,808
Want a drink?

335
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,120
So, what is this?

336
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,191
Boubou's birthday.
The girl I introduced you to.

337
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:09,431
-The short fat one?
-With the long blond hair.

338
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,832
What did you tell them?

339
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,243
That you're my friend.
Do you mind?

340
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:23,038
-What kind of friend?
-I didn't specify.

341
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:33,660
-What do we do?
-I don't know. Talk, drink.

342
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:36,223
Same as everybody.

343
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:40,794
-You don't want to dance?
-I can't dance.

344
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,036
-I can show you.
-No! Not here.

345
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:51,873
Can you take my hand?

346
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:06,550
-Do we get to smooch?
-No, this'll do fine.

347
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:08,584
This'll do.

348
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,344
-How will you get home?
-Subway.

349
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,191
-I'm taking a cab. Want a ride?
-No need.

350
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,884
See you tomorrow then.

351
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:31,112
-Jeanne!
-Hi, Pierre. You okay?

352
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:32,773
No.

353
00:38:33,484 --> 00:38:34,917
I'm worried.

354
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:37,918
Odile's not back.
Have you seen her today?

355
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:41,148
No. Not since yesterday,
at the supermarket.

356
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:46,956
Didn't she come home last night?
The kitchen light was on.

357
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:50,761
Yes, but she was out.
Forget it.

358
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:03,004
-Is Paul Angeli there?
-Yes. Who's calling?

359
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,897
-I'd like to see Paul Angeli.
-I'll tell him.

360
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:31,303
Thanks.

361
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:39,476
Paul? Somebody's here for you.

362
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:43,712
Somebody's here for you.
See you in the canteen?

363
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,029
help me, damn it!

364
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:35,299
help me.

365
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:49,418
Can't stay here.
You can't stay here.

366
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:53,152
Go in there.
Lock the door.

367
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:09,705
You owe how much?

368
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:12,408
-Seventy.
-Seventy what.

369
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,104
Seventy Gs. 70,000.

370
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:16,410
70,000 francs! That's enormous!

371
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,821
-Who's this Marchand?
-I don't know.

372
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:28,327
You owe 70,000
to a man you don't know?

373
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:56,790
I borrowed it three years ago
from a guy named Villard.

374
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:59,929
He had a nightclub.
He sold it to Marchand.

375
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:04,294
I never met Marchand. I only know
he wants his bread tomorrow.

376
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:06,958
If you don't have it,
what can he do?

377
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,461
Yeah, right.

378
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:13,800
How about you?

379
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:17,279
-Do you have any?
-What?

380
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:22,016
-Money? No, I don't have any.
-Sure?

381
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,414
I don't, I swear.

382
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:32,155
-I need the afternoon off.
-What will you do?

383
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:34,993
I don't know. Fuck!

384
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:43,095
What's that look for?
Can you help me? No. So.

385
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,251
-Isn't Paul here?
-I'll do it.

386
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:11,558
Good afternoon.
could I see Paul Angeli please?

387
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,258
-Your name?
-Mr. Masson.

388
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:22,297
-You're his parole officer?
-He told you about me?

389
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:26,708
You're Carla?
Miss Carla?

390
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:29,676
He told you about me too?

391
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,613
He didn't check in this morning.
I was worried.

392
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,815
How silly of me.
I sent him on a job.

393
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:42,728
-Does it matter?
-Not checking in, yes.

394
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:45,664
-He didn't even call.
-It's my fault.

395
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:48,802
A rush job came in last night.
We couldn't wait.

396
00:44:55,711 --> 00:45:01,239
Mr. Masson was expecting you.
I wouldn't have sent you out.

397
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:08,083
Send these faxes and print the plans
for the Drancy site.

398
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:11,191
-And this--
-May I have a word with him?

399
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,161
Of course.

400
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:17,128
Paul, just use your office.

401
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:31,740
Look, we have a deal.

402
00:45:32,615 --> 00:45:35,105
You check in at the agreed times.

403
00:45:35,284 --> 00:45:37,275
Where the hell were you?

404
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:39,283
-I went to see him.
-Who?

405
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:44,022
Marchand, the nightclub owner.
He asked for his money.

406
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,124
I said I didn't have it.
He asked if I had any ideas.

407
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:53,729
I said I just got out, I'm broke.
He said he had an idea.

408
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:57,702
I asked what.
He said:

409
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:04,269
''Work for me till you pay me off.
You'll get free food and tips. ''

410
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:07,348
-What did you say?
-What could I say?

411
00:46:09,086 --> 00:46:12,851
How will you cope?
Working here and there?

412
00:46:13,457 --> 00:46:15,789
I can't. I thought you realised.

413
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:18,792
I can't do both.
I have to leave here.

414
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:21,554
Besides, it isn't working out.

415
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:24,100
-What isn't?
-Me, here.

416
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,361
It's not my thing.

417
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:30,370
That's not true!
It's working well.

418
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,204
You're doing fine
and making progress.

419
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:36,039
I'm not.
I told you I don't give a shit.

420
00:46:37,247 --> 00:46:39,614
Don't sweat about it. I have no
choice.

421
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:43,782
-Have you told Masson?
-No.

422
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:49,619
He'd freak if he knew I was working
for a guy like Marchand.

423
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:54,656
You write him a letter...

424
00:46:55,435 --> 00:47:00,167
...tell him I wasn't up to it.
He won't be surprised.

425
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:03,765
I'll say I'm looking for another job.

426
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:07,301
On the other hand....

427
00:47:07,712 --> 00:47:11,409
If I could stay in the studio
for a while....

428
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:16,815
could I keep the keys
for a couple more weeks?

429
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:20,014
I have a meeting. Wait here.

430
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:34,636
Let him handle the alderman.
If in doubt, call my cell phone.

431
00:48:13,247 --> 00:48:16,808
Oh, it's you.
What's up?

432
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:20,516
I have to see Richard.
Lend me your place.

433
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:27,026
Don't be a pain. I told
Jean-Francois to call me here.

434
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,387
Don't do this to me!

435
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:34,557
-I'll never ask you again.
-No, you can't.

436
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:12,621
Okay, coming right up.

437
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:15,531
Paul!
Grab the bucket.

438
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:22,231
The boss wants champagne for three.

439
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:53,830
Your champagne.

440
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:01,173
Come in. Put it there.

441
00:52:16,697 --> 00:52:18,095
Do I know you?

442
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:22,827
-I don't think so.
-That'll do.

443
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,510
I have to lock up.

444
00:52:41,422 --> 00:52:44,357
-How do you get home?
-By train.

445
00:52:44,526 --> 00:52:48,019
-Want a ride?
-Sure. I'll finish this.

446
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,114
She has a big bust.

447
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:19,116
I wouldn't want to wear that.

448
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:27,429
Hi. Mind if I join you?

449
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:34,896
How are you?

450
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,647
-I was in the area and....
-Hang on.

451
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,886
Have some food.
You must be hungry.

452
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,086
-Sure?
-No, really.

453
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,355
-I have meal vouchers.
-I'm okay.

454
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,921
-So?
-So, what?

455
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,825
You tell me. How's it going?

456
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,772
I'm okay.
Hi, assholes.

457
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,308
-Still working a lot?
-More, since I'm alone.

458
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,315
You haven't hired anybody?

459
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,344
-You want to come back?
-No, thanks.

460
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,157
What are they saying?

461
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:30,628
-The usual crap.
-Yes, but what kind of crap?

462
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,663
Let me see....

463
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:40,038
Quentin's describing
his dinner last night.

464
00:54:40,245 --> 00:54:42,180
Two hundred fifty francs,
all included.

465
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:49,452
-Are you busy tonight?
-Why? Want to take me to dinner?

466
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,284
To a club.

467
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:57,257
-How about it?
-I've never been to a club.

468
00:54:59,164 --> 00:55:00,631
You'll see, it's great.

469
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:07,327
I'm sure. I've never tried.
But I don't dance.

470
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:10,204
I'm really glad you said that.

471
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:14,474
Let's skip formalities.
I think we should.

472
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:20,481
You're really nice.

473
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:24,588
Nice to ask me out, anyhow.
It's time I went home.

474
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:28,393
Unfortunately!

475
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,761
What?

476
00:55:33,098 --> 00:55:34,999
No, no....

477
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:39,702
Me? Nobody, no.
How about you?

478
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:46,237
You go with prostitutes?

479
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,318
Funny, I didn't imagine that.

480
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,947
Often?

481
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,129
Your bag, please.

482
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:06,294
Sorry I'm late. I waited 20 minutes
for the subway and got lost.

483
00:57:06,495 --> 00:57:09,828
I can't talk to customers.
Want a drink?

484
00:57:09,999 --> 00:57:12,593
I need to see your lips.
I can't hear.

485
00:57:12,768 --> 00:57:14,736
Do you want a drink?

486
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:22,602
Gin and tonic.

487
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:24,570
-What's that?
-Gin...

488
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:27,614
...and tonic. Fizzy.
You'll like it.

489
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:28,772
Can I have a straw?

490
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,019
Go outside.

491
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:14,857
Meet me at the back door,
by the garbage.

492
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:17,193
See you there.
Go now.

493
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,100
The back door.
I'll take that.

494
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:23,000
Go on.

495
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:28,270
-What are we doing?
-You'll see.

496
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:33,646
-Wait for me!
-Move your ass!

497
00:58:33,818 --> 00:58:37,152
What are you doing?
That's illegal!

498
00:58:39,158 --> 00:58:41,921
Come on!
Watch your step.

499
00:58:58,143 --> 00:59:00,235
What are you doing? Come on.

500
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,945
Come here.
Closer.

501
00:59:06,152 --> 00:59:08,346
-I feel dizzy.
-Don't be scared.

502
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,183
I'm here. It's okay.
See the second floor, there?

503
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:15,057
Use the binoculars.

504
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,389
-There?
-Yes.

505
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:20,092
-The orange window?
-Yeah.

506
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,700
The guys talking inside.

507
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:24,697
Can you tell what they're saying?

508
00:59:25,305 --> 00:59:28,536
-They're saying hello.
-Okay. What else?

509
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,682
No, it's too far!

510
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:38,407
They keep turning their backs.

511
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,687
I need to know
if you can lip-read from here.

512
00:59:42,322 --> 00:59:43,414
Make an effort.

513
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:48,694
No use. I'm not a fax machine!

514
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:54,925
-Can you lip-read or not?
-I read lips, not scalps!

515
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:57,200
Is that Marchand's place?

516
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:00,130
Which one's Marchand?

517
01:00:00,873 --> 01:00:03,866
-On the left.
-Do you know the others?

518
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:10,380
They're the Carambo brothers.
The older one was in Fleury with me.

519
01:00:11,051 --> 01:00:12,609
We barely met.

520
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,693
-I see.
-What?

521
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,918
Let me go!

522
01:00:20,462 --> 01:00:22,157
-Let go!
-Be quiet.

523
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,320
-I'll scream.
-No yelling!

524
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:26,293
Let's talk, okay?

525
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:31,097
Just stay and watch
what they say.

526
01:00:32,808 --> 01:00:36,242
You didn't mind asking me
to rob Keller's car.

527
01:00:37,078 --> 01:00:39,638
-This is different.
-There's no risk!

528
01:00:39,814 --> 01:00:42,339
The only danger
is falling down the stairs.

529
01:00:45,586 --> 01:00:48,558
They'll call me.
Take these. I'll be back.

530
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:51,658
-Who'll call you?
-Trust me. I'll be back.

531
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:53,521
Don't leave me here alone.

532
01:00:54,129 --> 01:00:56,427
See you later. Thanks.

533
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:59,932
Stay here.
I'll be back, honest!

534
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:02,231
I'll be back.

535
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:16,073
Bastard!

536
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:23,990
What the hell is this?

537
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:30,089
Why am I here?

538
01:02:10,109 --> 01:02:11,269
Your champagne.

539
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:13,769
We'll get back to it.

540
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,216
What's he doing there?

541
01:02:32,932 --> 01:02:34,956
Why did he ask me...?

542
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:09,290
-How will you do it?
-Do what? Oh, that!

543
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:13,906
-I don't know.
-Will you mug them, or what?

544
01:03:15,742 --> 01:03:17,709
-I'm not sure yet.
-Not sure yet?

545
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,278
You've no idea!
You don't know a thing!

546
01:03:21,448 --> 01:03:24,474
It's worth a try, right?

547
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,783
Why should I freeze
on a roof...

548
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:32,287
-...spying on hoodlums?
-Don't give me that!

549
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:37,328
For the money, maybe?
If I get some, you get some.

550
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:40,631
I don't give a shit about money.

551
01:03:43,537 --> 01:03:49,339
Let's cut the crap.
Just tell me what you want.

552
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,307
Come to work like before.

553
01:03:57,184 --> 01:03:58,481
Work nights at the club...

554
01:03:58,652 --> 01:04:02,088
...days at the office. I'll fix your
hours.
We'll use a company car.

555
01:04:02,288 --> 01:04:03,687
Fuck you!

556
01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:06,828
Take it or leave it.

557
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:12,693
No, you've made a mistake.

558
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:16,396
Yes, I'll give you
the architect's number.

559
01:04:17,138 --> 01:04:22,440
It's the Baron studio:
01 4825 4367.

560
01:04:29,684 --> 01:04:32,050
Fax this to that number.

561
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:27,673
Marchand's scared.
Street's too narrow.

562
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:31,974
Scared of bakery next door.
Young guy makes a phone call.

563
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:34,815
Wait, I can't read my writing.

564
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:38,421
''Meet the guy from the bank
tomorrow.''

565
01:05:39,288 --> 01:05:42,189
''Case the joint.''
Chapeau, Chameau?

566
01:05:42,759 --> 01:05:45,284
Must be somebody's name.
Ever heard of him?

567
01:05:45,462 --> 01:05:46,827
Means nothing to me.

568
01:05:46,997 --> 01:05:51,867
''Around 8.'' Must be 8:00
or the 8th, I don't know.

569
01:05:52,036 --> 01:05:54,936
The two brothers go in.
Marchand disagrees.

570
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:58,000
He wants to go in.

571
01:05:58,176 --> 01:06:02,340
''Why can't the other guy
wait in the car?'' They argue.

572
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:05,509
A number.
Old guy takes notes from photos.

573
01:06:05,682 --> 01:06:08,379
Road map.
They talk about money.

574
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:11,181
-Marchand says numbers, gesticulates.
-I get it.

575
01:06:11,357 --> 01:06:15,224
One guy supplies the plans.
The others pull the job.

576
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:19,094
Marchand hasn't a clue.
He's never robbed anything.

577
01:06:19,265 --> 01:06:21,925
Why do they say ''five, six''?

578
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,864
-5, 6 o'clock?
-They keep saying five, six.

579
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:43,378
-You haven't heard from her?
-No. How long has it been?

580
01:06:43,722 --> 01:06:45,588
-A week.
-A week!

581
01:06:46,759 --> 01:06:49,159
I assumed it was only
since yesterday.

582
01:06:49,328 --> 01:06:51,694
Something must have happened to her!

583
01:06:52,363 --> 01:06:55,799
-Have you told the police?
-If I had, they'd be here.

584
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:59,066
I had no real reason to worry.

585
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,873
Your wife disappears for a week
and you don't worry?

586
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:05,767
It's not the first time.

587
01:07:07,813 --> 01:07:10,714
-She's gone without a word before.
-Odile?

588
01:07:11,316 --> 01:07:14,047
She stayed a few days with Lucie
but always came back.

589
01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:16,016
I don't understand.

590
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:20,086
-You haven't been married 35 years.
-I don't mean that.

591
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,693
Be right with you!

592
01:07:22,797 --> 01:07:26,458
I don't get why she never told me.
I'm her sister, after all.

593
01:07:26,632 --> 01:07:31,094
-Maybe she didn't tell you everything.
-I guess so.

594
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:57,451
-What's the work today?
-Finish the Bulto file.

595
01:07:57,631 --> 01:08:00,156
Call Meldeg,
see if the goods arrived.

596
01:08:03,004 --> 01:08:04,094
All set?

597
01:08:05,507 --> 01:08:07,701
Try zipping your pants.

598
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:18,487
-Paul, file this.
-You should have fixed it last week!

599
01:08:18,487 --> 01:08:20,317
-Paul, file this.
-You should have fixed it last week!

600
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:23,013
Now Belin says the site's on hold!

601
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:26,422
What are you up to?
What is this bullshit?

602
01:08:26,595 --> 01:08:28,927
Don't interrupt!
You think I'm dumb?

603
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:32,726
-I always said it was risky.
-Okay! It's too late now.

604
01:08:33,603 --> 01:08:34,592
-Maybe--
-Okay!

605
01:08:34,771 --> 01:08:37,204
May I say something?

606
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,397
It seems to me...

607
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:44,070
...our problem with Lehaleur
is psychological.

608
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:47,309
We got off on the wrong foot.

609
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:52,444
-I could try and find a solution.
-It can't hurt.

610
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,257
Yes! I'm coming.

611
01:08:58,694 --> 01:08:59,991
I'm coming.

612
01:09:05,234 --> 01:09:06,258
What's your problem?

613
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:09,336
-Mr. Lehaleur?
-What do you want with him?

614
01:09:16,814 --> 01:09:18,441
What have I done to you?

615
01:09:19,115 --> 01:09:20,447
The neighbors!

616
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:26,084
He's agreeing more and more.

617
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:28,987
See you later.

618
01:09:31,995 --> 01:09:36,227
She's here. I'll put her on.

619
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,958
For you. Mr. Morel.

620
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:45,507
Sorry, I can't hear you.

621
01:09:45,678 --> 01:09:48,237
That's better.
It went very well.

622
01:09:48,412 --> 01:09:54,443
Mr. Lehaleur is fully in the picture.
Thank you, Mr. Morel.

623
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:37,913
-I'm a bit tired, but okay.
-Is it the job?

624
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:43,022
Yeah. It never stops.
Paperwork, building sites....

625
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:47,720
-I'm working around the clock.
-Can you cope?

626
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,626
No problem.

627
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:55,669
-New nail polish?
-Yes.

628
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:58,902
-Like it?
-A bit pale.

629
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:01,005
''Rosewood.''

630
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:06,770
-Can you babysit tonight?
-I won't be home tonight.

631
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:09,112
It's not so easy these days.

632
01:13:09,354 --> 01:13:11,652
-A lot of work.
-Not only that.

633
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:18,921
Still seeing your boyfriend?

634
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:20,997
Still seeing your boyfriend?

635
01:13:21,665 --> 01:13:24,531
-He's not my boyfriend.
-But you still see him?

636
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:26,626
Yes.

637
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:22,187
-A margarita and two beers.
-Are you done?

638
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:27,161
-Your antics with those jerks.
-What antics?

639
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,766
What antics?

640
01:14:29,468 --> 01:14:32,766
-What have I done wrong?
-Forget it.

641
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:36,697
Is it them?
Why? They're nice.

642
01:14:36,876 --> 01:14:38,036
Sure, real nice.

643
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,916
It's okay. It's over.

644
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:59,055
Feeling okay?

645
01:16:00,662 --> 01:16:01,754
Here.

646
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:06,122
Thanks.

647
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,804
-You're hurt.
-I'm okay.

648
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:11,701
-Let me see.
-Honest.

649
01:16:11,873 --> 01:16:14,603
I said, I'm okay.

650
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:20,205
I have to go back in.

651
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:23,375
Did you hear me?

652
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,986
Are you okay to go?

653
01:16:28,491 --> 01:16:31,653
-Go in. I'll join you.
-Go on the roof, I mean.

654
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:36,392
Can you hear me?

655
01:16:41,537 --> 01:16:44,164
-Yes.
-I'm going back in.

656
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,564
Eighty francs.

657
01:17:15,605 --> 01:17:17,072
Get changed and take her home.

658
01:17:17,307 --> 01:17:19,868
She'll direct you.
Give me some smokes.

659
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:25,812
-Leave the car keys on the bar.
-Okay.

660
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,477
Scumbag!

661
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:39,887
Let me help you.

662
01:17:46,004 --> 01:17:47,027
Careful.

663
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:49,169
Mind your head.

664
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:55,078
I hate what he's become.

665
01:17:56,348 --> 01:17:57,940
It's that crummy bar.

666
01:17:58,817 --> 01:17:59,909
It's changed him.

667
01:18:00,618 --> 01:18:03,587
He always had an eye for bimbos.

668
01:18:05,089 --> 01:18:06,784
What's he like with you?

669
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:10,452
Search me. He's the boss.

670
01:18:12,965 --> 01:18:15,194
Where does he fuck them?

671
01:18:16,034 --> 01:18:18,367
Where does he fuck the bimbos?

672
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:20,427
Upstairs in his office?

673
01:18:24,344 --> 01:18:27,470
Why am I asking you?
You won't tell me anyhow.

674
01:18:27,645 --> 01:18:30,206
I'm the dumb cunt,
and he's the boss.

675
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:37,144
He has to fuck them somewhere.

676
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:39,259
You want the window open?

677
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:42,884
-I feel sick.
-Sit up. Sit up!

678
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:46,430
Fuck!

679
01:18:58,578 --> 01:19:01,171
-What now?
-I need to pee.

680
01:19:17,997 --> 01:19:19,022
Shit.

681
01:19:29,075 --> 01:19:31,566
I'll tell you later.

682
01:19:33,613 --> 01:19:34,774
What do you want?

683
01:19:35,016 --> 01:19:37,246
There's nobody there.
No lights on.

684
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:41,745
I didn't see him.

685
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:45,257
What do we do now?

686
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,692
Until when?

687
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:53,493
I heard you. No need to shout!

688
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,844
What a prick!

689
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:31,366
How can anyone be such a jerk?

690
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:42,277
They were garbage bags.

691
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,348
I only saw them for a second.

692
01:21:46,518 --> 01:21:51,682
-What shape were they?
-Like bags with stuff inside.

693
01:21:53,424 --> 01:21:57,725
What stuff? It could be anything!
Cash, shoes, clothes....

694
01:21:57,896 --> 01:22:01,762
-You schlepp clothes around at 5 a.m.?
-Not cash, either.

695
01:22:03,834 --> 01:22:06,704
-He didn't come out?
-No! I didn't see!

696
01:22:07,807 --> 01:22:09,774
He must still be asleep.

697
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:12,900
All right!

698
01:22:14,746 --> 01:22:17,579
-What do we do?
-Nothing. What else?

699
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:20,316
He'll come down sometime to eat.

700
01:22:20,486 --> 01:22:24,286
-Then I'll go up.
-I have to go to the office to work.

701
01:22:24,457 --> 01:22:25,446
Go on, then.

702
01:22:26,492 --> 01:22:28,858
-But leave the car.
-What for?

703
01:22:30,595 --> 01:22:32,655
should I take the bags
on the subway?

704
01:22:34,231 --> 01:22:35,793
Don't you trust me?

705
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:39,334
Yes.

706
01:22:40,774 --> 01:22:43,241
-We meet where?
-Don't know. I'll call you.

707
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,484
Can you pick up some clothes
from my place?

708
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:26,310
There's one thing I don't get.

709
01:23:26,955 --> 01:23:29,081
If your wife disappeared
three weeks ago...

710
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:31,418
...why did you only report it
yesterday?

711
01:23:32,192 --> 01:23:35,684
She often went off
to stay with her sister...

712
01:23:35,997 --> 01:23:38,124
...in Desertines, near Montlucon.

713
01:23:40,535 --> 01:23:42,527
-You have no children?
-No.

714
01:23:45,006 --> 01:23:47,372
She couldn't.

715
01:23:48,576 --> 01:23:52,980
I almost forgot.
I put something aside for you.

716
01:23:58,787 --> 01:24:03,622
-What's upstairs?
-Two bedrooms and...

717
01:24:04,225 --> 01:24:05,989
...a shower, not really a bathroom.

718
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:09,027
-And there's a cellar?
-A full-sized basement.

719
01:24:09,264 --> 01:24:14,565
These are the most recent photos,
from last year.

720
01:26:27,273 --> 01:26:28,432
It's me.

721
01:26:28,607 --> 01:26:31,007
-Where are you?
-In the car. He just came out.

722
01:26:31,175 --> 01:26:32,201
I'm going in.

723
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:41,251
-Eat with us?
-No. Back in a half-hour.

724
01:27:19,495 --> 01:27:21,051
Give me some smokes.

725
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,496
-Where's the other guy?
-He'll be right back.

726
01:28:06,608 --> 01:28:07,597
Any luck?

727
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:13,810
Fuck all!
I looked everywhere. Nothing!

728
01:28:15,884 --> 01:28:18,752
-You searched?
-Yes! Everywhere!

729
01:28:18,922 --> 01:28:20,981
The only bags
were full of garbage!

730
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,557
What you put me through!

731
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:32,563
I'll go.

732
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:38,637
-Yeah, okay.
-If he shows, call me.

733
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,269
Give me the key.

734
01:28:43,812 --> 01:28:45,040
Give me the key.

735
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:18,472
Where's my vodka?

736
01:31:27,214 --> 01:31:29,045
Set the boss's table.
He's coming.

737
01:31:29,215 --> 01:31:30,614
Where is he?

738
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:45,173
A lot?

739
01:34:57,765 --> 01:34:59,596
Meet me at the car.

740
01:35:01,636 --> 01:35:02,624
Then what?

741
01:35:04,472 --> 01:35:07,464
Then? We get the hell out.

742
01:35:08,509 --> 01:35:09,772
Then what?

743
01:35:10,979 --> 01:35:14,107
-What do you mean, then?
-Then you split, is that it?

744
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:23,416
So, what?

745
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:27,354
Go if you want,
but without the cash.

746
01:35:29,366 --> 01:35:33,028
-That wasn't the deal.
-No. You were supposed to find it.

747
01:35:37,172 --> 01:35:38,300
Let go.

748
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:48,207
I'll be in the car. Come in
10 minutes or I'll be gone.

749
01:35:50,853 --> 01:35:52,411
Stop it.

750
01:36:43,741 --> 01:36:45,037
Shit!

751
01:37:21,412 --> 01:37:24,438
-Where's the other guy?
-He just went out.

752
01:37:24,615 --> 01:37:25,809
Something wrong?

753
01:37:54,947 --> 01:37:56,972
Where is it, motherfucker?

754
01:37:57,449 --> 01:37:58,439
Where is it?

755
01:37:58,685 --> 01:38:00,016
-What?
-The money!

756
01:38:00,453 --> 01:38:02,284
-Where is it?
-I don't know!

757
01:38:02,522 --> 01:38:03,955
Where's the money,
motherfucker?

758
01:38:04,223 --> 01:38:05,451
Where is it?

759
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:08,949
What's he done?

760
01:38:09,795 --> 01:38:12,528
Stay out of this.
Don't ask questions.

761
01:38:12,767 --> 01:38:15,030
Don't ask.
Just go downstairs.

762
01:38:15,235 --> 01:38:18,635
When the Carambos arrive,
stall them and warn me, okay?

763
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:21,734
Go on.

764
01:38:39,258 --> 01:38:41,453
-Where is it?
-I don't know!

765
01:39:07,988 --> 01:39:12,483
-Where is it?
-I know nothing about it!

766
01:39:20,802 --> 01:39:21,791
Shit!

767
01:39:25,107 --> 01:39:26,232
Motherfucker!

768
01:39:56,273 --> 01:39:59,265
Tell them anything!
Say I'll be there in an hour.

769
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:01,774
Give them a drink.

770
01:40:20,796 --> 01:40:22,320
Yes, I'm upstairs!

771
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:25,257
Wait there. I'll come down!

772
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,831
I'm coming down. Wait!

773
01:40:51,896 --> 01:40:53,522
What do I do now?

774
01:40:54,731 --> 01:40:58,100
Say something. Quick!

775
01:41:07,914 --> 01:41:09,641
Ticket!

776
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:27,726
Do as I say.

777
01:41:28,267 --> 01:41:30,792
Marchand. His wife.

778
01:41:31,403 --> 01:41:33,165
Slow down!

779
01:41:34,574 --> 01:41:35,870
Go to....

780
01:41:38,377 --> 01:41:40,470
Go to her place.

781
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:50,647
Slower!

782
01:41:58,296 --> 01:41:59,628
Yes, like that.

783
01:42:00,801 --> 01:42:02,131
Good!

784
01:43:12,274 --> 01:43:16,234
Hold on, I'm coming!

785
01:43:23,685 --> 01:43:25,676
I got a problem
with the money!

786
01:43:27,055 --> 01:43:28,785
He ripped off the money!

787
01:43:29,293 --> 01:43:32,819
Who did?
Stop sniffling like a faggot!

788
01:44:32,956 --> 01:44:33,946
Who's there?

789
01:44:34,592 --> 01:44:37,525
You don't know me.
Are you Mrs. Marchand?

790
01:44:37,693 --> 01:44:38,786
Yes. Why?

791
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:42,162
It's about your husband.
It's important.

792
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:44,664
Has something happened to him?

793
01:44:45,502 --> 01:44:47,094
I'm his mistress.

794
01:44:49,841 --> 01:44:52,239
Mrs. Marchand. Are you there?

795
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:03,520
Stop hitting him!
I'm sick of picking him up.

796
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:09,153
-Give up. He can't talk.
-Let me.

797
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,886
-I'll make him talk.
-Shut the fuck up.

798
01:45:12,064 --> 01:45:14,759
You screwed us.
Now I ask the questions.

799
01:45:17,602 --> 01:45:19,230
I've known him for six months.

800
01:45:20,738 --> 01:45:22,330
We fucked every day.

801
01:45:22,739 --> 01:45:24,799
We were going
to South Africa tomorrow.

802
01:45:25,044 --> 01:45:26,569
I don't understand.

803
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:30,146
You're not his type at all.

804
01:45:32,016 --> 01:45:33,507
They were mostly blondes...

805
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:37,479
-...and pretty, at least.
-It was physical.

806
01:45:39,426 --> 01:45:41,221
We fucked like animals.

807
01:45:42,328 --> 01:45:45,695
-I'd never imagined it.
-What?

808
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,692
Like a mindless piece of meat.

809
01:45:51,235 --> 01:45:53,329
Yesterday I heard
he had another woman.

810
01:45:54,007 --> 01:45:57,171
I can't take that.
You understand?

811
01:45:59,612 --> 01:46:01,080
Where did you do it?

812
01:46:03,249 --> 01:46:05,275
The studio above the club.

813
01:46:06,953 --> 01:46:08,478
He even gave me the key.

814
01:46:12,192 --> 01:46:13,319
Can you hear me?

815
01:46:14,427 --> 01:46:18,386
Spill it or we're dead.
I'll give you half my share.

816
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,590
I don't understand.

817
01:46:31,278 --> 01:46:33,074
-It's my wife.
-Go on.

818
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,111
It's me. What do you want?

819
01:46:39,254 --> 01:46:41,153
Get lost.
Take a pill and go to bed.

820
01:46:41,889 --> 01:46:44,722
-What's up with her?
-She's drunk. Ignore it.

821
01:46:47,796 --> 01:46:51,788
Don't hang up on me, you prick!
You're going to talk!

822
01:46:51,965 --> 01:46:53,935
-What now?
-I know everything!

823
01:46:54,603 --> 01:46:56,900
-What, you dumb cunt?
-You're whoring around...

824
01:46:57,071 --> 01:46:59,505
...with that girl.
Your fake name.

825
01:46:59,673 --> 01:47:01,004
Your travel plans!

826
01:47:01,709 --> 01:47:04,769
-I'm busy. Cut the crap.
-I want to hear.

827
01:47:04,945 --> 01:47:06,935
I suppose your plane ticket is crap!

828
01:47:07,814 --> 01:47:09,284
What ticket?

829
01:47:09,785 --> 01:47:12,218
You're not alone!
Who's with you?

830
01:47:12,389 --> 01:47:16,118
Is that a plane ticket
in your coat, or what?

831
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:19,283
Take your plane, scumbag!

832
01:47:20,461 --> 01:47:23,124
-I'm keeping the dough!
-What dough?

833
01:47:24,767 --> 01:47:26,428
The dough you just stole!

834
01:47:43,219 --> 01:47:47,383
I sacrificed everything for him!
What a scumbag!

835
01:47:49,393 --> 01:47:51,190
How could he do it to me?

836
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:57,295
On my mother's life! How could he?
All for nothing.

837
01:47:57,867 --> 01:47:59,631
He's a bastard.

838
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:03,233
These'll help.

839
01:48:08,144 --> 01:48:10,045
Can I have a drink?

840
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:55,153
Where's your wife?

841
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,853
Richard!

842
01:49:31,397 --> 01:49:32,728
These were in your bedroom.

843
01:49:35,534 --> 01:49:37,058
Where's the dough?

844
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:38,496
What are these?

845
01:49:42,206 --> 01:49:45,735
Grab Porky, stick his head
in the tub and don't let go.

846
01:50:11,472 --> 01:50:12,529
Hold still.

847
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:48,929
It's me! It's me.

848
01:52:12,628 --> 01:52:15,598
-What's up with her?
-She's only sleeping.

849
01:52:28,278 --> 01:52:29,711
The money!

850
01:52:54,773 --> 01:52:57,172
-What time is it?
-Around 8.

851
01:52:57,407 --> 01:53:00,708
-Shit!
-You have Masson today?

852
01:53:01,713 --> 01:53:04,409
You can't go like that.

853
01:53:13,425 --> 01:53:14,891
Fuck! The cops!

854
01:53:16,194 --> 01:53:20,634
-Isn't that him? Slow down.
-What the fuck's going on?

855
01:53:20,801 --> 01:53:22,392
He's trying to say something.

856
01:53:22,568 --> 01:53:24,661
-Slow down!
-I can't with the cops!

857
01:53:24,837 --> 01:53:26,737
Look! He's talking to us.

858
01:53:28,474 --> 01:53:31,910
I don't understand.
He's talking about his wife.

859
01:53:33,946 --> 01:53:36,541
About his wife.
He says that he loved her...

860
01:53:38,684 --> 01:53:41,983
...that he loved her
and it's over.
