1
00:00:01,908 --> 00:00:08,540
The black hole, where gravity's pull is
so intense that even light can't escape.

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,502
Sometimes I feel that way when
I'm at a boring dinner party.

3
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,006
Listen, next week we have the big quiz.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,802
But if you want tenure, you
need to learn to play the game.

5
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,887
Cozy up to Dean Fairchild.

6
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,724
Kiss his ass.

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:29,060
Remember, I'm not only the dean,

8
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:32,897
I am also the editor of <i>The
Astrophysics Quarterly Review.</i>

9
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,860
- I'm leaving you, Henry.
- No, Christine,

10
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:39,237
I will get published. You'll see.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,364
Who am I kidding, they're just
gonna choose Associate Professor

12
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:44,325
<i>Brodfard Gilroy's work,
like they always do.</i>

13
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,871
- Drink, Henry?
- No, thank you, Dean Fairchild.

14
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,831
I try not to drink bourbon before lunch.

15
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,375
Ouch. Do I detect sarcasm?

16
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,004
"A hit, a very palpable hit!"

17
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,005
<i>Hamlet,</i> act five, scene two?

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,133
"The Devil hath power to
assume pleasing shape."

19
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:03,011
"Though it be madness, yet
there is method in't."

20
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:05,597
"I am but mad north-north-west.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,559
When the wind is southerly, I
know a hawk from a handsaw!"

22
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:11,728
Jeez, Henry. Keep your shirt on.

23
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,355
We're trying to have a little fun.

24
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:14,730
My paper is better than anything

25
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:17,901
that could be conceived by
your feeble brain, Brodfard!

26
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:19,193
Oh, what's wrong, Henry?

27
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:22,113
Are you gonna whine or are you gonna win?

28
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,166
Oh! Ow! Ow!

29
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:41,215
Are those our professors?

30
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,469
I hope your writing is better
than your left hook, Neumann.

31
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,522
I just want people to see my ideas.

32
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:58,442
Well, perhaps you can start
a newsletter or something.

33
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:59,693
You utter moron.

34
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:09,828
That son of a bitch!

35
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:15,291
I know I'm not very good
at playing the game.

36
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:17,919
Maybe that's because science
isn't a game to me.

37
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:22,465
I don't care who jerked off next to
who in the faculty lounge last week.

38
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,718
I'm a damn good astrophysicist

39
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,761
and I will not let anyone
take that away from me.

40
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:30,139
Not Brodfard Gilroy, and
especially not you.

41
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:32,558
You back-slapping, booze-swilling,

42
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:36,855
glad-handing fuck dick of a shit butt!

43
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,941
Get out!

44
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,025
Oh, my God.

45
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,739
Don't beat yourself up.
It happens to everyone.

46
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:49,701
Just take this as an opportunity
to relax and reflect.

47
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:51,453
I know a great real estate agent.

48
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:54,163
She specializes in summer
rentals up near Waterville.

49
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,375
Call her, Henry.

50
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,253
This is the only
unit still available

51
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:01,754
that's within your price range.

52
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:05,008
Definitely has a rustic feeling to it,

53
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:09,053
but it's perfect for someone
looking for a little solitude.

54
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,806
We just had a married
couple in here just now.

55
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,100
I guess it didn't work out.
It's too bad, too.

56
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,978
I really liked them. It's so sad.

57
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:21,357
Did you know that more than 50% of
married couples get divorced these days?

58
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,277
Boy, oh, boy. Times sure have changed.

59
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:28,156
Anyway, listen to me jabbering on.

60
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,116
Believe me, I know you have better
things to do with your time

61
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,285
than listen to me go on
about gosh only knows what.

62
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:33,786
Quite a storm on the way.

63
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,914
They say it's a nor'easter.

64
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,500
Anyway, listen to me gabbing on.

65
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:41,252
I should mention that
there is a summer camp

66
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:44,881
right through the trees over there.
Nice enough people.

67
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:48,510
Sometimes they make too much noise, but
kids will be kids, don't you know?

68
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:49,843
Anyhoo...

69
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:52,263
I do have two other people
interested in this property,

70
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:55,641
so if you are serious about renting,
I'm going to need a deposit.

71
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,101
It's perfect. I'll take it.

Guys. Everybody, focus up.

84
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,436
Eyes up here.

85
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:42,063
- We have some very sad news.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,398
Tragedy has befallen
our humble theater.

87
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:46,901
Leaps were leapt. Bones were broken.

88
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,111
Dreams were deferred.

89
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:52,699
Earlier today, Abraham Mendel saved
the lives of Danny and Becky

90
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,158
by breaking their fall.

91
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,534
Sorry, man.

92
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:57,995
Danny, Becky, you were our leads.

93
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,706
- And we will never forget you.
- Never.

94
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,791
- But we're fine.
- Yeah, we weren't injured.

95
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,084
Yeah, well, you made a mistake,

96
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,003
and mistakes aren't tolerated
here, so you're out.

97
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:08,632
But the show must go on!

98
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:12,385
And in that spirit, Ben will
be stepping in for Abraham

99
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:15,429
and performing with McKinley
in the zoot suit number.

100
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:18,516
It is time for this actorly
vessel to cross the footlights.

101
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,559
<i>- Adieu,</i> my princess!
- Aw.

102
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,774
<i>Adieu</i> and <i>exeunt.</i>

103
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:30,862
It's kind of our thing.

104
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:34,407
Anyway, we have to replace the
leading lady and the leading man.

105
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,285
I need help from a
professional director. Claude?

106
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:38,787
Ah!

107
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:44,876
Let the auditions begin!

108
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:48,379
Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm from
Freehold, New Jersey.

109
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:51,340
I'm 16, and I'm gonna sing
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

110
00:05:54,844 --> 00:06:01,267
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪</i>

111
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:04,562
<i>♪ How I wonder... ♪</i>

112
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:07,440
Thank you.
That's all we need to hear.

113
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:09,650
Are you sure? I'm happy to do another song.

114
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:13,071
You weren't good, okay?
Is that what you want to hear?

115
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:16,240
You want me to gut you like
a fish for everyone to see?

116
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,910
Is that what you want, little girl?
Because let me tell you something.

117
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,870
The truth stings, okay?

118
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:22,997
Like salt on an open wound.

119
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,374
You were an abomination!

120
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,212
Your audition stunk up this
room like a dusty wet fart!

121
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,297
You don't have it!

122
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,383
You don't have it, honey.

123
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:38,262
And I hope to hell you're
good at something else,

124
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:43,476
because you sure as shit are not
gonna make it in show business.

125
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:49,273
So that, to answer your
question, is the truth.

126
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:56,030
What was her question?

127
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:09,585
I'll take a tin of Skoal and, uh...

128
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:11,962
two combs.

129
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,094
Candy! Yeah!

130
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:20,096
Candy!

131
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,850
Are you gonna buy anything?

132
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,351
What, old man?

133
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:28,104
I can't hear you over the music.

134
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:32,150
He asked you politely if you
were going to buy anything.

135
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:35,111
"He asked politely if
you were gonna buy anything."

136
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:38,739
- Who the fuck are you, asswipe?
- Yeah, asswipe, who the fuck are you?

137
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,333
I'm the Falcon,

138
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:52,336
President Reagan's hired assassin...

139
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,629
asswipe.

140
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,214
My uterus.

141
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,175
Oh, man.

142
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,968
Keep the change.

143
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,933
You kids stay in school.

144
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:25,453
Jonas?

145
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,122
Oh!

146
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:30,208
- Hey, there...
- Hi.

147
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,669
Gail, my fiancée.

148
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,172
What were you talking
to Beth and Greg about?

149
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:38,757
- What do you mean?
- I overheard you.

150
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,093
What'd you hear?

151
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:43,637
Something about sludge, the government...

152
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:44,805
codes.

153
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,850
- A can.
- Mmm-mmm.

154
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,602
What was all that stuff about?

155
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,942
Oh, yeah, that was, uh...

156
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:00,738
Jonas, is there anything I need to
know about you before we get married?

157
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,074
Like, anything at all?

158
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:05,576
No... nothing.

159
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,750
Oh, my... I'm so sorry, Jonas!

160
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,337
I thought for some reason that you would,
like, catch it and spin it around or...

161
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,257
God, what am I doing? I
think I'm just scared.

162
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,050
It's okay to be scared.

163
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,386
Getting married's scary.
But you want to know what?

164
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:25,929
- I'm not scared.
- You're not?

165
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,640
I remember the first
time I laid eyes on you

166
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:29,683
at the Portsmouth Marriott
doing the hustle.

167
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:34,397
I knew right then and there, you were
gonna be the girl that I married.

168
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:39,902
It wasn't the hustle. It
was the electric slide.

169
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,908
"That was my Mama's scarf.

170
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:48,369
The scarf she wrapped around her neck.

171
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:52,373
It was given to her by her aunt
Margaret who lived in Boston."

172
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:53,499
Hey, Katie.

173
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:56,210
I was thinking about watching you
ride a horse later. Is that cool?

174
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,005
Sorry, Andy. I'm auditioning to
replace Becky in the musical.

175
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,923
And if I get the part, I'll
be rehearsing all day.

176
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:03,467
That sounds like a drag.
I hope you don't get it.

177
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:07,846
Trees look weird if you squint at 'em.

178
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:11,767
Being in the play is a lot of fun.

179
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,062
In fact, you could audition
for the lead role.

180
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,438
I bet you'd be a great performer.

181
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,648
I'd rather pick dingleberries
out of my Aunt Frieda's butt

182
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,650
than do that stupid shit.

183
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:22,236
Well, it's just something to think about.

184
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,114
It's a really good musical. There's
all sorts of fun pyrotechnics

185
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:27,116
and dancing and singing and...

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,992
the two leads have a big kiss at the end.

187
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:34,665
Anyway, I'll see ya later.

188
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:40,629
Think I just caught the acting bug.

189
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:43,632
Next!

190
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:46,009
I have to call my service.

191
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,806
Claude, do you think, maybe, we're
being a little too hard on them?

192
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,351
I mean, after all, it's just a summer camp.

193
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,146
Let me tell you a little story, Susie.

194
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,942
One night, I was having drinks next
to the brilliant Jerome Robbins

195
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:06,864
while he was having drinks with
the late, great Gower Champion.

196
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,450
And do you know who else was
in the restaurant that night?

197
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:11,535
No.

198
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,205
Jack...

199
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:15,414
Hofsiss.

200
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,459
- Holy shit.
- "Holy shit" is right.

201
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,754
I call winner.

202
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,046
In your face, douche!

203
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,048
Hey, is it cool if we play?

204
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,385
It's not like we own the tetherball
court or anything.

205
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,138
Kevin, can you show me?

206
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,265
- Appleblatt?
- Okay.

207
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:36,769
The point is to get the ball all the way
around the pole, so you hit it like this.

208
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:40,148
Okay. So, like this?

209
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:42,691
Ow!

210
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,528
Stop laughing at her. It's not funny.

211
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:47,780
Happens all the time. See?

212
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,784
He is such a dork.

213
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:55,788
Kevin, what's your major malfunction?

214
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,081

253
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:55,366

254
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:56,659
Beth!

255
00:13:56,742 --> 00:14:01,372
We are very pleased to welcome Kennebec
County's number one hypnotist,

256
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,915
Jackie Brazen!

257
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,005
What are we doing, Beth? We're
sitting on a time bomb here.

258
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:11,382
What are we gonna do? We're
running out of time.

259
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,008
All right, all right! Camp Firewood!

260
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,719
We have to keep up normal
appearances for as long as possible

261
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:19,598
until we can figure out a way to stop
Xenstar and the United States government.

262
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,227
Are you ready to get
unconscious and uncanny?

263
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:27,230
Let's get uncanny!

264
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:28,857
I'm gonna need a few victims...

265
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:31,652
I mean volunteers!

266
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,029
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
Pick me! Pick me!

267
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:38,116
Whoa, whoa. Slow down, big fella. I'm
gonna need you to slow way down.

268
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,537
More like... a turtle.

269
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:44,707
Oh, my God.

270
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,042
He's acting like a turtle!

271
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:50,170
Turtle!

272
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,756
- What?
- I like the new look.

273
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,008
- Really?
- No, you look like a doink.

274
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,429
- Okay, can we go?
- I just need you to trust me, Greg.

275
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:01,139
I'm just really worried
about that toxic sludge.

276
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,895
Rhonda! Who's next?

277
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:09,064
And can someone please blow me away?

278
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:11,734
- Logan.
- That's me!

279
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,652
Hello, I'm Logan.

280
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,529
I'm 16 years old. I'm
from Tarrytown, New York.

281
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,699
My favorite musical is <i>Annie,
</i> my favorite season winter,

282
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:21,201
and my favorite actor is, of
course, the great Ben Vereen.

283
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:23,203
It's a 16/4 with a loop at the hook.

284
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:24,955
Freeze the bars and mute the quarter-tones.

285
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,749
If it ever feels like we're
dragging, we're not.

286
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:28,334
It's just that kind of tune.

287
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,212
What did you guys think of lunch today?

288
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:33,631
I thought the sloppy
joes were pretty great,

289
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,633
but the coleslaw was a little eggy.

290
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:36,967
I think we can do better.

296
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:52,858
He's the one.

297
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,486
We should tell him before
he books something else.

309
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,363

- Hi.

311
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,753
This is a little bit
awkward, but I was wondering

312
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:58,882
if I could look up any public records
on my fiancé, Jonas Jurgensen?

313
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,343
For no reason. Probably nothing.

314
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:03,345
Just to reassure myself.

315
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:04,597
It's always good to be thorough.

316
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:09,685
Jonas Jurgensen, date of
birth June 21st, 1952.

317
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:12,062
Resides at 1048 Walnut Street.

318
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:13,146
And...

319
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,315
- he's dead.
- What?

320
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:16,442
Oh, that can't be.

321
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,111
I am so sorry. I read that wrong.

322
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:22,072
- It's actually 1408...
- No, after that.

323
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:23,907
- That he's dead?
- That's impossible.

324
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,577
Uh, checking...

325
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,537
Oh...

326
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,372
No, it says it right here.
He's definitely dead.

327
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,332
But...

328
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,629
If Jonas is dead, then
who am I about to marry?

329
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,423
Do the funky chicken.

330
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:42,259
You're a constipated wiener dog.

331
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,721
You're a one-celled organism.

332
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,849
Dibs on her.

333
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,519
Dibs on her. Dibs on her.

334
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:54,187
You can't call dibs on every girl, Drew.
That's against the rules.

335
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:57,483
Yes, you can, 'cause I just did.
Eat my dick, Captain Fuck Pants.

336
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,943
We should take turns. Kevin, you go first.

337
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,153
Oh.

338
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:04,114
- Okay, I call dibs on...
- You're a sexy, sexy alpaca!

339
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:06,534
I call dibs on that Amy chick.

340
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:08,952
What? No. It was my turn.

341
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,788
Bullshit. We're going counter-clockwise.

342
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:13,290
It's my turn, and I call dibs on Amy.

343
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,667
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you,

344
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,878
is he a man or is he a pogo stick?

345
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:19,588
Pogo stick!

346
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,929
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

347
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:28,138
- McKinley, right?
- Yeah.

348
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:31,474
Oh, Ben. I'm the producer.
Well, was the producer.

349
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,019
I guess you and I are doing the zoot suit.

350
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,271
Yeah, we're doing the zoot suit.

351
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:37,898
Who came up with this contraption?

352
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:40,609
I guess the trademark is that both
actors get into the zoot suit

353
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:42,027
and then they play the zoot suit together.

354
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,237
- I know. I made the costume.
- No, you didn't.

355
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,448
Hand to God. I've been into sewing
since I was eight years old.

356
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:48,491
Oh, my God. I had no idea
you were that creative.

357
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:49,868
- Oh, really?
- Uh-uh.

358
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:52,204
Oh, I just thought it was so
obvious that I'm creative.

359
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,873
I mean, I just thought,
'cause you're creative

360
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:56,917
that you would know that I'm creative.

361
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,922
Oh, I see, Ben.

362
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,382
You don't realize that
you're creative, too.

363
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,093
It's all right.

364
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:09,346
Whether or not you're creative,
I think you're really talented.

365
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:13,684
Well, I think you're really
talented, too, obviously.

366
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,312
I mean...

367
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:17,437
Flatterer.

368
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,231
- I have some mask work to do.
- Okay.

369
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:20,357
- I'll catch up with you later?
- All right.

370
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,609
We gotta try this on, don't we?

371
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,485
No time like the present.

372
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:30,283
You're insane, Graham. Ayn Rand?

373
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,910
She's not attractive.

374
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:35,748
Her talent, Warner. I'm
attracted to her talent.

375
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,291
Well, she certainly has a brilliant mind.

376
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,877
But who needs a woman with a mind?

377
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,005
That's so true!

378
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:44,339
Hi, boys.

379
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:47,300
- Blake.
- Courtney.

380
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:49,845
Your collar's looking particularly
popped this afternoon.

381
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:53,599
So, um, word around camp is that
you and Katie are on the rocks.

382
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:56,226
Well, you heard wrong. We've never
been stronger, Katie and I.

383
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,229
'Cause, see, I thought I heard she
wasn't coming to TigerForm tonight

384
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:03,400
so she could eat hot dog wieners with
those peasants from Camp Firewood.

385
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:06,111
Katie will be at TigerForm tonight.
You'll see.

386
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,780
You'll all see!

387
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:11,574
Jeez, okay.

388
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,661
Don't have to get in such a snit.

389
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,454
He's like my father when he
gets into the Planter's Punch.

390
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,545
Well, if anything changes...

391
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,973
you know where to find me.

392
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:37,851
I'll be on the boat with Whitney.

393
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,311
Rowing crew.

394
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,814
If we can find a coxswain.

395
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,613
She is a minx.

396
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,199
Socialist!

397
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:59,539
It says here, in 1973, a plane
was on its way to Malta.

398
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:02,084
But that plane crashed.

399
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,252
There were five passengers on the flight,

400
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:08,465
four of whom were burnt to a crisp,
their bodies unidentifiable.

401
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:11,760
But one passenger's body was never found.

402
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:14,972
It seems that your fiancé
left that crash unharmed,

403
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:18,058
and then he took the identity of
one of the passengers who died.

404
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:19,476
What are you saying?

405
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,730
Your fiancé's name isn't Jonas Jurgensen.

406
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:25,398
- Then what is it?
- Gene Jenkinson.

407
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,900
Who is Gene Jenkinson?

408
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:31,154
It says here, he was in the Vietnam War,

409
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:33,156
and he loves to cook.

410
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,742
There's not much else.

411
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:38,578
Oh, Gail... I hate to see
you in pain like this.

412
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,207
Thank you, Jeff.

413
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,377
- Please, call me by my middle name.
- Which is?

414
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,087
Also Jeff.

415
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,797
Jeff, it is.

416
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,969
Ladies and gentlemen,

417
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:57,555
the two new leads for <i>Electro-City</i> are...

418
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:01,601
Katie Finnerty and Logan St. Bogan!

419
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:06,814
Oh, my God!

420
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:10,110
Excuse me. Oh, my God.

421
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:12,863
Okay.

422
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:16,241
Um, so many people to thank. My parents,

423
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,951
Roger and Wendy.

424
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,495
My voice coach...

425
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,418
Sir Maxwell Dickinson.

426
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:31,089
My speech instructor, Dan Larson MacLeod.

427
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:35,803
My tap guy...

428
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,472
Is it too late to audition?

429
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:41,558
- Yes, Andy, it's too late.
- No...

430
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,436
No, it's not.

431
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:46,688
Let's see what you got, kid.

432
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:48,690
Claude?

433
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,110
You cannot recast.

434
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,362
You literally, mere seconds
ago, cast me in the role.

435
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:56,573
- Stuff it, Logan.
- Oh, fuck you!

436
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:57,991
Fuck you!

437
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,916
Take your time, son.
Whenever you're ready.

438
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:08,293
Andy has never done anything
on the stage before.

439
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,170
Raw clay can be good, Susie.

440
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,005
Sticks to your hands
when it's on the wheel,

441
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,799
but it glazes like a dream.

442
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:17,427
This is a song I wrote.

443
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,471
It's called "Champagne Eyes."

444
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:23,516
<i>♪ These champagne eyes, they're trouble ♪</i>

445
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,938
<i>♪ My thoughts are on the ceiling ♪</i>

446
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:32,192
<i>♪ My gun is shot and wet ♪</i>

447
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:34,987
<i>♪ No surprise ♪</i>

448
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:37,697
Wow.

449
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,910
<i>♪ The lights are out, the money's gone ♪</i>

450
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:46,623
<i>♪ One breast is badly listing ♪</i>

451
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:53,588
<i>♪ Still you waltz around

452
00:23:55,632 --> 00:24:02,555
<i>♪ Forever waltz about on champagne eyes ♪</i>

453
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:25,495
<i>♪ And still we walk around... ♪</i>

454
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,626
Champagne eyes.

455
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,631
It's all I got, um...

456
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,342
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

457
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:42,512
Well, I won't lie to you, Andy.
You have talent.

458
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:44,306
But you're rough around the edges.

459
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:47,392
- So, did I get the part?
- Oh, you got the part, all right, mister.

460
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:48,768
But what about me?

461
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:50,645
I'm the best damn hoofer
you got, and you know it.

462
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,189
Don't worry, Logan.

463
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:55,442
You will play the part of the Warden.

464
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:59,196
The Warden? But
he only has one song.

465
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,989
Well, I suggest you make it a doozy.

466
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:03,908
Remember, no small parts.

467
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,411
Awesome.

468
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:07,955
Ladies and gentlemen...

469
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:11,249
the show is cast.

470
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:17,464
Hey.

471
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:20,675
So I guess we're gonna get
to do some hard neckin'.

472
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:23,345
Not everything's about making out, Andy.

473
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:26,764
I hope you learn to take
something seriously for once.

474
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,315
I hope you all had fun this afternoon,

475
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,027
and I also hope you learned a
thing or two about the mind.

476
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:42,615
To paraphrase the late Albert Einstein,

477
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:46,784
"We cannot solve our
problems with thinking.

478
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:50,997
We can only solve our problems by doing."

479
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,390
Mr. Brazen?

480
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:10,058
I'm sorry, we didn't mean to scare you.

481
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:12,060
We just want to tell you
how amazing that was.

482
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:13,270
Well, thank you very much.

483
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:16,982
The way you got Malcolm to eat all those
pieces of bread like that was hilarious.

484
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:18,191
Right on. Very fun.

485
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,027
And that was like four
entire loaves of bread.

486
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,154
He's gonna have the most
raging stomachache.

487
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:23,613
- So funny.
- Right on.

488
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:24,864
Very fun.

489
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:27,158
Well, good luck with your
show at Camp Snow Ledge.

490
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:30,037
Thank you. I will go do my
show at Camp Snow Ledge now.

491
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,290
If you'll excuse me...

492
00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:36,000
- Ow, ow...
- Let's get out of here.

493
00:26:36,084 --> 00:26:37,210
Ow, ow, ow...

494
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,461
What are you doing?

495
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:40,630
There is no Camp Snow Ledge.
I made that up.

496
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:41,714
- You mean...
- Yes.

497
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:42,924
You lied to Jackie Brazen?

498
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:45,843
No, I mean, I think the
government is on to us...

499
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,016
Run!

500
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:54,727
- Come on.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

501
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,270
- Hurry up.
- You hurry up.

502
00:26:56,354 --> 00:26:57,605
- Faster.
- I'm running. You run.

503
00:26:57,689 --> 00:26:59,065
- I'm running.
- You call that running?

504
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:01,109
That's not running. I'm running.

505
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,031
Don't stop. Stay with me.

506
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,163
