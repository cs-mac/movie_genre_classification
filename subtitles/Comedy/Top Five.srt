00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,984
I could take one, but every one?

157
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,386
"Every one," really?

158
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,654
Come on, man.
Look at this shit.

159
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,891
"Andre Allen is the most
pathetic character

160
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,093
"in cinema today."

161
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,529
"If he ever put out
another movie,

162
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,630
"I would not see it

163
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,665
"if it was playing
in my glasses."

164
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,535
Why the fuck would somebody
say some shit like that?

165
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,170
That's James Nielson.
That's what he does.

166
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,506
He's a critic.
And he won't show his face.

167
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,940
No, fuck James Nielson.

168
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,442
He's been ripping my shit
apart for years.

169
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,843
The next one's a chick.

170
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,745
She just wants to do
a profile piece on you.

171
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,147
And I think she's
a big fan of yours.

172
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,681
Fuck the <i> times.</i>

173
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,483
You're gonna do this, okay?

174
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,185
I'm not going to go back and
forth with you about this.

175
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,587
We talked about it.
It's <i> The New York Times.</i>

176
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,123
Do you hear me?
<i>The New York Times!</i>

177
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,994
<i>That movie</i> Crossbusters,
<i>what'd I say to you, Andre?</i>

178
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,864
That little baseball movie,
what I say to you, Andre?

179
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,599
You said it wasn't a good idea.

180
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,101
Now, when you tell me
you wanted to do that movie

181
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,036
about the Haitian revolution,
Andre, what'd I say to you?

182
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,838
<i>You said it wasn't
a good idea, okay?</i>

183
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,507
No. No, no, no, no,
you're wrong, Andre.

184
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,709
That's not what I said. I
said, "nigga, is you crazy?"

185
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,878
<i>I emailed it!
I sent the email out</i>

186
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,881
with a bunch of racial slurs
and bad English

187
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,149
to my own company account!

188
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,517
The reason why I did it, Andre,

189
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,885
was 'cause
I wanted to be on file

190
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,754
to show people
that I was against this!

191
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,490
I was against this project!
I... I jeopardized my job.

192
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,025
You know that?
I almost ruined my job.

193
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,860
What are you talking about?

194
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,995
A nigga can't get fired
for saying "nigga" to a nigga.

195
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,131
You've never been more wrong.
A nigga can...

196
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,769
A nigga can get fired
for saying "nigga" to a nigga.

197
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,237
A nigga don't run
this damn company.

198
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,239
Matter of fact,
if niggas at this company

199
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,208
found out that I was using
the word nigga in here,

200
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,876
my black ass would be
on the street.

201
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,880
<i>I guess you're right, nigga,
but I don't want to do this.</i>

202
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:06,117
I hate the <i>Times.</i>
Everything I do, they trash.

203
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,688
<i>Look, Andre, they're gonna
write the story anyway.</i>

204
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,057
<i>And I mean, it's hard enough
getting you a job as it is.</i>

205
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,892
I mean, it's not like everybody's
knocking on your door for work.

206
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,894
It's really hard to get you work.
You know that, I know that.

207
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,998
Are you kidding me? Listen, Andre,
the wedding is the best thing

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,066
that you got going right now.

209
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,534
And let's be honest.

210
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,102
Andre, if this thing flops,

211
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,670
we could be talking
<i>Dancing With the Stars,</i> man.

212
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,172
Dancing With the fucking Stars?

213
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,507
Yes. <i> Dancing With the Stars.</i>

214
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,875
That's where
you're at right now.

215
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,544
<i>Is follow you around
for one day.</i>

216
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,279
Let them follow you around!

217
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,647
You know, if I get the word out,

218
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,516
this movie could
still be a big hit.

219
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,618
<i>It could be like</i>
<i>a Haitian</i> Django.

220
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,887
If you say so, Andre,
then yes. Hold on. Hold on.

221
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,722
Hey! Hey! Hey!

222
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,923
What is going on?
Where's everyone running to?

223
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,958
Zoolander's in
the conference room!

224
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,159
Ben Stiller's in
the conference...

225
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,028
These white people
don't tell me shit!

226
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,230
Yo, silk! Where's the car?

227
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,599
It's in range.

228
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,668
Hey, how'd it go
with Charlie Rose?

229
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,737
Chelsea Brown.

230
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,639
From the <i> Times.</i>

231
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,607
Yes, from the <i> Times.</i>

232
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,644
How'd it go? I thought you
were supposed to be watching.

233
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,779
You a real journalist,
or like Miss Detroit?

234
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,214
Funny.

235
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,149
Look, they just told me that
you're gonna be doing this.

236
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,717
I'm sorry if I'm late.

237
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,919
Congratulations on the wedding.

238
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,320
And the movie.

239
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,721
You know, some friends and I

240
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,924
saw you a few years back
at purchase.

241
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:22,561
Thank you very much
for doing this interview.

242
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,995
Why, 'cause your boy
James Nielson

243
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,564
said he wouldn't watch
my next movie

244
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,132
if it was playing
in his glasses?

245
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,867
James.

246
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:33,271
Hey, who would have thought Google
would have made that possible, right?

247
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,906
Look, you're about
a half hour late.

248
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,975
If I were you,
I would get started.

249
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,145
Okay. I just need
to go home first.

250
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,280
They just told me
that we were doing this.

251
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,882
I don't have my recorder.

252
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,184
Recorder?
What are you, Lois Lane?

253
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,320
Just use your phone.
No, you don't understand.

254
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:49,588
I... I can't do an
interview without it.

255
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,870
It's kind of my thing.
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,600
You take these?

257
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,368
Chelsea: Uh...

258
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,070
Yes.

259
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,640
Andre: They're good.

260
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,308
Chelsea: I do photography
on the side.

261
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,277
I do a little poetry
on the side,

262
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,778
I do a little music on the side.

263
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,246
That's nice.

264
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,715
It's always good to make sure

265
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,951
you never get too good
at any one thing.

266
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,086
Chelsea: Okay,
I'm almost done.

267
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,220
I just need to change
really quickly.

268
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,388
I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend

269
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,790
for his birthday.
A word of advice.

270
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,092
Never surprise anyone.

271
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,693
Chelsea: Why?

272
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,696
Hey, I call my mother
before I go over,

273
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,698
'cause I don't want to
walk in there one day

274
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,934
and catch her hugging up
on some other kid!

275
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,770
Hi. Are you going to marry
Princess Erica on TV?

276
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,405
Can I see your phone?

277
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,976
Did you have a baby
when you were 10?

278
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,679
Chelsea: Don't take
his phone. Mom?

279
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,781
Okay, what are you doing
with my phone?

280
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,249
Playing <i> Angry Birds.</i>

281
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,184
But I don't have <i>Angry Birds.</i>

282
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,686
You do now.

283
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,055
Grace? Go finish
your work, <i> Mamita.</i>

284
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,823
And give the man back his phone.

285
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,693
Hi.
Hi.

286
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,328
I'm Gladys, Chelsea's mother.

287
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,131
Are you ready for the big day?

288
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,299
Oh, the wedding.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,702
You're so lucky
you found someone.

290
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,004
I hear that being a cougar
is a big thing,

291
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,707
but I can't find anybody
that wants to be couged.

292
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,841
So, I read this stuff

293
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,109
to try to better understand men.

294
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,411
Listen to this.

295
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,680
"Men love it
when you gently..."

296
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,349
"...lick their..."
Okay, no more <i> Cosmo.</i>

297
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,084
Wait a minute. I thought
you wrote this one.

298
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,719
Wait, wait, get out of here.

299
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,354
So... so you are
a real journalist.

300
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,456
Gladys: I'm sorry, I didn't
know it was a secret.

301
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,358
Shakira Simmons? (STAMMERING) What's that?
Your stripper name?

302
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,893
Shakara Simmons.

303
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,829
I don't use my real name
for the fluffy stuff.

304
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,366
Okay, I found my flip,
and we can go now.

305
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,802
So what's up with
all this Cinderella stuff?

306
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,004
(ELEVATOR BELL DING) Um,
those are my daughter's.

307
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,140
A little girl's reading
<i>The Cinderella Effect.</i>

308
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,276
Okay, that one's mine.
Okay.

309
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,211
Don't you think it's kinda odd

310
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,480
that a grown woman
is still into Cinderella?

311
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,383
That a grown man is still
into the Yankees?

312
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,985
Yes, but the Yankees
are a real team.

313
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,455
A-rod is real? Okay, you
got me on that one.

314
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,157
And for your information,

315
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,026
my daughter is working
on a school project.

316
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,962
You know, where they have to
rewrite a classical story

317
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,198
and she's doing one on
the real Cinderella.

318
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,900
According to my child,

319
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,471
Cinderella was born a nanny
in the Bronx in 1995, okay?

320
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,806
Her mama was a nanny and her secret
father was the mean white landlord,

321
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,310
Cinderella had to do all the
things that a nanny has to do,

322
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,946
she had to cook and clean, and
do everything for her sisters.

323
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,749
And then one day,
prince came into town

324
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,318
and was doing a concert that
everyone wanted to attend.

325
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,886
But the landlord
forbid her to go,

326
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,756
so she waited
until her sisters left,

327
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,090
and then snuck into the concert

328
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,759
and was the prettiest
girl there.

329
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,327
Prince didn't want to hang
with anyone else,

330
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,528
and then she noticed that
her sisters were leaving

331
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,163
and she knew she had to go.

332
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,798
But she also knew

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,366
that she wanted
to see prince again.

334
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,401
So, she did what girls do

335
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,170
when they want
to see a guy again.

336
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,172
Hand job?

337
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,309
She left something.

Do you even know
what my movie's about?

385
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,080
It's about Dutty Boukman,

386
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,482
a self-educated slave
who, once in Haiti,

387
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,084
became one of the leaders
of the revolution

388
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,519
where Haitian slaves
killed over 50,000 whites.

Yay, dead white people.

390
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,257
Dutty did not shut up
and play nice.

391
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,992
You know, normally,
after someone says

392
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,960
they saw your movie,

393
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:59,564
they give you some sort
of opinion, you know...

394
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,433
They go, "oh, I saw your movie
and I thought it was good."

395
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,936
And you know, sometimes they don't
like your movie and they go,

396
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,005
"I saw your movie and I
thought it was interesting."

397
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,607
Yeah, it was interesting
how you ended the movie

398
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,142
before you showed

399
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,644
how the French
had cut his head off.

400

But I'd like to ask you
this question first.

401
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,051
How do you think being sober
has affected your career?

402
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,586
It hasn't.

403

Uh, I think it has.
I know it has.

00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,773
That's my shit right there.

622
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,078
Oh, my God.
Were you scared?

623
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,980
Yes, I was scared.
I'm naked

624
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,942
and a man walks in the room
and starts undressing.

625
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,585
That look good, man.

626
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:48,752
Hey, let me get some of that.
Oh, oh, oh.

627
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:49,887
Ow!
(LAUGHING)

628
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,956
Oh, hi, Jazzy.
Hey, Jazzy.

629
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,224
My dick was gone,

630
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,226
it looked like a button
on a mink coat.

631
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:56,660
Tammy: Yeah.
(LAUGHING) Yeah.

632
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,562
Tammy: Yeah,
daddy Dee's getting it!

633
00:24:58,564 --> 00:24:59,864
Who the motherfuckin' man
in Houston?

634
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,232
You're the motherfuckin' man!

635
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,701
Rhonda: You're the man.
We love you.

636
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,135
Jazz: Look at that tow truck.
Look at that tow truck.

637
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,570
Back that thing up on it.
(RHONDA MOANING)

638
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,073
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.

639
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,075
Rhonda: Harder. Harder.
Jazz: Oh, yeah.

640
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:14,078
Jazzy Dizzle. Gettin' it.
(LAUGHING)

641
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,213
Andre: <i> I wanted to run away,</i>
<i>but I was naked.</i>

642
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,916
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.

643
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:19,950
How did you feel?

644
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,052
I was terrified.

645
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,521
(JAZZ LAUGHING) Yeah, yeah.

646
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,056
Hey, bitch.
Get your ass over here.

647
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,758
Me?
Mm-hmm.

648
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,228
Coming, daddy.

649
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,997
Andre: <i> These girls that</i>
<i>I thought were angels</i>

<i>two seconds ago,</i>

651
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,100

<i>I've ever seen.</i>
(MOANING)

653
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,169
Oh, yeah.

(GRUNTING)

655
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,773
What'd the room smell like?

656
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,708
What did the room smell like?

657
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,776
What kind of question is that?

658
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,077
Come on.

659
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,147
Scared motherfucker ass
and smoked ribs.

660
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,182
But the most disgusting part...

661
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:55,252
Chelsea: <i> No!</i>
Andre: <i> Yes!</i>

662

I think I'm coming!

663
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,188
(SCREAMS)

664
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,290
Ahhh...

<i>old faithful.</i>

00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,029
Jazz: Oh...

668
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:08,032
It was just everywhere.

669
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,833
Like the garbage truck
had to come

670
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,602
and lay salt to get rid of it.

671
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,338
<i>So finally, they leave.</i>

672
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
I assume it's to do coke.

673
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,262
You know, people get
real stingy with their coke.

674

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hey, wassup?

00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,666
Where's Jazzy?

677
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,867
Uh, I don't know.

678
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,069
I thought you all
went somewhere.

679
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:48,639
You don't know where
your best friend Jazzy's at?

680
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,374
(SCOFFS) Best friend?

681
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,109
Hey, I just met him today.

682
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,178
He's not really my best friend.

683
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,081
I mean, is something wrong?
Is there a problem?

684
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,916
Yeah, there's a fucking problem.

685
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,951
Your best friend said
if we came over here

686
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,753
and fucked you, we'd get $1,000.

687
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,288
$1,000? What the...
Hey, hey, hey...

688
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,824
And now I cannot find his ass.

689
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:09,693
Hey, he ain't tell me shit,
and even if he did,

690
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,663
why would I pay you to fuck him?

691
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,131
I mean, I'm nasty,
but I'm not a freak!

692
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,700
I don't care!

693
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,136
You better get us our money
and soon, or I'm gonna yell

694
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,838
"rape" up in this bitch

695
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,374
and your ass is gonna
go to jail! Do you hear me?

696
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:25,242
I ain't givin' y'all...
Do you hear me?

697
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,410
I got nothing to do with Jazzy!

698
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,745
Both: Rape!

(SIREN WAILING)

I told you I'm the motherfuckin'
man in Houston, right?

701
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,886
If I didn't know that judge,
you might still be in there.

702
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,388
Look, I'm gonna drop
dede off at practice,

703
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,690
then get you back to the
hotel, you get some rest.

704
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,092
I mean, after Houston,

705
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,029
<i>I totally quit drinking.</i>

706
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,731
<i>From that point on,
I never had a drink again.</i>

707
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,936
No donuts! Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

708
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,673
Oh, there it is, let me be
your prisoner of love.

709
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,907
How about that? You know
you need to back up.

710
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,809
Ooh, lock me up!
Put the key in your bra!

with my teeth!

Yeah, Charles.

Hey, people are still at work.
It'll pick up tonight.

the jewelry store,

716
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,789
and I will check in
with you later, okay?

717
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,295
Here you go.

(CHUCKLES)

719
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,269
These aren't the rings.
They're not?

720
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,770
I mean, those are the rings,

721
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:30,974
Let me go get Michele.
I think she dealt with it.

722

Hey, excuse me, sir. No, no, no.
Oh, I just wanted...

Mr. Allen, hi.

724
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:41,185
Um, is there a problem
with your ring?

725
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,467
Well, there's
another ring there.

726
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,888
Ah, you're right.

727
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,457
I mean, we're just
getting married,

728

we're not winning
the super bowl.

729
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:52,296
Miss Long came by
earlier this week and, uh,

730
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,865
added onto the order.

731
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,267
Added to the order?

you when he is ready.

You good? You need a
coffee or anything?

737

No, I'm good.
All right, great.

738
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,826
So,

739
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,195
are you okay now?

740
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,331
I saw you yelling
on the phone earlier.

741
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,932
No, I'm fine.

742
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,769
What's on your mind?

743
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,804
Ask me a question.
Interview me.

744
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,172
Get in my business.

745
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,474
That's what I'm trying to do.
What happened?

746
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,043
Okay. Let me
ask you a question.

747
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,313
If a guy you loved
gave you a wedding ring,

748
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,350
a ring you said
you've always wanted,

749
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,418
would you exchange it because
your boss told you to?

750
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,954
Why'd you change the rings
without talking to me?

751
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,056
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

752
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,191
I meant to tell you.

753
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,473
I've been so busy,
I just forgot.

754
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,861
How does that make you feel?

755
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,096
I didn't say it was me,

756
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,098
I just said
if a guy you loved...

757
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,001
So this guy I love...

758
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,435
Which ring did he get me?

759
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,971
The network, those jerks,

760
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,907
they just thought they weren't
camera-friendly enough,

761
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:13,377
if I thought there was
gonna be a problem.

762
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,979
She's a reality star.
Everything's for sale.

763
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,948
Everything's not for sale.

764
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,418
Okay! You ready?

765
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,055
What's up?
This is Andre Allen

766
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,558

to satellite radio,

00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,028
I listen to Sirius Hits One.

768
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,431
That's, um,
that's good, just, uh...

769
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,633
Just make it a little funnier.

770
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,936
Funnier?
You're a funny guy.

771
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,372
Make it more funny.

772
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,975
Okay.

773
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,377
Hey, wassup, this is Andre Allen

and when I listen
to satellite radio,

775
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,982
I listen to Sirius Hits One!

776
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,387
Just, you know, say...
Just put a little, uh...

777
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,389
Put a little stank on it.

778
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,891
Stank?

779
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,560
Stank. Stank.

780
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,063
Stank?
Give it stank.

781
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,465
Okay, I don't really
know what you mean.

782
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,933
Uh, could you show me?

783
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:14,404
You're the funny... I'm not...
okay, all right. It's like...

784
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:18,008
Hey! This is Andre Allen,

785
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,612
and when I listen
to satellite radio... whoa!

786
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,414
I listen to Sirius Hits One!
Whoo!

787
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,216
It's a brand new movie.

788
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,518
<i>Uprize?
Uprize. Uprize.</i>

789
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,320
It's in theaters today.

790
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,256
You're playin'
a Haitian revolutionary?

791
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,291
This is a...
Homosexuals.

792
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,159
...homosexual radio station.
Yeah.

793
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,227
I just want to say,
"what's up?"

794
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,229
To all my Haitian fans

795
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,898
that listen to Opie and Anthony.

796
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,068
That Hammy the Bear is a
revolutionary out of Haiti?

797
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,037
Hammy's not in the movie.

798
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,505
They should let children
out of school

799
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,574
to see this movie. They
should show it in school.

800
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,443
First hundred gay people

801
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,079
get three dollars
off their tickets.

802
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,415
If you look at my comedy,
it was always serious.

803
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,317
Just prove your gayness...

804
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,919
How do we prove we're gay?
...And we...

805
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,187
I have some, uh, some goat meat.

806
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,623
I brought you some,
uh, Haitian food.

807
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,325
Goat meat.
Goat meat?

808
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,928
Spaghetti with ketchup...
Cumia: (LAUGHS) What is...

809
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,497
...which Haitians actually
eat for breakfast.

810
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:16,500
Cumia: Wow, really?
Yes. This... this...

811
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:21,204
Yes, spaghetti with ketchup is the
cheerios of Haiti. (ALL LAUGH)

812
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,107
Now, is there going to
be a <i> Hammy the Bear 4?</i>

813
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,943
Andre: I hate
Hammy the Bear.

814
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,612
I gave you three
<i>Hammy the Bears.</i>

815
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,547
I want people
to take me serious.

816
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,483
I want people to stop walking
up to me on the street

817
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,552
and making bear sounds.

818
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,088
Andre, what do you have to say
to the white audience here

819
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,558
that is insulted, uh, disgusted,

820
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,095
by your movie, watching 50,000
of their people being killed?

821
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:48,098
Uh, George Bush kills
a lot of brown people.

822
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,366
Nobody had a problem with that.

823
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,467
Cumia: It wasn't a movie.

824
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,568
He killed some...

825
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,003
Like, really killed them!
Cumia: Oh.

826
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,439
I fake-kill white people
and it's a problem.

827
00:32:55,441 --> 00:33:00,978
How many of these white people
actually die on screen?

828
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,047
Uh, probably two,
three thousand.

829
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,148
That's it, dawg?

830
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,285
Stank.
Stank.

831
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,125
Nice and funny. Go!

832
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,561
Wassup, motherfuckers?

833
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,997
This is motherfucking
Andre Allen!

834
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,399
And when I listen
to satellite radio,

835
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:25,068
or scratch my nuts, that is,

836
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,172
I listen to Sirius
motherfucking 101,

837
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,207
biatch!

838
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,410
First take was good.

839
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,245
I was wrong on the stank note.

840
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:38,548
First take had a lot of
wonderful stuff in there.

841
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,089
Andre: I hope you're writing
nice things about me.

842
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,157
Let's go.

843

00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,466
MAN 1: What's up, dawg?
MAN 2: Hammy!

845
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,170
MAN 2: Hammy,
don't get brand new.

Hollywood! Hollywood!

852
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,089
Roll out the red carpet.
There it is.

853
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,558
Hollywood, come on, boy.
(LAUGHING)

I thought you'd be in L.A.,

855
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,063
you know, getting ready
for that big wedding.

856
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,731
I see commercials for it
all the time.

857
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,733
Yeah, yeah, I'm in town

858
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,268
just doing some press
for this movie.

859
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,103
I leave tonight.

Uh, Chelsea here

That's why you bring

What, you telling her
how bad you had it?

Your next wife,

00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,364
is she going to be, uh, white
or she gonna be Asian?

00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,801
Still not funny, man.

Oh, it's only funny when
you say mean shit, right?

or you was selling.

mention that five grand you owe me.

you're gonna get yours
off top, my man.

have a income first

before you get a check.
You can't tax zero.

00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:28,945
Soon.

939
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,714
That's what you said last time.

940
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,916
And you know what, I'm still
waiting on my invitation.

941
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,619
Hey. I'm not in charge
of the guest list. Okay?

Tell the truth. Tell the truth.
That bitch don't like me.

Oh, she asks about me?

She asks about you all the time.

946
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:44,628
What does she say?

947
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,296
She say, "how your
big friend doing?"

948
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,998
Lisa: My big...

949
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,566
Is that what that
bitch think about me?

950
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,368
I'm big like that?
For real?

I want to, but general

Erica picked out everything.

967
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,965
They're even
giving out gift bags.

968
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,402
Gift bags?
Nigga, kill yourself.

969
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,538
What's wrong, man?
What's wrong with a gift bag?

970
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,806
They got lots
of cool shit in there.

971
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,341

Matter of fact,

if you take it off,
you won't even sweat.

982
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,564
I can take yours off, too,
if you want me to.

983
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,800
Nah, that's okay, but thanks.

984
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,369
Nigga, put your
bracelet back on!

985
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,104
I don't want the cops
running in here!

Me? I was there first time
he got on stage.

Chelsea: How was he?
He sucked.

988
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,612
Nothing about him was funny.

989
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:12,882
He was like a bag
of dead kittens.

Lisa: That's some real shit.

Fred: 'Cause Tupac was
headed for the Oscar.

994
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,559
Or Tupac would be
one of our political leaders.

995
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,095
Tupac might be
a political leader,

996
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,663
if he was alive.

997
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:29,466
But then again, Tupac might be

998
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,768
in a Tyler Perry movie
right now. So you don't know.

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,937
You don't know.
Fred: You never know.

He might be...
Tupac might be

1001

in a Tyler Perry movie.

I gotta agree with
that shit right there.

I would hope he's a senator.

1004

Scott down a flight of stairs.

the funniest?

"what's wrong with her?"

your life would be
had you stayed together?

What kind of shit was that?

If I'd have known how
successful he was gonna be,

I woulda built him
my own PlayStation.

01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:41,675
Definitely something
I would give a man.

2177
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:42,876
I got a Mexican <i> chica.</i>

2178
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:44,844
She loves candles.
She's a candle bitch.

2179
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,146
What else you got?

2180
01:34:46,148 --> 01:34:47,681
Uh...

2181
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:51,117
Gourmet nuts.

2182
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:53,286
You know I love some nuts.
That's for me. Give me those.

2183
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:54,220
Andre: There you go.

2184
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:55,955
Hopefully honey-roasted.

2185
01:34:55,957 --> 01:34:58,258
When they put the honey on the nuts?
Mmm-hmm.

2186
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,926
That's a whole different
world right there.

2187
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:01,227
(CONTINUES TALKING)
And let's see.

2188
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:03,930
A gift certificate for...

2189
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,265
Silk: That's when they took
it to a new level.

2190
01:35:05,267 --> 01:35:06,399
You know me, I'm a snacker.

2191
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:07,734
Now, if they could find a way

2192
01:35:07,736 --> 01:35:09,769
to put the honey
inside the, uh...

2193
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:10,870
Some kind of cloning shit,
I don't know.

2194
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:11,905
Is that cloning?
Mmm-hmm.

2195

2196
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,452
Yo, Silk.

2197
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:07,160
You want the top five?
ALL: Yes!

2198
01:36:07,162 --> 01:36:08,294
MAN: Yes.

2199
01:36:08,296 --> 01:36:10,163
Here it is.

2200
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:11,998
Sugarhill Gang,

2201
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,466
Eminem...
Right.

2202
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:15,335
Wale,

2203
01:36:15,337 --> 01:36:17,337
Ice Cube...
Man: Whoa!

2204
01:36:17,339 --> 01:36:18,872
...and Sir Mix-a-Lot!
(ALL CLAMORING)

2205
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,540
Yes!

2206

"Put 'em on the glass"!
