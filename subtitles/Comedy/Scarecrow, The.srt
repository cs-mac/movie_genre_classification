1
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,051
- Miranda.
- Jude?

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,591
I'm so sorry.

3
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,115
I hope you know the whole town's talking
about you walking out of church today.

4
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,884
Yeah, well, they'll talk about
somebody else tomorrow, right?

5
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,987
What's wrong?

6
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,061
The crops are dying of thirst.
I gotta fix this pump.

7
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,191
I don't care about our crops.
I care about you.

8
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,664
I was raised on a farm.
You think I'd be good at this by now.

9
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,466
You are good at it.

10
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,608
Well, you're a great father.

11
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,840
That must count for something, huh?

12
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:39,510
Well, as soon as great father
pays 40,000 a year, I'll be fine with it.

13
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,377
John, come on.

14
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,890
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,187
Wanna kiss and make up?

16
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,635
Hey, you got something on your nose
right there.

17
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,970
All right, I'll go make lunch.

18
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,215
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

19
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,686
All right, come help me with lunch.
Come on.

20
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,444
Michael wants you to tuck him in.

21
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,873
How long did it take
before they shut off the power last time?

22
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,783
- Two months.
- They're late.

23
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,759
You are all knotted up.

24
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,298
You need to relax. Come to bed.

25
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,571
I'd love to.

26
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,076
But you're not going to.

27
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,607
I just... Let me finish this, all right?
Then I'll come up.

28
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,248
All right.

29
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,885
Good night.

30
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,247
What's wrong?

31
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,951
- Should I be worried about you and Mom?
- Why?

32
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:58,880
- You slept on the couch last night.
- No, baby, I was up late paying bills.

33
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,751
I accidentally fell asleep.

34
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,889
You've been accidentally falling asleep
on the couch a lot lately.

35
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,842
- Mr. Rollins.
- Hey, Randy.

36
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,642
Yeah, Mr. Fitterson wanted a word,
if you're not too...

37
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,236
I get to guess?

38
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,844
Yeah, of course.

39
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,152
Guess the weight and your purchase is free.

40
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,454
65 pounds, 15 ounces.

41
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,258
66 pounds, 2 ounces.

42
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,053
That figures. Just put them on my tab.

43
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,997
Mr. Rollins, I can't. You're supposed to...

44
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,229
Never mind. I'll put them on your tab.

45
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,400
Randy, I thought I told you.

46
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,675
Leave those bags for now, Rollins.
You and I, we need to have a word.

47
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,712
I'll be right back.

48
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,157
Lindsey, let's go. Come on.

49
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,963
Don't be like that, John.
I'm trying to run a business here.

50
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,229
I'm not the bad guy here.

51
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,206
You tell your father to pay his bills,
this won't happen.

52
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,572
You're a class act, Jim.

53
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,304
Lindsey, let's go.

54
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,543
Dad?

55
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,977
Dad?

56
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,827
Dad!

57
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,420
- Hey, munchkin.
- Who's he?

58
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,634
It's not a he. It's an it. It's a scarecrow.

59
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,428
I don't like it.

60
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,766
- Well, hopefully the crows won't, either.
- The crows?

61
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,606
Yeah, that's how it gets its name.
It scares crows.

62
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,239
It's bad, Daddy.

63
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,545
It's not bad. It's not good.

64
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,612
It's just a bunch of clothes
stuffed with straw.

65
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,282
You all right?

66
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,894
Please, Daddy, get rid of it.

67
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,725
Okay.

68
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,769
I won't put it up, all right?

69
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,270
- Promise?
- Scout's honor.

70
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,641
How about another driving lesson?

71
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,610
Mom said I can't drive the tractor.
It's too dangerous.

72
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,573
You're a natural. We won't tell Mom.

73
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,819
You better get rid of it first.

74
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,006
Jesus Christ.

75
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,441
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

76
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,741
Since when do you use his name in vain?

77
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,875
You startled me.
What are you doing back there?

78
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,813
I'm just getting this old stuff ready to sell.

79
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,154
Won't bring in much,
maybe some grocery money,

80
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,954
but every little bit counts.

81
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,587
- Who's gonna buy that old junk?
- Tommy said he'd buy it.

82
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,866
He's gonna use it for his rental properties.
He said it makes it more homey.

83
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,028
You sure spend a lot of time
with Tommy lately.

84
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,571
- Well, that's something.
- What's something?

85
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,074
You being jealous. Means you still care.

86
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,382
I'm not jealous. Of course I still care.

87
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,683
So, what's the verdict?

88
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,825
Well, it's not good.

89
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,591
If we harvest now,
maybe we can sell about half.

90
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:22,623
If I wait for the rain,
the crows may not leave anything at all.

91
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,769
You'll make it work. You always do.

92
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,587
Shit.

93
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,529
Damn.

94
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:19,283
Lord, if this is your will, then I'll try...
I'm really trying.

95
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,491
Forget it.

96
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,698
You're Rollins, right?

97
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,531
Sorry about the trespassing.

98
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,666
- I'm Jude Weatherby.
- Weatherby.

99
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,200
A sharecropper. I'm working
the widow Lockett's spread till harvest.

100
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,110
Weatherby. That sounds really...

101
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,172
Your family used to own
a lot of land around here.

102
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,014
Yeah, until the banks came along.

103
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,055
It's a hell of a thing,
going to war with the rich.

104
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,350
Here.

105
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:03,885
- I brung you a little neighborly gesture.
- Yeah, I don't... Thank you.

106
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,126
I figured, since we're gonna be neighbors,

107
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,497
I should get the initial trespassing
out of the way.

108
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,330
You can trespass around here anytime.

109
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,138
Well, thanks.

110
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,208
Nice setup you got here.

111
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,403
Yeah, except for the crows.
They're killing me.

112
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:24,973
Yes, sir, the corn matures,
and the crows come out of the woodwork.

113
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,276
Nasty creatures.

114
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,984
They shit where they eat, you know?

115
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,047
Trust me, I know.

116
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,094
Well, that's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

117
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,760
- Yeah, I was just about to get rid of it.
- Ugly son of a... Get rid of it?

118
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,265
Why would you want to do that?

119
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,066
I think I need about 50 of those
to do any good.

120
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:51,733
You're thinking too much.
You're a farmer, right?

121
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,202
All you can do is plant your seeds.

122
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,008
The reaping what you sow comes later.

123
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,876
Same goes for a scarecrow, don't it?

124
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,084
You hang your scarecrow,
and the rewards come later.

125
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:51,360
<i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>

126
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,326
Michael?

127
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,306
- Hey, were you playing on the field today?
- No, I wasn't.

128
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,878
- What's wrong with your brother?
- He's mad at you.

129
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,082
Something about a scarecrow.

130
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,557
- Where are you going?
- Movie night at Cindy's house.

131
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,656
All right. Go. Have fun.

132
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,677
Hey. I kept your supper warm in the oven.

133
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,421
Crops are dying, crows are eating our corn,
the water pump's busted,

134
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,721
now we got kids in our field.

135
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,860
- Kids?
- Yeah.

136
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,660
What?

137
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,497
John, I know
you've been under a lot of stress,

138
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,276
but why is there a six-pack in the fridge?

139
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,572
New neighbor brought it over.

140
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,247
- Didn't want to be rude.
- New neighbor?

141
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,477
Yeah, he's working
the Lockett tobacco farm.

142
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,144
Nice enough guy.

143
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,817
- You kept the beer because...
- In case he stops by. I'll offer him one.

144
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,956
Get out of the heat.

145
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,063
Weather said there's gonna be a front
moving in later in the week.

146
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,225
Yeah?

147
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,271
- Soda?
- Sure.

148
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,341
- Why are you being so nice to me?
- Why are you being so grumpy?

149
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,041
- I guess I've been a bear lately, huh?
- Grizzly.

150
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,479
Yeah. Just ignore me.

151
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,077
I don't want to ignore you.

152
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,847
I want you to come to me
when you're stressed.

153
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,256
You're beautiful.
You've always been beautiful.

154
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,496
Everybody knew
you'd get out of this dead-end town.

155
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,157
Why would I wanna do that?

156
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,534
I don't know. You could have married
somebody rich, a banker, lawyer...

157
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,506
You could have married Tommy.

158
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:53,943
Car lot, property.
I mean, what's he worth now?

159
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,974
- I got you pregnant.
- Enough.

160
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,982
I don't ever want to hear you
talk like that again.

161
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,018
Lindsey is the greatest gift
you have ever given me.

162
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,988
You were too young.

163
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,220
I stole your youth.

164
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:16,199
I love my life, I love my kids, and I love you.

165
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,098
Come here. Kiss me.

166
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,577
Hey.

167
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,686
Hey, Rollins. Hey.

168
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,767
Did you drag me all the way out here
on purpose?

169
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,039
I mean, look at my shoes.

170
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,110
You know,
I'm not here to take away your farm, John.

171
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,912
Good. Grab a hoe. You can help me out.

172
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,043
Come on.

173
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,815
You gotta give me something
to go back to the board with.

174
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,686
Why? You gave me a 60-day extension.

175
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,985
Well, yeah,
and a lot of good it's gonna do you.

176
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,185
I mean, look at this.
You're never gonna sell this crop.

177
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,592
Did you even consider irrigation?

178
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,631
Yeah. I came to you six months ago
for a loan for a water pump.

179
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,495
You turned me down, remember?

180
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:39,003
Well, you know what, John?
Times are tough on everyone.

181
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,070
That's a nice watch.

182
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,441
You know, John,
I think you should really consider selling.

183
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,909
Look around.

184
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,742
I wouldn't even make half the money back
that I already owe the bank.

185
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,147
And what if you could? I may have a buyer,

186
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,518
and I think I can convince him
to make an offer

187
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,522
that would allow you to walk away debt free.

188
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,251
I don't know.

189
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,394
Man, come on, John.

190
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,762
Listen, I'm here as your friend.

191
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,197
I have a meeting with the board tomorrow,

192
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,828
and I have no option
but to recommend foreclosure.

193
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,236
You're gonna lose your farm, John,

194
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,504
and I'm doing everything I can
to soften the blow.

195
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,011
- Lf I sold, how much would you make?
- Come on.

196
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,013
Will you quit being so stubborn? It's over.

197
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,016
Think of your wife and kids.

198
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,054
Don't mention my family. We're not moving.

199
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,759
My crows are dead. My luck is changing.

200
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,584
I'll bring the harvest in on time.

201
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,556
Okay, John. We'll see.

202
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,754
Hey, you got the irrigation working.

203
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,630
Supper's on the stove.

204
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,796
Kids are out, so it's just you and me tonight.

205
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,798
John.

206
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,739
John.

207
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,543
John, dinner's gonna...

208
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,388
John, come on.

209
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,388
I should go down.

210
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,585
Don't.

211
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,899
John. John!

212
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,065
Stop it. John, you're hurting me!

213
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,630
Stop. Stop. John.

214
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,832
John.

215
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,979
What is wrong with you?

216
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,683
I'm sorry.

217
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,576
Listen, if he won't sell,
I'll convince the board to foreclose.

218
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,342
Well, relax.
I've known guys like Rollins before.

219
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,879
Yeah. He's stupid,
and he's easy to manipulate.

220
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,481
Well, yeah.

221
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,259
Right.

222
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,127
Yeah.

223
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,605
Yeah, well,
when he sees these foreclosure signs,

224
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,044
he'll be bending over backwards to sell.

225
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,240
Yeah.

226
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,176
Right. Right.

227
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,290
Tell him to draw up the papers.
I'll have them signed by tomorrow morning.

228
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,658
Right. Okay.

229
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,262
Okay. Yeah.

230
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,731
Sounds good.

231
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,461
No, everything's under control.

232
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,060
Yep.

233
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,671
Hey, I gotta call you back.

234
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,117
- Milton.
- Hey, John.

235
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,655
- You have a minute?
- Yeah, come on in.

236
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,188
I understand George Chapman
paid you a visit yesterday.

237
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,701
- Yeah, that's right.
- Can I ask what you two talked about?

238
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,761
We talked about the money I owe the bank.
Why?

239
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,103
Where were you last night between, say,
10:00 and 2:00?

240
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,040
He was here with me.

241
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,777
- And you were here all night?
- Yeah.

242
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,375
Yeah, he was here all night.
What is this about, Milton?

243
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,121
- George Chapman is dead.
- He's dead?

244
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,624
- Oh, dear.
- Found him this morning.

245
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,058
You knew he was foreclosing.

246
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,062
Well, he threatened as much yesterday but...

247
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,588
- John.
- I didn't think he'd pull it off.

248
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,029
You didn't see him at all last night?

249
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,474
You can't possibly think
that John had anything to do with it.

250
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,506
Look, don't jump the gun here.
I'm just following procedure.

251
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,708
It's probably an accident anyway.

252
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,707
What do you mean probably?

253
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,878
Hit-and-run, sort of, 18-wheeler.

254
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,890
Driver thought he hit an animal,
kept on rolling.

255
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,483
Didn't realize what he'd done
until he got to Valentine truck stop

256
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,724
and found Chapman wedged
beneath his truck.

257
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,923
Oh, dear Lord.

258
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,990
Yeah, but Valentine's,
that's three hours from here.

259
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,295
What makes you think he came here?

260
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,770
Found his SUV parked on the highway
near a foreclosure sign,

261
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,205
them Calvin Co shoes
he always boasted about in the road.

262
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,708
Figure that's where he was struck.

263
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,537
Well, I'm just following procedure.

264
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,483
I should get back.

265
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,984
- You know where to reach me.
- Yeah.

266
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,719
I wonder how Peggy and the kids are.

267
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,365
I can't even imagine.

268
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,359
Maybe I should fix them something.

269
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:02,236
Make them a roast or some French bread
and bring it over there.

270
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,573
- John.
- What?

271
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,112
I was just saying, maybe I should
fix something for Peggy and the kids,

272
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,447
- French bread and a roast.
- Why?

273
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,783
- Why? What do you mean, why?
- Why you gotta make them food?

274
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,885
- Well, I don't have to. I want to.
- I don't think they need our food.

275
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,224
He was one of the richest men in town.

276
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,166
I think they're gonna be all right without us.

277
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,227
- You could show a little more compassion.
- Look, I'm sorry.

278
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,829
I'm sorry he's dead.

279
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,707
At least he's not calling in the note
on the farm anymore, will he?

280
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,482
Hello?

281
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,358
<i>This I know</i>

282
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:06,825
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

283
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,800
Good God, man. What's gotten into you?

284
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,240
You lost? What's the matter?
You look like you seen a ghost.

285
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,611
- You believe in ghosts?
- Ghosts?

286
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,951
Are you serious?
You mean, like haunted houses and such?

287
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,582
Like fields, corn fields.

288
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,760
Well, I don't reckon
I've ever heard of no haunted corn field.

289
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,391
Now, what exactly did you see, anyway?

290
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,529
It's not what I saw. It's what I heard.

291
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,438
I heard screams,
and I heard a little girl singing, chanting.

292
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:01,000
Is that all?
I've heard me some voices plenty of times.

293
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,274
A man works in his field, gets tired...

294
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,516
Listen, that's not fatigue. It's...
I heard voices.

295
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,485
Okay, okay. Calm down.

296
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,416
And this.

297
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,356
Belonged to a man that was killed yesterday.

298
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,827
- George Chapman? That's his watch?
- Yeah. You know him?

299
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,855
You sure that's his?
There's a lot of fancy watches in the world.

300
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,194
Not out here. He was here visiting yesterday.

301
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,404
Well, there's your answer, then.

302
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,100
He must have lost it out there is all.

303
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,866
What about the voices?

304
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:38,838
John, you done found the silver lining.
Stop focusing on the cloud.

305
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,644
If it was me, I'd take that watch
and find me the nearest pawn shop.

306
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,580
No, my wife's gonna make me
give it back to his family.

307
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,588
Well, then we can see
who wears the pants in your house.

308
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,761
I tell my wife everything, Mr. Weatherby.

309
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,527
It's Jude. And suit yourself.

310
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,533
You know, she's probably right.

311
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:04,233
I'm sure that Chapman's millionaire widow
needs that watch more than you do.

312
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,270
You planted the seeds, John.

313
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:13,282
A smart man would consider it good fortune
or karma or whatever you want.

314
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,648
Pawn the watch, John.

315
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:20,383
Buy that wife of yours a dozen roses
or that daughter of yours a new dress.

316
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,887
You deserve it. We all do.

317
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,969
You mind telling your son
to stop playing on the tractor?

318
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,514
Why? He can drive it just fine.

319
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,710
I don't want him driving it at all.
And where are you going?

320
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,379
I need you to get rid of the throw rug
in the living room.

321
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,150
Call Tommy.
Throw it in the barn with the rest of the junk.

322
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,716
No, I can't sell it. It's filthy.
I need you to throw it out.

323
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,763
Well, you wear the pants in the family.
You decide.

324
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,044
Hey, Randy.

325
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,812
Mr. Rollins, please don't make this harder
than it has to be.

326
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:21,909
Right.

327
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,812
How much do I owe you?

328
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,088
- You're not gonna take a guess?
- Yeah, sure.

329
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,564
69 pounds, 3 ounces.

330
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,499
- That's right.
- Really?

331
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,828
Hey, everybody.
Mr. Rollins here just guessed it right.

332
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,202
Thank you for coming.

333
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,506
I don't know what to do. He's changed.

334
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,074
He stopped going to church.

335
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,686
He started cursing. He started drinking.

336
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:38,153
The way he reacted to Chapman's death
today, it was so cold.

337
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,362
Mary, Chapman was about to toss you all
to the curb.

338
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,624
I mean, I can't say for sure,

339
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,397
but I probably would have reacted
the same way he did.

340
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,494
No.

341
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,038
No, I don't think you would have.

342
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,970
You should have heard
the way he talked to me today.

343
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:55,136
The man that I married
never would talk to me that way.

344
00:41:56,213 --> 00:42:00,411
- Have you tried counseling?
- No.

345
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,177
John would never even consider that.
It's just not his thing.

346
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,418
You deserve better.

347
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,288
John hasn't exactly
kept his end of the bargain, has he?

348
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,831
Please don't.

349
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:24,067
I've seen you there, Cherry Tree Park,

350
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,239
where we first met.

351
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:33,080
I mean, I know you wonder
what could have been.

352
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,450
I think you should go, Tommy.

353
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,257
Yeah.

354
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,704
You and the kids have a place to stay
if you need one.

355
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,672
Thanks.

356
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,848
- Night.
- Night.

357
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,901
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

358
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,980
- I saw Tommy.
- Yeah.

359
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,381
- Did you guys talk?
- No.

360
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,822
He just stopped by
to see how we were doing.

361
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,958
We've been better, right?

362
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,057
Look, I know you've been
under a lot of pressure,

363
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,965
and you've been working really hard. I...

364
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,264
We've been better, right?

365
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,135
Yeah.

366
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,512
Look, I've been thinking.

367
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,146
Maybe we should get counseling.

368
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,814
- Really?
- Yeah.

369
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:22,357
I mean, I've been thinking about it
for a while.

370
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,058
I just didn't want to tell you.

371
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,029
Why? Why wouldn't you tell me?

372
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,235
I don't know.
Men are supposed to be strong, you know?

373
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,768
I thought maybe you'd think less of me
or something.

374
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,197
I would never think that.

375
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,075
- Yeah?
- I love you.

376
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,805
- Should we get counseling?
- Yeah.

377
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,852
- It would mean a lot to me.
- Yeah?

378
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,662
Thank you.

379
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,229
- Come to bed with me.
- I'll be up in a minute.

380
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,101
I got a few things to think about, you know.

381
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,032
Yeah.

382
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,703
Michael?

383
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,603
No!

384
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,077
Michael.

385
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,412
Michael!

386
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,194
Michael!

387
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,739
Michael, buddy,
what are you doing out here?

388
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,731
Get rid of it.

389
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,935
Get rid of what?

390
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,276
It knows that I know.

391
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,146
It knows that I know.

392
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,483
It knows that I know.

393
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,646
What are you talking about?

394
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,553
It knows that I know.

395
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,921
Come here. Come here.

396
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:03,935
It's you!

397
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,607
Michael?

398
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,590
Hey. Hey.

399
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,591
- You fell asleep out here, sweetie.
- Where's Michael?

400
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,428
He's taking a bath.

401
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,163
You all right?

402
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,464
Is he okay?

403
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,768
Yeah, he's okay. He's just...

404
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,972
Wow, would you look at your corn?

405
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,075
- It grew.
- It did.

406
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,384
You been drinking?

407
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:05,533
I made an appointment for us,
tonight at 7:00 for counseling, all right?

408
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,830
Perfect.

409
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,127
I just got a call.

410
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,724
What happened?

411
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,604
It's Tommy.

412
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,140
He's dead.

413
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,442
I know. I know. I couldn't believe it.

414
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,915
Milton doesn't believe it, either.

415
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:32,082
He hung himself in Cherry Tree Park.

416
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,154
Oh, Jesus.

417
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,659
What's that?

418
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,764
It's... I found it out in the field.

419
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,902
- That's Tommy's ring.
- What?

420
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:53,135
You heard us last night, didn't you?

421
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,677
- You heard us.
- I didn't hear anything.

422
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,211
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe you should go.

423
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,337
- I think you should leave.
- What?

424
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,439
You said that he was here.
Maybe he just dropped it out in the...

425
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,346
- No!
- Calm down.

426
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,918
- It's... It's gonna be all right.
- No! Please!

427
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,146
- Come on!
- No!

428
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,745
I can fix it, really!

429
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,313
Fix it? Tommy is dead. How can you fix that?

430
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,790
It's not about Tommy.

431
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,555
That's not what I mean.
That's not what I mean.

432
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,892
- Look, I think I know what's happening.
- Tell me.

433
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,226
- I can't tell you, Mary.
- Please.

434
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,823
I haven't figured it out yet, but...

435
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,870
Nothing's gonna happen to you, all right?
You just have to trust me.

436
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,565
All right? Can you do... Can you trust me?

437
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,807
- I don't know.
- We've been together 16 years, Mary.

438
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,569
Sixteen years.

439
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,874
I love you. Just trust me.

440
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,639
No, we're okay. It was just...

441
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,268
I was so shocked.

442
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,437
Oh, my God, what happened?

443
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,881
- Come on. I'll drive you to Doc Sanders.
- Just pull it out.

444
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:18,250
- You sure, John? It's gonna hurt.
- Yes. Just pull it out.

445
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,579
God.

446
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,381
John, that's gonna get infected.

447
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,982
Won't take us 20 minutes
to get to Doc Sanders.

448
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,458
I'll do it.

449
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,633
I guess you heard about Tommy.

450
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,104
Yeah. Mary told me.

451
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,474
Well, Mary, like I was saying,
he left a lot earlier last night.

452
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:46,515
Some of the boys said he got a call
that he was coming to see you.

453
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,245
- You called him?
- Yeah, that's right. I called him.

454
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,913
He is buying some furniture from us.

455
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,047
He was here maybe an hour.

456
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,720
Okay. I just thought it was odd, is all.

457
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,820
He never leaves early,
workaholic that he was.

458
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,429
Still, if he was contemplating...

459
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,163
He didn't seem depressed?

460
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,070
No, he was fine. Just like his old self.

461
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,767
Nothing odd or out of the ordinary?

462
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,832
No. No, nothing.

463
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,275
All right.

464
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,744
I should get back.

465
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,045
John, seriously,
you should get that hand looked at.

466
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,822
Why didn't you tell him?

467
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,363
Because I know how it would have looked.

468
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,491
How would it have looked?
I didn't do anything.

469
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,232
I didn't have any reason to hurt Tommy.

470
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,567
But people will think you did.

471
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,564
Look, John,

472
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:51,445
I've... I've been talking to Tommy about us,

473
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,609
our relationship.

474
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,043
I know. I'm sorry.

475
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,883
But it has been a really, really rough year,
and I just...

476
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,386
Well, I'm sorry.

477
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,459
But what if... What if he told somebody?

478
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,293
You know how this town gossips,

479
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,201
and I didn't want you holding
a dead man's ring in your hand.

480
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,102
Look, John, are you okay?

481
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,644
Can I take you to Doc Sanders now?

482
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,177
I'm not finished yet.

483
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,693
Who are you?

484
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,256
My daddy thought he would protect us.

485
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:55,464
Daddy was wrong.
He only protects the land, not the man.

486
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,631
What are you talking about?

487
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,910
Do you know where your wife
and children are?

488
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,180
Mary!

489
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,020
Kids?

490
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,094
Honey?

491
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:11,573
Take your brother inside
and both get ready for bed, all right?

492
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,707
Hi, honey.

493
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,708
What are you doing?

494
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,945
Getting rid of this.

495
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,589
I've tried, John,

496
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,682
I really have.

497
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,387
And I love you,

498
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,325
- but...
- But what?

499
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,036
If you're not even gonna make an effort,

500
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:48,066
I think maybe we should
spend some time apart.

501
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:49,970
What?

502
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,642
Come on,
our counseling appointment, John?

503
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,945
The one you didn't even bother
to show up to tonight?

504
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:57,748
- That was tonight?
- Yeah, it was tonight.

505
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,252
You told me to trust you.

506
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,883
You told me
that you were gonna fix everything.

507
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,951
So what have you been fixing?
What have you done all day?

508
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,621
Got rid of this.

509
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,325
Great.

510
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,359
- Great, that'll help.
- No, it will.

511
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,630
You don't understand, but it will.

512
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,366
Tommy is dead, and you had his ring.

513
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,466
Help me understand that.

514
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,475
- Hold on!
- Forget it.

515
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,382
Hi. I'm looking for Jude.

516
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,133
Have a seat.

517
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,743
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, sure.

518
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,150
Are you a friend of Jude's?

519
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,019
I'm Miranda.

520
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,650
Jude's my husband.

521
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,354
Thanks.

522
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,726
So, your wife kicked you
out of the house, huh?

523
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,464
We just had a little argument.

524
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,482
- Wow.
- Sorry.

525
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,277
Jude likes to spike it with moonshine.

526
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,881
Yeah, that's good. Has quite a kick.

527
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,356
Where is Jude?

528
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,252
He ain't here.

529
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,098
Do you know when he'll be back?

530
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,227
He went up to Valentine
to pick up some grain.

531
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,398
Won't be back till morning.

532
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,905
I'm sorry. I should take off then.

533
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,773
What happened to your hand?

534
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,608
It's nothing.

535
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:44,318
It won't be once it gets infected.

536
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:57,162
I don't know. The way I've been acting lately,
there's just no excuse for it.

537
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,996
I'm just a shitty husband.

538
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,400
You're under tremendous stress.

539
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,903
Your wife should understand that.

540
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:10,776
Yeah, but the things I'm going through,
I don't think anybody could understand.

541
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,804
I bet I would.

542
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,911
You have strong hands.

543
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,421
It's a good thing 'cause,
contrary to what people believe,

544
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,889
corn doesn't really grow itself.

545
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,824
I saw you watching me.

546
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,696
- What?
- It's okay.

547
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:33,491
I knew you were there.
I wanted you to see me.

548
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,431
I've been watching you, too.

549
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:42,069
In your field, you were filthy,

550
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:46,213
sweating, you looked angry.

551
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,685
It made me wet.

552
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,298
I should go.

553
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,935
I should really get going.

554
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,942
I can't do this.

555
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,142
You already are.

556
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,851
Jesus.

557
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,212
He ain't here.

558
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:37,998
I love my wife.

559
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,625
I love her, too.

560
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,132
Now fuck me like you fuck her.

561
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,619
You gonna sleep all day?

562
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,861
Jude'll be home soon.

563
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,230
Might be best you weren't here.

564
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,134
So stupid.

565
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,370
So stupid.

566
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,251
Stupid.

567
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,093
Where's your mom?

568
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,603
She saw you coming.

569
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,765
She asked me to take Michael for a walk.

570
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,468
She still angry?

571
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,507
Tell me this, was it worth it?

572
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,641
Was what worth it?

573
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:04,411
Putting your precious corn field
before your family?

574
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,442
Look, you have every right to be upset.

575
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:33,812
I'm fine.

576
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,116
You don't sound fine.

577
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:39,279
Oh, really, John? How exactly do I sound?

578
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:42,984
I'm sorry I missed our appointment.
I've messed up on so many different levels.

579
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,426
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, I'm sure you are. Just forget it.

580
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,432
- Come on, Mary...
- Just leave me the fuck alone, John.

581
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,296
What?

582
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,429
You don't like it when your innocent
country wife talks like a sailor?

583
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,870
No, I don't.

584
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,636
No? But it's okay for you
to stop going to church?

585
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,768
- Come on.
- Start drinking, staying out all night?

586
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,144
I came here to apologize.

587
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,511
I'm so sorry.

588
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:10,313
John Rollins is apologizing again,
and this time he means it.

589
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,911
- This time is gonna be different.
- Come on.

590
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,455
- Who is she?
- Stop.

591
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,889
It's the only thing that makes any sense.
You must be seeing somebody.

592
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:17,948
So what is her name?

593
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,892
Is she young? I know you like them young.

594
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,759
You certainly liked me when I was young.

595
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,231
- Does she like it rough, John?
- Enough!

596
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,835
Just go. It'll blow over. It always does.

597
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,512
John, I'm asking you nicely to just leave

598
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,982
before I take this knife
and I stab you in the heart.

599
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,202
Hey, John!

600
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,000
This a bad time?

601
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,575
I guess you want to talk to me.

602
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:15,473
- Look, I don't know what got into me...
- Miranda said you stopped by.

603
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:19,009
Said you and the little lady had a tiff.
Are you okay?

604
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,281
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

605
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,190
Yeah, yeah, something's wrong. Talk to me.

606
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:30,028
Last night, I burned my scarecrow.
I mean, I burned it down to the ashes.

607
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,760
Your scarecrow.

608
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,234
John, I just walked past the thing
in your field.

609
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,101
I know. That's what I mean.

610
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,208
Look, two people are dead,
and I think that that thing has...

611
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,806
I'm starting to think things,
and I don't know if...

612
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,144
Yeah, you need to see my wife.

613
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,783
My wife, Miranda, she knows stuff, John,

614
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:56,150
stuff what ain't exactly Christian,
if you get my meaning.

615
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,122
Come on.

616
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,883
I got John with me.
He's gonna need that book of yours.

617
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:34,958
Miranda.

618
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:47,204
It's the blackest of magic.
Miranda's daddy got it off a dead Indian.

619
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,252
It's true.

620
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:04,019
- How do I get rid of it?
- Why?

621
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,918
You've already received its blessings.

622
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:10,397
Your crows are gone. Your crop flourishes.

623
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,059
It only did what you wanted.

624
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,762
- I never wanted...
- Of course you did.

625
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,307
The banker meant to take your farm.

626
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,843
The seducer meant to take your wife.

627
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,071
You planted the seeds, John,

628
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,811
and now you complain
about your blessed harvest?

629
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,241
You're insane.

630
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,247
I'm not saying it's perfect.

631
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:38,822
Your scarecrow is unfocused, John,
because you're unfocused.

632
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,289
It's about the land, John.

633
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,126
The land is all that matters.

634
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,231
You knew.

635
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:53,500
How do you think a poor Irish family
like mine came to control so much land?

636
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,843
That's right.

637
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,680
And now it can all be yours.

638
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,006
Stay focused.

639
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,912
Let the scarecrow help you.

640
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,520
You'll need it to remove obstacles.

641
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,648
I don't have any obstacles.

642
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:13,491
Well, that family of yours,
they're a distraction, John,

643
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,495
an obstacle.

644
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,694
You think I'm gonna let something happen
to my family,

645
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,729
- to my kids...
- Come on.

646
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,000
You've already turned your back
on your family.

647
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,508
The wheels are already in motion.

648
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:32,505
Honestly, I'm surprised they lasted this long.

649
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,962
John! John!
Lord, John, what's gotten into you?

650
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,937
- Where's my wife?
- She's fine. I just spoke to her.

651
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,839
- My kids?
- They're fine. They're all fine.

652
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,436
John, come on. Calm down.

653
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,245
What's happened here?

654
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,143
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

655
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,447
Try me.

656
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,824
Look, I don't think Tommy killed himself.

657
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,786
I don't think Chapman's death
was an accident.

658
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,328
Me, neither.

659
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,529
Come here, I want to show you something.

660
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,904
What, John? What do you want to show me?

661
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,306
What was Chapman doing
in your field that night, John?

662
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,714
He wasn't in my field. He was putting up
foreclosure signs by the side of the road.

663
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,117
We found his wallet
in the middle of your field.

664
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,212
Funny thing, no cash in it.

665
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,849
Randy said you had a wad of cash on you
the day after Chapman's death.

666
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,383
- Do you mind explaining that?
- Yeah, I found it. I found it in my field.

667
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,054
Is that right?

668
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,791
Would you mind explaining
how it got there?

669
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:58,332
I'm about to.

670
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,097
You know there's a door here.

671
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,106
This is where it all started.
This is where I found it.

672
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,234
- Found what?
- The scarecrow.

673
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,302
Help me out. Come here. Help me.
Lift this up.

674
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,608
Help me.

675
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,351
Give me that.

676
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:25,723
What?

677
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,694
The flashlight, you idiot.

678
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,600
You coming?

679
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,752
John, what are we doing in here?

680
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,787
This is where it all started.

681
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:00,320
- What?
- The scarecrow.

682
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,825
It protects the land. It's protecting me.

683
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,457
- You're serious.
- Think about it.

684
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,332
Chapman wanted to foreclose.

685
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,372
- Tommy was clearly after my wife.
- John, stop.

686
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,772
I'm gonna have to ask you
to come to the station with me.

687
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,400
Are you listening to me?

688
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,104
What, do you want it
to come after you next?

689
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,113
Wait, is that a threat?

690
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,513
What? John, what?

691
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,583
John?

692
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:51,372
Just leave him.
The fool is safer where he lays.

693
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,675
Don't give me that look.

694
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,911
You made a mess of everything.

695
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,755
You don't deserve
the blessings you received.

696
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,290
Get off my property.

697
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,053
Look, calm down, John.

698
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,460
Your field is glorious now.
It's just the beginning.

699
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,521
All these lands could be yours.

700
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,226
You lied to me. Get out!

701
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,461
John!

702
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,662
- Who are you talking to?
- Mary, please, they're just leaving.

703
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,227
Who is...

704
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,900
Jude and Miranda. I told them
we don't want them on our property.

705
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,567
There is no one here. You're alone.

706
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,111
- What's the matter with you? They're right...
- What's the matter with me?

707
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,204
I'm not the one that's screaming
at people who aren't there

708
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:30,012
and burning our living room rug
in the middle of the night.

709
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:35,954
I mean, first Chapman and Tommy
and now you're behaving like this?

710
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:39,123
I just don't know...
I don't know what to think, John.

711
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:42,925
- I think you need help.
- No, no, no, no. It's the scarecrow.

712
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,328
- The scarecrow?
- Come on, don't look at me like that.

713
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,029
You haven't seen what I've seen. Look.

714
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,469
It's all right here. Look. See for yourself.

715
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,702
- What? What am I supposed to see?
- It's a book of black magic.

716
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,266
The scarecrow, everything is here.

717
01:16:56,345 --> 01:17:00,577
I... It's not. It's just your old Bible,
the one your father gave you.

718
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,992
- No, no, no. No, that...
- What have you done?

719
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,964
- No, no, no!
- Let me go!

720
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,510
Michael! Lindsey!

721
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,047
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Hurry up, we're leaving.

722
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,214
- Where's Daddy?
- Daddy's not coming with us.

723
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,883
- But I want Daddy.
- We have to go now.

724
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:45,685
Hide!

725
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,033
Mom.

726
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,207
Good.

727
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:08,777
I think he's gone.

728
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,635
Lindsey! Lindsey, quick,
the keys to your car.

729
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,295
- I don't have mine.
- They're in my room.

730
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:07,501
Okay, we'll run to the Lockett farm
and call for help. Go! Go, go, go!

731
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,411
Run! Run!

732
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:17,374
No! Come back!

733
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,283
No! Michael, Lindsey, come on.

734
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,452
No! Come back!

735
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:31,998
Where are you?

736
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:34,092
That's Daddy. We have to go back for him.

737
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,967
- No, no, no. We've gotta go.
- Go this way.

738
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:45,305
Wait.

739
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:49,413
Where's Michael? Where is he? Michael?

740
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:54,483
Michael?

741
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:04,329
Go this way. Go, go, go. Go, go.

742
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,972
Daddy?

743
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,358
Oh, no, no, no. No.

744
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:50,105
I tried to save my family,
and look what it got me!

745
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:55,741
Don't make the mistake I did, John!
Let the scarecrow take them.

746
01:20:55,817 --> 01:21:00,345
You planted your seeds.
Go reap your reward.

747
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,861
Michael. Michael.

748
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,227
Michael!

749
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,604
Michael!

750
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,036
Let's go! Come on!

751
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:38,875
- Where's Michael?
- He's not with you?

752
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,676
What have you done with him?

753
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,050
Oh, no. Michael!

754
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:25,720
Michael. What's going on?

755
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:47,277
Michael! Michael!

756
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:53,911
No!

757
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:14,169
Michael!

758
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,173
Mary, no!

759
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,621
- Michael! John!
- Daddy!

760
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,250
John! John! What happened?

761
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,556
Where's Michael? John.

762
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,994
- Lindsey?
- Michael!

763
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,392
John.

764
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,931
- Michael.
- Lindsey?

765
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,133
- Lindsey?
- Michael.

766
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,145
Is he still down there?

767
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:11,493
Lindsey!

768
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,256
Stay back.

769
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,594
Stay back.

770
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:58,540
Mary, run!

771
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,687
Come here. Come here. Come here.

772
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:50,826
Come on.

773
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,102
It's okay.

774
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,168
Michael.

775
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,503
Go on. Go to your mom.

776
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,579
Are you all right? You're okay, you see?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
