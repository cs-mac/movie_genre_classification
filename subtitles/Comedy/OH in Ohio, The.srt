00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,689
How sensible. You brought two umbrellas?

2
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,989
I am tired from working late, but
I still want to beat you up.

3
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,900
How nice for us to each have an umbrella. I'm not getting
hit by a single drop of rain. My shoulders are dry.

4
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,390
Aigoo. Thank you so much.

What would you have done if
that grandpa wasn't there?

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,910
Would we have walked all the way,
each holding our own umbrellas?

10
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,989
If so, I would have beat
you with the umbrella.

11
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,820
- That's enough.
- You bring two umbrellas because there are two people?

12
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,019
Of course. I should have known when you called a
proxy driver all the way out to the Western Sea.

13
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,109
Be quiet so that I can say something, too.

Okay. Go ahead.

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,470
Speak.

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,600
You don't even have anything to say.

17
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,520
I love you.

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,440

sure are saying it early.

Why? I also want to reply.

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,889
- I also, to Park Do Kyung—
- Enough. It's okay. Stop.

26
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,909
Oh, why?

Thank you.

68
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,120
I became prettier.

69
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,130
Because I am loved, I got prettier.

70
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,940
Hold on, Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

71
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,709
I accept the fact I'm late. I
can just go and get scolded.

72
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,020
Is being late important? No.
Love is what is important.

73
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,910
Wake up.

74
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,260
Wake up!

75
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,109
Oh, Do Kyung. I thought I was back
in your house, I was so shocked.

76
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,980
Aish.

77
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,389
You didn't go home?

78
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,959
You know about my house.

79
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,019
Some girl is ringing my
doorbell at all hours.

80
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,419
Ah, my head.

81
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,490
Get up. Let's go to the sauna.

82
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,829
I paid attention today. I stripped from
the top, and dressed from the bottom.

83
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,419
To not be cursed out by you, I
carefully dressed that way.

84
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,119
It seemed like you didn't notice.

85
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,890
Hey.

86
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,810
Please... Compliment me.

87
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,930
I need a compliment.

88
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,019
I don't have any energy. And even if I
play all night I don't have any fun.

89
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,069
I feel like I have "bad guy" written
on my forehead as I walk around.

90
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,559
And even in my heart, "bad
guy" is stamped in there.

91
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,549
- If you're going to be like this, why did you leave?
- I got kicked out.

92
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,609
I didn't walk out with my own feet.

93
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,689
She told me to not look back,
and even called out my steps.

94
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,860
Left foot, left foot.

95
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,450
I was going to marry Noona.

96
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,850
I'm not that much of a bastard.

97
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,139
At that time, Noona said,

98
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,720
"You don't have to force
yourself to deal with this."

99
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,970
She caught me smoking a cigarette.

100
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,710
I smoked just once before, when I failed
the bar exam and got my draft notice.

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
This was my second time ever smoking.

102
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,610
So she found out my true
feelings pretty easily.

103
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,679
I'm so humiliated.

104
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,840
I feel so bad.

105
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,899
I feel so humiliated.

106
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,949
Do Kyung, hug me please.

107
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,500
Sheesh.

108
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,420
I'm so humiliated. I'm so sorry.

109
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,510
How is Noona?

110
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,710
Don't be lonely.

111
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,599
Even if you don't have a father,

112
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,079
you have a mom who's like a dad,
and an uncle who's like a dad.

113
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,099
But if you still need a father,

114
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,909
even if Mom had to go out into the world
and drag out every guy in existence,

115
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,070
I'll find you the very best father!

116
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,560
This is the analysis for the food
trends for the next half-year.

117
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,860
It's not analysis if I can't
understand the first line.

118
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,019
Again!

119
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,679
- I will do it again!
- Go make me some coffee.

120
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,190
Yes.

121
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,109
Show me the one we downloaded earlier.

122
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,169
Oh, please don't worry. You know us.

123
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,819
Even if the sky falls, we will finish mixing the sound.
When we finish the accident scene, I will call you.

124
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,220
Yes, yes. Take care.

125
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,629
Joo Il and Ki Tae are looking
around for new offices.

126
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,619
We'll find someplace cheap, so know that.

127
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,409
We will not go work anywhere else.

128
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,230
Don't worry, CEO, you will continue to
get jobs. So we will recover very soon.

129
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,640
You're amazing. Can you work?

130
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,879
Let's go to Chairman Jang and apologize.

131
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,760
- It's not going to end just because we do that.
- And send that woman back to him.

132
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,849
Then, it's the end!

133
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,079
Forget it.

134
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,579
Are you punishing me right now thinking that
you were totally ruined because of Mom,

135
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,740
that Mom did wrong, so she should feel
it down to her bones? Is that it?

136
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,619
This all happened because I did wrong.

137
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,750
You didn't do anything wrong, Mom.

138
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,219
What?

139
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,520
Do Kyung, he...

140
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,789
Is...

141
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,530
Is he sick?

142
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,330
He's acting strange. I
think something's wrong.

143
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,810
He's not getting mad at me!

144
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,590
What's going on with him?
Hurry up and find out.

145
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,029
I'm so proud of you,
you're not even wilting.

146
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,609
You're enduring so well so
Unni won't feel sad, right?

147
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,389
Don't cry at night because you feel lonely.

148
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,530
Unni will come early
tomorrow morning, okay?

149
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,419
What do the flowers say?

150
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,390
You shouldn't talk to flowers. It makes you look
weirder than if you wear flowers on your head.

151
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,940
- Let's go. Sang Soo is treating.
- I will have sweet potatoes pork cutlets.

152
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,619
Oh, I'm leaving now. Why?

153
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,629
Let's eat dinner with my sister tonight.

154
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,590
With the director?

155
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,380
Tell him never mind.

156
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,189
I told you I would bring you home.

157
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,950
- What's the use going back and forth? We can take a taxi.
- But you are not alone... (I.e., pregnant)

158
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,489
I mean, you are with her, so I
should have gone to pick you up.

159
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,809
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

160
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,480
Go inside.

161
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,009
- It's her boyfriend who made our company like that, right?
- Her boyfriend is me.

162
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,310
- So you've gone crazy.
- Don't say anything to her. I'll kill you.

163
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,119
Wow, you are like a married couple.
It's nice to see.

164
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,290
Our company is...

165
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,559
Well, they say that love triumphs all.

166
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,470
Why eat together? You two
could eat alone upstairs.

167
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,580
We can eat together. If you don't
eat, you can't do <i>other things.</i>

168
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,159
Why do you glare at me whenever I say anything? What
fun is a couple in love if we can't make fun of them?

169
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,370
I won't get all jealous,
I still have my pride.

170
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,569
Come here and sit.

171
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,410
- Yes.
- Sit down. Let's eat.

172
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,229
Please eat a lot. Oppa
said you like melons.

173
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,239
I also like meat. And sushi.
I like a lot of things.

174
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,159
If he ever asks what you
like, never answer him.

175
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,350
He will buy you only
that thing for 365 days.

176
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,679
It was 30 years ago, I was 14 years old.

177
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,979
I tasted melon for the first time,
and said that it was very delicious.

178
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,259
After hearing that one comment, for
30 years, he only buys me melons.

179
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,790
"Merong!" (Nyah-nyah)

180
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,689
Let me just say one thing.

181
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,240
Please love our Do Kyung a lot.

182
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,190
He's a pitiful child.

183
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,240
Can I take him home and raise him?

184
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,779
- I'm just joking.
- But it sounded real.

185
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,689
You can take him home and love him
until he suffocates with your love.

186
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,190
As long as I don't die from a
fluttering heart first, that is.

187
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,389
Wow. You have to have the
last word, don't you?

188
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,340
- So you love him that much?
- So much that I could bungee jump without a rope.

189
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,770
Of course, not alone. With him.

190
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,330
You... sound a bit crazy.

191
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,319
Take it easy. Even if
he's my little brother,

192
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,689
- there are limits to how much I can cheer on someone else's love.
- Yes, ma'am.

193
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,519
But, the lawyer friend seems to be late.

194
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,459
If we call him, he'll come out.
He's hiding somewhere.

195
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,179
Lee Jin Sang! Come out and eat!

196
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,410
- Lee Jin Sang!
- He's gone. He's not coming anymore.

197
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,340
This human...

198
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,110
So he ran way.

199
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,950
He went to meet Miss Monday.

200
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,739
It seems like that guy caused
some big trouble. What did he do?

201
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,099
- Something.
- So what did he do?

202
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,589
I'll tell you later.

203
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,130
Oh, I'm so curious. Can't you tell me? It's
making me sad that everyone knows but me.

204
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,900
What do you want to listen to?

205
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,419
Rather than listen, that song you sang
when you were a child, "Daydream,"

206
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,449
let's record that as you sing it.

207
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,609
I think it will be good
to hear when you get old.

208
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,879
Your voice at six years old, then at 36.

209
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,509
- I think it will be fascinating.
- No.

210
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,000
Why? Let's record that.
Please sing it for me.

211
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,089
The man who I loved most,

212
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,199
his voice at the moment
when he loved me the most.

213
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,500
I want to record that.

214
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,910
I want to hear it. Sing it for me.

215
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:02,250
♪ <i>You pretend to be okay, smiling</i> ♪

216
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,869
What is this?

217
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,050
Are those handcuffs?

218
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,149
Is this what you're into?

219
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,670
Oh, it's making me flustered.

220
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,569
♪ <i>Because I know your scars
better than anyone else</i> ♪

221
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,890
It's not something I had from before.
I bought it for you.

222
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,840
Am I dying?

223
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,410
Why are you treating me so well?

224
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,889
You're being too good
to me, it's scaring me.

225
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,029
♪ <i>What should I do?</i> ♪

226
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,510
I was passing by, and I thought
it was pretty, so I bought it.

227
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,030
It's making me uneasy.

228
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,419
I am so happy, but I'm so uneasy.

229
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,179
Am I uneasy because I'm so happy?

230
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,599
Don't think too deeply about it.

231
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,419
It's not the right timing to be
this happy, but I am, that's why.

232
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,710
You can just be happy.

233
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,759
Then I will just be happy.

234
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,820
And I will brush my teeth now.

235
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,430
Can I take a shower, too?

236
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,710
Let's take you home.

237
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,119
Everybody, look!

238
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,780
Hey! Everybody, come!

239
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,610
Jump! Jump! Yeah! Yeah!

240
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,860
Hey!

241
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,869
Are you playing to make up for lost time?
You are playing so hard.

242
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,359
Right. Why didn't you come all this time?

243
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,219
Oppa was just... Busy.

244
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,989
But from now on, I will
be comfortable and free.

245
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,660
Every day, every night, party-party,
crazy party! Here, drink!

246
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,540
Brother-in-law!

247
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,349
You shouldn't live this way. Think about
your child. Does my sister deserve this?

248
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,030
He must be crazy.

249
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,799
It's nothing. Nothing at all.

250
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,749
It's a friend's little brother.
He is just playing.

251
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,769
What a crazy guy. His jokes
are a little much, huh?

252
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,309
Let's have a drink. Yeah.

253
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,189
Let's go home, Brother-in-law! Even if you
hate my sister, you shouldn't do this!

254
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,360
Look, really.

255
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,240
Bastard!

256
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,169
Hey, Park Hoon, stop right there!

257
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,220
If I catch you, you're dead!

258
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,830
A loveless marriage isn't a sin, you know?

259
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,059
That guy, he's really gone crazy.

260
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,179
Get lost, you jerk.

261
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,739
Noona still loves you! How can
you not know a woman's heart?

262
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,920
I don't know! I don't know.

263
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,259
You son of a bitch.

264
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,619
Why? Why can't you admit
that it is your child?

265
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,960
Why can't you say that you
have a baby on the way?

266
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,900
You are a FATHER!

267
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,899
Oh, what is going on with our family?

268
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,780
Hyung is ruined, and Brother-in-law
left home. What is this?!?

269
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,410
You came?

270
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,360
Oh, that bastard. Crazy bastard.

271
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,889
He's just someone I know.

272
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,850
He chases me everywhere I go and does that.
He thinks it's funny.

273
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,079
Let's go dance.

274
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,190
Let's go quickly.

275
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,430
Go in.

276
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,040
Go back safely.

277
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,890
Ouch. That hurts.

278
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,610
<i>If I look back on this moment as I die,</i>

279
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,670
<i>I won't regret this.</i>

280
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,030
<i>I won't regret this.</i>

281
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,859
Why do all the people that come to my
house always have so many requests?

282
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,930
You never requested anything from me...

283
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,679
You never requested anything from
me, and that is why I liked you.

284
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,419
But in the end, you disappoint me.

285
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,949
This all began because of me.

286
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,299
If Oppa collapses, I can't end things
with him. I request you, please.

287
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,810
I want to help him, even by doing this.

288
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,420
Please help me.

289
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,959
Oh, get these grass bits away from me.

290
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,179
Are you trying to starve
this old man to death?

291
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,210
And you, go.

292
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,360
Isn't it a bit childish?
Joining hands with your enemy?

293
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:39,029
How about becoming more honest? Aren't you the
one who wants those two to break up the most?

294
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,559
Yes, that could be true.

295
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,089
But I haven't looked into
my heart that deeply.

296
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,019
I don't want to,

297
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,279
because I might see that that is how I truly feel, deep
in my heart. So before that, I'm changing my behavior

298
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:59,010
by telling myself that I really want
them to be happy together, truly.

299
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,689
What a difficult way to live.

300
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,059
I do understand you. I felt that
way until just a few days ago.

301
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,690
Even as I was doing bad things,
I felt terrible about it.

302
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:17,749
So I thought about it, and decided
to only be a halfway bad guy.

303
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,829
'I am not a completely bad
guy, I will only go halfway.'

304
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,490
'So you should get knocked
down flat, right about here.'

305
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,309
But you know who the most despicable
people in this world are?

306
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:36,700
People who are good, but quit.
Or people who are bad, but quit.

307
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,849
People who just quit.

308
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:45,489
Don't be vague about your feelings when you
don't really feel that way. Just be honest.

309
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,760
It's cooler if you just embrace your
desire to want them to break apart.

310
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,259
After talking to you, I see my answer.

311
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,109
They say you really know someone only after you break
up with them. After leaving him, Park Do Kyung

312
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,749
turned out to be a really great
guy, so I regretted it a lot.

313
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,890
But I don't think Hae Young regrets
breaking up with you, like I do.

314
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:11,480
You... You cannot even be
compared to Park Do Kyung.

315
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,430
Come in.

316
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:46,429
Director Park, the R&D department developed
something new. Let's go see it together.

317
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,109
Let's do that.

318
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,159
It seems this product's
profit potential is low.

319
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,610
Hey, Madam Park Soo Kyung.

320
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,869
Let's go.

321
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,199
That woman is ignoring me?

322
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,059
We should really consider profitability
a priority when developing products...

323
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,809
Why aren't you answering my calls?

324
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,289
Go. I am at work.

325
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,839
<i>You're wearing heels, are you nuts? You're
pregnant at age 44, do high heels make sense?</i>

326
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,659
<i>I am pregnant at age 44, and
have you contributed anything?</i>

327
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,579
<i>I did contribute something, obviously.</i>

328
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,410
<i>You crazy punk.</i>

329
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,469
I think I must have called you a
thousand times since last night.

330
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,029
You are so stubborn. How can you not
answer your phone, after so many times?

331
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,089
Are you trying to see who wins over whom?

332
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,119
There is no reason I should
answer your phone call.

333
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,089
When you kicked me out of your house, didn't that mean that we
were at least preserving our brother-and-sister relationship?

334
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,189
Don't make me laugh.
Could that be possible?

335
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,539
Wow, I didn't know you
were this uncool, Noona.

336
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,209
Cool, my ass. You can
feed that to the dogs!

still remain brother and sister?</i>

339
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,836
Didn't you say that your college major
was French? What are those two saying?

340
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,129
I cannot understand a single word.

341
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,950
<i>Get lost!</i>

342
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,949
Fine, then. So you're breaking up our
brother-sister relationship, too.

343
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,359
Let's just never speak to each other again.
That's not difficult at all.

344
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,999
Let's completely abandon all
our affection for each other.

345
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,020
But there is no going back now. It's over.
I spit on you! Spit!

346
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,169
What? What? What is it?

347
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,580
What's going on? What is it?

348
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,209
Who are you?

349
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,919
<i>Let's do it, just once more.</i>

350
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,090
<i>Kiss.</i>

351
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,299
I do know this word. Let's
just get off, right now.

352
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,780
But I have to ride this. I
have to go to a meeting.

353
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,510
Why are you getting off?

354
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,566
What is it? What did he say?

355
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,719
He asked to kiss her.

356
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,690
Kiss?

357
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,579
But he looked so normal.

358
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,480
And he looked a lot younger, too.

359
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,719
Director! Whoa!

360
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,860
You guys look so cool.

361
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,499
Wow, they kiss so well.

362
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,219
Whoa, really. Director.

363
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,450
Director, fighting!

364
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, they're really going for it.

365
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,920
Director, good job.

366
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,500
- Thank you.
- No, I was going to see him anyway.

367
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,240
Thank you for requesting that of me.

368
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,830
Don't worry too much.
Everything will turn out okay.

369
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,180
I am grateful.

370
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,030
What's wrong?

371
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,089
He keeps seeing it. I think he's
really up against something.

In my life, a man calling me to come
out in the middle of the night,

398
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,136
after my sunbae during Freshman year
in college, this is the first time.

399
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,749
That sunbae wasn't really my type,
but I think that he liked me a lot.

400
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,620
He saw me at orientation, and remembered every
time that he saw me, up to the seventh time.

401
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,129
The second time was in the library. The third time was at
the main gate. And the fourth time was somewhere else.

402
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,219
Do you remember where we first met?

403
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,639
Why wouldn't I know that? We first
met at the coffee shop with Hee Ran.

404
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,736
You gave me a nosebleed
in both my nostrils.

405
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,909
That wasn't it.

406
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,490
Before then, we had already
seen each other, while walking.

407
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,196
You looked back at me, too.
Don't you remember that?

408
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,409
Which street?

409
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,100
Yeoiudo. In front of the post office.

410
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,209
Oh, that's right. I did go there.

411
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,689
So you saw me in the street, and
you fell for me at first sight.

412
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,296
And you remembered that?

413
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,339
No.

414
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,529
- Even before that, I knew you.
- How?

415
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:08,320
You kept appearing in my mind. Your face.
Even though I have never seen you before.

416
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,529
Then I saw you for real in the street.
Then I saw you in the coffee shop.

417
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,409
How can I appear in your mind
before you've ever seen me?

418
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,890
Just...

419
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,170
like a memory.

420
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,300
I kept seeing you.

421
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,800
Before you moved into that
room, I saw it in advance.

422
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,720
I couldn't see other things.

423
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,600
I only saw you.

424
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,449
At first, I thought that
I was seeing the future.

425
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:48,219
I thought that I had developed
psychic powers or something.

426
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,310
But I came to know it, suddenly.

427
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:57,429
What I was seeing. Why I was seeing you.

428
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,760
Why did you see me?

429
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,640
In the future, when I was dying,

430
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,160
what I was thinking about
in my final moment.

431
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,580
Like when your life flashes
before your eyes, as they say.

432
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,349
I saw something like that.

433
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,789
In the future?

434
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,880
Yes, before I die.

435
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,070
Before I die,

436
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,350
I thought of only you.

437
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,299
<i>I...</i>

438
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,980
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

439
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,980
<i>My feeling of missing you was so strong,</i>

440
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:53,349
<i>that feeling pierced through
time and came back to the past.</i>

441
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:58,059
My doctor said that that can happen.
In my memory at the moment of death,

442
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:04,110
we broke up and were not together. You
moved out of here, and we were finished.

443
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,760
As I died, I regretted that the most.

444
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,149
Why was I so stingy about my heart?

445
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,810
Why did I live always so stressed out
about things that didn't matter?

446
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:28,749
And I said so many things
to you that I didn't mean.

447
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,879
<i>I will give you as much money as you ask for. Why force
someone when she says she doesn't want to live here?</i>

448
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,339
<i>Sorry for acknowledging your existence.</i>

449
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,280
<i>Don't be sick.</i>

450
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,769
What were the words I really wanted to say?

451
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,170
Never mind my pride or anything else.

452
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,079
What did my heart really want most?

453
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,830
What were the words I really wanted to say?

454
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,290
<i>Just...</i>

455
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,430
<i>please return. I'd like
it if you came back.</i>

456
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,199
<i>I'm sorry, but these are my true feelings.</i>

457
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:14,169
<i>I got sick from holding back my desire
to hold you and have all of you.</i>

458
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,959

I even wondered if it was okay
for a woman to be this way.

00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,490
But... I liked it.

It moved me. If I died never
