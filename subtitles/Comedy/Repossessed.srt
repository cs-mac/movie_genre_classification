Demonic voice:
I am Satan,

00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,680
King of all
that is evil.

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,570
Man: In the name
of God almighty,

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,620
I cast ye
back to hell!

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,990
I command
thy putrid spirit

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,580
Be banished from
this child's soul.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,500
Never!
The girl is mine!

8
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,170
Mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine...

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,660
Don't you stick your
tongue out at me!

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,030
Aw, I'll do what
I damn well please.

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,470
Stop your cursing!

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,390
Make me, slime ball.

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,150
I am a priest!

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,620
Oh, pardon me...

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,870
Your reverend
and holy slime ball.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,910
How about these, pops?

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,470
I command you,
close your blouse!

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,270
Watch this, bud.

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,140
Put down
that crucifix!

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,320
Ohh, I love it!

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,360
Stop it!
I command you!

22

Be gone, Satan!

Mother! Mother!

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,280
Mother!

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,700
Father, is it
all over?

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,590
Is Nancy
all right?

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,360
Bless you.

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,280

possibly thank you?

Aah!

Ooh.

Satan:
I'll be back!

Ooh!

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,180
Oh, shit.

[Sighs]

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,390
Ooh.

* I was minding my business

50

* "come on, just follow me"

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,490
* so I, I looked him
in the eye *

55
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,870
* and I showed him
to the door *

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,060
* oh, no

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,490

to get lost *

58
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,100
* 'cause I've been there
once before *

Priest, German accent:
Uh, Adams?

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
Here.

81
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,270

82
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,180
Yes, father.

83

84

* here

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,460
Good day to you.
I am father mayii.

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,950
And I would like to welcome
you to the seminar.

89
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,960
I am here to discuss
an incident in my life

90
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,070
That first destroyed,

91
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
And then renewed my belief
in divine intervention.
That first destroyed,

92
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,310
And then renewed my belief
in divine intervention.

93
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,120
17 years ago, a young girl
was a victim of an episode

94
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,970
Of demonic possession,

95
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,780
And I was called in
to rescue her soul.

96
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,820
Now, that battle left me
broken physically,

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,880
And mentally...

98
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,420
But recently,

99
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,380
My faith has been renewed.

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,190
And I believe that even the
most cynical among you here

101
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,970
Will... Find...

102
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,960
This story...

103
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,780
Inspiring.

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,420
Young lady, would you
pull down your dress?

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,670
Sure.

106
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,740
Up!

107
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,440
Ooh.

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,150
Mayii: I had long since
lost track

109
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,040
Of the child Nancy.

110
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,980
She had grown to womanhood
and got married,

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,860
And had settled down
with her husband

112
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,940
And 2 lovely children,

113
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,060
In a picturesque
neighborhood

114
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,750
With playful children
and picket fences,

115
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,350
And lots of caucasians.

116
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,440
Ah-choo!

pals on ice

121

Has turned ugly, Dan.

122
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,750
Dan: Yeah, and it was
rusty the rooster

123
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,120
Who started it all
with his...

Oh, my darling!

Ok, kids, dinner's
almost ready!

130
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,550
Turn off the TV!

131
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,190
What are we having?

132
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,350
Oh, your favorite...
Prime ribs, sweet potatoes,

133
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,560
Green beans...
And split pea soup.

[Dramatic drum beats]

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,320
Not again!
Oh, mom!

136
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,790
Both: I hate
split pea soup!

137
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,850
You know
we hate it.

138
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,520
Mom, we hate it!

139
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,300
I said they were
lovely children.

140
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,310
At this point, they had
not taken acting lessons.
I said they were

At this point, they had
not taken acting lessons.

142
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,350
Really, mom, I want
to change my name.

143

All my girlfriends
think it's dorky.

144
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,640
Oh, honey, but frieda
is such a nice name.

145
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,300
Not my first name.
My last name... aglet.

146
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,400
Come on! What's it mean,
anyway?

147
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,670
Well, frieda,
in the old days,

148
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,010
Aglet meant he who puts
those tiny plastic things

149
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,640
On the end of shoelaces.

150
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,870
See, back then, a man's name
was the same as his occupation.

151
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,570
Oh, like a man named
Fred carpenter

152
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,530
Would build houses?

153
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,680
Mm-hmm.

154
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,120
Or a Thomas Baker
made bread?

155
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,170
Exactly.

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,610
So, what did
John hancock do?

157
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,910
Well, there were
some exceptions.

Oh, and you all know

Oh, foo-foo says,
"God bless you, everyone."

Ha ha ha ha.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,350
We have a terrific
line-up of inspiration

173
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,460
For you
on this program.

174
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,020
As usual, we'll be
reading some passages

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,170
From the good book.

176
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,190
And just possibly,
we will heal

177
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,430
Some of our sickly,
and/or...

178
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,870
Crippled followers.

179
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,880
And you know, Ernest,

180
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,700
Foo-foo just loves
when you heal people.

181
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,530
Foo-foo is
a good dog.

to watch this!

No, way!

Come on, now.

I'll change it.

I don't know...

are dead.

constantly surrounds us,

in mind...

So, uh, what seems
to be your problem?

Something came over me
last night.

I just felt such...
Incredible anger.

I vomited on my family.

what could it be?

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,210
Possibly the flu.
I just had

A couple of cases
of it come in today.

I must admit
that hospitals

276
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,170
Have always
frightened me.

with me?

gathered here.

their opinions,

A good, clean,
decent life.

that rob lowe video.

other than himself

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,190
Will find that
he shall receive

I said he was dedicated.

332
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,610
I did not say
he was articulate.

333
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,300

to each other.

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,140
I will now ask
our ushers

338
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,060
To please pass around
the donation basket.

339
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,270
Our church thanks you.

340
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,890
Mayii: Father brophy
was a man of integrity.

A man dedicated
to his beliefs.

A man about 5' 10"
in his stocking feet.

343
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,450
It was father Luke

344
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,340
Who would make me
once again come face-to-face

345
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,010
With my nightmares,
and would introduce me

346
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,500
To some very interesting
Armenian food.

347
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,980
As a matter of fact,
it was at the dinner table

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,210
That he heard his brother
say, "Luke..."

349
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,560

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,520
Excuse me, father.

353
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,270
While tallying
the donations,

354
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,750
I came upon this note

355
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,150
With your name
written on it.

356
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,200

Father mayii?

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,840
Yes, yes?

359
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,500
Is it true that
priests and nuns

360
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,170
Have orgies
in the Vatican?

361
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,850
What?

362
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,480
Father Luke suffered from
the burden of self-doubt,

363
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,910
Always questioning himself.

364
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,890
Was he good enough
to be a priest?

365
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,350
Should he have been
a rabbi instead?

366
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,790
After all, they do
have Sundays off.

367
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,130
And the question that
nagged him the most...

368
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,610
Why weren't there any
Japanese players in the nba?

369
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,630
Was it the hand
of the almighty

370
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,520
That drew Luke
to the phone that night?

371
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,440
[Ringing]

372
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,080
Or had he just forgotten

373
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,970
To leave his answering
machine on again?

374
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,270
Hello?

375
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,000
Father brophy?
Hi. This is Nancy aglet.

376
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,410
I'm the one that
left you that note today.

377
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,200
That's so strange.

378
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,640
I was just about
to phone you.

379
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,910
I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

380
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,830
I looked your name up
in the phone book.

381
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,930
That's ok.
Now, what's this

382
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,530
About your having
a religious problem?

383
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,640
[Sighs]

384
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,930
Honey...

385
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,850
Oh, sorry. Have you seen
my nose hair clippers?

386
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,710
Um, they're
in the, uh, cabinet.

387
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,570
Listen, I really can't
talk about this over the phone.

388
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,490
Is it possible you could
come over tonight,

389
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,020
So we could
speak privately?

390
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,590
Uh, well, you see,
it's my, uh...

391
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,020
Please, father.
It's very, very serious.

392
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,820
Sure. Where
do you live?

393
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,820
I live at 733 sex drive.

394
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,240
Thank you.
Good-bye.

395
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,140
Good-bye.

Hey, let's play

Well, welcome,
father.

401
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,500
I'm Braydon aglet.

402
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,820
Hello.

403
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,250
And these are my
children ned and frieda.

404
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,470
Hi.
Ned: Hi.

405
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,820
Come on, dad,
let's play!

406
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,050
Come on, dad,
please, let's play.

407
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,490
In a second.

408
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,940
Nancy said you'd
be dropping by.

409
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,190
Something about her
doing some work

410
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,360
With the church?

411
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,800
Uh, something
like that, yes.

412
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,170
What should we
ask it first, dad?

413
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,580
Oh, well, uh... Well,
there's something

414
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,500
I've always wanted
to ask.

415
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,060
Will Ted Kennedy
ever become president?

416
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,020
[Whooshing]

417
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,420
Ho ho ho! I guess
not, eh, kids?

418
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,140
[Demonic voice] Braydon,
I thought we'd spoken

419
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,840
About using that thing
in this house.

420
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,590
I never want to see that
thing in this house again!

421
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,250
Ohh! Oh, I'm so sorry!

422
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,360
Ohh...

423
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,500
Father, maybe we could...

424
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,580
Go in the other room
and speak privately?

425
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,610
Sure.

426
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,450
It was... it was very
nice meeting you.

427
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,670
I-I assume you don't
want your family

428
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,630
Knowing about this.

429
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,300
No, I don't.

430
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,310
No one knows what
happened to me in my past.
No, I don't.

431
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,790
No one knows what
happened to me in my past.

432
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,130
And what I believe is
happening to me now.

433
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,730
Ok, and what exactly
is that?

434
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,340
I believe I'm being
possessed by the devil.

435
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,230
The devil?

436
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,680
Mrs. aglet, are you
under any kind

437
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,850
Of psychiatric care
at all?

438
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,470
I once gave my word
never to show anyone

439
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,850
What you are
about to see.

440
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,460
High school
debating champion?

441
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,970
Papal seal
of possession?

442
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,260
Signed by the pope.

443
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,790
Mrs...

444
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,570
Mrs. aglet,
I apologize,

445
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,420
But I guess
I've always felt

446
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,540
That these stories
of demonic possession

447
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,740
Were nothing more
than religious folklore.

448
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,810
Why did you call me?
Why didn't you contact

449
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,890

Mayii. Father
Jedediah mayii.

451
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,620
Well, they say he
retired from the church

452
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,660
Right after
my exorcism.

453
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,420
What makes you think that
you're being possessed again?

454
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,380
Satan's spirit flew
right out of my TV set

455
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,330
And into my soul.

456
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,370
Ok...

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,100
Oh, no, I know it
sounds crazy,

458
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,830
But it must be true.

459

please help me.

going on here?

my wife down to the bed.

like that before in my life.

were away at camp.

wrong with your wife,

do all I can

that you and I have gone

to being enemies.

something supernatural?

542
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,000
Not impressed, huh?

543
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,370
Well, how about
if I...

544
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,570
Make the film break?

545
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,550
[Snapping and fizzling]

546
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,810
Oh. Of... of course
I love you. Yeah.

547
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,890
This evening, 8:30.

548
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,360
Tonight? No, no.

549
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,000
No feathers. We'll use
the whole chicken.

550
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,850
Ahem.

551
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,890
Father brophy
was very disturbed.

552
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
[Door closes]

553
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,410
So, father,
what happened?

554
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,190
It may sound
unbelievable,

555
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,760
But my guess
is that Nancy is...

556
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,330
[Dramatic music playing]

557
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,190
Possessed
by the devil.

558
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,400
Yeah, I knew it!

559
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,370
He said
it's only a guess!

560
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,310
I still say
it's p.M.S.

561
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,550
Mayii: As father brophy drove
from the aglet home,

562
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,940
A great fear welled up
within him

563
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,710
Like a big sneeze.

564
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,860
You feel it build,

565
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,300
But you know you can't stop it

566
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,160
Without making your ears plug up

567
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,300
And a bubble come out
of your nose.

568
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,710
How could he,

569
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,980
A young, inexperienced priest,

570
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,960
Do battle alone
with the dark lord himself?

571
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,970
Then, it came to him

572
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
Like a sign from heaven.

573
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:55,610
[Brakes screeching]
Like a sign from heaven.

00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,590
Man: Hey, hey!

576
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,150
I can't see nothing!
What are you doing up there?

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,110
Second man:
What's going on?

578
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,000
Is that you?
Hey, get up!

579
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,780
Mayii: The young priest
had read about

580
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,110
The exorcism I had performed
in 1973

581
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,560
As well as my 17-year
decline into oblivion.

582
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,260
But he tried to call me anyway.

583
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,870
Mayii: Strangely, my number
kept ringing busy.

584
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,750
Was it Satan's trickery at work?

585
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,530
Or was it just my party line?

586
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,880

and cheering on phone]

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,110
If he had reached me,

589
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,000
I would have told him
not to come.

590
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,300
I was weak and tired,

591
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,860
Listless, out of sorts, and...

592
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,330
My stools were a little loose.

593
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,050
Sister, I'm looking
for the room...

594
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,710
Hold out your hands.

595

Excuse me?

Ow!

Don't run
in the hallways!

599
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,730
Now, what do you need?

600
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,640
Which room is father
Jedediah mayii in?

for coming by so late,

desperately needs you,

Someone you helped
a long time ago.

Who?

627
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Nancy aglet.

628
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,200
I don't, uh...

629
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,610
Recall the name.

630
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,140
Well, then maybe you'll
recall her exorcism.

That poor child.

She barely survived
the exorcism,

637
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,950
As did I.

638
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,060
And you say that
she needs my help?

639
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,910
I think Nancy has been...

How can you be sure?

647
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,210
She's displaying
all the main traits...

648
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,290
An ungodly voice,

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,860

Violent spasms...

651
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,450
But that doesn't
prove a thing.

652
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:48,460
She could be
related to Joe cocker.
But that doesn't
prove a thing.

Father, I've seen her!

From something unholy.

her soul again!

You have to help her!

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,660
I can't.

00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,620

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,390
I can't!

664
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,470

are you all right?

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,120
It's my heart.

668
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,160
It began at Nancy's exorcism.

669
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,100
That's why
I can't help you.

670
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,470
If Satan should find me
in this weakened condition,

671
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,880
He could take
possession of my soul

672

And become even stronger.

673
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,400
But if you can't
help her, who can?

674
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,460
I don't know.

675
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,420
[Whispering]
I don't.

676
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,270
I don't.

677
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,310
But... good lord, yes!

678
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,390
You could do it.

It is your destiny.

682
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,750
There's no way.

683
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,310
You see, there's something
that I haven't told you.

684

I think I've
lost my faith.

I think I've
lost my faith.

Luke!

687
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,510
I never want to hear you

688
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,440
Say anything
like that again.

689
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,790
Now, why...

00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,160
Why don't you...

691
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,680
Look at it like this.

692
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,810
Maybe this is God's way
of reaffirming your faith.

693
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
While you're
saving Nancy's soul,

694
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,550
You're also saving your own
soul at the same time.

695
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,700
After all, God does work
in strange ways, doesn't he?

696
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,910
Yes. Yes, he does.

697
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,830
Good.

698
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,950
You've given me a lot
to think about, father.

699
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,800
Good night, and, uh...

700
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,960
God bless you.

701
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,170
God bless you, son.

702
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,730
Now, you have a great
deal of work to do.

703
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,730

Yes?

711
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,600
Wasn't it hard to...
To live with yourself

712
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,550
After completely
wimping out

713
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,570
And allowing a wuss
like father Luke

714
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,880
To go up against Satan
all by himself?

715
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,370
I mean, didn't
you feel like

716

A complete piece
of gutless, spineless,

717
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,030
Primordial slime?

Next question.

719
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,350
Mayii: Luke knew little
about the ritual of exorcism,

720
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,850
So he arranged for a meeting

721
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,440
With the supreme council

than good.

01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,220
Now, just remember
one thing:

1440
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,020
The devil is
always trying

1441
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,140
To take over your mind.

1442
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,570
He'll lie to you,
he will deceive you.

1443
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,710
He will totally try
to manipulate you.

1444
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,700
So do not listen
to anything

1445
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,980
That he has to say.

1446
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,420
He's worse than
a studio executive.

1447
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,540
Understood?
Understood.

1448
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,780
Worse than
a real estate agent,

1449
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,260
A divorce attorney...

1450
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,310
I got it.
Right.

1451
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,520
All right, then.

1452
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,720
Let's go.

1453
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,870
[Imitating Carol ann]
They're here...

1454
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,990
Ah...

1455
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,260
I see it pays to advertise
on television.

1456
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,580
I think a little mood
lighting is appropriate.

1457
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,370
Don't you?

1458
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,520
There.

1459
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,550
Have no fear,
my son.

1460
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,190
We have the Bible,
we have our faith.

1461
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:14,000
And as a back-up,
these beauties.

1462
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,630
That's an illegal
foreign object!

1463
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,710
Jesse, what do you
know about fairness?

1464
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:21,660
I'll show you fairness!

1465
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,440
Are you just
about finished?

1466
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:27,190
It's been
a long time, mayii.

1467
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,030
I've waited an eternity
to do to you

1468
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,610
What you did to me
all those years ago.

1469
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:40,630
Before I do,
I've got something...

1470
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,780
Special for you.

1471
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,220
That is disgusting,
mean gene!

1472
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,990
I have never seen
a move like that

1473
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,680
In all my years
of wrestling!

1474
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,610
Whew!

1475
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,760
So...

1476
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,640
How do you like it?

1477
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,520
Oh, you'll pay for that,
you bucket of cow dung.

1478
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,800
How dare you, you...

1479
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,400
How long has she
been in this condition?

1480
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,450
A few days.
How does look?

1481
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,250
Not too good.
She looks like

1482
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:21,320
She's been existing
solely on airline food.

1483
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,590
Your father wears
tight underwear!

1484
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:22,600
And I can't stand
your mother!

And I can't stand
your mother!

1486
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,040
Will you put
a sock in it?!

1487
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,760
Jeez, what crawled up
your butt and died?

1488
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:32,930
Every night I prayed

1489
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,200
To never again gaze
on your grotesque face,

1490
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,730
Listen to your
venomous voice,

1491
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,140
But with you right
in front of me now,

1492
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,330
I thank God that I have
the opportunity

1493
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,340
To boot your stinking
carcass back to hell,

1494
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,250
You worthless,
you rotting,

1495
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,620
You vulgar spirit.

1496
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,740
Hey, hey, hey!

1497
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,890
Where does it say

1498
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,520
You can talk to me
like that?

1499
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,740
Right here.

1500
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,600
Oh, sure, you may feel
pretty cocky right now,

1501
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,490
But you'll soon realize

1502
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,080
That I am far
too powerful for you.

1503
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,380
And I am a man of God.

1504
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,340
And I fear no one,

1505
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,820
Especially an unholy spirit
from an unsavory world.

1506
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,580
Unsavory? Aw, come on.

1507
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,400
You've got just as many
unsavory types here.

1508
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,670
From those domino's
pizza delivery boys

1509
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:25,620
To that idiot
in the back row

1510
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:27,670
Who won't shut up
during the movie.

1511
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,150
Enough!

1512
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,190
This is meandering.

1513
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,400
Father, my lunch bucket.

1514
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,470
Holy water.

1515
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,710
The church was closed.

1516
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,600
The only place open
was a 7-11.

1517
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,560
Ahh, thank you,

1518
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,510
You've been
a lovely audience.

1519
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,630
And next,
I'd like to do

1520
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:56,030
My impression of
comedian don Adams.

1521
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,980
[Imitating don adams]
Where's the chief, 99?

1522
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,280
Do not get smart with me!

1523
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,710
On a visit to the little
town of Bethlehem,

1524
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,380
A young Shepherd
came upon Jesus,

1525
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,750
Accepted him lord...

Lick me!

Oh, is this cool
or what?

1529
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,600
It's the cone-ilingus move.

Why don't you
take a lick

candy stick,

You sissy boys!
Hee hee hee!

01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,900
That's disgusting!

1534
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,720
And the living Jesus
said unto him,

1535
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,080
"He who is strong
in his belief of God

1536
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:28,520
Shall have
his sins forgiven."

1537
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,530
What a levitation move!

1538
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,490
Jesus said unto him...

Father.

1540
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,180
Luke, do not believe
what you are seeing.

1541
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,710
It is merely
an illusion.

on the deficit!

backdrop. Wow!

an illusion.

that's very real.

you'll be history.

That's enough!

In the name of God,

1567
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,820
I demand you stop
this charade!

1568
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:28,220
You... Demand?

1569
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,390
You're not
in a position

1570

To demand dick,
altar boy!

1571
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,440
See, I know
all about you.

1572
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:35,000
And why you really
joined the church.

1573
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,280
Oh, sure.

dental plan.

Be quiet.

Ignore that
beast, Luke.

1578
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:42,490
You joined the church

1579
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,830
Because you had
no talents, no skills,

1580
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:45,910
Were totally
untrainable,

1581

was under 400.

in the church,

1585

01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,520
Nancy, saving your soul
is thanks enough.

1792
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,400
Good will always
triumph over evil.

1793
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,160
But I'm confident now

1794
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,000
That we have seen the
last of this vile demon.

1795
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,920
Satan: Mayii!

1796
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,930
I'll be back!

1797
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:54,980
All: Ohh, shit.

1798
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,520
So, it happened.

1799
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,730
Victory over the devil.

1800
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,490
A great day for mankind.

1801
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,680
And a pretty good day
for split pea soup.

1802
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:07,560
Nancy and Braydon are
a happy couple again,

1803
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:09,490
And the kids
are just fine.

1804
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:11,530
But now they're taking
acting lessons.

1805
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,330
But that's not important
right now.

1806
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,220
I have a very special
guest here for you.

1807
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,610
Nancy aglet.

1808
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,900
Now, I'm sure many
of you have questions

1809
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,360
You'd like to ask.

1810
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,780
Yes?

1811
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,750
How do you feel
after all of this?

1812
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:31,350
I feel wonderful.
Thanks for asking.

1813
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:33,200
Man: Uh... Uh...

1814
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,580
Yes?

1815
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,050
No offense,
but I think

1816
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:37,460
You're insulting
our intelligence.

1817
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,780
I mean, honestly,

1818
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,760
Do you expect us to
swallow this bullshit?

A girl Nancy *

1833

* would she get away?
Or could she? Can she *

1834
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,820
* find a way out?
I doubt *

1835
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,060
