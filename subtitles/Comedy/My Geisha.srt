1
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,960
Good morning, Mr Lewis,
Miss Dell's in the playroom, sir,

2
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,560
Morning, George, I'll find her,

3
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,920
Very good,

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,440
Not ladylike, but good,

5
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Hello, Sam,

6
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,040
Did you find out
where the genius is going?

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Nope, He won't tell me anything,

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,600
The two of them are in there mumbling,

9
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
And every time I try to listen,
they shut up,

10
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,960
Well, we'll find out in a minute,

11
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,960
<i>- Second location, yeah?</i>
<i>- But look at the potential,,,</i>

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
Hi, Sam,

13
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,600
Sam, how are you?

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,560
I think I'm fine,
I'll know better after I hear your story,

15
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,960
You're gonna love it, Sam, Love it,

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,120
All this mystery, I know what it is,

17
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,960
It's another Western,

18
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
And how do you know it's a Western?

19
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,760
'Cause I looked in your closet,

20
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,640
And I see you're taking
your hiking boots,

21
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
I always take those boots
when I go on location,

22
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Well, then it's a picture set in Alaska,

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,440
Why Alaska?

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,160
Because I saw your finger on the map
before you snatched it away,

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,800
Well, you're getting warmer,
Keep trying,

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm not interested,

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,640
I probably won't like it, anyway,

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,240
Did it ever occur to you
that being your wife

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,480
is no guarantee
I'm doing every story you dream up?

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
<i>Think about that for a while,</i>
<i>Herr Director,</i>

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, now, no talk like that,

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,320
It's a good story, You'll like it,

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,320
How do you know, Sam?
You haven't even heard it yet,

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,760
My nose tells me,

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,120
I smell enthusiasm,

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,000
Look at their faces,
Like a couple of kids with a new toy,

37
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
I smell a hit,

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,000
I smell his part's gonna be
fatter than mine,

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
May I say, it is about time?

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
Lt'll be rewritten,

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,680
Never happen, Not this part,

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,720
Now, enough already,

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,680
Save the suspense for the picture,
Let me hear something,

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,280
Sit down, Sam,

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready,

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
Good,

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
We are going to do

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,640
<i>Madame Butterfly.</i>

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>Madame Butterfly?</i>

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,200
I know what you think,

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,880
but it's a wonderful love story, Sam,

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,160
And through the story, I want to capture
the real traditional Japan,

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,960
Picture it, Sam,
All shot in natural settings,

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
It's a country of yellow and red lacquer,

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,720
It was made for colour film,

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,320
And that score,
it has international appeal,

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Well, I don't know,

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,120
I play Lieutenant Pinkerton,

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,720
Of course, it's magnificent casting,
I'm ideal for the part,

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,560
And I walk around
on those little wooden shoes

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,120
and go chop, chop, chop, huh?

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
You're not in the picture, Lucy,

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
She's not?

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm not?

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,720
No, you're not,

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm going to use a real Japanese girl,

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,800
That's the kind of picture
it's going to be, real,

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,000
Not just an opera, but real,

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Well, that's a surprise,

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,200
And a very unpleasant surprise,

71
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,520
Now, look here, Paul,
I'm going to talk plainly,

72
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,680
Lucy is the biggest single
box-office attraction we have,

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,160
<i>Now, when you said Madame Butterfly,</i>

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
I thought you had a comic version

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,600
that would allow her to be funny,
to be a clown,

76
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
- Well, I haven't,
- To do the thing that she's famous for,

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,880
<i>- I haven't,</i>
<i>- Well,,,</i>

78
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,600
And Lucy in the part of
Madame Butterfly would be offensive,

79
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
Well, that's a nice word,

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,200
No, you are a great comic, Lucy,
and a great artist,

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,560
but the role of Madame Butterfly
is outside your range,

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,960
Outside, my foot!

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,080
It's harder to get laughs
than crying into handkerchiefs,

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Get some of those
handkerchief sniffers to try it,

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,640
I agree, darling,
but I don't see you in this part,

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,360
And, Sam, if you don't care to do it,

87
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,040
I can go ahead with another studio,
and no hard feeling,

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Well, I can't make that decision
without talking to New York,

89
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,800
Why do you have to go to Japan
so soon? What's the rush?

90
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,720
Our problem is beating
the rainy season,

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
We're short of time as it is,

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
You're not too mad at me,
are you, Lucy?

93
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,720
Not too mad,

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,240
I was just thinking where there was
a gun in the house so I could shoot you,

95
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,160
I'm sorry, darling,
but I have to do this picture,

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,840
It means more to me than you suspect,

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,760
It won't be too long,
I'll call you every day,

98
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,720
If I'd wanted to kiss a telephone
good night, I'd have married one,

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,120
The luggage is packed now, sir,

100
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Well, let's get the funeral procession
over with,

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Pick me up at my house,
would you, Pauly?

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,360
- I might as well be going,
- See you at the airport, Sam?

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,480
<i>... via Honolulu is now boarding</i>
<i>at Gate 10.</i>

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
<i>All aboard, please.</i>

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
Well, that's you, boys,

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,880
You know something, I've kissed Lucy
so often in front of the camera

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,040
with him directing me, I'm curious
to see the master himself at work,

108
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,760
Carry on, Here, I'll hold your library,

109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Take care of yourself,

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,400
Get enough rest,

111
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,640
Don't smoke too much,

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
Think of me,

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,880
Day and night, my love,

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
Well, it's not bad,

115
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,560
A little old-fashioned, perhaps,

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,040
My parents used to kiss like that,

117
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,000
Wow,

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,760
Well, not exactly like my parents,

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,440
or not when I was around, at any rate,

120
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
Oh, Paul,

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,600
I've sent a long telegram
to Leonard in New York,

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,440
I hope he goes along with the idea,

123
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
You know you have my vote,

124
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,800
Thanks, Sam,

125
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,320
- Bye, darling,
- Bye, baby,

126
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
- Goodbye, Uncle Sam,
- Happy landing,

127
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,960
Well, goodbye, Bob,

128
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,040
- Bye, leading lady,
- Bye,

129
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,160
Bye, lover, Good luck,

130
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,680
Well, tomorrow we find out
if New York likes documentary opera,

131
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,880
That's the worst idea I ever heard of
in my whole life!

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,960
Well, it isn't really so terrible, Leonard,
if you stop and think about it,

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>Madame Butterfly is a masterpiece,</i>
<i>It should be done,</i>

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,480
Well, let Sam Goldwyn do it!

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,680
<i>Look, look, I like Madame Butterfly.</i>

136
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,320
I'll even pay my $2 and go to see it,

137
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,160
but what I won't do is to pay $2 million

138
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,160
to have Robert Moore
kissing a Japanese girl!

139
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,840
The film public wants to see
Robert Moore kissing you,

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,120
And your artistic husband
should know that,

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,560
It's out of the question!

142
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,640
I absolutely forbid him to make it!

143
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Tell him another studio might want it,

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,800
Leonard, I don't really see
how you can forbid him to make it,

145
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,160
He's only given you first choice,

146
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,160
Another studio wants it,

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,040
Now, watch, He can't stand that,

148
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,160
- Put Sam on the phone,
- I can hear you from here,

149
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,480
We can hear you fine, Leonard,

150
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Sam, this is an order,

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,240
The film is not to cost
more than a half a million dollars,

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,280
That's all a Robert Moore picture
without Lucy is worth!

153
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,680
Now, you go to Japan
and watch every penny,

154
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,360
I hold you responsible!

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,440
You can't make it
for a half a million dollars!

156
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,840
He hung up,

157
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,000
<i>Can Madame Butterfly</i>
<i>be done for half a,,,</i>

158
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,160
No!

159
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,000
But in the motion picture business,
a half a million dollars

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
is roughly $700,000,

161
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,160
Maybe,

162
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,960
Maybe with a little skimping and saving
and me watching the pennies,

163
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,160
we can make it for $800,000,

164
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,960
I better go to Japan right now,

165
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,360
There must be other ways
of making a living,

166
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
Fortunately, I don't know any,

167
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,360
Well, I'll be leaving tomorrow

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,320
before that husband of yours
starts making contracts

169
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,880
to use all of Japan as extras,

170
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,520
I'll kiss him for you,

171
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,680
Sam,

172
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,520
can I kiss him myself?

173
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
Take me with you,
You don't have a picture for me, yet,

174
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,440
And I'll come back
anytime you tell me to,

175
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,280
You miss him already?

176
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,880
Well, maybe you can help,

177
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,080
We'll have to tell him
he has to make a cheap picture,

178
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,720
That won't be easy,

179
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,200
I'll phone you when we leave,

180
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,720
Thank you, Sam,

181
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,200
Now, he hasn't any other studio
to back him,

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Once in a while, I don't mind making
a little artistic gamble,

183
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
There are other things in life
beside just money,

184
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
That's one of them,

185
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
Thank you, Sam,

186
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,480
Well, goodbye, darling, I'll phone you,

187
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Thank you,

188
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,160
This is Tokyo tower,

189
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,400
Make straight-in approach to runway 33,

190
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,680
You are cleared to land, Over,

191
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,840
Oh, hello, Mr Takata, How are you?

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,240
Fine, Mr Lewis,

193
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,160
It's so nice to see you again
in our country,

194
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,560
Well, it's nice to be back here,

195
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,960
Lucy, this is Mr Kenichi Takata,

196
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,560
- the head of our office in Japan,
- How do you do?

197
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,520
- Miss Lucy Dell,
- How do you do?

198
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,080
I was not informed you were coming,

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,520
There would have been the press,

200
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
Oh, no, No press is quite all right,

201
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,680
I used a fake name, anyway,
We're surprising my husband,

202
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,120
He will be surprised,

203
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,880
He awaits only Mr Lewis at his hotel,

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,240
- This way, please,
- Certainly,

205
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,160
Excuse me a moment,

206
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
Lucy, because the plane was late,

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
Paul and Bob asked me to meet them
at this teahouse restaurant,

208
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,840
So why don't you go upstairs
and freshen up a bit?

209
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,160
I'll go and see the boys,
and then I'll send the car back,

210
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,960
and then you can come in
and really surprise them, How's that?

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,520
Stay head of the studio, Sam,
You couldn't be an actor,

212
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
What do you mean?

213
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,960
You're afraid I'll catch Paul
with someone, isn't that right?

214
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,800
- Oh, no, no, Not at all,
- Yes, it is,

215
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
Well,

216
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not in favour of surprises,

217
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,040
especially out of town,

218
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,880
I had a very bad experience once

219
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,480
with two married stars in Pittsburgh,

220
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,760
There'll never be
a Pittsburgh with us, Sam,

221
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,160
Take my word for it,

222
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,160
I'd bet my life on Paul,

223
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,320
Now let's freshen up,
We'll both surprise him,

224
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Lucy Dell-san,

225
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
This is the mama-san,

226
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
How do you do?

227
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
They will take us to your husband,

228
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,480
- Thank you,
- Miss Dell,

229
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,320
We see your picture often,

230
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,880
- Thank you,
- I have a photograph of you on my wall,

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Thank you very much,

232
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,800
You're very big in Japan,

233
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,200
- Thank you,
- Thank you very much,

234
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,680
That's nice,

235
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
It's really gorgeous in here,

236
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,960
Charming, isn't it?
What a lovely little bridge, too,

237
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,320
Very lovely, yes,

238
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,720
They've got five dames
waiting on them in there,

239
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,280
I heard it was a man's country,
but this is ridiculous,

240
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
More!

241
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,760
Yes, They come and go all evening,

242
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
Why that different makeup?

243
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,120
The first one is a waitress,
and the other one is a geisha,

244
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,240
Geisha?

245
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,760
Well, tell them they're wasting their time
on my boy,

246
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
Or could it be we're in Pittsburgh?

247
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,600
Lucy, you don't believe that of geisha,
do you?

248
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Certainly you know better than that,

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know,
I've heard conflicting stories,

250
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,320
I haven't won one yet,

251
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,040
Do you think this is crooked?

252
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't see how,

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,280
Maybe they're clairvoyant,

254
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,840
I'll be a monkey's uncle,

255
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
What's the monkey's uncle drinking?

256
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,360
Sake, It's rice wine,

257
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
They're beautiful,

258
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,120
This is Miss Lucy Dell,

259
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
Hello,

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
Are they wigs, or is that their own hair?

261
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
It's a wig,

262
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,880
Wigs,

263
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Could I put on one of those costumes
and make my face white like they do?

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,440
Yes,

265
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
You might fool him as you walk in,

266
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,640
but first straight look at you,
he'll know you,

267
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,440
- I'll bet you $100,
- All right, you've got it,

268
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,840
Not yet, but I think I will,

269
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,040
The bet's for one good
straight look, okay?

270
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,440
Okay, What comes after?

271
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,280
Then I'm gonna jump in his lap
and give him a big fat kiss

272
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,720
and see how Mr Nonchalant
reacts to that,

273
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,120
It's worth losing just to see,
Don't be long,

274
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,280
Okay,

275
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
Hiya, Sam!

276
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
- Hi, Paul,
- Hi, Sam,

277
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,280
Pull up your knees and sit down,

278
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,560
Tell me, did you see Lucy
before you left?

279
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,960
We went to the airport together,
She sends her love,

280
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll drink to that,

281
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,240
To Lucy, the greatest wife
both sides of the Pacific,

282
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,720
Thank you,

283
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,160
Thank you,

284
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
Here?

285
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,120
I make you a beautiful geisha,

286
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Thank you,

287
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,160
This is white makeup,

288
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,720
- I put this on my face?
- Yes,

289
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,080
Like this?

290
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,560
But imagine, Sam,

291
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,400
imagine hearing Puccini's music
over a shot of Fujiyama,

292
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,720
over those beautiful shrines,
over a face like that,

293
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,880
Yes,

294
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,320
lt'll be fabulous,

295
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh, brother, I got to stop eating,

296
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,480
My stomach's busting,
and my knees are killing me,

297
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,080
Paul, can't we leave now?

298
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,800
Look, Bob,
we ought to stay another five minutes,

299
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,320
just as a matter of courtesy,

300
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,480
Okay,

301
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,400
By the way, Paul,
I expect the music tomorrow morning,

302
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,080
I want you to listen to it,

303
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
They've done a wonderful recording job,

304
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm sure you'll like it,

305
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,560
Fine, I want to hear them
as soon as possible,

306
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
No, no, no, enough with sake,

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
Sake, You know, I like sake,

308
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm gonna have a couple of cases
sent out to California,

309
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,560
You know, I have to finish casting
before I look for locations,

310
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,520
Well, they certainly should help you
with all the casting,

311
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
- Certainly,
- They can be very helpful, I'm sure,

312
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,800
Good, Thank you,

313
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,960
We're overdoing this, aren't we?

314
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,280
I only want to see actors
who speak English, of course,

315
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,600
I understand,

316
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,880
Does that limit my selection?

317
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,600
No, not very much,

318
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Good, Good,

319
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,760
Let's see if my luck has changed any,

320
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,320
No,

321
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,120
Come on,

322
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,960
I win! I knew I'd get the hang of it,

323
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,760
Come on, come on,
young lady, drink up,

324
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,200
I quit while I'm ahead,

325
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,080
I don't want to break my winning streak,

326
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,760
Young lady, do you know

327
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,160
that you were up against
one of the smartest gamblers

328
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,800
who ever floated down the Mississippi?

329
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,160
Floated up, too, which is even harder,

330
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
You are so funny,

331
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,200
Thank you, ma'am,
And you're very charming,

332
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,920
And you are very pretty, too, miss,

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,320
Thank you,

334
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,880
You know, these people
are very photogenic,

335
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,480
It's their bone structure,
high, full cheeks,

336
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,440
More so than occidentals?

337
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,760
Oh, yeah,

338
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,520
I mean, this girl, for instance,

339
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,680
is a better photographic subject
than, say, Lucy?

340
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
Excuse me,

341
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,480
Absolutely,

342
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,360
Well, you're the expert,
I know when I'm licked,

343
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,240
Well,

344
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,360
enough polite, Goodbye, everybody,

345
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,520
Miss, how do you say
goodbye in Japanese?

346
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,040
<i>Sayonara.</i>

347
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
Certainly, What's the matter with me?

348
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,760
It's the only word in Japanese
I do know,

349
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,240
It's the only word in Japanese
a lot of people know,

350
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,640
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>- Well, sayonara, everybody,</i>

351
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,000
Marlon Brando,

352
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,200
Thank you,

353
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,040
- Go and come back,
- Why?

354
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,120
- Go on and come back,
- All right,

355
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,080
Thank you so much,

356
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,560
Thank you very much, Wonderful,

357
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you so much, Wonderful,

358
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,560
Madame, we'll be back again,

359
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,320
- We had a wonderful time,
- Thank you very much,

360
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,680
<i>Sayonara, you all!</i>

361
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Old Japanese saying,

362
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
"Fast pay make fast friends,"

363
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,280
Sam, what chance has Paul got
to make a good picture

364
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,760
on this cheap budget?

365
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,080
Not much,

366
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,920
Tomorrow, I'm going to tell him
he can't shoot it in colour,

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,880
lt'll have to be
in glorious black and white,

368
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,080
Without your name on the picture,

369
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,760
we can only spend so much
and no more,

370
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,960
Are you thinking the same thing
I'm thinking?

371
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,880
Exactly, And you'd be great in the part,

372
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,240
I'd love to do it, Sam,

373
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,280
And it'd really be
something different for me,

374
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,440
Without hurting Paul,
how can we talk him into it?

375
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,280
Well, how are you hurting him?

376
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,040
Without you, he has a cheap picture,

377
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,240
black and white,
and without the best opera singers,

378
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,400
With you, the sky is the limit,

379
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,120
Colour, famous singers,

380
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,000
<i>and he could shoot on location</i>
<i>until he's,,, To his heart's content,</i>

381
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,640
So, how are you hurting him?

382
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,960
Well, it's a matter of pride,

383
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
He's so sold on using
a real Japanese girl,

384
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
Well, then it's false pride,

385
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,160
He couldn't tell you from a Japanese,
and he was six inches from you,

386
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,120
We'll have to do it delicately,

387
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,160
Well, fine, Force him delicately,

388
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,320
How?

389
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,400
Let me do it,

390
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,120
I'll suggest you for the part,

391
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,680
He'll refuse, We'll argue for an hour,

392
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,000
Then I'll say, "Made up as Japanese,
you could fool anyone,"

393
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,080
Sooner or later, take my word for it,

394
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
he'll say,
"Oh, no, no, she could never fool me,"

395
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,960
"All right,

396
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,360
"we'll make that the deciding condition,"

397
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
After he agrees,
we'll show him we fooled him already,

398
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,600
He'll stick to his bargain,
I know it, I guarantee it,

399
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,120
Sam, are producers born that way,
or do they teach you those things

400
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
when you join the studio?

401
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,960
Well, like the man said,
who was asked if he was a communist,

402
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,160
"We're not allowed to tell,"

403
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,640
Well, the local gals
don't come blue-eyed,

404
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,320
so I'll need some contact lenses,

405
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
It's all right, We'll send to America

406
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
to have a man come down here
and fit you,

407
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
Sam, contact lenses
were invented in Japan,

408
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,040
- Really?
- Yes,

409
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,800
<i>Well, live and learn.</i>

410
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,400
Thank you, Very nice,

411
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,720
We also dance,
We do soft-shoe, ballet and classical,

412
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,720
We have a bicycle act,
We could show you,

413
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,480
I ride on my sister's shoulder
and play an ukulele,

414
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,040
It goes over very well,

415
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,000
<i>I'm afraid it would be a little difficult</i>
<i>to fit into Madame Butterfly.</i>

416
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,920
But anyway, thank you very much,
young ladies,

417
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,240
Mr Takata will call you
if we can use you,

418
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,680
- Good morning, Mr Takata,
- Good morning, Mr Lewis,

419
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
- Paul in there?
- Yes, Please come in,

420
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,720
Thank you,

421
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,360
Morning, Paul,

422
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Hello, Sam,
That's all, Takata, thank you,

423
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,000
- All right,
- How did you sleep?

424
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,200
Fine, I'm all caught up,
How are you making out?

425
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,440
I've seen 30 girls this morning,

426
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,000
Ukulele acts on bicycles
and rock 'n' roll singers,

427
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,720
They're more western
than the girls at home,

428
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,080
I knew there was an American tendency,

429
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,600
but they are making a fetish of it,

430
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
They're not Japanese anymore,

431
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
Look at them,

432
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
I felt this problem
when I got off the plane

433
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,040
and saw the neon signs,

434
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
That's just why I want to do this picture,

435
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,440
I want to capture that
other spirit of Japan while it still exists,

436
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,600
Sam, the mistake I have made

437
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,240
was thinking I should use
a Japanese actress,

438
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,800
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that,

439
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Why?

440
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,480
Because I've come to recommend
an American actress,

441
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
- Who?
- Lucy,

442
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,800
I thought we settled that,

443
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,160
Yes, but you just said you're not using
a Japanese actress,

444
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,160
That's right, Not an actress,

445
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,680
I want to use a plain,
old-fashioned, real Japanese girl,

446
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,520
who doesn't sing rock 'n' roll, That's all,

447
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,240
You've got a built-in hostility
to Lucy playing that part,

448
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,840
Now look, Paul, I say,

449
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
Lucy made up as a geisha
in a roomful of geishas,

450
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,840
you'd never pick her out,

451
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,520
You're blowing your top, Sam,

452
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,680
- You had too much sake last night,
- I say she'd fool you,

453
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,560
And I say she'd never fool me
for a minute,

454
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,720
Well, I'd be willing to go by that test,
What do you say?

455
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,680
I haven't time for this foolishness,

456
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,800
I know now the sort of girl I want,

457
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,200
Now, be fair,

458
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,360
Get one of those geisha
we saw last night,

459
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,920
In fact, I know the very one,

460
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,160
The girl who came in last, The shy one,

461
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,840
The one I beat in the game,

462
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,360
<i>Well, I've got some,,,</i>

463
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,200
There was something about that geisha,

464
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,040
I didn't know what it was,
And then suddenly it came over me,

465
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,520
- Do you know who she reminds me of?
- Who?

466
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,920
Lucy, Yes, Lucy,

467
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,200
You don't see it, but I do,

468
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,280
I tell you,
she's exactly as photogenic as Lucy,

469
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
I guarantee it,

470
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
Well, what do you know?

471
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,760
Sam, what do I need out of this girl?
A face,

472
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,840
But it must be a real face,

473
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
Madame Butterfly was a geisha,

474
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,160
This girl is a geisha,

475
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,880
She'll play it real because
she doesn't know any other way,

476
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,520
I'm sure I'm right, Don't resist the idea,

477
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,600
No, No, I'm not resisting it,

478
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,800
Just let me think about it,

479
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,720
Sam, I'd like to pay a compliment,

480
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,920
- There is nobody like you in Hollywood,
- Well, I haven't said yes, yet,

481
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,560
- Yes, but you agree to the principle?
- Yes, in principle,

482
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,680
All right, I don't hold you to that girl,

483
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,880
<i>If it's not that geisha, well,</i>
<i>we'll look for another,,,</i>

484
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
No, no, that girl,

485
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,280
- That geisha was the best,
- You think so, too, huh?

486
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,320
I give you my word,
I couldn't take my eyes off her,

487
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,080
She's got something, no doubt,
I'll give her a screen test,

488
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Sam, on this picture,
I want the real thing,

489
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,160
I want to get away from a film studio,

490
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,400
I tell you, Sam,
we can make screen history,

491
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,320
While you're making it, I'll run along,

492
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,080
I have some errands,

493
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,440
Thank you,

494
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,520
So long, Sam, Take care of yourself,

495
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,400
- I'm awfully fond of you,
- I love you, too,

496
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,480
Well, I hope my eyes don't blink
too much,

497
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,680
I have to get used
to these contact lenses,

498
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,920
Well, the thing to stress
is how old-fashioned you are,

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,160
That's the quality he says
he keeps looking for,

500
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,920
I'll be old-fashioned,

501
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What are you going to say?
Have you got a story prepared?

502
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,240
- I have a story,
- Well, aren't you nervous?

503
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,760
No, Sam, but I will be pretty soon,

504
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm sorry,

505
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,040
I think we must use psychology on Paul,

506
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,440
If he thinks he won't be able to get me,
he'll want me,

507
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
What?

508
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,080
You work in a restaurant,

509
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,120
You have a chance to be a film star,
and you're going to play hard to get?

510
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,640
Sam, you going to listen
or keep talking?

511
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,160
All right, I'm listening,

512
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,040
Go tell Paul I'm a very religious girl,
and when I finish my geisha time,

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm entering a Buddhist convent,

514
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,680
What's that?

515
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,640
Please, We haven't time
to debate this, Sam,

516
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,280
Do as I ask, Run and tell him that,

517
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,720
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing,

518
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
Convent?

519
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
Well?

520
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
Maybe we ought to get another girl,

521
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,160
<i>- Why?</i>
<i>- Well, this one is,,, I don't know,</i>

522
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,200
She won't give him options
for more pictures,

523
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,760
More pictures? She's not
too interested in doing this one,

524
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,320
- She's not?
- What?

525
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,680
I don't know, I can't get it clear,

526
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,640
but she's going into a convent
or something,

527
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,200
Kind of a religious type,

528
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,960
Paul, don't take on headaches
you don't need,

529
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
I don't know,

530
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,600
A spiritual quality
is what this role calls for,

531
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,120
Not interested in the part, huh?

532
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
Here she comes,

533
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
- Good morning,
- Good morning,

534
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm afraid I don't know your name,

535
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,360
Yoko Mori,

536
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,840
Yoko Mori,
That is a very melodious name,

537
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,720
Yes, nice and short,
Looks fine on a marquee,

538
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,160
You remember Mr Moore?

539
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,320
Very famous American picture star,

540
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,920
I am honoured,

541
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,560
Well, thank you,

542
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,000
I am likewise honoured,

543
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
What pictures of mine have you seen?

544
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,320
I never see you in cinema,

545
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
I sorry, I do not go,

546
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,040
I thought the Japanese
were big picture fans,

547
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,720
<i>Hai, we in Japan</i>
<i>admire greatly the American film,</i>

548
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,040
But not you?

549
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,920
I hope I not give offence,

550
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,720
No, no,
We're just curious why you don't go,

551
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,720
I follow old tradition,

552
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,840
My honoured grandmother
never go cinema,

553
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,160
I'm afraid that
the cinema wasn't invented

554
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,440
when your grandmother was around,

555
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
Well, let's begin, shall we?

556
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,800
What is she, some kind of nut?

557
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,360
- I say get somebody else,
- Well, you can't tell yet,

558
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,800
I can tell,

559
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Okay, thank you, Shig, Thank you,

560
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,680
Now, here,

561
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,760
Here, that way, That way,

562
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,840
<i>Now, Now, Miss Moro, I,,,</i>

563
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Mori,

564
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,560
Yes, of course, I'm sorry, Yoko Mori,

565
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,000
Can I have a little quiet, please?

566
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,440
Thank you very much,

567
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,880
Now, Miss Mori,
this is mostly a photographic test,

568
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,800
We want to see how you look on film,

569
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,440
how your voice sounds
and how you move,

570
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,560
I'll ask a question from off-camera,
and you answer me,

571
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,360
Now, that's simple, isn't it?

572
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,120
<i>Hai, seems simple,</i>

573
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,960
We go, Right?

574
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,880
Rolling,

575
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,320
<i>Madame Butterfly. Test,</i>

576
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,800
Yoko Mori, Take one,

577
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,800
Are you nervous, Miss Mori?

578
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
<i>Hai, I little nervous,</i>

579
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,440
That's very natural,

580
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,320
- May I call you Yoko?
- I would be honoured,

581
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,360
Yoko, we know very little of geisha,

582
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,800
Would you tell us something
about yourself,

583
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,800
where you were born,
how you were raised,

584
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,400
and how you came to be a geisha?

585
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,400
I was born the youngest of 11 children

586
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,360
to my poor but very honourable parents

587
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,800
in small village not far from Tokyo,

588
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,320
When I was a few weeks old,
my father died,

589
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,960
and mother unable to raise me,

590
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,280
she sent me to live
with honourable grandparents,

591
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,280
who raised me until I was five years old,

592
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,720
Since they, too, were also quite poor,

593
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,160
it became necessary at that time
to sell me,

594
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
<i>When I was sold,,,</i>

595
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,680
Hold it a moment, Yoko,

596
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,400
Hold it,

597
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,920
Am I not speaking clearly?

598
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,880
No, you're speaking fine,

599
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,960
The part about you being sold,

600
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,560
could you explain that a little more fully?

601
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,320
My grandfather went to a man
who bought young girls

602
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
to train as geisha,

603
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,640
He bought many girls,

604
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,880
although not all girls were able
to become a geisha,

605
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,560
I was most fortunate,

606
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,400
I became geisha,

607
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,920
Does this man still own you, Yoko?

608
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,920
No, I recently pay back last of money

609
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,200
to honourable gentleman,

610
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,320
That's very commendable,

611
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,840
I do not understand the word,

612
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,960
Oh, it's a compliment,
It means very nice,

613
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,280
I don't understand that word,

614
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,960
That means thank you very much,

615
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,400
Thank you,

616
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,280
Bob, why don't you stand next to Yoko?

617
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,680
Okay,

618
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,120
How much shorter is she than you?

619
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,200
Oh, quite a lot,
I'd say three or four inches, at least,

620
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
Yoko,

621
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,800
would you put your arms
around Mr Moore and kiss him?

622
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,040
It is necessary?

623
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,280
Have you any objection
to kissing Mr Moore?

624
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,520
No, Only I have never
kiss anyone before,

625
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,960
<i>Paul, if,,,</i>

626
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,120
Never?

627
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,080
You mean never in your whole life?

628
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,600
Kissing not Japanese custom,

629
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,640
However, I have seen it done
and will attempt it, if you wish,

630
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,360
Paul, if you don't mind,

631
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,240
I'll direct this part of the scene myself,

632
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,200
Honey? Put your arms out,

633
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,800
No, no,

634
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
This way,

635
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
That's it,

636
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,560
Well,

637
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,640
What have you got to report, director?

638
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,440
Hey,

639
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,960
Oh,

640
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,040
Well, if that's her first kiss,

641
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm afraid to see what she'll be like
with a little practise,

642
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,560
What do you think of kissing, Yoko?

643
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,960
It is most interesting,

644
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,880
She can take
kissing direction great, Paul,

645
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Take my word for that,

646
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,880
All right, cut,

647
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,480
You were very natural, Yoko,

648
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,600
I had him kiss you to see
if it would upset you,

649
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,920
It is good, this being natural?

650
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,080
It's the hardest kind of acting to do,

651
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,480
- Take my word for it,
- Oh, yeah,

652
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,880
Why don't you wait for me
in the dressing room, Miss Mori?

653
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,480
Thank you very much, Thank you,

654
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,520
<i>I think the kid's just great, She's,,,</i>

655
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,400
Well, I mean, she's natural,

656
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,920
You know, that's what Paul said
the part calls for,

657
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,840
You're the producer, Sam,
How do you vote?

658
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,200
Well, I'm not against her,
but I'd prefer a girl with options,

659
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,320
Come on, Sam,

660
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,800
Sam, this one-shot appearance
can be an asset to us,

661
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,480
We'll publicise that this girl
is going into a convent,

662
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,800
lt'll be a tremendous emotional wallop
to the audience,

663
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,920
- Yeah, yeah, you bet, you bet,
- Well, you may be right,

664
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
I'll tell her she got the part,

665
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,840
Here, now, Just a minute, Bob,
Let me be the producer in something,

666
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,760
After all, I still have
the business negotiations to make,

667
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,000
<i>- You're right, Sam, Come on, Bob,</i>
<i>- Yeah, I just,,,</i>

668
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,680
- How'd we do?
- Well, you got the part,

669
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,280
They talked me into it,

670
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,800
Attaboy, Sam,

671
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,520
You know, that convent idea did it,

672
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,480
Lucy, when you decide to retire
from acting,

673
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,640
I'll make you a producer,

674
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,080
- You're just dishonest enough,
- Thank you,

675
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,120
By the way, you're going to have
trouble with Bob,

676
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,440
- What kind of trouble?
- Well, romantic trouble,

677
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,920
He's anticipating laughs,

678
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,640
I can tell, with the geisha,

679
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,440
I always have that kind of trouble
with Bob, Sam,

680
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,000
- What's that?
- Yeah,

681
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,680
I don't believe it,

682
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,720
Why, he's Paul's friend,

683
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,240
There's nothing wrong with Bob,

684
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
He's just a delayed adolescent,
that's all,

685
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,080
Why do you think he's been married
four times?

686
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,000
He falls in love with the woman
who's nearest,

687
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,480
It doesn't bother me, though, Sam,

688
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,720
Who is it?

689
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,440
It's me, Yoko, Open the door,

690
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,080
Who is me, please?

691
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,920
Mr Moore,

692
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,720
Mr Moore,

693
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,320
<i>Please, dozo. Come in,</i>

694
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,680
<i>Yoko, honey, I,,,</i>

695
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,480
I've just been thinking,
Maybe I could help you a lot,

696
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,200
How would you like to rehearse
at my hotel this evening?

697
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
<i>We,,,</i>

698
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,560
The door was locked,
I thought you were alone,

699
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,280
Now, Bob,
you might as well get used to it,

700
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,360
I have to bring this girl back
to her uncle every night,

701
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,080
He's made me responsible for her,

702
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,880
You know, these people are very strict,
Come on,

703
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,680
For heaven's sake, Sam,
I wasn't going to eat her,

704
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,600
Thank you very much for offer,
Mr Moore,

705
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,800
That's all right, Yoko,

706
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,960
What's the matter with you?
Are you an animal or something?

707
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,200
<i>- Let me,,,</i>
<i>- Go on now, please,</i>

708
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,880
Sam, up to here it's been a joke,
but now I want to start to work,

709
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,840
I want to listen to the radio,
day and night,

710
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,160
and get the inflection in my ear,

711
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,720
I've been bluffing it,

712
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,960
I want to move to a real Japanese hotel,

713
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,240
and I want a coach, the best,

714
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll show that husband of mine,

715
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
"You're a great comic, Luce,

716
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,240
"but the role of Madame Butterfly
is outside your range,"

717
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,560
<i>He'll eat those words</i>
<i>with nouvelle vague sauce,</i>

718
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,000
my fine French genius,

719
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
Do it, Luce, Do it,

720
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,920
- Come in, Come in, Mr Takata,
- Thank you,

721
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,160
I came as soon as I could,

722
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,440
I hope you are pleased with your room,

723
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,280
- I need a chair,
- No, nothing doing,

724
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,120
We don't want you sitting down
on the chair, in the middle of a scene,

725
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
forget yourself like that,

726
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
Mr Takata?

727
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,520
Now, the most important thing now
is to find the teacher for her,

728
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,800
Are there such things
as geisha teachers?

729
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,600
- There are,
- Well, fine, We want the best,

730
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,440
Sworn to secrecy,

731
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,880
Takata, now, you get one over here,
say, at 3:00,

732
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,640
I have an old friend who is
one of the most famous teachers,

733
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,240
And perhaps he will
kindly permit us to visit him,

734
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,960
Well, we'd be very much obliged,
Mr Takata,

735
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,760
Of course, we'll pay him
whatever his time is worth,

736
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,840
and we'll appreciate it very much
if he'll teach Miss Dell,

737
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,320
I will present our plea most earnestly,

738
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,480
Thank you,

739
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,960
- May I leave now?
- Yes, Certainly,

740
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,160
Thank you,

741
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,960
<i>- Well, thank you very much,,,</i>
<i>- It's a pleasure,</i>

742
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,240
<i>,,,for the time you've given me,</i>

743
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,560
- Goodbye,
- Thank you very much,

744
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,800
Goodbye,

745
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,960
- Goodbye,
- Goodbye,

746
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,080
Goodbye,

747
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,160
That was certainly a boner,
asking him to bring the teacher here,

748
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,280
I forget how polite these people are,

749
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,560
- He is expecting us,
- Thank you,

750
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,920
Welcome to my home, I am honoured,

751
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,960
I am privileged to enter,

752
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,680
May I present my friends

753
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,560
Miss Lucy Dell and Mr Samuel Lewis?

754
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,040
- How do you do?
- How do you do? How are you?

755
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,280
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

756
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,920
- How do you do?
- Would you be seated?

757
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,960
- Thank you,
- Thank you,

758
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,560
<i>It occurs to me,</i>
<i>our ceremony of cha-no-yu</i>

759
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,400
may not be interesting to you,

760
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,760
It is the preparation and drinking of tea,

761
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
We drink tea in America

762
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,080
with lemon, iced, creamed,
all sorts of ways,

763
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,880
- We like tea,
- That's right,

764
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
Our main purpose in our tea ceremony

765
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,680
is not actually the drinking of it,

766
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,320
but to create
an atmosphere of tranquillity,

767
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,280
Like our martini, Same principle,

768
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,880
I understand your time is limited,

769
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,600
We may assume
the atmosphere is tranquil, if you wish,

770
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,720
It is most kind of you,

771
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,440
We've come for advice and guidance,

772
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,600
I'll help if I can,

773
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,880
Miss Dell is a famous
motion picture actress in America,

774
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,440
Mr Lewis is Miss Dell's employer,

775
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,760
<i>He wishes to film a motion picture</i>
<i>of Madame Butterfly.</i>

776
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,520
Since Miss Dell will play
the part of a geisha,

777
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,040
he hopes that
you may be able to instruct her,

778
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,960
Yes, she has a whole week
to get up in it,

779
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
I'm not sure I understand,

780
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,120
Oh, I'm a quick study, I'll surprise you,

781
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,560
I would be truly surprised, Miss Dell,

782
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,160
The tea ceremony we are watching
takes many months to perfect,

783
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,720
There are 90 separate and exact steps,

784
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,600
Well, say we skipped the tea ceremony,
Could she get up on the rest of it?

785
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,320
If I worked hard?

786
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,000
Perhaps, I can best answer you

787
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,520
if I tell you what a geisha is,

788
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,280
A real geisha, as you say,

789
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,280
I have a particular girl in mind,

790
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,800
At seven years of age,
she became an apprentice,

791
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,080
In the coldest winters,

792
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,440
she would practise
her musical instruments,

793
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,960
As her fingers became
too numb to strike,

794
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,080
she would dip her hands,
chapped and bleeding,

795
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
into a pan of ice water,

796
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,800
<i>This is called kan-geiko,</i>
<i>or winter practise,</i>

797
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,160
and is not intended for cruelty,

798
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,960
but discipline,

799
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,720
It has been estimated

800
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,920
that the hours required
for study and work

801
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,440
to become a true geisha

802
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,440
equal that of a doctor,

803
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,440
The geisha whom I describe

804
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,720
speaks French and English
and Chinese,

805
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,720
She plays excellent golf

806
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,560
and tennis and is a ski champion,

807
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,400
She dances the ancient dances

808
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,080
and the tango equally well,

809
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,600
She can converse with almost any man
on his profession,

810
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,120
Should he be a stockbroker,

811
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,240
she will know the closing prices
of the franc in Geneva

812
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,480
and pound in London,

813
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,760
She has been bred to please
and represents

814
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,120
a flawless combination
of womanly grace and skills,

815
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,080
Of course, I speak
of our extraordinary geishas,

816
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,000
the ones who may marry
cabinet ministers,

817
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,520
They are the ultimate,
we believe, in womankind,

818
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,760
I do not believe all these graces
can be taught in one week,

819
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,640
I respectfully offer,

820
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,480
You couldn't teach me that
in two lifetimes,

821
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,960
Would it be possible for us to see
this geisha that you spoke about?

822
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,280
May I present her? Kazumi lto,

823
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,960
She came to visit me today,
and she was kind enough to offer

824
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,800
to act as my hostess,

825
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,160
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

826
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,480
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

827
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,200
Thank you,

828
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,400
Oh, Mr Kaida,

829
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,360
what's the purpose
of all this work and preparation?

830
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,280
What does this remarkable girl do?

831
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,160
She performs a service
which is peculiarly Japanese,

832
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,680
We conduct our business and social life
only in the teahouse, never in our home,

833
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,880
She entertains for us,

834
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,840
In America, you combine the functions
of childbearing and entertaining

835
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,360
in one woman,

836
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,120
I do not deny it is more efficient,

837
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,200
and it is possibly our way in the future,

838
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,120
But you must pardon an old man,

839
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,520
who has devoted his life
to the art of geisha,

840
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,000
if he feels sad to see disappear

841
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,040
this distillation of all
that is wonderful in womanhood,

842
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,920
Well, could you help Miss Dell
in little things,

843
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,320
just so she'd look like a geisha?

844
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,880
After all,
she only has to fool an American,

845
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
I only know the old arts,

846
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,560
But may I suggest,
perhaps Kazumi could help you?

847
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,560
She would know your needs
better than I,

848
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,240
- Yes,
- Sam, that's a great idea,

849
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,800
Sure, We could live together,

850
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,360
She could stick with me day and night,
watch me like a hawk,

851
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,920
- Oh, sign her, Sam! Sign her!
- Yes, we'll take her,

852
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,680
That is, if it's all right with Kazumi,

853
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,160
Would it please you, Master?

854
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,440
It is only for you to decide,

855
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,760
It would be an honour to see a geisha
truly portrayed on the screen,

856
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,160
I am most happy to be at your disposal,

857
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
Well, thank you, Kazumi,

858
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,120
Excuse me for being rude just now,

859
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
There is no need,
Truly, I was not offended,

860
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,600
Are you always this good-natured?

861
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,080
I mean, in the morning
before coffee, too?

862
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,560
All the time, She is a geisha,

863
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,280
Brother, have I got a lot to learn,

864
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,160
Now, that, I can shoot
in Hollywood studio,

865
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,960
I keep saying real,

866
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,760
We will shoot everything outside,

867
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,760
You understand, Mr George?
Everything outside, clear?

868
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Yes, thank you very much,

869
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,280
- Hi, Sam,
- You heard the music?

870
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah, they did a wonderful job,

871
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,680
It will be absolutely sensational,

872
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,440
I hope so, We're spending money
like it'll be sensational,

873
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,200
- Don't lose your nerve, Sam,
- Oh, no, I've got plenty of nerve,

874
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,320
It's money I'm thinking of,

875
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,160
For you, Mr Robaix, Long distance call
from Phoenix, Arizona,

876
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,360
- One second, Phoenix, Arizona?
- Yes, sir,

877
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,160
Who'd call me from there?

878
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,560
Yes, hello?

879
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,720
Oversea operator,

880
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Yeah?

881
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,880
Phoenix, Arizona
calling Mr Paul Robaix,

882
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,800
Yes, who's calling him?

883
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,640
Mrs Robaix calling,

884
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,080
- One moment please,
- It's Lucy,

885
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,720
- In Arizona?
- Yes,

886
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,160
- Hello?
- Hello, Paul, darling,

887
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,640
Hello, Lucy, How are you?

888
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm fine, I'm just fine, Can you hear me?

889
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,360
Yes, very good,

890
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,320
- What's that?
- I said I hear you very good,

891
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,720
You have to speak louder,

892
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,120
<i>I said, I hear you,,,</i>

893
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,520
Oh, I can hear you very well,

894
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,520
What are you doing in Arizona?

895
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,400
Well, I came down to
the Cooper ranch for a while,

896
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,480
They have lots of horses here,
and it's very quiet,

897
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,520
But they don't have a telephone,
I had to come down to the general store

898
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,400
to call you, as a matter of fact,

899
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,840
How long you staying there?

900
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,680
Oh, I think a few more weeks,

901
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,720
And then I thought I'd try
the Elizabeth Arden health farm,

902
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,600
But they don't take
telephone calls, either,

903
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,680
So I'll always have to call you, okay?

904
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,600
Okay, don't forget me,

905
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,840
I won't, darling,
I think of you all the time,

906
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,360
- How's everything going?
- Oh, fine,

907
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,960
We just received the opera voices
from New York, Fabulous,

908
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,240
- Oh, wonderful,
- What?

909
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,720
Well, I think we're getting
a weak connection now,

910
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,600
<i>- Oh, no,</i>
<i>- Oh, I'm,,, I'll call you again, Paul,</i>

911
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,360
- Lucy, hello?
- I love you,

912
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,080
- Hello, darling, Hello?
- I love you, Bye,

913
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,560
I love you,

914
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,840
Well, that takes care of the telephone,

915
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,880
What an invention, Frustrating,

916
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,000
- Mr Robaix,
- Yeah?

917
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,520
- Nagasaki is right here, see?
- Oh, fine,

918
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,400
- Oh, by the way, Sam,
- Yeah?

919
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,800
Where does Yoko live?

920
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,680
Oh, she moved into the Saami hotel
with a geisha friend of hers,

921
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,520
Get me the Saami hotel,
I want to talk to her,

922
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,320
Oh, no, no, Please, please,
Look, she's not in,

923
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,560
I'm pretty sure she isn't,

924
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,800
- Where is she?
- Well, she said

925
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,960
she was going out shopping,
Really, you can put that down,

926
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,480
No, no, Maybe she's back,

927
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,560
See if she's in,
If she's not, leave my name, will you?

928
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,120
Well, what do you want her for?

929
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,280
The boss tell me there's sumo wrestling
this afternoon,

930
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,680
and I thought we'd take Yoko along
to explain it to us,

931
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,680
Oh, that'll be Sam, He's going to tell me
how Paul was during the phone call,

932
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,880
Yoko?

933
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,920
Hello, Yoko?

934
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,600
Who is calling, please?

935
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,520
It's Mr Robaix, Yoko,

936
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,880
Yes, Mr Robaix, how are you?

937
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,160
How are you along in your English?

938
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,160
Fine, I practising every day,

939
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,320
Good, good,
What are you doing this afternoon?

940
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,480
I practising with my friend,

941
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,320
Well, I'm inviting you and your friend
to the sumo wrestling,

942
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,840
so you can explain it to us, okay?

943
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,480
Hello, Yoko?

944
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,680
All right, All right,

945
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,560
Fine, We'll check later about times,

946
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,320
Sam, you won't be bored this afternoon,

947
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,800
I'm sure I won't,

948
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,960
Well,

949
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,920
it had to be faced sooner or later,

950
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,120
He's never seen me in the daytime
so close before,

951
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,200
When we make up your eyes,
and with your cheekbones,

952
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,680
you are difficult to detect, I assure you,

953
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,920
I would not glance at you a second time,

954
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,200
That boy knows me
a little better than you, Kazumi,

955
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,200
But I think we can get away with it,

956
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,760
I just need all the help I can get,

957
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,800
Now, would you fill me in
on sumo wrestling?

958
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,200
Sumo wrestling is Japan's
most popular sport,

959
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,240
Even ahead of your baseball,

960
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,480
And is performed by Japanese

961
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,120
who are bigger than the most
people believe that Japanese grow,

962
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,280
The small wrestlers are 200 pounds,

963
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,880
and the larger ones are 350,

964
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,480
Do you think we're gonna
miss this whole thing?

965
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,600
<i>Look,,,</i>

966
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,960
Oh, hello, Yoko,

967
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,640
<i>Yoko, I,,, I'm sorry,</i>

968
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,880
- I thought you were someone else,
- Hey, Paul,

969
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,920
<i>Why don't you and Sam go on in,</i>
<i>and I'll be happy to wait for Yoko,,,</i>

970
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,240
- Good afternoon,
- Oh, hello, Yoko,

971
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,920
May I present my friend,
Kazumi lto-san?

972
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?

973
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,440
How do you do?

974
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,360
- How do you do?
- Shall we go in?

975
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,360
Yes, thank you,

976
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,320
Was that real Japanese?

977
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,080
I don't understand it, I only speak it,

978
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,760
Sumo wrestling is over 300 years old,

979
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,480
It is Japan's most popular sport,

980
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,760
How much do those fellows weigh?

981
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,280
The lighter one weigh 200 pound,

982
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,840
The larger, 350 pound,

983
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,880
Hey, Sam, we ought to import
a half a dozen of these guys

984
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,280
for the Los Angeles Rams,
We'd lead the league,

985
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,960
Well, let's finish the picture first,

986
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Why did they stop?
And what are they throwing?

987
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,480
They are throwing salt, It is traditional,

988
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,920
It will be done several times
to appease gods,

989
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,200
<i>- For heaven's sake,</i>
<i>- Hai, like for heaven's sake,</i>

990
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,200
No, Yoko, no, I didn't mean it that way,

991
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,360
<i>We say, "For heaven's sake,,,"</i>

992
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,040
Well, it's sort of complicated,
but it means,

993
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,200
"What do you think of that?"

994
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,960
She's showing off, Tell her to quit it,

995
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,400
In Japanese?

996
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,360
May I introduce one of our champions,
Edo No Yama?

997
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,560
- How do you do?
- Enjoyed your work,

998
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,640
- You see?
- Everything all right?

999
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,160
Fine, Sam, How would you like
to learn an aria in Japanese?

1000
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,800
- Would you like to do it in Italian?
- Oh, no, Just skip it,

1001
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,360
- Why don't we tell Paul who I am, Sam?
- What?

1002
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,640
He ought to be convinced
by now I can play it,

1003
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,120
<i>- What if he discovers it?</i>
<i>- Oh, no, Just,,,</i>

1004
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,320
What's going on here?

1005
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,760
Oh, no, no, nothing, Nothing at all,

1006
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,360
Studying your lines
for the wedding scene?

1007
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,560
<i>Hai, I have memorised already,</i>

1008
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,640
Say, you know,
we ought to do a little rehearsing,

1009
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,160
Kazumi, sit back with Mr Takata,
Would you, please?

1010
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,960
Now, look,
Do you think that's a good idea?

1011
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,320
Paul might want her unrehearsed,

1012
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,600
Paul's the one that told me to do it,

1013
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,080
Thank you very much, Kazumi, honey,

1014
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,760
Well, where should we start?

1015
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,000
Here's to the happy couple?

1016
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,720
<i>Hai, if you like,</i>

1017
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,200
Here's to the happy couple,

1018
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,200
Oh,

1019
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,600
- Thank you,
- You're welcome,

1020
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,680
Yoko, honey, you don't have to light
my cigarettes anymore,

1021
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,280
You're not a geisha now,

1022
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,040
You're my leading lady,

1023
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,000
I like to light your cigarette,

1024
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,360
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Hai.</i>

1025
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,760
- Why?
- I like to please,

1026
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,200
It is my pleasure in life to please,

1027
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,880
Well, yeah, but don't you like to have
people do nice things for you?

1028
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,880
<i>Hai. Yes, sometimes,</i>

1029
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,440
But I have been taught

1030
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,360
it is more pleasure to give
than to receive,

1031
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,280
<i>That is also your teachings, ne?</i>

1032
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,200
Yeah, but we've sort of
forgotten about it, I'm afraid,

1033
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,360
Yoko, I've been married four times,

1034
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,240
What do you think about that?

1035
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,080
You must be very desirable,

1036
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,400
What? Oh, yeah, well,
only in the beginning, Yoko,

1037
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,400
Only in the beginning, yeah,

1038
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,920
Come to think of it, they even
light cigarettes at the beginning,

1039
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,400
<i>But it,,, It wears off,</i>

1040
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,520
<i>I'll bet it wouldn't wear off with a,,,</i>
<i>With a Japanese girl,</i>

1041
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,640
Yoko,

1042
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,440
would you take alimony from a man?

1043
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,880
- Alimony?
- Yeah,

1044
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,520
I do not understand,
What is alimony, please?

1045
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,080
Forget it, I'm sorry I mentioned it,
It's a very dirty word,

1046
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,240
I'll wash my mouth out with soap,

1047
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,880
Yeah, well, let's do the lines now,

1048
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,240
All right, cut,

1049
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,080
- It's okay for you, Shig?
- Wonderful,

1050
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,960
Good, Print that one,

1051
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,800
What's the matter? Didn't you like it?

1052
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,560
There is something peculiar
about this girl,

1053
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,840
What do you mean?

1054
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,240
I've directed many beginners,
and she takes direction too easily,

1055
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,480
Really?

1056
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,040
- There's only one explanation,
- What's that?

1057
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,080
The geisha training,

1058
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,400
She's like a sponge, absorbs everything,

1059
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,920
Yeah, I guess that must be it,

1060
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,120
- Good evening, Mr Robaix,
- Good evening, Any mail?

1061
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,440
Not for you, I hope all went well today,

1062
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,440
It went very well, thank you,

1063
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,640
And now I would like to bake
in one of your famous Japanese baths,

1064
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
I'll bake with him, too,
Separately, if you don't mind,

1065
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,240
Certainly,

1066
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,440
You say that, separately?

1067
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,960
Yeah, that's what I said, Not together,

1068
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,760
I know it's a custom here,
but I'm not that fond of this guy,

1069
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,880
<i>Oh,,,</i>

1070
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,200
What's the matter?
You have separate baths,

1071
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,800
I had one this morning,

1072
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,040
But they're all booked
this time of the evening,

1073
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,160
And you did not reserve one,
Mr Robaix,

1074
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,920
Oh, no!

1075
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,440
Sam?

1076
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,120
Now, my contract says
that I've got to have a hot bath,

1077
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,480
And if it doesn't,
my agent's gonna be in hot water,

1078
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,320
What's wrong?

1079
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,480
Oh, we forgot to reserve private baths,

1080
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,160
and we're not used to
community bathing, you know,

1081
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,080
Oh, we have reserved private baths,
Perhaps you may have ours,

1082
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,960
It is all right,

1083
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,960
Thank you very much, Yoko,
Are you sure you don't mind?

1084
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,280
No matter, We think bathing
together more friendly, anyway,

1085
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,360
- She's got something,
- Maybe she has,

1086
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,400
I'm not saying anything against it,

1087
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,480
<i>but I can't explain, Men and women</i>
<i>all bathing together is something,,,</i>

1088
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,760
- The shame is in your head,
- Yeah,

1089
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,440
<i>Well, you're probably right, but,,,</i>

1090
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,080
Thank you very much, Yoko, Kazumi,
Good night, Sam,

1091
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,240
Are you coming, Sam?

1092
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,560
No, I'm going to have a drink at the bar,

1093
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,400
Okay, see you tomorrow, Good night,
And thank you again, Yoko,

1094
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,640
Good night,

1095
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,960
- See why I love him, Sam?
- 'Cause he takes baths?

1096
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,800
No, because he's not interested
in community bathing,

1097
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,200
You see, that's why
I'd bet my life on Paul,

1098
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,440
Most men would be smirking
about bathing with a lot of strangers,

1099
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,040
- But not Paul,
- You're absolutely right,

1100
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,800
It's all in your head,

1101
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,320
I'm going to take a bath with you,

1102
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,040
You are?

1103
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,640
You didn't think I had the nerve,
did you?

1104
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Cancel my bath,

1105
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,560
We are all bathing together,

1106
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,240
Oh, maybe you shouldn't, Paul,
You know, we're foreigners here,

1107
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,440
All the more reason
to follow local custom,

1108
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,720
- That's right,
- It's common courtesy,

1109
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,920
- Absolutely,
- Anyway, I'm doing a Japanese picture,

1110
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,040
This might give me
a further view into their culture,

1111
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,440
What about you, Sam?

1112
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,560
Well, I had a bath this morning,
I'm against this, Paul,

1113
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,000
- See you girls at the bath,
- In the bath,

1114
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,440
<i>Hai, good night,</i>

1115
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,320
- Sam, get me out of that!
- Well, how?

1116
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,760
- I don't care how,
- Well, he'll never recognise you,

1117
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,240
- He certainly will,
- Well, how will he?

1118
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,480
- I have an appendicitis scar,
- Well, he'll never look,

1119
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,440
- He won't, will he?
- He's a gentleman,

1120
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,040
He's doing this for research,
just like a scientist,

1121
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,560
That's it, Think of him as a doctor,

1122
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,240
How about Dr Bob?

1123
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,600
Well, he'll never recognise
your appendicitis scar, Or will he?

1124
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,080
Oh, we're being very witty today,

1125
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,720
- aren't we Sam?
- Well, I'm just joking,

1126
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,640
Yes, well,
you'd better think of something,

1127
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,600
Maybe I have an idea
which can help you,

1128
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,600
Kazumi, if you can get us out of this,
I'll kiss you,

1129
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,760
I must make some preparation,
Excuse me,

1130
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,760
Thank you so much, Kazumi,

1131
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,760
- What's she going to do?
- I don't know,

1132
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,440
But I sure hope it's something
where I keep my clothes on,

1133
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,840
You already clean?

1134
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,280
- Yes, we washed in our room,
- Yeah,

1135
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,120
- And now we want to soak,
- To soak, yeah,

1136
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,640
Where are the dames?

1137
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,360
<i>You know, the,,,</i>

1138
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,600
Are the young ladies here yet?

1139
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,120
The young girls, Coochy, coochy,
In there?

1140
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,880
Ah, yes, Girls in bath,

1141
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,000
- Wait for you, Go in, please,
- Thank you, Thank you,

1142
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,640
Yeah, I'll say, Oh, brother,

1143
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,080
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,

1144
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,520
<i>After you, mein Kapitn.</i>

1145
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,160
Well,

1146
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,440
here goes nothing,

1147
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,480
Where are we?

1148
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,320
Yankee Stadium,

1149
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,800
Can you see anything?

1150
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,720
I can't see a thing,

1151
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,840
Too late, Missed her,

1152
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,160
Which way is the ocean?

1153
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,320
Here, hold on to me,
I used to be an Eagle Scout,

1154
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,160
Oh, I got it, I got it, Water,
Hot water, Dead ahead,

1155
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,480
Feel it?

1156
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,680
Roger, How deep do you think?

1157
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,080
Well, I don't know,
We're taller than they are,

1158
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,080
Here, let go of my hand, Daddy,
I'm going in,

1159
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,240
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am,

1160
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,640
Well, I said I was sorry, lady,

1161
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,160
Sorry, sir,

1162
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,600
I mean madame, No, I think sir,

1163
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,840
Is that you, Bob?

1164
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,040
Where are those girls? Yoko, Yoko!

1165
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,720
- Yoko?
- Kazumi? Yoko!

1166
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,640
- Yoko?
- Kazumi!

1167
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,280
Yoko,

1168
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,080
I'm sorry, sir or madame, whichever
you are, And let's get out of here, Bob,

1169
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,880
You mean, you've had
enough culture, huh?

1170
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,400
Yeah, enough,

1171
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,720
Boy, I tell you, East is East,
and West is West,

1172
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,960
but it's not going to ever meet
in this bathtub,

1173
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,320
- You finished already?
- Yeah, we weren't very dirty,

1174
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,760
Steaming up that bath was genius,
Kazumi, really,

1175
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,480
It was a solution,

1176
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,560
- Where's Paul?
- He went to bed,

1177
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,120
- What are you playing?
- I'm teaching her gin,

1178
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,160
You're teaching her?

1179
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,480
I didn't say I was beating her,
I said I was teaching her,

1180
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,680
Oh,

1181
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,840
- Where's Yoko?
- She had dinner in her room,

1182
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,640
She went to sleep early,

1183
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,240
<i>Yeah, I'm,,,</i>

1184
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,640
I'm just a little bushed,
I think I'll turn in, too,

1185
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,960
Good night,

1186
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,320
- You playing her for money?
- A yen a point,

1187
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,240
I'll probably be working for you
in the morning,

1188
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,760
I wouldn't be surprised,

1189
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,640
Well, good night, all,

1190
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,480
I better get busy
before you blitz me on the other two,

1191
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,080
Thanks, honey,

1192
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,000
Kazumi?

1193
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,920
No, it's me, Yoko, Bob,

1194
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,080
Do not put on light, please,

1195
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,080
Don't you worry, I'm not going to,

1196
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,880
Yoko, honey, it's all right,

1197
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,760
Nobody's going to bother us,

1198
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,560
<i>- Here,,,</i>
<i>- Please, Mr Moore!</i>

1199
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,920
Yoko, look, This is the first time
I've gotten you alone,

1200
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,960
Mr Lewis is always around, or Kazumi,

1201
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,560
- This is our chance,
- Please, Mr Moore, I'm not that kind,

1202
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,880
<i>Oh, here, Yoko, Let me take,,,</i>

1203
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,120
<i>Yoko, what's the,,,</i>

1204
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,640
<i>You geishas are,,,</i>

1205
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,520
Yoko?

1206
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,240
<i>Yoko, honey, I,,,</i>

1207
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,760
<i>Yoko, let,,,</i>

1208
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,200
Yoko, don't you like me?

1209
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,200
<i>Hai, I like you, Mr Moore,</i>
<i>But this is forbidden,</i>

1210
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,480
- Honey, you can trust me,
- No, Mr Moore,

1211
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,320
- Look, I won't tell,
- Please, Mr Moore!

1212
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,960
- Yoko,
- No, Mr Moore!

1213
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,920
Yoko, look, control yourself, honey,

1214
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,760
Look, relax, You're a grown girl,

1215
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,200
Mr Moore, you're dishonouring me,

1216
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,440
No, no, I'm not, I respect you,

1217
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,000
Mr Moore, if I am dishonoured,
I'll be on your conscience,

1218
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,360
Well, that's all right,

1219
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,800
If I'm dishonoured,
I must commit hara-kiri,

1220
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,080
<i>- What was that?</i>
<i>- Hai, I must, It is my faith,</i>

1221
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,360
<i>- You mean hari-kari with a knife?</i>
<i>- Hai.</i>

1222
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,760
Even now I somewhat dishonoured,

1223
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,960
No, no, no, you're not,

1224
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,040
No, I haven't touched you,
See, I haven't touched you,

1225
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,320
I must go to temple and ask what to do,

1226
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,080
No, you don't have to
ask them anything,

1227
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,760
This was nothing, nothing at all,

1228
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,800
Mr Moore, please go,

1229
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,160
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go, yeah,

1230
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,000
Yoko, honey, now,
you won't do anything foolish, will you?

1231
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,080
I must talk to honourable ancestors,

1232
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,560
Yeah, talk to them, That's a good idea,
Yeah, yeah, fine, Well, good night,

1233
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,160
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm talking to honourable grandfather,

1234
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,080
Oh, very good, Very good,
Talk to him a lot,

1235
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:03,120
Yes, that's an excellent thought,
That'll straighten it out, Yes,

1236
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,880
<i>Well, see you tomorrow and sayonara.</i>

1237
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,880
Paul?

1238
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,760
Paul?

1239
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,720
Paul, wake up, boy,

1240
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,880
- What's the matter?
- I can't sleep,

1241
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,320
Would you believe it?
I haven't been able to close my eyes,

1242
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,040
What do you want me to do,
sing to you?

1243
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,040
Take a pill, you idiot, and let me alone!

1244
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,560
This is your answer to me?
Me, your best friend?

1245
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,240
You're not my best friend, anymore,
Go away, Please, go,

1246
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,720
Oh, brother, how selfish can you get?

1247
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,560
Here I am on the threshold of a decision

1248
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,120
that may mean my last chance
for happiness, and you say go away!

1249
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,400
Very well,

1250
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,560
In a crisis,
a man knows his true friends,

1251
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,760
All right, what is it? Talk, talk,
Unburden yourself,

1252
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,400
You're quite sure
that you feel up to listening?

1253
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,240
Yes, I'm sure, I'm all ears,

1254
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:31,000
Paul, I've been doing some
serious soul searching,

1255
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,680
My qualities of life are shoddy,

1256
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,800
Cheap and shoddy,

1257
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,040
Yes, they are,

1258
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,440
Paul, I've just had a revelation,

1259
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,280
It's come to me

1260
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,920
like a blinding light,

1261
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,800
Really?

1262
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,440
I've been comparing Yoko
to the four dames I married,

1263
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,160
They don't come off so good, Paul,

1264
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,240
Oh, I wouldn't say that,

1265
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,800
Well, I would,

1266
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,480
Paul, there's a difference,
a great, great difference,

1267
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,640
<i>You think that Japanese women</i>
<i>take alimony? Not,,,</i>

1268
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,200
Do you know what they do
when you split with them?

1269
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,880
They jump in volcanoes,

1270
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,640
- You're exaggerating a little,
- Paul, listen,

1271
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,040
Paul, I've just come to a giant decision,

1272
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,640
If Yoko will have me,

1273
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,840
- I'm going to marry her,
- Good,

1274
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,840
Marry her?

1275
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,520
- That's right,
- Are you crazy?

1276
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,760
Paul, I hope I'm not going to see
any prejudice in you,

1277
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,840
That's not it at all,

1278
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,080
You hardly know her,

1279
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,000
I know her better
than I knew half my wives,

1280
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,840
Paul, she is,
she's all those things I said she is,

1281
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,840
She's good, kind, decent,

1282
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,720
Oh, brother, is she decent,

1283
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,680
I can testify to that,

1284
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,640
What more could a man want?

1285
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,640
- Paul?
- Yes?

1286
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,720
You've made up my mind for me,

1287
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,360
Paul, I'm going to marry her,

1288
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,480
<i>- It's settled!</i>
<i>- But, listen,,,</i>

1289
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,880
- It's settled!
- Listen, Bob, Bob!

1290
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,480
Oh, now I can sleep like a baby,

1291
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,360
Shig, I asked you to put the camera low!

1292
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,200
It's clear? Low!

1293
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,440
<i>Put the camera low!</i>
<i>I want this one! Not,,,</i>

1294
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,200
- Mr Robaix?
- What?

1295
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,280
A letter from your wife,

1296
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,440
Thank you,

1297
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,680
Quiet! Quiet!
Let's have a bit more quiet on the set!

1298
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,720
- Quiet,
- No, no, no, You can talk, go ahead,

1299
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,360
Shig, It's low take,

1300
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,200
And keep the camera low
to get the reflection,

1301
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,360
Yes,

1302
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,000
We start here with the dolly
and track slowly,

1303
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,800
Yes, Mr Robaix,

1304
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,800
Hi, Paul,

1305
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,000
Hey, what are you doing here?

1306
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,840
- Well, you know,
- Ah, yes,

1307
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,280
Have you asked her yet?

1308
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,960
No, That's what I want
to talk to you about,

1309
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,680
<i>- You see, Paul,,,</i>
<i>- Shig, I think 20 feet of track, at least,</i>

1310
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,400
<i>- Paul,,,</i>
<i>- Right, niju feet,</i>

1311
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,600
- Yeah,
- Okay,

1312
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,160
I've been thinking, Well,
I thought maybe you could help me,

1313
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,680
You see, I've been reading up
on their marriage customs,

1314
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,280
It seems that the man
doesn't propose himself,

1315
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,200
- He gets a friend to do it for him,
- What?

1316
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,800
Well, you're my best friend, Aren't you?

1317
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,840
A dog is a man's best friend,

1318
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,280
- Do your own proposing,
- Now, listen to me, Paul,

1319
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,160
Enough of this nonsense,

1320
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,240
This picture winds up tomorrow,
and she wants to enter a convent!

1321
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,480
We got to talk her out of that, Oh, Paul,

1322
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,320
You want me to be happy, don't you?

1323
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,800
Hey,

1324
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,000
Are you sure you want to marry her?

1325
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,960
I'm positive, absolutely positive,
Now, Paul, listen,

1326
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,520
Build me up to her,
Tell her how very nice I am,

1327
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,840
Well, lie a little,

1328
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,720
I don't have to lie,

1329
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,560
Oh, Paul, you're wonderful,
just wonderful,

1330
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,720
Thank you very, very much,

1331
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,560
- Shig, you need me?
- Not for half an hour, Mr Robaix,

1332
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,080
Keep the camera low as you track,

1333
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,040
- Go for the reflection,
- Okay,

1334
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,400
<i>- Well,,,</i>
<i>- Paul, tell her about my good qualities,</i>

1335
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,520
Yeah,

1336
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,760
Paul, You better be careful, though,

1337
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,720
- Yeah,
- Yeah,

1338
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,720
Your husband is coming,

1339
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,280
He's a very handsome man,

1340
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,960
I'm entitled to him,
He's married to a very beautiful girl,

1341
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,000
I would not like to be married
to a very handsome man,

1342
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,320
Why not?

1343
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,440
I have a most jealous nature,

1344
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,760
You are fortunate you have not,

1345
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,120
No one's more jealous than I am,
Kazumi, No one,

1346
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,680
Then you hide it well,

1347
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,400
I'm even jealous
that my husband likes Yoko,

1348
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,960
But you are Yoko,

1349
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,240
How's that for being jealous?

1350
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,720
And don't think I'm not gonna run down
that Yoko the first chance I get,

1351
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,960
That dame's getting too cute,

1352
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,880
- I am ready,
- Oh, we're not set up yet,

1353
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,960
I just came in for a chat,

1354
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,760
May I be excused?

1355
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,800
<i>- Sayonara, Kazumi,</i>
<i>- Sayonara.</i>

1356
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,680
Please sit down,

1357
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,000
There is something you wish say to me?

1358
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,480
Well, do you know your lines for today?

1359
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,200
Today, there are no lines,

1360
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,640
Only silent scene before temple,

1361
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,840
- Have I misunderstood?
- No,

1362
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,280
My mistake,

1363
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
Yes?

1364
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,720
You know, my friend Bob
is a very nice person,

1365
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,520
<i>Hai, I find him so,</i>

1366
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,720
He finds you so,

1367
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,120
I am flattered,

1368
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,680
He's rather shy,

1369
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,400
You wouldn't know it, but he is,

1370
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,840
- I am surprised,
- Oh, yes,

1371
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,360
We were discussing you,

1372
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,320
In his opinion and in mine,

1373
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,760
the Western woman is no match
for the Japanese woman,

1374
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,000
You are very kind but, I think, unfair,

1375
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,800
No, no, no, no, The Western woman
can learn a lot from you,

1376
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,600
in the observance of the homely virtues,

1377
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,880
I'm certain there is lot
we can learn from her,

1378
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,400
That's right,

1379
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,000
But not in the art of pleasing men,

1380
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,200
Perhaps,
Our upbringing is to please men,

1381
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,760
That's right,

1382
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,720
Does Mr Bob find me sympathy?

1383
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,760
Oh, yes, Oh,

1384
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,960
Maybe Mr Bob would like
make love to me,

1385
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,920
What?

1386
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,520
I would be happy to please him,

1387
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,600
What do you mean, please him?

1388
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,080
Make love to him,

1389
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,800
It cannot be so different between us,

1390
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,240
I don't think I understand you,

1391
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,080
In what way I can explain more fully?

1392
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,600
Do you let a man make love to you?

1393
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,840
<i>- Hai, if he entitled,</i>
<i>- What do you mean "entitled"?</i>

1394
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,960
Who'd be entitled to make love to you?

1395
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,400
Oh, all nice, sympathy people,

1396
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,960
<i>All,,,</i>

1397
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,320
Are there many people
sympathy with you?

1398
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,480
<i>Hai. Oh, there are very many,</i>

1399
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,080
Let me see,
My patron, who lend me money,

1400
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,280
- His friends,
- His friends?

1401
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,440
<i>Hai.</i>

1402
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,360
But what if you don't like his friends?

1403
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,880
Oh, that very impolite,

1404
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,440
Isn't that carrying courtesy
a little too far?

1405
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,800
As you say, we have the homely virtues,

1406
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,840
That's not exactly what I meant
by virtues,

1407
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,960
I must say, this surprises me,

1408
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,960
<i>I,,, Oh, I hope I have not offended you,</i>

1409
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,840
No, no, No,

1410
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,920
You are sympathy to me,

1411
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,280
<i>- I am?</i>
<i>- Hai.</i>

1412
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,360
Well, thank you, Yoko,
I'm much obliged,

1413
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,200
It is small courtesy,

1414
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,560
- Not in my country,
- No?

1415
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,640
- How strange, How very unfriendly,
- Yes,

1416
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,320
I mean, no,

1417
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,520
It's only in the head, probably,

1418
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,680
Like mixed company bathing,

1419
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:03,360
I'm afraid our cultures
are more different than I thought, Yoko,

1420
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,440
Very much,

1421
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,400
You have worked hard,

1422
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,200
- Now you must relax,
- Yeah,

1423
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,480
Oh, yeah,

1424
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,240
Yes, we've all been working hard,

1425
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,880
And it's been worth it, Yoko,

1426
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,960
I've seen most of the picture,
It's good, Yoko, It is,

1427
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,520
I very happy for you,

1428
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,760
And I am happy for me,

1429
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,080
I needed this picture, I needed it badly,

1430
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,560
- Needed?
- Oh, yeah,

1431
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,880
This use of the word not clear to me,

1432
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,720
I needed it to be successful, Yoko,

1433
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,960
You are most successful,

1434
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,400
- You are director of wife's pictures,
- That was it,

1435
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,160
My wife pictures, Not mine, My wife's,

1436
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,520
You are not pleased
directing wife's pictures?

1437
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,040
Well, I was grateful but not pleased,

1438
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,960
They're not the same,

1439
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,280
There does not seem to me
to be much difference,

1440
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,320
There is a difference,

1441
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,240
You're Japanese, Yoko,
You don't understand,

1442
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,680
I am most anxious to understand,

1443
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,760
Well, nobody said it to my face,

1444
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,880
but I wasn't Mr Robaix,

1445
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,080
I was Mr Lucy Dell,

1446
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,000
That couldn't happen
to a Japanese man,

1447
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,040
He is born a big man to his wife,

1448
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,760
In the Western world,

1449
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,800
a man must be a big man
to his wife, too,

1450
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,200
But often this is difficult,

1451
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,440
I think the Western world is wrong,
and your world is right,

1452
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,800
Yeah,

1453
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,720
You are unhappy your wife successful?

1454
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,280
No, Yoko,

1455
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,240
I'm very proud of her, very much,

1456
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,480
But it only became necessary
that I was successful, too,

1457
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,320
A little for my vanity,
a little for my dignity,

1458
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,320
But mostly so that I could be the man,
so she could be the woman,

1459
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,360
Yeah,

1460
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,160
Say, do you know what you are doing?

1461
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,480
You are being my geisha,

1462
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,520
So this is what you do for
the tired Japanese businessman, huh?

1463
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,720
You make him tell his troubles,

1464
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,680
Why, you geisha are nothing
but just analysts without couches,

1465
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,960
<i>Yoko, sayonara.</i>

1466
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,840
And thank you for the massage,

1467
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,640
What did she say?

1468
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,720
<i>- About what?</i>
<i>- Did you tell her all,,,</i>

1469
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,320
About what?

1470
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,240
- About marrying me,
- Oh, that,

1471
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,840
Bob, we have to give that
a lot more thought,

1472
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,040
<i>There's no time for thought, Paul,</i>
<i>Listen, I,,,</i>

1473
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,640
She's a wonderful person,

1474
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,080
but are you considering
the practical side of marrying her?

1475
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,200
<i>Of course, I,,,</i>

1476
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,840
What would she be like in Beverly Hills?

1477
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,240
It's great, just great,
Everybody would envy me,

1478
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,720
She's been raised differently
from our women,

1479
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,280
Not just going around
lighting everybody's cigarettes,

1480
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,920
What's wrong with that?
I think that's cute,

1481
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,520
<i>- This is the kind of,,,</i>
<i>- To tell you the truth,</i>

1482
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,160
she'd go around doing more than that,

1483
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,520
Mr Robaix! Mr Robaix!

1484
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,360
The laboratory just called,

1485
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,360
There's something the matter
with yesterday's film,

1486
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,720
<i>- Oh, no!</i>
<i>- Could you,,,</i>

1487
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,360
There's a flutter in it,

1488
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,160
- A flutter?
- Wait a minute,

1489
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,600
Do we have to shoot it again?

1490
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,880
Can't tell,
They're waiting for us at the lab,

1491
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,120
Okay, Go ahead, I'm coming,

1492
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,720
Paul, answer me, Did you ask Yoko
to marry me, or didn't you?

1493
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,880
Bob, as much I admire her,
I don't think you ought to marry her,

1494
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,640
Who's asking for your opinion?

1495
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,320
I just asked you to deliver a message,

1496
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,280
a simple message
like a Western Union boy,

1497
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,880
I don't need your permission,
You're not my father, you know,

1498
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,440
You're not going to get into
one of your hasty marriages again,

1499
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,600
I warned you, Paul,

1500
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,840
You don't know anything about this girl,

1501
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,800
<i>- I know enough about,,,</i>
<i>- No, you don't,</i>

1502
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,920
They've been raised
to please everybody,

1503
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,200
<i>Well, I'll,,,</i>

1504
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,800
<i>- Their morality is different,</i>
<i>- Now, Paul, Now,,,</i>

1505
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,480
They are friendly, like puppies,

1506
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

1507
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,280
Well, she's my puppy,

1508
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,240
And I don't want to hear
one more word against her,

1509
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,880
because I'm going to marry her,

1510
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,680
And I'm not going to let you do it, clear?

1511
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,560
Mr Robaix, I think it's likely
you'll find nothing in our contract

1512
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,720
about your giving me permission
whom I can marry,

1513
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,520
<i>This is legal,</i>
<i>You want me to read it to,,,</i>

1514
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,160
Paul! Paul!

1515
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,720
You're only going to see the negative,

1516
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,120
and of course,
all the colours will be reversed,

1517
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,640
Yes, I understand,

1518
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,560
- The colours will be odd,
- Let's go, Come on,

1519
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,840
I can show you the colour print
by tomorrow,

1520
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,760
That's not important,

1521
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,760
It's the flutter that bothers me,

1522
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,080
Aren't these negative colours crazy?

1523
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,800
There it is,

1524
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,960
It's okay, I cut away before that,
No problem,

1525
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,560
We'll get by,

1526
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,720
Is there more?

1527
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,480
Just one shot of Yoko towards the end,

1528
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,800
There it is,

1529
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,080
A redheaded geisha with blue eyes?

1530
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,960
Very strange, Mr Robaix,

1531
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,080
Yes, Very strange,

1532
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,920
- Do you have to shoot it again?
- No,

1533
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,520
- Oh, fine,
- We're lucky,

1534
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,800
Yes, aren't we?

1535
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,720
Well, we better get back,

1536
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,000
Shig, you do the scene,

1537
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,560
It's a silent shot,
I have some thinking to do, you know?

1538
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,080
Okay,

1539
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,280
- Run the last shot again, please,
- Certainly,

1540
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,560
Run the last one again,

1541
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,520
You shouldn't have done it, Lucy,

1542
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,120
I wish you hadn't,

1543
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,160
You're a clever girl, I give you that,

1544
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,440
You're too clever for me,

1545
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,760
Paul,

1546
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,080
There you are,

1547
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,040
Where have you been?
We thought you had an accident,

1548
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,720
No, no,

1549
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,760
No accident,

1550
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,120
- I've been walking,
- You had your dinner?

1551
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,280
- How about a drink?
- No, thanks,

1552
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,640
Oh, Shig tells me we don't need
to retake anything,

1553
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,960
- Is that right?
- That's right,

1554
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,280
Sam,

1555
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,320
I'm curious about something,

1556
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,800
What's that?

1557
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,320
You've been making some plans
about the opening of the picture,

1558
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,720
- What are they?
- We've got the opening set up great,

1559
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,120
The world premiere is gonna be
right here in Japan,

1560
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,360
We're flying in a planeload
of American press,

1561
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,040
<i>Life, Look, Time, Newsweek,</i>
<i>AP, UP, everybody,</i>

1562
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,840
We'll get international coverage,
Not bad, eh?

1563
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,440
Not bad,

1564
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,680
Seems almost too much,

1565
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,560
Are you sure
it merits bringing all that press?

1566
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,440
Certainly it merits it,

1567
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,320
They might be expecting a stunt
of some kind,

1568
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,120
That's what these press boys
usually call for,

1569
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,640
No, no, This is a fine artistic effort,
and the company's going all out,

1570
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,960
- I've got a surprise for you,
- Really? What is it?

1571
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,120
Lucy is flying here for the opening,

1572
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,720
Surprised?

1573
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,120
- Not exactly,
- Why not?

1574
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,720
Lucy would surely come

1575
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,240
to wish me success
on my first picture without her,

1576
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:36,960
Yeah,

1577
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,800
Well, she's flying in just the same,

1578
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,040
I thought you would be happy
to hear that,

1579
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,720
I'm very happy,

1580
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,560
- Well, where have you been?
- Walking,

1581
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,120
Here, now, take it easy, will you?
He's moody,

1582
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,800
Well, he should be,
His conscience is killing him,

1583
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,960
What about?

1584
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,240
I asked him to do me a favour,
just a simple favour,

1585
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,280
Something that means
my entire life's happiness,

1586
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,400
and he won't do it,

1587
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,600
What did you want him to do?

1588
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,080
To ask Yoko to marry me,

1589
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,440
You want him to ask Yoko to marry you?

1590
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,840
I suppose
you've got something against that,

1591
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,680
Oh, no, no, no, I haven't said anything,

1592
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,520
- Well, are you going to or aren't you?
- I'm thinking about it,

1593
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,000
Paul, listen, I haven't got much time,

1594
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,280
Hey,

1595
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,080
Hey, maybe I could ask her myself,

1596
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,520
No, no, He'd do it better, She likes him,
She'd listen to him,

1597
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,600
That man is standing
between Yoko and me,

1598
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,160
You're right,

1599
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,240
I mean, she'd listen to him,

1600
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,960
Who is it?

1601
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,040
It's Paul, Yoko, I want to talk to you,

1602
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,200
I'm not dressed, Mr Robaix,
but I'll be only one minute,

1603
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,640
Sorry, No hurry,

1604
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,960
I should have called first,

1605
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,240
I won't be long,

1606
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,680
Would you like me to come back later?

1607
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,720
No, I am almost ready, Mr Robaix,

1608
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,600
It won't be much longer,

1609
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,480
Please excuse me,

1610
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,000
Very sorry to keep you waiting,

1611
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,240
Perfectly all right,

1612
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,080
Please come in,

1613
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,160
- May I make tea?
- No, thank you,

1614
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,200
Very honoured for this visit,

1615
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,120
Please sit down,

1616
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,400
I couldn't get back to the set,

1617
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,240
<i>- Did the scene go well?</i>
<i>- Hai, very well, Thank you,</i>

1618
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,680
Today no dialogue, simple,

1619
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,280
<i>- Well, tomorrow is the last day, Yoko,</i>
<i>- Hai, I know,</i>

1620
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,200
Have you enjoyed making the picture?

1621
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,080
Very much, Mr Robaix, Very much,

1622
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,840
Oh, call me Paul,

1623
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,240
Paul,

1624
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,920
That's right, that's more friendly, isn't it?

1625
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,080
Yes,

1626
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,680
The scene tomorrow is very important,

1627
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,120
I understand,

1628
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,720
You must project great unhappiness,

1629
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,080
A girl giving up her baby
to her husband's new wife

1630
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,760
and killing herself, is pretty strong,

1631
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,400
And if it isn't done well,
it can be laughed at,

1632
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,160
And it's a very famous scene,
The critics know it,

1633
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,720
I will do my best,

1634
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,600
You see,

1635
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,760
the camera is a large magnifying glass,

1636
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,680
Just as it can enlarge truth,
it can enlarge falsity,

1637
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,360
Can you be sincerely unhappy?

1638
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,520
I will try,

1639
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,840
I wonder how I can help you,

1640
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,080
You have been most helpful,

1641
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,280
Already you have rehearsed me
many times in scene,

1642
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,920
I agree, but rehearsals can accomplish
only so much,

1643
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,120
One must feel it inside,

1644
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,600
I will make every effort,

1645
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,840
I'm sure you will,

1646
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:34,720
Yoko,

1647
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,000
you're a cute kid,

1648
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,040
Thank you very much,

1649
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,760
I am sympathy to you,
and you are sympathy to me,

1650
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,760
Isn't that right?

1651
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,920
Yes,

1652
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,080
In fact,

1653
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,440
I would say we are sympathy
to each other,

1654
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,840
Why don't we celebrate
the end of the picture?

1655
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,840
What's the matter, Yoko?

1656
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,480
Need a little more romance?

1657
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,440
I tell you my philosophy in these things,

1658
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,640
Never chase a woman,

1659
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,120
I say, if they don't meet you halfway,

1660
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,800
let them go,

1661
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,960
<i>Well, sayonara, Yoko,</i>

1662
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,080
You'll never know what you missed,

1663
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,200
See you on the set,

1664
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,440
- Key, please,
- Yes, sir,

1665
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,640
Paul?

1666
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,000
- Oh, 510, please,
- Yes, sir,

1667
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,320
- Were you with Yoko just now?
- Yes,

1668
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,560
- Everything all right?
- Fine,

1669
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,760
- That's an important scene tomorrow,
- Yes, it is,

1670
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,440
- Think she can do it all right?
- I don't see why not,

1671
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,960
Four, please,

1672
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,400
Five,

1673
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:27,560
<i>You've,,, You've done a remarkable job</i>
<i>on that girl, really remarkable,</i>

1674
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,760
- Why, thank you, Sam,
- No, no, I mean it sincerely,

1675
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,840
You know, all that painstaking rehearsal
has certainly paid off,

1676
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,200
The proof is in the performance,

1677
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,920
She's marvellous,

1678
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,040
Well, I really didn't have to
rehearse her that much,

1679
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,520
Fourth floor,

1680
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,600
You see,

1681
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,880
Lucy is a good enough actress
without much help,

1682
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,680
Fifth floor,

1683
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,200
No, no, Fourth floor,
take me down to the fourth floor,

1684
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,680
What took you so long?

1685
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,440
How long have you known?

1686
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,040
Not very long,

1687
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,520
You were too clever for me, both of you,

1688
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,400
Well, we sure sweated it out,

1689
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,040
We were afraid that if you caught on
too early, you'd have quit the picture,

1690
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,920
You were right, I would have,

1691
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,760
Well, we were lucky you didn't,

1692
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,840
Everything has turned out for the best,

1693
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,240
Lucy's happy, New York is happy,
and I know that you're happy, too,

1694
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,400
You know that,

1695
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,440
Now look, Paul,
You may be a little annoyed

1696
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:43,880
because we pulled some sort of
practical joke on you,

1697
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,080
but we did it for your own good,

1698
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,280
You're really obligated to Lucy
for doing this,

1699
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,440
- Obligated?
- Yes,

1700
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,960
You know, I came to Japan

1701
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,600
to tell you that you couldn't make
a first-class picture,

1702
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,440
That it was going to be black and white,
no expensive singers,

1703
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,800
and a budget cheap enough
that would've broken your back,

1704
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:04,080
Now with Lucy, we gave you the tools
to turn out your first-class picture,

1705
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Certainly you're obligated,

1706
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,440
Did it occur to you, either of you,
that I didn't want to be obligated?

1707
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,280
Now, look, Paul, Now,
don't spoil your success with pouting,

1708
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,600
You're too big a man for that,

1709
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,080
That was an unfortunate phrase, Sam,

1710
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,720
I almost was a big man,
I'm afraid I missed my chance,

1711
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,680
Well, if this makes any trouble

1712
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,320
between you and Lucy,
I'll never forgive myself,

1713
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,880
I don't know what else to say, except,

1714
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,440
it's a lesson I thought I knew,

1715
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,280
never interfere
between husband and wife,

1716
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,560
And I don't know
what more you can say,

1717
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,920
Anything I can do?

1718
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,000
Yeah,

1719
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,560
I'd appreciate very much
if you don't tell Lucy I know,

1720
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,600
Not if you say so,

1721
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,280
I'll do the scene tomorrow,

1722
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:03,560
and I would like to play the game
out to the finish,

1723
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,320
just as you planned it,

1724
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,360
You mean, have the premiere
without telling Lucy you know,

1725
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,520
Without telling anyone I know,

1726
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,760
<i>Without telling Life and Look and Time</i>
<i>and Newsweek and all the rest,</i>

1727
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,520
- Look, we don't have to do that now,
- I insist on it,

1728
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,480
She has earned her triumph,
let her have it,

1729
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,320
She's entitled to it,

1730
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,960
What about after the picture?

1731
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,360
I thought you didn't believe in interfering
between a husband and wife,

1732
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,320
Now, Paul,

1733
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:34,120
I've known you and Lucy for a long time,

1734
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:37,200
You know, what you two have together
is something rare,

1735
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,560
Yours isn't just a marriage,
it's a love affair,

1736
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:42,080
You're the envy
of everyone who knows you,

1737
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,240
You're not going to break up
a marriage that perfect,

1738
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,400
That's why it has to break up,

1739
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,760
Because it's been that perfect,
and it isn't anymore,

1740
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,400
I discovered she has a lover,

1741
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,400
- A lover?
- Yes, a lover,

1742
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,160
- Her career,
- Oh, career,

1743
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,800
That's her first love, Sam, ahead of me,

1744
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,160
I come after,

1745
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,280
And, Sam,

1746
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,080
- I won't come after,
- Well, that you can explain to her,

1747
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:13,120
No, you can't explain in a love affair,
Not in a real love affair,

1748
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,400
- Paul, now, please,
- Enough, Sam!

1749
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,520
I want your word
you won't tell Lucy I know,

1750
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,080
Have I got it?

1751
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,000
- You have it,
- Thank you, Good night, Sam,

1752
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,600
Good night,

1753
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,400
- Have you seen Miss Mori?
- Yes, sir,

1754
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,560
Here, Very nice,

1755
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,600
I would like to get it the first take,

1756
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,600
I have an idea it'll be her best, Sam,

1757
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,840
I just left her,
She's in the mood, all right,

1758
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,800
Well, it will help the scene,

1759
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,600
And the only important thing
is a good picture,

1760
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,840
Isn't that right?

1761
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,000
Nothing else really matters,

1762
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:56,760
She is coming,

1763
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,280
Well, I would like to shoot it now,

1764
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,920
You don't need another rehearsal,
do you?

1765
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,480
- No,
- Good, Take your place, please,

1766
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:07,560
All right, everybody,
Come on, come on, come on,

1767
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,680
Cut,

1768
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,760
- It's okay for you?
- Fine,

1769
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,000
That's it, everyone,
Thank you all very much,

1770
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,960
It's over, Lucy, Please, Lucy,

1771
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,240
I'm all right, Sam,

1772
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:29,920
Well, you were carried away,
it happens often, You did it fine,

1773
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,680
It wasn't the scene,

1774
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,960
He wanted to sleep with Yoko,

1775
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,200
It was Pittsburgh after all, Sam,

1776
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,960
Pittsburgh with chopsticks,

1777
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,960
Oh, no, no, no, Please, please, Lucy,

1778
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:50,720
Put him on, please,

1779
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,840
Your call to Japan, Mr Lewis,

1780
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,600
Hello, Sam?

1781
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,720
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you,

1782
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,680
Say, everything is fine from this end,

1783
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,800
The plane leaves tonight
with all the press,

1784
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:04,400
Now, how you gonna do it exactly?
Tell me,

1785
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,240
Well, Lucy's gonna put on
a geisha outfit backstage,

1786
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,360
Yeah,

1787
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:11,320
And then when the audience begins
to call for the star and the director,

1788
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,640
she's going to pull her wig off,

1789
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:16,320
Oh, that's wonderful! Marvellous!
Lt'll be a sensation,

1790
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:17,840
Sam, I compliment you,

1791
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,840
And if I compliment you,
it must be marvellous,

1792
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,000
Well, thanks,

1793
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,320
Sam, I feel great, just great,

1794
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,520
- Well, why shouldn't you feel great?
- Huh?

1795
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,760
Look, and stop spending
so much money on long-distance calls!

1796
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,840
I own as many shares in the company
as you do,

1797
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:37,040
- What's your problem?
- I just got a letter from Yoko,

1798
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,240
I'll read it to you,

1799
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,000
Sam,

1800
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,360
"Dear sir,

1801
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,680
"thank you for your kind offer
of marriage,

1802
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,200
"I'm afraid it's impossible,

1803
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:51,720
<i>"I'll always feel like a sister to you,</i>
<i>Sayonara, Yoko,"</i>

1804
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,200
But at least I've got a Japanese sister,

1805
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,040
I wrote her a 10-page proposal,
Ten pages!

1806
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,400
- I say that Paul ruined it for me,
- Well, that's life,

1807
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,160
Is that the best you can tell me?

1808
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,360
What am I? A philosopher?
I'm a movie producer,

1809
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,200
<i>- Sam, what's,,,</i>
<i>- Oh, come on, come on,</i>

1810
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,640
Let's go and get something to eat,

1811
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,120
Sam, usually when Paul and I
have been separated for a long time,

1812
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,640
we jump at each other,

1813
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,520
I'd like to skip that,

1814
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:43,840
I understand,

1815
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,120
You just mention I have a headache,
I'd like not to be alone with him,

1816
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,280
Okay,

1817
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,760
Come in,

1818
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,560
- Been a long time, lover,
- Too long,

1819
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,480
I couldn't get to the airport,
I was at the lab, checking the reels,

1820
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,120
It's all right,

1821
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,920
- How was your flight?
- Fine,

1822
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,800
- Good,
- She doesn't feel well, Paul,

1823
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,440
- Oh, I feel all right,
- Really?

1824
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,840
The truth of the matter is,
she has a splitting headache,

1825
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,600
- Oh, no,
- Well, I'll be over it by the opening,

1826
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:29,040
I just have to lie down awhile, that's all,

1827
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,640
I'll tell you what we'll do then,
I didn't finish checking all the reels,

1828
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,800
I'll go back to the lab,
You go to the theatre with Sam,

1829
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:39,520
I'm too nervous to sit,
and I'll be walking around the theatre,

1830
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,680
All right, darling,
I'll see you after the picture,

1831
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,440
- I hope you'll feel better,
- Thank you,

1832
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,840
- Good,
- Good luck,

1833
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,360
And keep your fingers crossed,

1834
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,040
- Yes,
- Thank you,

1835
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,320
Well, that was easy,

1836
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,040
Was it?

1837
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,680
- It's Lucy Dell!
- Lucy Dell,

1838
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,000
It's Lucy Dell!

1839
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:53,440
Oh, thank you,

1840
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,960
Is it going well?

1841
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,520
Great,

1842
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:39,320
Oh, never mind, never mind,
I'm going right out,

1843
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,240
You know, Hollywood's a funny town,

1844
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,480
Slapstick comedienne like you
pulling off a stunt like this,

1845
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,840
They just might give you the Oscar,
you know, they might,

1846
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,120
I'll take it,

1847
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,600
Well, I didn't think you'd turn it down,

1848
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,520
Well, I'll nose around,

1849
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,440
Is she changing into the geisha outfit?

1850
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:48,760
What do you intend to do
after she takes off her wig?

1851
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:50,760
Nothing,

1852
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,960
You sure?

1853
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,960
I'll play surprised,

1854
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:00,120
That's what the script calls for,
doesn't it?

1855
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,120
What comes after?

1856
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,960
What usually happens
when two people break up,

1857
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,240
She was wonderful in that scene,

1858
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,520
Yeah,

1859
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,960
You know,
I've gotten used to sitting like this,

1860
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,400
May I offer you a small gift

1861
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:36,680
in tiny repayment for the friendship
and pleasure you've shown me?

1862
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,680
Why, Kazumi,

1863
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,680
how very thoughtful of you,

1864
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,080
Thank you,

1865
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:45,800
Oh!

1866
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:50,040
Oh, it's beautiful, just beautiful!

1867
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,080
It used to belong
to a very famous geisha,

1868
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,960
Really? What's this?

1869
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:56,760
An old proverb,

1870
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,200
What does it say?

1871
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:02,080
"No one before you, my husband,
not even I,"

1872
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:07,320
"No one before you, my husband,

1873
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,360
"not even I,"

1874
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,160
Interesting, is it not?

1875
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,120
A little too interesting, Kazumi,

1876
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:25,640
Why did you pick that proverb?

1877
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,720
I did not pick the proverb,

1878
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,760
It was the fan I selected,

1879
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,920
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Paul!

1880
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,520
Paul! Way to go!

1881
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,480
Go on, Paul, They want you,

1882
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,880
Go on, now, Come on,
Come on, Get up there,

1883
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:31,120
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

1884
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:33,360
for your warm receptions,

1885
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,720
which has moved me
more than I can say,

1886
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,040
I know you must be eager to meet
a remarkable young lady

1887
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,160
who helped tremendously

1888
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:48,400
to make this picture
worthy of your response,

1889
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,520
May I present

1890
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:55,880
Miss Yoko Mori,

1891
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,400
Paul,

1892
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,400
<i>- Now, please, No, please,</i>
<i>- Let me,,, Let me go,</i>

1893
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,880
It's Lucy Dell,

1894
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,880
Where's Yoko Mori?

1895
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,280
Lucy Dell,

1896
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:24,880
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been asked
to make an announcement,

1897
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,600
Miss Yoko Mori, whom you've just seen
as Madame Butterfly,

1898
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:31,200
will not be with us tonight,

1899
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:38,920
She has played
her first and last performance

1900
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,440
and has entered a convent,

1901
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,200
We will see her no more,

1902
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:56,320
But I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing her every happiness,

1903
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,760
And now I know you'll understand
how proud I am

1904
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,640
of the director of this wonderful picture,

1905
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:10,200
Mr Paul Robaix, my husband,

1906
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:38,560
Lucy?

1907
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,200
Yes?

1908
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,280
I love you very much,

1909
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,720
I'm glad, darling,

1910
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:50,200
- Promise me something, dear,
- What is it?

1911
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:55,200
Don't be sympathy to anybody but me,
my geisha,

1912
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,520
You knew?

1913
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,800
I knew,

1914
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,560
It wasn't Pittsburgh,

1915
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,600
Keep bowing, you little ham,
