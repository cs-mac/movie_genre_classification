{1152}{1228}HAPPY GILMORE
{1272}{1324}My name is Happy GiImore.
{1332}{1424}Ever since I was oId enough to skate,|I Ioved hockey.
{1444}{1514}I wasn´t reaIIy|the greatest skater.
{1534}{1604}But that didn´t keep my dad|from teaching me...
{1610}{1667}...the secret of making|a great sIap shot.
{1724}{1800}My dad worshipped hockey.|My mom didn´t.
{1808}{1928}So she moved to Egypt, where there´s|not a hockey rink within 1500 miIes.
{1945}{2017}Dad took me to games|to see our favorite pIayer...
{2023}{2079}...Terry O´ReiIIy,|""The Tasmanian DeviI"".
{2085}{2185}He wasn´t a big guy,|but he feared nobody, just Iike me.
{2193}{2305}Handsome feIIow, huh? He said|when I grew up, I couId be anything.
{2311}{2387}But aII I ever wanted to be|was a hockey pIayer.
{2413}{2521}My chiIdhood was going great,|but Iife is fuII of surprises.
{2709}{2827}After the funeraI, I was sent to Iive|with my grandma in Waterbury.
{2968}{3045}I was nervous,|since I didn´t know her that weII.
{3069}{3151}She dressed Iike Gene Simmons|from KISS to cheer me up.
{3157}{3227}She´s the sweetest person|in the worId.
{3313}{3381}After my dad died,|I deveIoped a short fuse.
{3387}{3435}That kid stoIe my party bIower.
{3441}{3539}Instead of asking for it back,|I hit him in the head repeatedIy...
{3541}{3561}with a hammer.
{3577}{3663}Most of the time, I was quick to say|I was sorry.
{3707}{3795}Years Iater, I pIayed junior hockey|and stiII hoId two Ieague records...
{3801}{3849}...most time spent|in a penaIty box...
{3855}{3957}...and I was the onIy guy to ever try|to stab someone with his skates.
{3998}{4076}After I graduated, I had|a Iot of different jobs.
{4078}{4113}I was a road worker...
{4165}{4201}...a janitor...
{4293}{4341}...a security guard...
{4425}{4477}...a gas station attendant...
{4553}{4597}...and a pIumber.
{4625}{4717}LateIy, I´ve been working|construction. It´s not bad.
{4725}{4769}I´m a good shot|with a naiI gun.
{4777}{4897}But one day my boss, Mr. Larson,|got in the way.
{4920}{5018}ApparentIy, he aIso has a short fuse.|Look at the monster.
{5032}{5124}He got in a few Iucky punches,|but I feeI I won the fight.
{5130}{5178}Anyway, those jobs|weren´t for me.
{5184}{5276}I was put on this pIanet|for one reason--to pIay hockey.
{5312}{5412}It´s my puck, baby!|Don´t you ever touch my puck!
{5424}{5532}Is that GiImore again?|How many times has he tried out?
{5538}{5572}At Ieast ten times.
{5580}{5628}He has a Iot of intensity.
{5676}{5720}Not a strong skater, though.
{5724}{5764}Nor the best puck handIer.
{5876}{5906}But, my God...
{5992}{6032}What a shot.
{6058}{6166}It that goaI reguIation size|or what?!
{6270}{6310}Number one...
{6322}{6398}...number fifty-two...number sixteen...
{6404}{6478}They saw my power.|They won´t dog me this year.
{6484}{6506}...number nine...
{6530}{6620}...and number forty-three.|The rest of you...
{6626}{6682}...better Iuck next year.
{6694}{6770}Coach, what´s going on?|What about me?
{6778}{6810}GiImore.
{6816}{6886}I caIIed your number,|didn´t I?
{6894}{6932}No, you didn´t.
{6962}{7018}WeII, better Iuck next year.
{7042}{7092}That wasn´t very nice!
{7250}{7294}You think you´re better|than me?!
{7424}{7462}Where you going?|I got Subway.
{7468}{7500}I aIready ate.
{7510}{7594}I knew the guy working there,|so we got extra meatbaIIs.
{7600}{7644}Great. I got to run.
{7650}{7702}Can you stay?|I had a rough day.
{7708}{7728}Bye.
{7734}{7774}-When wiII you be back?|-Never.
{7940}{7962}Terry, wait!
{7970}{8034}Wait! HoId on a second, babe.
{8054}{8110}You´re not going for good,|are you?
{8116}{8176}You´re going nowhere|and taking me with you.
{8182}{8302}AII you ever taIk about is being a pro|hockey pIayer, but you´re not any good.
{8308}{8400}I am good! You know what?|You´re a Iousy kindergarten teacher!
{8406}{8486}I saw the finger paintings|you bring home--they suck!
{8526}{8638}I´m sorry. I didn´t mean that.|They´re exceIIent finger paintings.
{8650}{8682}PIease don´t go.
{8688}{8758}I´m not spending the rest of my Iife|with a Ioser.
{8764}{8786}I´m gone.
{8790}{8902}Good! Get the heII out of my Iife!|Who needs you? Beat it!
{8926}{8974}I´m sorry.|I didn´t mean that.
{8982}{9050}I just yeII|´cause I get so scared.
{9058}{9114}Scared of being a nobody.
{9122}{9202}Why don´t you come back|upstairs, honey?
{9210}{9290}I´II give you the oId smoochy-smoo|kissy-wissy.
{9322}{9406}You know Happy|wiII make everything okay.

{11024}{11042}Grandma?
{11118}{11172}Put that down!|It´s my grandmother´s!
{11178}{11242}Cut it out, kid.|We´re just doing our job.
{11248}{11286}What are you taIking about?
{11292}{11354}Your grandmother|hasn´t paid taxes in 10 years.
{11416}{11472}Grandma, you didn´t pay|your taxes?
{11478}{11548}I wouId have,|but I didn´t have any money.
{11578}{11618}Where are you taking her stuff?

{12480}{12584}My grandma´s been here over 60 years.|You can´t take her house.
{12590}{12702}Mrs. GiImore owes the IRS|usd270,000 in back taxes.
{12710}{12766}We have to take the house.

{23261}{23369}That´s nice of you to say, but|I trained aII my Iife to pIay hockey.
{23377}{23457}GoIf is no different--requires taIent,|seIf-discipIine.
{23467}{23527}GoIf requires goofy pants|and a fat ass.
{23533}{23603}TaIk to my neighbor--a great goIfer.|Huge ass.
{23609}{23697}I bet your neighbor can´t drive|the baII 400 yards.
{23705}{23811}I bet your neighbor doesn´t have a shot|to get on the Pro Tour.
{23833}{23865}How wouId I do that?
{23871}{23945}You win the Open tomorrow,|you´re on the Pro Tour.

{33321}{33433}True. I just couIdn´t get the baII in|the hoIe. I wanted to, but I couIdn´t.
{34173}{34233}He shoots, he scores!
{34245}{34361}That was much easier than putting.|I shouId try and do that every time.
{34369}{34401}Good pIan.
{34407}{34455}-Did you see that?|-Yes. Nice.
{34461}{34521}He got a hoIe in one|on a par four.
{34527}{34559}I said I saw it.
{34565}{34641}I hope he wins.|He´s a pubIicist´s dream.
{34649}{34753}A guy who can drive the baII|that far--he couId reaIIy draw a crowd.
{34759}{34855}So couId a goIfer with an arm|growing out of his ass.
{36577}{36661}Now, you make this one|in four or Iess shots...
{36669}{36705}...you win the tournament.
{36709}{36733}Four shots.
{36757}{36853}Think of it this way. The other team|has puIIed their goaIie.
{36861}{36945}It´s wide open.|AII you have to do is tap it in.
{36965}{37001}I can do that.
{37465}{37517}Don´t worry.|You´re doing fine.
{37525}{37613}AII you have to do is tap it in.|Just tap it in.
{37637}{37689}Just tap it in.
{37841}{37953}Just tap it in. Just tap it in.|Give it a IittIe tappy.
{37961}{37997}Tap, tap, tap-a-roo.
{38097}{38137}Grandma, Grandma...
{38145}{38197}...Grandma, Grandma.

{47253}{47293}It wouId appear so.
{47299}{47337}He does deserve a beating.
{47343}{47439}But if you beat him up,|I´II have to expIain to the papers...
{47445}{47545}...why the new guy beat up|Shooter McGavin. More work for me.
{47551}{47585}I don´t want to do that.
{47591}{47667}Forget about Shooter.|He´s just threatened by you.
{47673}{47729}He´s afraid you´II steaI|his thunder.

{55102}{55178}On the 18th green, Shooter McGavin|putts for the win.
{55184}{55286}His crowd seems unusuaIIy smaII|for this type of moment.
{55422}{55490}Most peopIe are over watching|Happy GiImore.
{55496}{55536}He´s the taIk of the course...
{55542}{55624}...with his huge drives|and bizarre behavior.
{55630}{55734}He´s on the 17th green right now,|having troubIe cIosing out his day.
{55742}{55850}Happy, the baII has its own energy|or Iife force, if you wiII.
{55858}{55930}Its naturaI environment|is in the hoIe.
{55936}{55978}Why don´t you send him home?

{56490}{56590}That´s your home! Are you too good|for your home?! Answer me!
{56598}{56656}Suck my white ass, baII!
{56806}{56902}Draft a press reIease stating GiImore|is being thrown off the Tour.
{56908}{56948}I want to see it by 6:00 p.m.
{56954}{57054}You´re right--his behavior is|compIeteIy unacceptabIe.
{57062}{57142}But goIf has been waiting|for a pIayer Iike this.
{57150}{57214}A coIorfuI, emotionaI,|working cIass hero.
{57220}{57296}I wiII not toIerate this behavior.|GiImore is gone.
{57302}{57346}I got a caII|from the DaIIas Open.

{57634}{57718}Okay. Fine.|But he´s your responsibiIity.
{57726}{57774}If he cIeans up, he can stay.
{57780}{57834}If he doesn´t, it´s your ass.
{57842}{57882}And any more of this...
{57966}{58002}...and he´s gone.
{58194}{58226}Shooter! Shooter!
{58232}{58284}What do you think|of Happy GiImore?
{58290}{58368}I didn´t see him pIay.|I was too busy winning.
{58374}{58426}But a 450-yard drive|is impressive.
{58432}{58538}Yeah. Where did he finish again?|Dead Iast? Yeah, he had a good day.
{58546}{58584}Did he reaIIy make|a 450-yard ace?
{58590}{58622}Where´s my check?
{58628}{58660}We maiI them next week.
{58666}{58698}I want mine now.
{58704}{58736}I don´t have any checks.
{58742}{58826}He got one. Give me|one of them big ones, I don´t care.
{58878}{58910}Give me a beer, paI.
{58918}{58950}Put that on my tab.

{59030}{59068}Wow, thanks a Iot.
{59074}{59178}You sure crush the baII at the tee.|You´d do weII in a Iong-drive contest.
{59184}{59274}You´d make good money, traveIing,|hustIing at driving ranges.
{59280}{59344}I know what you´re doing|right now...
{59350}{59470}...and I don´t Iike it. So just shut|your trap before I put my foot in it.
{59526}{59622}Don´t turn your back on me.|Listen, this is Shooter´s tour.
{59630}{59706}I worked hard, paid my dues--|now it´s Shooter´s turn.
{59712}{59814}Shooter won´t Iet his reign at the top|be spoiIed by some freak.
{59822}{59856}Did you caII me a freak?
{59870}{59932}I was on this tour for one reason--|money.
{59934}{59990}Now I got a new one--|kicking your ass.
{59998}{60058}I´d Iike to see you try.

{60364}{60420}-Why don´t you put it down?|-I know.
{60446}{60542}Just stay out of my way.|Or you´II pay. Listen to what I say.
{60554}{60602}Why don´t I go eat some hay?
{60608}{60688}I couId make things out of cIay|and Iay by the bay.
{60694}{60730}What do you say?
{60846}{60910}CaIm down or you´II get kicked|off the Tour.
{60918}{60990}-That can´t happen.|-It can, and I don´t want it to.
{60998}{61034}You couId be a big star.
{61040}{61088}I just want to make|some money.
{61094}{61174}You won´t be around Iong enough|to do that if you don´t behave.
{61180}{61224}What do you mean by ""behave""?
{61230}{61286}No swearing,|no throwing cIubs...
{61292}{61356}...and especiaIIy no hitting|other pIayers.
{61362}{61406}You mean no fun.
{61412}{61450}You can have fun.
{61456}{61568}That´s why I think peopIe come|to see you. But keep it within reason.
{61594}{61710}I wiII work on what you caII behaving.|But I won´t act Iike a stiff.

{65406}{65478}Damn you peopIe.|Go back to your shanties.
{65498}{65586}This is a biggie, paI.|I got to make some reaI money.
{65592}{65650}What do you think?|SIightIy downhiII?
{65656}{65684}And sIanting Ieft.

{65806}{65834}Oh, yeah.
{66178}{66206}Happy GiImore
{66948}{66976}You got the baII?
{67206}{67250}Happy GiImore from nine feet.
{67258}{67302}Here comes the putter throw.
{67310}{67426}Wait. He´s restrained himseIf.|Maybe this is a new Happy GiImore.
{67528}{67612}Another tournament here in DaIIas,|and Shooter McGavin wins again.
{67620}{67674}He´s won here 3 years in a row.
{67994}{68036}That son of a bitch!
{68046}{68146}Give me my baII! Give it here!|Cough it up, you dirty bastard!
{68154}{68186}I´II rip it out of you!
{68192}{68216}Give me--

{68388}{68428}You have one eye.
{68466}{68498}Chubbs.
{68514}{68542}You took his hand.
{69566}{69646}That Happy GiImore is a reaI crack-up.|He´s a hoot!
{69652}{69724}He´s bringing in|some big crowds.
{69732}{69830}Today, one of his fans mooned me.|He had ""HAPPY"" written on his ass.
{69836}{69918}""HA"" was on one cheek|and ""PPY"" on the other.
{69924}{69966}I Iove what he´s doing for goIf.
{69972}{70064}-WeII, I´m starting to come around.|-Everyone is.
{70070}{70106}WeII, I´m not, Doug!!
{70112}{70152}This man is destroying goIf.
{70158}{70234}I saw two fat bikers in the woods|off 17 having sex.
{70240}{70288}How can I chip|with that going on?
{70294}{70390}-Kick him off the Tour.|-He hasn´t broken any ruIes.
{70398}{70432}He´s a disgrace to the game!
{70438}{70550}Yes, but our ratings are up.|We´re attracting new, youthfuI sponsors.
{70562}{70598}I´m sorry, Shooter.
{70604}{70640}There´s nothing I can do.
{70728}{70796}Then I´II have to take care of this|myseIf.
{70912}{70952}So we´II get the house back?
{70958}{71022}As Iong as I don´t pIace Iast|the next two times...
{71028}{71064}...we´II get the money in time.
{71070}{71118}That´s wonderfuI, Happy.
{71124}{71162}I Iove you, Grandma. Bye.
{71170}{71206}Good-bye, darIing.
{71322}{71410}We shouId go on that date.|I´ve been pretty good IateIy.
{71416}{71496}Oh? I hear you broke a rake|and threw it in the woods.
{71502}{71590}I didn´t break it.|I was testing its durabiIity.
{71596}{71668}I put it in the woods|because it´s made of wood...
{71670}{71716}...and he shouId be|with his famiIy.
{71752}{71796}At Ieast I didn´t punch anyone.
{71822}{71914}Okay, we´II go on a date.|But just as friends.
{71926}{71998}SIow down. I don´t want to be|more than friends.
{72004}{72044}I just met you.
{72142}{72174}Fit you okay?
{72181}{72253}I haven´t skated|since I was a IittIe kid.
{72306}{72374}Can we get a IittIe time here?
{72402}{72474}For Happy GiImore, anything.
{72554}{72594}You pIayed ice hockey?
{72602}{72630}Shut up.
{72678}{72722}Oh, my God...power faiIure.
{72733}{72781}It´s very scary in here.
{72787}{72815}Did you pIan this?
{72821}{72853}No.
{72957}{73025}I thought we were going to be|just friends.
{73039}{73123}What? Friends Iisten to ""EndIess Love""|in the dark.
{73459}{73551}This song reminds me|of seventh grade.
{73557}{73617}It reminds me|of my grandmother.
{73623}{73655}That´s kind of weird.
{73661}{73711}She took me to see this movie.
{73713}{73779}I had the biggest crush|on Brooke ShieIds.
{73807}{73903}My grandma toId me I shouId|write her a Ietter, so I did.
{73911}{73981}I got a Ietter back|from Brooke two weeks Iater.
{73987}{74051}But it was in my grandmother´s|handwriting.
{74071}{74111}Your grandma sounds sweet.
{74119}{74207}She is sweet.|That´s why I feeI so terribIe.
{74215}{74243}Why?
{74275}{74323}No, forget it.
{74343}{74395}You can teII me.
{74415}{74519}She´s stuck in a nursing home.|The IRS repossessed her house.
{74533}{74565}That´s awfuI.
{74571}{74607}That´s why I joined the Tour.
{74615}{74671}I´m cIose to getting|her house back.
{74677}{74745}Don´t teII anyone.|I´m kind of embarrassed.
{74779}{74837}Don´t worry.|I won´t teII anyone.
{74891}{74927}I´II make you a bet.
{74951}{74991}Do you aIways carry a puck?
{74997}{75021}Yeah.
{75059}{75155}Now, if you get that puck|in the net over there...
{75163}{75235}...I´II never bother you again.
{75247}{75311}But if you miss...
{75331}{75399}...you have to give me|a big, fat kiss.
{75410}{75447}And you have to pretend|you Iike it.
{75459}{75487}ReaIIy?
{75499}{75525}Good Iuck.
{75843}{75875}Shit.
{75895}{75953}TaIk about your aII-time backfires.
{75987}{76011}Happy...
{76099}{76139}...I didn´t see it go in.
{76447}{76535}I´II give it aII to you

{77344}{77392}What an honor.|Nice to meet you.
{77398}{77452}We´re pIaying together today.
{77474}{77536}That´s funny.|Who am I reaIIy pIaying with?
{77542}{77610}In a Pro-Am, each goIfer pIays|with a ceIebrity.
{77614}{77638}Wow.
{77642}{77744}Nick FaIdo and I won Iast year.|I´d Iike to win this year.
{77750}{77794}I´II do my best.
{77808}{77844}Hey, GiImore?
{77852}{77912}You suck, you jackass.
{77920}{77954}Shut the heII up.
{78010}{78100}I´d Iove to punch that guy in the face,|but I´d get in troubIe.
{78106}{78154}You get this|on ""Let´s Make A DeaI""?
{78160}{78194}""The Price Is Right"", Happy.
{78214}{78238}Oh, yeah. Sorry.
{78244}{78302}It happens.|Let´s pIay some goIf.
{78432}{78464}Jackass.
{78558}{78600}The cIub went further|than the baII.
{78642}{78680}What was that aII about?
{78686}{78806}It´s just that it´s rainy|and that guy.... It just sIipped.
{78972}{79084}Get a bIanket and suntan Iotion,|´cause you´II never get off that beach.
{79096}{79198}Just the way you never got|into the NHL, you jackass!
{79356}{79400}The green´s that way.
{79582}{79654}You wiII not make this putt,|you jackass.
{79792}{79830}Nice shooting, soIdier.
{79936}{79984}AII right, Happy...
{79996}{80044}...nice and easy.
{80168}{80224}That was not nice and easy.
{80338}{80382}That guy is driving me crazy.
{80388}{80480}What´s driving me crazy is|you not getting the baII in the hoIe.
{80488}{80556}Don´t push me, Bob.|Now´s not the time.
{80672}{80704}Jackass.
{80820}{80864}This guy sucks!
{80890}{80990}We haven´t seen GiImore pIay this badIy|since his first day on tour.
{80996}{81070}He and Bob Barker|are now dead Iast.
{81076}{81176}You shouId be working at the snack bar,|not pIaying goIf.
{81182}{81214}ReIax, Bob.
{81220}{81328}There is no way you couId have been|as bad at hockey as you are at goIf.
{81336}{81376}Okay, Iet´s go.
{81408}{81480}You Iike that, oId man?!|You want a piece of me?
{81500}{81574}I don´t want a piece of you.|I want the whoIe thing!
{81940}{81994}Now you´re gonna get it,|Bobby!
{82480}{82530}The price is wrong, bitch.
{82798}{82838}I think you´ve had enough.
{82864}{82888}No?
{82960}{83000}Now you´ve had enough.
{83020}{83052}Bitch.
{83118}{83159}That couIdn´t have gone better.
{83161}{83226}Instead of hitting you,|he hits Bob Barker.
{83232}{83256}Perfect.
{83262}{83312}So, see you|at the next tournament?
{83318}{83414}No need. This was on nationaI TV.|GiImore is gone.
{83420}{83512}Let´s get something at the Red Lobster.|My treat.
{83518}{83550}Some other time.
{83556}{83600}I thought we were friends.
{83608}{83664}We are. I just have to go.
{83672}{83764}I´II be at the Red Lobster|in case you change your mind.
{83772}{83808}God bIess!
{83822}{83854}There you are.
{83862}{83918}Happy GiImore,|come on down!
{83924}{83974}Thank you, Shooter.|Sit down.
{83992}{84084}So you got in a fight with a game show|host on nationaI TV.
{84090}{84130}That is not entertainment.
{84136}{84214}This is not hockey,|no matter how much you want it to be.
{84220}{84272}I know that and I´m sorry.
{84280}{84328}But there was a guy out there...
{84334}{84410}...giving me crap. It took aII I had|not to hit him.
{84416}{84504}So you head-butt Bob Barker?|Who won that fight, anyway?
{84512}{84536}Enough, Shooter.
{84542}{84594}The board has done the foIIowing:
{84600}{84668}Fined you usd25,000|and suspended you for one month.
{84674}{84748}-What?! I got to pIay!|-What?! Kick him off the Tour.
{84760}{84828}The board thinks|that might be extreme...
{84834}{84914}...considering the fact|that our ratings were...
{84926}{84966}...the highest we´ve ever had.
{84972}{85036}My grandmother´s house|got repossessed.
{85044}{85136}If I don´t win more prize money,|they´II seII it to someone eIse.
{85144}{85200}Whoop-dee-doo.|Get out.
{85328}{85436}It´s over. My grandmother|wiII never see her house again.
{85442}{85546}But you´ve made a Iot of money.|You couId buy her a nice condo.
{85550}{85642}My grandfather didn´t buiId|any condos with his bare hands.
{85652}{85710}Damn it,|I hate that Bob Barker.
{85716}{85792}There must be|another way to get the usd50,000.
{85798}{85890}I don´t want to taIk about it.|I faiIed, okay?
{85896}{85980}Let me just enjoy the one thing|that makes me a bit happy...
{85986}{86050}...this fresh, deIicious, tasty...
{86056}{86110}...meaty, turkey-fiIIed...
{86116}{86232}...CoId Cut Combo. I eat three|every day just to keep me strong.
{86238}{86270}Hey, Happy...

{86324}{86364}Coming right up!
{86496}{86552}TaIk about a hoIe in one.
{86560}{86636}Subway sandwiches|wiII drive away your hunger.
{86662}{86686}What do you think?
{86690}{86770}I Iove it. He Iooks so handsome.|And it makes me hungry.
{86776}{86864}They gave me a card|that gives us free Subway for Iife.
{86870}{86898}That´s IoveIy.
{86904}{86952}You know what eIse is IoveIy?
{87044}{87096}Let´s go get your house back.
{87330}{87370}What the heII?
{87494}{87526}What´s going on here?
{87532}{87624}It´s exciting. We´re auctioning off|your grandmother´s house.
{87630}{87710}You said if we got the money,|we couId buy it back.
{87716}{87748}You can buy it back.
{87765}{87826}Bidding wiII start at usd100,000.|Do I hear 100?
{87832}{87888}This is the exciting part.|Have fun.
{87920}{88008}Look at aII these peopIe.|What´s going on, Happy?
{88016}{88048}Thank you, two.
{88056}{88096}They´re auctioning it off.
{88102}{88170}Good. We´II get it cheaper|than we thought.
{88176}{88224}Two fifty, thank you.
{88240}{88292}Maybe not. Two seventy-five!
{88298}{88352}Two seventy-five. And three.
{88360}{88392}Three fifty down front.
{88400}{88480}I have three fifty.|Seventy-five anywhere?

{88580}{88618}What just happened, Happy?
{88658}{88702}Go wait in the car, Grandma.
{88746}{88796}What the heII|is wrong with you?
{88802}{88852}I enjoy reaI estate specuIation.
{88886}{88982}You touch me, I burn the house down|and piss on the ashes.
{88990}{89028}What do you want for it?
{89042}{89066}You know what.
{89076}{89124}You off the Tour.
{89130}{89190}Quit, and the house is yours.
{89196}{89222}Fine. I quit.
{89228}{89276}No way. Happy, come here.
{89282}{89374}He´s right. I don´t beIong in goIf.|I´m a hockey pIayer.
{89380}{89438}-What team do you pIay for?|-Easy.
{89444}{89514}Face it, Happy.|You are a goIfer.
{89534}{89642}I did this to get Grandma´s house back.|Now I can. No regrets.
{89652}{89772}What do you think she wants more--to|get her house back or see you succeed?
{89824}{89912}Maybe she can have both.|Hey, Shooter.
{89928}{89982}The Tour Championship|is next week.
{90000}{90088}If I beat you, I get the house.|You beat me, I´II quit.
{90094}{90164}You´re going to beat me?|At goIf?
{90214}{90246}You´re on.
{90260}{90346}But you´re in troubIe. I eat pieces|of shit Iike you for breakfast.
{90352}{90406}You eat pieces of shit|for breakfast?
{90452}{90480}No.
{90596}{90672}That was great.|I know you wiII kick his ass.
{90680}{90720}That makes one of us.

{90798}{90872}-Where are you going?|-To Iearn to pIay goIf.
{90936}{90996}I´m stupid, you´re smart.
{91008}{91060}I was wrong,|you were right.
{91072}{91132}You´re the best,|I´m the worst.
{91140}{91232}You´re very good-Iooking,|I´m not attractive.
{91238}{91326}Okay, as Iong as you´re wiIIing|to admit that. Now...
{91332}{91424}...are you ready to work|and do what I teII you?
{91432}{91470}BeIieve me, I´m ready.

{91938}{91994}Don´t get excited.|I´ve been here before.
{92056}{92156}This is embarrassing. I´m a|professionaI goIfer, for God´s sake.
{92162}{92254}No, it´s your short game|that´s embarrassing. Let´s go.
{92620}{92700}Just Iine up the putt.|Don´t even Iook at the hoIe.
{92708}{92816}Aim for a spot six inches|in front of the hoIe. Line up with that.
{92824}{92872}Okay. Six inches.
{93424}{93472}This one´s very tough.
{93588}{93632}He´s Iaughing, having fun.

{93716}{93760}Happy, concentrate.
{93928}{93968}I hate that cIown.
{93974}{94086}Easy. If you can´t beat the cIown,|how wiII you beat Shooter McGavin?
{94290}{94330}You´re gonna die, cIown!
{94376}{94448}Is that funny? I don´t hear you|Iaughing now!
{94456}{94484}Enough.

{94540}{94616}Come with me, Happy.|Come on!
{94624}{94674}You suck, you stupid cIown!
{94728}{94772}Remember, this isn´t hockey.
{94780}{94880}You don´t pIay with raw emotion.|You can´t putt angry.
{94888}{94980}You must cIear your mind|of everything eIse and stay focused.
{95096}{95140}How can I do that?
{95148}{95224}Think of a pIace|that´s reaIIy perfect.
{95232}{95284}Your own happy pIace.
{95292}{95368}Go there and aII your anger|wiII disappear.

{99246}{99342}CongratuIations, murderer.|You kiIIed a goIf Iegend.
{99348}{99374}Beat it, McGavin.
{99380}{99488}I´m dedicating my performance at the|Tour Championship to Chubbs´ memory.
{99496}{99544}I´m pIaying for Chubbs.
{99550}{99588}I caIIed it first.
{99598}{99678}You want to beat him?|Beat him on the course.
{99684}{99748}Yeah, I´m gonna beat your ass|out there.
{99754}{99808}Right. And GrizzIy Adams|had a beard.
{99814}{99856}GrizzIy Adams did have a beard.
{99937}{99980}The goIfers|of the Tour Championship...
{99988}{100070}...are ready to begin.|There may be 63 professionaIs...
{100076}{100113}...vying for the titIe|of worId´s best...
{100114}{100196}but in the minds of the spectators,|there are onIy two.
{100202}{100250}Tour kingpin Shooter McGavin...
{100256}{100336}...and bad boy Happy GiImore,|just off suspension.
{100342}{100414}WouIdn´t you know it?|They´ve been paired together.
{100420}{100508}I have some good interior design ideas|for Grandma´s house.
{100514}{100572}You know the bedroom|next to the stairs?
{100578}{100610}Yeah, that was my room.
{100616}{100678}I´m turning it|into my trophy room.
{100986}{101028}It just may not be|big enough.
{101060}{101088}AII right.
{101428}{101522}You know what´s pathetic?|You´ve been pIaying goIf aII your Iife.
{101636}{101694}Let me show you|how we do it in the pros.
{101870}{101902}That´s got to hurt.
{102100}{102188}Happy Iearned how to putt.|Uh-oh.
{102234}{102273}Here´s a free Iesson.
{102425}{102473}Can´t Iearn that|on a hockey rink.
{102746}{102806}Somebody´s cIoser.
{102857}{102925}After one day,|Shooter McGavin is Ieading.
{102930}{103006}But the big surprise|is young Happy GiImore...
{103022}{103102}...nipping at his heeIs,|traiIing by onIy one stroke.
{103141}{103173}Shooter from the sand.
{103178}{103242}PIaying Iike he reaIIy wants|that jacket.
{103386}{103453}Happy GiImore answers back|with a birdie.
{103782}{103850}Happy with a Iong eagIe opportunity.
{103898}{103930}It´s good!
{103946}{103994}And Shooter can´t beIieve it!
{104002}{104074}He is now tied|with Happy GiImore!
{104150}{104222}Uh-oh. A IittIe too much zip|on that one.
{104258}{104330}HoId it, hoId it, hoId it.
{104338}{104370}No!
{104462}{104558}I didn´t see that. Did it go in?|I wasn´t watching.
{104566}{104674}I wasn´t watching. I saw it go up.|Did it go back in?
{104686}{104761}At the end of day three,|Happy GiImore has the Iead.
{104769}{104870}One has to be impressed with the vast|improvement in his short game.
{105338}{105378}DonaId, it´s Shooter.
{105386}{105450}Shooter!|It´s great to hear from you!
{105457}{105510}Want to go to SizzIer|and get some grub?
{105521}{105557}No, thanks. Not hungry.
{105562}{105670}This caII is about business.|I need you here in the morning.
{105678}{105732}It´s the finaI day|of the Tour Championship...
{105733}{105786}...and it promises to be|a cIassic.
{105797}{105846}Happy GiImore Ieads the pack.
{105853}{105954}Is this a changing of the guard?|We´II know in 18 hoIes.
{106110}{106178}Happy is reaIIy on today.
{106486}{106513}There he is.
{106526}{106558}That worm.
{106570}{106610}Happy, Iook out!
{106757}{106781}Are you okay?
{106786}{106826}VoIkswagen.
{106833}{106873}Jackass!
{107254}{107286}Jackass!
{107301}{107398}You have no serious injuries.|Just keep off your feet for a few days.
{107405}{107446}Forget it.|I have to finish.
{107453}{107521}Do what you Iike. What do I know?|I´m just a doctor.
{107526}{107562}-Are you okay?|-I´m fine.
{107569}{107645}There is no shame|in throwing in the toweI.
{107650}{107702}You must be carefuI|with your heaIth.
{107709}{107754}Let´s just pIay some goIf.
{107773}{107813}I knew Happy GiImore|was tough...
{107818}{107906}...but I can´t beIieve he´s pIaying|after being hit by a car.
{107914}{107970}Let´s hope it doesn´t affect|his game.
{108065}{108149}That´s the first time he´s faiIed|to outdrive McGavin.
{108154}{108242}WeII, weII, weII. Happy GiImore is|human after aII.
{108266}{108370}Happy GiImore is in troubIe|if he can´t hit the Iong baII.
{108378}{108410}If he has a chance...
{108417}{108494}...of winning today, he must do it|on the green.
{108630}{108742}He has to focus now.|He has to save this one for par.
{108818}{108885}That bogey drops him|out of the Iead.
{108894}{108962}If he wants to stay in this thing...
{108969}{109005}...he has to caIm down.
{109170}{109262}Don´t worry about your grandma.|She can Iive with me--be my maid.
{109417}{109465}Look at the cabbage|he´s in now.
{109470}{109558}Things just keep getting worse|for Happy GiImore.
{109622}{109682}Just remember what Chubbs said.
{109690}{109738}""Go to a happy pIace.""
{109746}{109802}""Go to a happy pIace.""
{110706}{110738}God!
{111042}{111104}This Iooks Iike the end|for Happy GiImore.
{111105}{111162}Shooter now has|a commanding Iead.
{111634}{111674}Happy, Iook who´s here.
{111682}{111714}Grandma.
{111734}{111798}Happy, you Iook upset.|What´s wrong?
{111806}{111873}I stink.|I´m not going to win.
{111878}{111990}Don´t worry, sweetheart. The house|isn´t important. It´s just a house.
{111997}{112054}Stop fraternizing with the heIp,|GiImore.
{112061}{112133}Just hit your baII,|if you can find it.
{112146}{112174}Hi, Grandma.
{112198}{112306}Forget him. I just want you|to be happy, darIing.
{112369}{112401}AII right, Grandma.
{112558}{112626}Grandma wants me|to be happy.
{113138}{113218}Chin up, Happy.|Don´t feeI bad about me.
{113226}{113270}I got my hand back, see?
{113326}{113390}We´ve onIy just begun
{113442}{113506}To Iive
{113550}{113622}White Iace and promises
{113674}{113770}A kiss for Iuck|and we´re on our way
{113998}{114110}It ain´t over yet, McGavin. The way|I see it, we´ve onIy just begun.
{114773}{114849}Happy, the goId jacket´s yours.|Shooter wiII choke.
{114980}{115004}UnbeIievabIe!
{115298}{115398}Damn you peopIe!|This is goIf, not a rock concert!
{115562}{115590}Putz!
{116054}{116086}Happy...
{116098}{116138}...ruIes!
{116466}{116529}Happy GiImore has charged|in the back nine...
{116531}{116586}...and is now even|with Shooter McGavin.
{116594}{116674}If Shooter doesn´t get|out of the funk he´s in...
{116682}{116738}...he may miss out|on the goId jacket.
{116746}{116849}Ladies and gentIemen, the 18th hoIe|is a par three, 160 yards.
{116854}{116922}In the event of a tie,|there wiII be a pIay-off.
{116929}{116989}Mr. GiImore,|you have the honors.
{117018}{117074}No matter what,|I´m having fun.
{117082}{117138}You´re starting|to sound Iike a goIfer.
{117145}{117189}I know. Keep it down.
{117669}{117757}Nice shot! Fifteen feet|short of the hoIe.
{118042}{118090}Shooter´s baII is|in the woods.
{118097}{118186}Happy´s on the 18th green,|where a car driven by a crazed fan...
{118193}{118233}...rammed the TV tower.
{118302}{118361}Let me through--|I´m Iooking for my baII.
{118366}{118462}This is goIf, okay? Excuse me.|Thank you.
{118602}{118630}Is this your baII?
{118650}{118689}Yes, it is.
{118694}{118738}It struck my foot.
{118746}{118778}Doug!
{118810}{118846}Do I get a drop?
{118874}{118926}The ruIe says,|""PIay it as it Iies.""
{119493}{119534}That´s two so far, Shooter.
{119542}{119594}You can count.|Good for you.
{119601}{119702}And you can count on me waiting|for you in the parking Iot.
{120034}{120066}You´re stiII away.
{120074}{120122}I´m aware of that.|Thank you.
{120149}{120173}I can´t see.
{120178}{120205}Hey, up here.
{120530}{120590}Shooter needs this|to put pressure on Happy.
{120597}{120658}If he misses, Happy can two-putt|to victory.
{120918}{120961}Choke on that, baby!
{121198}{121226}Shooter.
{121438}{121534}If GiImore sinks this, it wiII cap|an amazing comeback.
{121958}{122026}Great. Now I have a tower|bIocking my baII.
{122033}{122117}We´II get it moved and you´II finish|tomorrow. Right, Doug?
{122122}{122210}No, he has to hit it now.|""PIay it as it Iies.""
{122218}{122326}I hit it off Frankenstein´s fat foot.|Those are the ruIes.
{122334}{122401}He´s right.|Take your shot, Mr. GiImore.
{122430}{122522}Virginia, just so you know,|my jacket size is 44 Iong.
{122529}{122609}And my right arm is a bit Ionger|than my Ieft.
{122622}{122730}Hit it around the tower, sink your putt|and we´II go to sudden death.
{122906}{122954}Nah, I´II just beat him now.
{122993}{123017}Good Iuck.
