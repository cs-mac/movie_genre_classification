1
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,394
Dad, dinner's almost ready!

2
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,441
Dad? Oh, my God! Dad?

3
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,249
Dad?

4
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,481
Dad?

5
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,342
New Orleans can be a
tough town to die in.

6
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,449
But when you die and come
back, you call me. Dylan Dog.

7
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,254
Or at least you did.

8
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,386
You see, I used to protect all of them,

9
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,261
all those creatures of the night.

10
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,400
Those sharp-toothed monsters you
thought were only in the movies.

11
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,269
Why? Because they're real.

12
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,340
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

13
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,274
I used to think the same thing.

14
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,468
But go ahead.

15
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,536
Take a closer look at that
bum begging for change.

16
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,282
Take a look at your
neighbour your best friend.

17
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,352
Hell, maybe even your girlfriend.

18
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,218
The undead are out there,
hiding in plain sight.

19
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,487
And in my day, I was the
line between you and them.

20
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,528
I was the peace, the cork in
the bottle, the line in the sand.

21
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,260
But then everything changed.

22
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,272
And I discovered there's
more than one way to die.

23
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,408
Your heart can go on
ticking, but sometimes,

24
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,309
that's just for show.

25
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,455
But flesh-eating monsters
weren't my problem anymore.

26
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,461
I had moved on to a
much safer line of work.

27
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,277
You think you can just ruin
people's lives and get away with it?

28
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,473
You cocked the gun too early.

29
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,343
What?

30
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
Shove a gun in somebody's
face, that's shock enough.

31
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,348
You want to save the
gun-cooking till later.

32
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,294
In case the gun itself doesn't
put enough fear into the guy.

33
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,231
You've already done that.
Now what do you do?

34
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,393
Shake it at me?

35
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,235
See? Hardly effective, right?

36
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,369
But if you save the
gun-cooking until later, boom.

37
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,505
Then you've got escalation.

38
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,315
And that, my friend,
is the name of the game.

39
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,448
All right. So, why are you here?

40
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,519
I'm here to put a bullet in your head.

41
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,485
Not ringing bells.

42
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,461
You're gonna have to help
me with this one, Chief.

43
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,429
Who are you again?

44
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,233
Oh, right. You're the
one with the screamer.

45
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,300
Those pictures are
gonna cost me everything.

46
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,339
The four-bedroom,
five-bath house

47
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,274
with the pool and the tennis court,

48
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,469
and the Mercedes S-Class!

49
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,244
It's never pretty when love dies.

50
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,440
What would you know about it?

51
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,254
You know, I think you missed
something in these photos.

52
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,457
Yeah, you should check this out.

53
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,285
See right here?

54
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,497
What did I miss?

55
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,433
Oh, God!

56
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,298
I think you broke my nose!

57
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,461
Calm down, big baby.

58
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,234
It's not broken.

59
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,435
Now, I know you're upset with me,
but I'm just doing my job.

60
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,376
You were the one
power-thrusting your secretary.

61
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,276
Executive assistant.

62
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,302
Whatever.

63
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,315
You do the crime, pay the fine.

64
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,483
But...

65
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,322
...she cheated on me first.

66
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,457
God.

67
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,418
You don't need revenge.

68
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,453
You need proof.

69
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,331
Audio. Pictures. Video, if possible.

70
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,530
I get 250 a day, plus expenses.

71
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,499
You wouldn't happen to
have a check with you?

72
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,407
Do you take credit cards?

73
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,309
Dylan!

74
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,220
Did that guy just have a gun?

75
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,459
Here.

76
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,360
What is this? You're gonna like it.

77
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,355
It's something for us to
keep up with the competition.

78
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,423
Marcus.

79
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,494
Dylan, listen, there's three key
ingredients to life and business, okay?

80
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,371
I call it Y.E.L. It's yearning,
earning, and learning.

81
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,466
You know, you really gotta stop
watching those infomercials.

82
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,278
Yeah, and you need to evolve, man.

83
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,311
I'm sorry, there's a
revolution going on, Dylan.

84
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,474
It's called "digital," all right?

85
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,346
There are certain parts of the world,

86
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,476
that consider film kind of old.

87
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,249
Sounds like paradise.

88
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,415
Well, I used your credit
card, so I hope you like it.

89
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:43,261
Hey. Have you thought about that
conversation we had a couple weeks ago?

90
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,226
At all?

91
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,266
Dylan, Dylan. Look.

92
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,201
Now I'm not saying
that getting your mail

93
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:57,265
and developing your antiquated
film stock isn't a blast.

94
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,244
But, frankly, I can do more, man.
I want to do more, okay?

95
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,476
I thought this was about
cases of life and death,

96
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,486
not cheating husbands
and insurance fraud.

97
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,447
I want to be your go-to guy, Dylan.

98
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,219
I don't want to be
your go-get guy anymore.

99
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,317
I want to be your partner.

100
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,456
Marcus, I told you.

101
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,492
I can't have a partner.

102
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,265
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,368
No, that's cool, man.

104
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,532
Hey, speaking of cheating husbands...

105
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,407
...the Collins photos.

106
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,091
Yeah.

107
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,438
Is that even anatomically possible?

108
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,342
Yeah, you do not want to know what
I crawled through to get this picture.

109
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,344
Oh, hey, you got a call today.

110
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,481
Lady in the Garden District.
Said she needs to talk to you.

111
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,448
You hear that?

112
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,426
No. What?

113
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,296
That, my friend, is our fees going up.

114
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,432
The New Orleans Garden District,

115
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,332
where the rich go to live in style.

116
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,266
On in this case, die in style.

117
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,397
Nice first impression.

118
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,272
Might be time for a new car, man.

119
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,966
Hey. It's a classic.

120
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,076
And you go before the car goes.

121
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,929
- Understand?
- Yeah, right. Yep.

122
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,479
You know those guys?

123
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,379
In another life.

124
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,413
First thing you learn
about uptown cases?

125
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,418
They always end up downtown.

126
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,393
If I'd have known where
this one was heading,

127
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,260
I would have turned
it down in a heartbeat.

128
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,331
But you know what they
say about hindsight

129
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,329
it'll screw you every time.

130
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,301
Hi. Can I help you?

131
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,461
No. That's what I do.

132
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,307
I'm Dylan.

133
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,377
I'm not really sure how we do this.

134
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,276
I've never met a private investigator.

135
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,478
Well, why don't you just
tell us why we're here?

136
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,380
My father...

137
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,449
Let me guess. Skipped out on the family?

138
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,517
He was murdered.

139
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,363
And he would never do that. So...

140
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,297
So, you're looking at "the family."

141
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,494
Condolences.

142
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,535
So, what do our friends in
blue have to say about it?

143
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,273
They didn't hear a word I said.

144
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,275
They don't believe me.
They don't believe my story.

145
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,337
They're parked outside just
to convince the neighbours

146
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,969
- that they're safe.
- What?

147
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,794
Why do you think we will?

148
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,281
After the funeral, the
priest gave me this.

149
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,229
I don't do that sort of thing anymore.
Sorry for the confusion.

150
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,493
- Marcus?
- What just happened?

151
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,229
My father was killed
by some kind of monster.

152
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,294
Look, miss, in a moment of trauma,
the mind can play tricks.

153
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,398
Don't give me that crap.
I saw it with my own eyes.

154
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,342
It was huge, thick fur, massive claws.

155
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,898
Sorry, but an investigator
isn't the type of help you need.

156
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,379
I knew you were bullshit.

157
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,284
We'll be in touch. Sorry for your loss!
Thank you for your time.

158
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,319
Damn it, Dylan! What the hell, man?

159
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,281
That girl’s in trouble.

160
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,316
No, that girl is trouble.
It's not our problem.

161
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,328
Sure. Her father's dead.
She's traumatized.

162
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,330
She's all alone. She needs our help!

163
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,388
Drop it, Marcus. End of discussion.

164
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,333
Okay, stop, listen. Hold on, all right?
Dylan, listen.

165
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,427
This is the first real
case we've seen in years.

166
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,234
Okay, someone who
actually needs our help.

167
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,467
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

168
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,408
Something different, something better!

169
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,501
Don't you want that?

170
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,375
- No, I don't.
- No, you don't.

171
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,347
Because things in life
don't get better, all right?

172
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,349
They either stay the same,
or they get a lot worse.

173
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,284
Five, 10, 20 years from now,
I want every day to be the same.

174
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,287
That's my plan. See you tomorrow.

175
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,257
Good plan. Good. All right.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

176
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,258
I'll just walk then?

177
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,264
"No pulse? No problem."
What?

178
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,332
That doesn't even make any sense.

179
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,279
Corpus House, the hottest club in town.

180
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,411
A vampire den selling the new
drug absolutely everyone wants.

181
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,446
Keeps you up all night, gives
you the strength of 10 men.

182
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,518
It makes you feel like
you could live forever.

183
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,386
Leave it to vampires to market
their own blood as a thrill ride.

184
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,437
- How much?
- 450.

185
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,398
You've had enough already, Roddy.

186
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,304
I'll let you know when
I had enough, okay?

187
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,456
Roddy!

188
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,384
Roddy!

189
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,395
Shut up!

190
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,368
Yeah!

191
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,508
Vargas.

192
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,503
There was a werewolf murder last night.

193
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,415
An importer named Alfred Ryan. Civilian.

194
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,322
People die, Lorca. Get over it.

195
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,415
This one's different.

196
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,358
Apparently, the wolves at Port
Authority caught wind of something

197
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,259
being brought over from the old country.

198
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,463
The Heart.

199
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,460
Go check it out.

200
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,338
Goddamn breathers.

201
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,346
Hotshot. Party's over.

202
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,477
I'm just getting started.

203
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,429
Yeah!

204
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,304
Someone needs a timeout.

205
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,308
Carry on.

206
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,352
Hey, Dylan.

207
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,481
Hey, man, I wanted to
apologize for earlier.

208
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,354
I shouldn't have said
all that stuff, man.

209
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,361
I mean, it's not my business, and I
feel like I overstepped my boundaries.

210
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,331
So, I'm sorry.

211
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,389
And I'm sure you're right, too.

212
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,301
She was probably just a nut job,
some kind of whack-a-mole.

213
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,428
What was she talking about, anyway?

214
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,408
I mean, it was like something,
some big beast with big fangs and big...

215
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,396
Marcus?

216
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,431
Marcus?

217
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,345
All right. Let's see what we got.

218
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,317
Jesus Christ!

219
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:31,251
Is it me, or does it look like something
took a bite outta this guy?

220
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,260
Sorry.

221
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,433
With all the dead bodies
I'd seen in my day,

222
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,493
you'd think this would've been easier.

223
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,463
But it wasn't.

224
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,466
Marcus was my friend.

225
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,427
I thought I'd left my
past behind, but sometimes,

226
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,329
it has a way of sneaking up and
punching you square into the present.

227
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,428
It was time to get back to work, fast.

228
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,286
Thought you said I was crazy.

229
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,289
What made you change your mind?

230
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,254
My friend was murdered last night.

231
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,262
Oh, I'm sorry. Who would do that?

232
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,460
Not a who. A what. Whatever
killed wasn't human.

233
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,263
Someone was watching your house.

234
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,532
Someone who wanted to
scare me off your case.

235
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,432
So, you're taking the case?

236
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,236
Maybe.

237
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,281
What killed my father?

238
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:07,953
A werewolf.

239
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,218
A werewolf? Like in the movies?

240
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,417
Yes and no.

241
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,485
They're not just in Grandma's
cabin out in the woods.

242
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:21,295
Or only in London. They're here, in
the city, living and working among us.

243
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:27,371
Most have learned to control the
change, to control the beast inside.

244
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,274
But sometimes the beast
gets loose and you get...

245
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,245
Well, this.

246
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,447
What did your father do for a living?

247
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,348
He was an importer.

248
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
I don't know what you're
gonna find in the house.

249
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,478
The police have been all over the place.

250
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,284
Did they check the trees?

251
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,381
The trees?

252
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,415
Werewolves love to use trees.

253
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,290
Most of the earliest European cases

254
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,388
of lycanthropy took place near forests.

255
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,274
Jackpot.

256
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,284
Fascinating.

257
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,311
It's very high-tech.

258
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,258
Undead investigation is old-school.

259
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,294
This is a female werewolf hair,

260
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,390
between her second and third coat
which means she's probably about 18.

261
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,335
That thing was a woman?

262
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,431
That thing was a girl.

263
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,270
What are those?

264
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,298
Hair samples.

265
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,277
The most common way to become a
werewolf is through inheritance.

266
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,477
Like a genetic disorder, it's
passed down from parent to child.

267
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,247
These families, like any Wolf pack,

268
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,460
have identifying colours in their coats.

269
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,489
There are four werewolf
clans in the city.

270
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,300
And they're pretty territorial,
like the mob, so...

271
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,302
...this girl has to be from one of them.

272
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,407
Damn it.

273
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,398
What?

274
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,247
Hey.

275
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,541
What's the problem?

276
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,377
The Cysnos Meatpacking Plant.

277
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,347
Owned and operated by
the Cysnos werewolf clan.

278
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,486
I was hoping I was wrong about
them being mixed up in all of this.

279
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,491
Gabriel and I go way back.

280
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,261
But you know what they
say about werewolf hair.

281
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,267
It doesn't lie.

282
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,265
The thing about Werewolves is
that they don't take too well,

283
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,243
at being accused of murder.

284
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,269
Especially the ones they commit.

285
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,474
Only ten pounds.

286
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,347
You shouldn't be sneaking around.

287
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,326
People might get the wrong idea.

288
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,295
Well, then, it's a good thing
that I'm the only people here.

289
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,394
How's the family, Gabriel?

290
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,337
Excellent. Thank you for asking.

291
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,503
Can you even imagine what it means

292
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,477
for you to walk through
those gates again?

293
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:58,279
After what happened?
They call you a monster hunter now.

294
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,344
You either have to be really
brave or completely crazy,

295
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,480
to come out of retirement.

296
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,286
Don't worry.

297
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,416
I'm still retired.

298
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,421
Just on one case.

299
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,364
A murder.

300
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,366
A human named Alfred Ryan.

301
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,427
Alfred Ryan. Alfred Ryan.

302
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,339
This name should mean something to me?

303
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,365
I don't know. You tell me.

304
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,243
Someone in your clan killed him.

305
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,272
Accuse one of my family
and you accuse me.

306
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,341
You should know that.

307
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,320
Or have you travelled that
far from the man I once knew?

308
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,379
Hey, I stayed away.

309
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,447
It's your world that came knocking.

310
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,458
And now someone close to me is dead.

311
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,383
Again.

312
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,462
Sorry.

313
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,435
Is this Mara?

314
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,266
How old is she? 17? Must be
on her second coat by now.

315
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,237
Watch yourself, boy.

316
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:01,472
Out of respect for our past,
I won't kill you where you stand.

317
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:12,446
You better leave. The others
might not be as understanding.

318
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,335
Cassandra was a beautiful girl.

319
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,504
What happened to her was a tragedy,

320
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,269
but I don't think she
would have wanted this.

321
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,309
And what exactly is "this"?

322
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,405
You, stirring up old
ghosts in her honour.

323
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,408
Cassandra.

324
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,378
I hadn't heard her name
out loud in a long time.

325
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,273
You should've never came back.

326
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,511
You're not welcome here
anymore, little pig.

327
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,438
Wolfgang. Still sore
about our last fight?

328
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,380
My father should've never stuck his
neck out for you with the Truebloods.

329
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,315
He should've let you
roast like I told him to.

330
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,460
You're nothing but a lousy breather.

331
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,288
You hit like a vampire.

332
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,300
You know the last time I tasted human?

333
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,175
They say we ain't allowed no more...

334
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:34,405
But hey,
rules were meant to be broken.

335
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,254
Oh, that's right. You're not
a big fan of silver, are you?

336
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,367
After shooting the breeze with Wolfgang,

337
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,430
I went to check out the address
I'd found in Gabriel’s office.

338
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,273
Ten pounds of meat
wasn't much of an order.

339
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,369
Maybe it was being
delivered to a single person.

340
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,446
Maybe someone in hiding.

341
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,448
And sure enough, I hit pay dirt.

342
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,520
I found the monster that
killed my client's father.

343
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,499
Mara?

344
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,394
The bad news? It was
Mara, Gabriel’s daughter.

345
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,305
That's not a wolf bite.

346
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,491
So, is it over?

347
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,229
Not even close. She was
tortured before she was killed.

348
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,429
Well, that's good. No, not good.

349
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,335
I need to know why.

350
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,499
What are you talking about?
That monster deserved to die.

351
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,307
Lines are being crossed,
the kind that end up starting a war.

352
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,505
Which is why I need to know,
what was your father into?

353
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,243
Now, you listen to me very carefully.
I told you everything.

354
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,341
No, you listen to me.

355
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,309
When I talk about a war,

356
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,344
I don't mean the kind
that you see on the news.

357
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:07,290
It'll be here, in the
streets, and it'll be bloody.

358
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,323
And before long, that blood
will lead right back here to you.

359
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,229
And when it does, no one
will be able to save you.

360
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,222
Not even me.

361
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,338
Fine.

362
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,376
Okay.

363
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,479
I think I better just show you.

364
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,349
My father told me about this book,

365
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,476
just in case anything
ever happened to him.

366
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,447
After the other night, I checked it.

367
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,383
The objects in this book are
worth around two million dollars.

368
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,428
None of it was touched.

369
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,521
Except for this one artefact.

370
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,402
This one I can't find.

371
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,324
And why didn't you
tell anyone about this?

372
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,468
The things in this book
are not meant for customs.

373
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,241
Your father was a smuggler.

374
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,278
You don't understand.

375
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,348
Somebody like you wouldn't understand.

376
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,511
I don't want anybody to know about this.

377
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,415
Not the police, not anybody.

378
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,254
Because that's not the way
I want him to be remembered.

379
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,520
He was my father.

380
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,430
What is it?

381
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,455
Kill the lights.

382
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,362
Come on!

383
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,406
Let's go!

384
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,455
This way!

385
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,230
Come on!

386
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,439
Dylan?

387
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,406
Where's the Heart?

388
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,512
Dylan!

389
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,375
Get in.

390
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,470
What the hell was that?

391
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:46,450
Magnesium flare. Burns with
the same intensity as sunlight.

392
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,282
It won't kill them, but
it gave us an opening.

393
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,311
Not that. The part where
you used me as live bait!

394
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,323
Look, you're alive.

395
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,369
Oh, my God!

396
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,307
Dylan!

397
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,377
Dylan, come on!
Come on, do something! Dylan!

398
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,313
Dylan!

399
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,251
Kill it! Do something!

400
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,386
Hang on.

401
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,488
Bull's eye.

402
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,393
What the hell is going on?

403
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,339
Look around you. Look at them.

404
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,266
You think they're all
like you, but they're not.

405
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,371
Someone on this street is
an impostor. A living dead.

406
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,440
The monsters you read about as a kid,

407
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,441
they're real, and they're here.

408
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,289
Werewolves, vampires,
they're everywhere.

409
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,323
Hiding, surviving.

410
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,456
And the key to their survival is making
sure none of us know they're here.

411
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,297
That's why New Orleans
became their Mecca.

412
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,493
Where else could you hide if
you were a creature of the night?

413
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,371
How do you know all this?

414
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,431
There was a pact among all the undead,

415
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,500
to appoint a single human
as impartial inspector.

416
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,405
An investigator.

417
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,379
Someone they could trust to
protect them from themselves,

418
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,406
when one of their own crossed the line.

419
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,483
There was a time when they
trusted me. I kept their secret.

420
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,489
What happened?

421
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,450
I paid a price.

422
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,319
The bite on Mara looked similar
to the one that killed Marcus.

423
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,422
I just had to be sure.

424
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,331
What are we doing here?

425
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,267
I gotta check something out.

426
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,267
Stay here.

427
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,305
Okay. So, I'll just scream if
a killer vampire comes along.

428
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,405
Yeah, yeah, he's fresh. I told
you, three hours in the bag.

429
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,249
Yeah. I don't know.

430
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,342
Phil, how big is he?

431
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,353
He's about 5'9", 170.

432
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:04,321
Yeah, he's a medium.

433
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,450
I'm sorry, but you needing more larges,

434
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,254
you know, not exactly my problem.

435
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,223
Hey, hey, hey, public
ain't allowed back here.

436
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,497
Shit. it's Dylan.

437
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,491
Phil, Cecil.

438
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:21,335
Dylan. It's really good to see you, bud.

439
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,306
I thought you was retired.

440
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,501
I'm just here to check out a body.

441
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,272
Came in this morning?
Marcus Deckler?

442
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,242
Yeah, not so much.

443
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,347
Okay, yeah, the kid.

444
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,220
You know, I gotta compliment
you, because you, my friend,

445
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,222
have an excellent eye,

446
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,451
because this kid, he really
took good care of himself.

447
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,226
He's soft, like a lady.

448
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,387
I like that.

449
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,457
Was he a vegetarian or something?

450
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,432
Here he is.

451
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,343
The bite's the same.

452
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,450
Hey.

453
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,442
Where's his left arm?

454
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,454
Told you, dude! I knew
this one was coming back.

455
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,259
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

456
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,295
What's he talking
about? Why am I freezing?

457
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,234
Where the hell am I? What's going on?

458
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,339
Do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

459
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,273
The good. The bad.

460
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,345
Okay. The bad news is that you're dead.

461
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,478
Look at him!

462
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,451
You're funny. That's funny.

463
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,386
So, what's the good news then?

464
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:56,389
The good news is that the
condition is manageable.

465
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,430
Wait a minute.

466
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,432
Wait a second.

467
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,434
I'm dreaming.

468
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,243
I'm dreaming. I'm asleep right now.

469
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,372
And you look great! Look at you!

470
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,474
Marcus.

471
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,343
I can like feel you, too.
That's bizarre.

472
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,445
Marcus. No, Marcus. Marcus, stop it.

473
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,388
You look svelte, you look
good, you look clean-out.

474
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,517
Man. I wish you were like this.

475
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,294
Marcus, you're not dreaming.

476
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,260
I think I am.

477
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,390
I think I am.

478
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,394
Oh, no! Oh, no!

479
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,235
What is this? What
is that? What is that?

480
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,300
Mostly your large intestine.

481
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,437
Dylan, we're talking some serious
malpractice shit here, man!

482
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,244
I mean, what are we gonna do about this?
This is gonna get infected!

483
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,545
Well, you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

484
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,376
You're the living dead, Marcus.

485
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,320
The good thing about being the
living dead? No more jogging.

486
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,384
What's up?

487
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,318
How did this happen?

488
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,420
Well, by the looks of it,
you got bitten by a zombie.

489
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,392
Only takes one bad apple
to spoil the whole bunch.

490
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,338
Hey, you know what? Those flesh
eaters, they're not like us.

491
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,308
I mean, they're shredded, they're
ripped, with an attitude to match.

492
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,278
Think Mike Tyson after
you made fun of his lisp,

493
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,473
and that tribal tattoo on his face.

494
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,282
That's the only way we
fit in with them breathers.

495
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,378
We don't eat them, they
don't sever our brain stems.

496
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,480
It's worked out pretty well so far.

497
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,425
Hey, you okay there, pally?

498
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,290
What happened to my arm?
What happened to my...

499
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,303
Marcus!

500
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,409
Marcus was in bad shape,

501
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,440
and I needed to understand
why the undead were on a killing spree.

502
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,476
Luckily, there was Big Al's
Body Shop, where...

503
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,387
Well, you'll see for yourself.

504
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,290
Body shop? What are we doing here?

505
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,224
Seeing an old informant of mine.

506
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,266
Where do you think you're going?
We're closed.

507
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:13,460
Back off. Or you're gonna need
some serious body work yourself.

508
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,367
Thank you.

509
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,439
Whatever you do, don't scream.

510
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,273
Okay.

511
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,404
What the hell is going on here?

512
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,404
This is a body shop.

513
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,302
Zombies come from all over the
Southeast to get replacement parts.

514
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,336
They rot fast.

515
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,354
These people are zombies?

516
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,394
Think of it as recycling.

517
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,274
No, you don't pick
them out of the bayou.

518
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,276
They're as fresh as your mother's...

519
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,379
I gotta call you back.

520
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,313
Holy rotting shit.

521
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,274
Dylan.

522
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,220
Big Al. How's the parts business?

523
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,485
Listen, man, I don't know
how to say this exactly,

524
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:48,432
but the word on the street is that
you went, well, postal a ways back.

525
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,331
So, do I gotta be worried?

526
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,335
Relax, Al.

527
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,232
I'm just here to drop
someone off for work.

528
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,500
Tell your hunchback he's
in the trunk of my car.

529
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,470
Who's your friend, Dylan? She's
got some nice parts on her.

530
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,335
She's a client.

531
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,283
So, I had a little run-in
with the Truebloods tonight.

532
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,145
Oh, yeah? Really?

533
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,353
Not a happy reunion?

534
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,323
Who's running the show these days?

535
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,420
Vargas. He runs the Corpus House now.

536
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,426
The creep who peddles
vampire blood to civilians?

537
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,489
Yeah, well,

538
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,498
I guess the peddling business
is starting to pay off.

539
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,397
He's got himself a corner office now.

540
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,404
I mean, especially since
Trueblood upper management

541
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,244
was sent to greener pastures.

542
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:41,316
If I had to guess, I'd say he's
the one been spreading the word

543
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,377
about you being this venator,

544
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,355
that everyone's been
talking about, capisce?

545
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,349
- There's a venator around?
- Yeah.

546
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,383
What's a venator?

547
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,294
It's Latin, short for monstro venatorum.

548
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,294
Monster hunters.

549
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,296
Religious nut jobs, mostly.

550
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,360
Running around with silver bullets

551
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,394
and wooden stakes and holy water.

552
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,440
Jeez.

553
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,402
We thought them days
was done, but lately...

554
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,346
Lately what?

555
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,449
Few of the dead missing here and there.

556
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,411
Some whispers. Nothing for sure.

557
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,222
Man, you have been out of the loop.

558
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,451
And you wouldn't happen to be profiting

559
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,324
from any of this now, would you, Al?

560
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,487
I'm offended, Dylan.

561
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,459
You know I run a clean operation here.
This ain't no chop shop.

562
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:32,368
Right. Well, you keep
those big ears open, Al.

563
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,330
You near of anything that I need to know,
you be sure to give me a call.

564
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,398
Well, all right, then.

565
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,336
You take it easy, Dylan.
You hear me?

566
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,247
And do yourself a favour.

567
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,544
Stay away from Corpus House.

568
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,381
I got some bad news, Lorca.

569
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,516
Big Al's informant said he
saw one of our Truebloods

570
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,285
running away from where
that bitch wolf died.

571
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:03,426
Do you have any clue of the heat
that you could bring on us?

572
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,269
Of what we have at stake?

573
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,503
We have been waiting hundreds of years.

574
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:11,663
Look at me!

575
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,402
Hundreds, to finally come out of hiding.

576
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,372
To claim our rightful place
at the top of the food chain.

577
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,286
To stop living off of human table scraps

578
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,515
like some roving pack of cockroaches.

579
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,417
No! No more.

580
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,428
The human race is obsolete, y'all.

581
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,334
Now, how do we do this? It's simple.

582
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,371
The Heart of Belial.

583
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:48,378
Which Lorca here has not only
failed to find, but he's...

584
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,250
He has managed to expose us...

585
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,409
...to Dylan.

586
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,486
I don't need to explain to
you what it means to a vampire

587
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,391
to be buried alive, right?

588
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,363
The claustrophobia, the insects,

589
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,491
the worms eating away at your brain.

590
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,301
And yet you can never die.

591
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,236
It wasn't me. I couldn't find it.

592
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,436
Lorca, I want to
believe you. I really do.

593
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,373
So, you know what?

594
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,451
I'm gonna give you a little
bit of time to think it over.

595
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:32,286
Okay. How about 20 years?

596
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,324
Okay?

597
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,481
Okay. Okay.

598
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,521
Vargas.

599
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,295
Vargas! No, Vargas!

600
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,232
Vargas!

601
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,333
No! Please!

602
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,265
No! No!

603
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,301
I'm not sure that I understand.

604
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,476
It's almost like you're saying that
monster hunters are the bad guys,

605
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,348
which really doesn't make any sense,

606
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,479
because since when are
monsters the good guys?

607
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,424
Well, that all depends on who
you think the monsters are.

608
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,497
Where the hell am I? What's that smell?

609
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,298
You.

610
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,389
Oh, man.

611
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:21,335
Oh, my God! What's wrong with my arm?

612
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,340
Dylan, what's wrong with
my arm? What happened?

613
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,333
Relax. It's a loaner.

614
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,376
A loaner?

615
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,311
Yes. They were out of
Caucasian in your size.

616
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,405
Out of... Are you listening
to what you're saying?

617
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,307
My arm is brown!

618
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,385
And I'm not even married.

619
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,288
Marcus.

620
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,458
You are a zombie. Now pay attention.

621
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,360
Floor cleaner is your new deodorant.

622
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,295
Wisk takes the place of soap.

623
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,264
Green cleaner will keep
your eyes from yellowing up,

624
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,425
and bleach is for your teeth.

625
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,529
This is your new beauty regimen,

626
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,396
and you can never take a day off.

627
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,504
You're a funny guy. You're a funny guy.

628
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,373
I've been telling you for
years you had it in you.

629
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,473
You're just always so
serious. I'm starving.

630
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,279
Marcus, no, you cannot eat that!

631
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,342
Marcus, I'm trying to help you.

632
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,513
I already started,
and they are delicious.

633
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,415
So, I already know you're lying.

634
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,416
I'm like loving this.

635
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,355
Oh, God.

636
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,510
Marcus, this is the zombie buffet.

637
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,344
I'm fine. I'm fine.

638
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,286
Can you just drive
me to, like, a clinic?

639
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:51,256
And get me like a B-12 shot,
or something to that effect?

640
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,353
Might make me feel...
We don't have time for this.

641
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,490
You want me to show
you your stomach again?

642
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:00,231
You're a zombie now. You either
eat this or live human flesh.

643
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,338
You know that hungry
feeling in your stomach?

644
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:06,241
It's only gonna grow worse if you
don't eat. Then you rot and die.

645
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,280
I think I'm gonna be sick.

646
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,390
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

647
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,395
I'm not gonna eat that.

648
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,459
And we're gonna forget
that you suggested it,

649
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,297
'cause it's disgusting.

650
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,276
Ghouls.

651
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,437
Oh, my God.

652
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,271
Ghouls? And these ghouls would be?

653
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,280
Can we crack a window, please?

654
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:52,321
Funny. Dead guy joke.
Everyone's a comedian. Jesus.

655
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,381
It's just that it smells so bad.

656
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,324
Maybe it's you. Maybe you
smell. Ever think about that?

657
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,321
Ghouls are humans
addicted to vampire blood.

658
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,433
Gives them incredible
strength and perpetual youth.

659
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:09,361
Like vampires. Just, I've never
seen it this popular before.

660
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,366
You're just making this shit
up as you go, aren't you?

661
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,267
Take her back to the office.
It's not safe here.

662
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,345
Well, what about you?

663
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,438
I'll be fine.

664
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,252
If I'm not back in an hour,
call in a bomb scare.

665
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,293
There was only one way to get into
Corpus House if you weren't a vampire.

666
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,297
And that was as ghoul
addicted to their blood.

667
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,490
Luckily, I knew the game.

668
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,424
All I needed was proof.

669
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:39,496
Welcome to Corpus House.

670
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:11,332
My only lead was a teenage vamp
who disappeared at Mara's place.

671
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,270
My options were running out,
or always running away.

672
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,363
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Maybe you can help me out.

673
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:21,276
He's a Trueblood.
About 5'7", early-20s-looking, thin.

674
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:26,508
Kind of looks like one of
those shaved cats? You know?

675
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,347
Thanks a lot. You're a help.

676
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,284
You're requested upstairs.

677
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,490
And what if I don't wanna go?

678
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,288
Then we get to play
squash with your balls.

679
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,396
And here I thought I wasn't
gonna get lucky tonight.

680
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,424
You know what I'm talking about.

681
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,265
I saw you down there with that little...

682
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,363
Hey... Lookie here, hey!
What's up, Dylan?

683
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,432
Welcome to Corpus House.
I'm sorry, welcome back.

684
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,472
Have a seat. Take a load off.
Can I get you a drink, a shot?

685
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,512
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that.
Don't do that. Don't be rude.

686
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,413
Now, I know you and this building
have a lot of history here,

687
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,355
but I assure you, I don't
want no kind of trouble.

688
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,281
Really?

689
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,294
Then what's this I
hear about you spreading

690
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,488
stories about me being a monster hunter?

691
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,300
Are you kidding? After what you did?

692
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,271
Oh, man. My only regret is that...

693
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,398
And I told them. I wanted
to get you a fruit basket.

694
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,400
I mean, for real,
if you hadn't killed off

695
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,468
all those elders from back in the day,

696
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,469
I'd be paying dues for
like another century

697
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,312
before getting the chance
to run things around here.

698
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,328
And now look at me.

699
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,401
I'm king of the world!

700
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,234
So, thanks, pal.

701
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,301
Pal.

702
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,498
If we're such good friends,

703
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,510
then why don't you tell me why
one of your boys killed a werewolf

704
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,512
and why a few more tried
to kill a client of mine?

705
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,306
I'm sorry to hear that.

706
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,247
But, no, that's not one of my boys.

707
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,480
Well, then I guess you won't
mind if I have a look around,

708
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,491
you know, for old times' sake.

709
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,355
I mean, I don't know of any club
owner that would agree to that.

710
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,297
I wasn't asking permission.

711
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,501
Take a look around you, Jack.

712
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,344
Things have changed.
We don't need you anymore.

713
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,299
So, take some friendly advice from me

714
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,479
and go back to spying on your Motel Sixes,
or whatever it is that you do...

715
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,322
...and let me advance the race.

716
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,415
You're in on this, Vargas.

717
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,523
And when I can prove it,
you'll be seeing me again.

718
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,389
But next time, I won't be so polite.

719
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,396
Like I always say, the secret
to good detecting? Get lucky.

720
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,340
What's your problem?

721
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,313
I'd be careful if I were you.
These are wood-tipped bullets.

722
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:16,213
"Theodore Cuff, 114 Avenue C."

723
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,255
What's your Trueblood name, Theodore?

724
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,457
Slake.

725
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,351
Tell me about Mara Cysnos.

726
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,388
I'm not telling you anything.

727
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,426
How long ago were you bitten, Teddy?

728
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,293
You don't look like you've
been eternal more than 10 years.

729
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,236
It'd be a real shame to die so soon.

730
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,240
Bite me.

731
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,434
Why did you kill Mara?

732
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,470
And why were the Truebloods after her?

733
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:48,343
If you kill me, you'll never find it.

734
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,354
I'm the only one who knows where it is.

735
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,392
Is this what you're
talking about? What is this?

736
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,233
Not very cool, Teddy. Not very cool.

737
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,472
Put him down.

738
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,387
What the hell are you?

739
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,309
See? That's just what this case needed.

740
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,378
A seven-foot tall,
flesh-eating zombie.

741
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,281
Which begs the question, are there
any actual people left in New Orleans?

742
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,294
So, you really don't know what happened

743
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,319
between Dylan and those vampires?

744
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,355
No, you know, he doesn't
really talk about it that much.

745
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,358
I think it may have something to
do with his fiancée a few years ago.

746
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,395
She left him?

747
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,270
No, not exactly. She's...

748
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,413
Yikes. You look like crap.

749
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,281
Thanks, Mary Kay.

750
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,414
We've got a lead. Leave in 30 minutes.

751
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,519
Wait, what? Not you.

752
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,412
I just about died tonight. I need
to know you're somewhere safe.

753
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,353
Well, what about me?
Why do I have to go?

754
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,255
Because you're already dead.

755
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:38,419
I'm already dead.

756
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,231
Oh, my God! What have you done?
I look like a dead hooker!

757
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,499
It was a shame Slake turned
out to be a dead-end. Literally.

758
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,440
But at least his driver's license

759
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,341
led me straight to his crummy apartment.

760
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,277
I was hoping we'd find the
cross, or at least a clue.

761
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,304
Yeah, you should trash the place.
That's good.

762
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,316
'Cause, you know, Slake won't mind.

763
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,320
Oh, man.

764
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,494
I didn't know Apple made coffins.

765
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,439
Hey, I thought vampires
didn't show up on film.

766
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,313
No, it's mirrors they've got no reflection in.
They photograph just fine.

767
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,441
Let me see.

768
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,457
It's Mara, the dead werewolf.

769
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,293
She was dating a vampire.

770
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,383
That's a new one.

771
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,297
We've gotta go to a funeral.

772
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,533
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

773
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,210
Maybe I'm just sick.
Maybe I'm just really sick!

774
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,537
Did you ever think about that, Dylan?

775
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,313
'Cause I'm pretty sure my
HMO is not gonna cover this.

776
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,442
You need to fix this, all right?

777
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:12,319
I'm pretty sure my insurance policy
isn't a zombie plan, all right?

778
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,378
You need to fix this!

779
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,422
You shot me!

780
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,431
Oh, my God, Dylan, why
would you do that? I'm hit!

781
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,363
I'm hit.

782
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,469
This doesn't hurt.

783
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,281
Marcus? You are dead.

784
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,283
Now, you can pity yourself and
die a slow, miserable death.

785
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,411
Or you can define
yourself as you want to.

786
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,252
But I can't make that decision for you.

787
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,320
Well, you didn't have to shoot me.

788
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,313
Seeing Gabriel at his daughter's
funeral was hard enough.

789
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:13,407
But accusing her and her
vampire boyfriend of murder,

790
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,543
might have been what
some call "bad" manners.

791
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,485
I knew Gabriel would shoot
me straight, or kill me.

792
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,486
Maybe both.

793
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:32,461
They say if you live long enough,
you live to see everything.

794
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:38,371
This is one sight I
wished they had spared me.

795
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,371
I'm sorry about Mara, Gabriel.

796
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,406
I truly am.

797
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,377
But I need answers.

798
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:54,414
That vampire boy came to me,
pleading for his life.

799
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:59,326
Told me everything about
his relationship with Mara.

800
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,287
Everything.

801
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,324
He didn't kill my daughter.

802
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,300
Gabriel, we've known
each other a long time.

803
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,312
What is it that you're hiding from me?

804
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,507
What does it have to do with this?

805
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,343
I didn't know they would do that.

806
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,288
The idealism of youth, I suppose.

807
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:31,420
Thinking they could bring peace to
centuries of war by stealing a trinket.

808
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,493
They didn't know it would
awaken a sleeping beast.

809
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,326
So much bloodshed. And for what?

810
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,396
Wait, what beast are you...

811
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,304
It's our matter to deal with, not yours.

812
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,374
It's too late. I'm in it now.

813
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,473
When I get to the bottom of this,
someone is gonna pay.

814
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,478
I hope that it won't be you.

815
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,412
Gabriel was a dead-end.

816
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,457
Or maybe he was just trying to
protect me from his daughter's fate.

817
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,391
What the hell are you doing?

818
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,506
I was just...

819
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,444
She's very beautiful.

820
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,372
She was.

821
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,340
What happened?

822
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,419
I mean, you don't need to tell me.

823
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,217
I just thought you might want to.

824
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,266
When I came home that night,
I could sense that something was wrong.

825
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:50,431
The apartment just felt colder.

826
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,274
I headed straight to Corpus House.

827
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,303
I knew. I just knew it was them.

828
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,310
And when I saw her
lying there on the floor,

829
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,355
I lost it.

830
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,420
Nothing was gonna stop me
until I made them all pay.

831
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,295
And they did.

832
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,332
All of them.

833
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,253
They took something
precious from both of us.

834
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,466
I can't.

835
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:09,241
Three deluxe cheeseburgers
with extra cheese and bacon

836
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,421
and jalapenos and mushrooms and onions.

837
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,482
Some cheesy fries...

838
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,392
...some deep-fried cheesy strings...

839
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,419
...and Diet Coke.

840
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,431
Right.

841
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,263
I got you.

842
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:28,270
Hey, Tommy! Let me get a number nine!

843
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:30,464
What's a number nine?

844
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,270
Exactly, dude.

845
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,432
Exactly.

846
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,275
Number nine. It's up.

847
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,313
What the hell is this?
This is not what I ordered.

848
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,420
A worm-meal and a larva patty.

849
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:50,449
A warm cup of motor oil.
And a complimentary hot dog.

850
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,354
Why is there a hot dog?

851
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,266
Not hot dogs! Not hot dogs!

852
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,232
That's so disgusting!

853
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,501
Do you have any idea how many
hot dogs I ate as a child?

854
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,502
You know what? I'm not gonna do it.

855
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,340
I'm not gonna do it!
Forget it! Forget it!

856
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,379
Why don't you just take your cataracts

857
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:16,249
and your weird face pustule
and your bleeding gums

858
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:20,313
and your ass breath, and
you go die with some dignity,

859
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,359
like I intend to do.

860
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,420
Good day, sir.

861
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,295
You shouldn't treat them like that.

862
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,399
He's a person, too, you know.
You know what?

863
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,459
Sweetheart, I don't think you understand

864
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,231
what you're talking about, okay?

865
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,395
Yeah. I think I do.

866
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,329
Here.

867
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,476
Oh, no. Is this some kind
of, like, religious thing?

868
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,478
Just read it.

869
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,512
Is this a zombie support group?

870
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:53,484
And you should totally come by.

871
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,322
It's just a bunch of us
getting together and talking.

872
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,395
Trust me. It helps.

873
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:12,365
I needed answers from an old friend.
A really old friend.

874
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:16,535
Borelli was bat-shit crazy, but let's
see you when you're 800 years old.

875
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,352
I always like you, Dylan.

876
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,382
Yeah, yeah.

877
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,458
Life is wasted on the mortal.

878
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,362
And other women?

879
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,465
You never change, do you?

880
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,306
Dylan, look at me.

881
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,437
Centuries on this earth, and still

882
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,505
I cannot find a wife to live past 98.

883
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,350
Handsome young man. You'll find another.

884
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,447
Yeah, well, not like Cassandra.

885
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,323
How very true.

886
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,400
This really takes me back.

887
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:21,343
Dante.

888
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:28,316
I tell you something,
that man could drink.

889
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,353
So, what do I owe the honour?

890
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,287
What do you know about this?

891
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,454
It's nothing. Old ghost story.

892
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,493
Borelli, I need to know.

893
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,466
People are dying because of this.

894
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:56,378
What is it?

895
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:04,378
You tell no one that
I told you this, okay?

896
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,431
It is called the Heart of Belial.

897
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,434
And it's been missing for centuries.

898
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:35,316
Five thousand years ago,
Belial walked the earth.

899
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,420
It was the most powerful of the dead.

900
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,485
He brought darkness and
death upon the whole world.

901
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:46,452
It is called the Heart of Belial,

902
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:51,432
because inside the Heart
is the blood of Belial.

903
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:57,235
Belial cannot be
destroyed, only contained.

904
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,309
The myth says that on the
night of the full moon,

905
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,447
Belial can be created again.

906
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:11,352
All the creator needs
is the Heart and a host.

907
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,413
A host?

908
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,323
A body, one of the undead.

909
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,487
The Heart of Belial injects
the blood into the host.

910
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:25,467
Once that happens, the host is doomed.

911
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,497
Belial lives again,

912
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,337
answerable only to his creator.

913
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,238
What the creator hates, Belial hates.

914
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,303
What the creator seeks to
destroy, Belial destroys.

915
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,315
But, in order to destroy Belial,

916
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:43,250
you must first kill his master.

917
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:48,289
It's a, how do you say,
symbiotic relationship.

918
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:53,217
Their souls are
inseparably bonded together.

919
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,251
Great.

920
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:58,324
Dylan, 400 years ago,
the Heart was stolen.

921
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:08,376
This symbol is the crest of the
last great monstro venatorum.

922
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:13,371
They found the Heart and planned to
use it to wipe out all the undead.

923
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:19,386
But the hunters themselves were
massacred before they could use it.

924
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,224
The legend says a werewolf family

925
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,356
was entrusted to hide the
Heart over the centuries,

926
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,490
and to keep its secret.

927
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,268
Gabriel.

928
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,533
I called, to rendezvous at Cysnos Plant.

929
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,509
I was hoping Gabriel
would stay clear of this.

930
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,341
But my gut knew this
wasn't gonna end well.

931
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,405
What the hell happened?
What's wrong? Is it bad?

932
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,415
It's worse.

933
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,327
Search for others. Hurry.

934
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,230
Gabriel.

935
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,492
There is not much time.

936
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:13,304
Please, tell them that
Slake told me the Heart...

937
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,400
Dylan, there's nobody.

938
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,276
...Sclavi.

939
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,311
You must find Sclavi.

940
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,428
What did that to him?

941
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,362
Same thing that killed you and Mara.

942
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,231
Wait. The zombie? The big zombie?

943
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,264
Sclavi.

944
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,334
I gotta check something out.

945
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,532
Call Wolfgang. Make sure you're
not around when he gets here.

946
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:46,062
Yeah.

947
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,317
Hi. I don't really know what to say.

948
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,478
I guess I'm Marcus.

949
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,389
And I'm...

950
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,384
I'm dead.

951
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,419
Hi, Marcus.

952
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,452
Hey, everybody.

953
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:12,433
So, yeah. So, it's
been a rough adjustment.

954
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:18,371
You know, the smell, the diet,
the whole...

955
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,444
...things-falling-off-of-you thing.

956
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,472
Yeah, this guy knows
what I'm talking about.

957
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,448
- You get used to it.
- No, I won't.

958
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,352
But right now I have a big problem.

959
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,378
Okay? I'm looking for a zombie.

960
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,390
I'm looking for a massive zombie.

961
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,256
And he's bigger and
stronger than anything...

962
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,320
...I've ever seen.
And he's a killer.

963
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,256
We thought those were just rumours.

964
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:49,404
They say he lives in the abandoned
power building outside of town.

965
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,238
In the forbidden ward.

966
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:56,477
Marcus, you have to be careful.

967
01:06:56,479 --> 01:07:00,415
There's no room for heroes
in the world of zombies.

968
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,440
Believe me.

969
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:05,318
We come from a long and proud
history of being cowards.

970
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,286
Marcus?

971
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,431
Marcus?

972
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:23,294
If I'm not back in an hour,
call in a bomb scare.

973
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,478
Hey.

974
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,279
Hey.

975
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,386
You really don't know
anything else about this?

976
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,251
No, I mean, it was
stolen from my father.

977
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:45,358
Right, well, it was
never his to begin with.

978
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,295
I mean, it belonged to the Werewolves.

979
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,290
Your father had to have known
that this wasn't just some

980
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,777
goddamned heirloom for sale.

981
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:57,337
Mara killed him to get it back.
That's...

982
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:01,241
But you said the
vampires were behind this.

983
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,401
Not exactly.

984
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:06,379
Mara gave the Heart to her vampire
boyfriend, Slake, who hid it.

985
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,450
And when Mara was killed,

986
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,385
he told the one person that
he could trust where it was,

987
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,221
Gabriel.

988
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,416
Now all three of them are dead.

989
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,355
Does the word "Sclavi"
mean anything to you?

990
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,332
No.

991
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,337
I have been pointing the finger
at Gabriel, my oldest friend.

992
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,271
A man of honour.

993
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,399
Now he's dead.

994
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,422
Crossing the line? Yeah, perhaps.

995
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,322
But I'm not exactly billing her for it.

996
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,359
I knew Elizabeth was still in danger.

997
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:04,236
Being caught up in a world where
you don't belong isn't natural.

998
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:10,478
I was well aware of that at
one time. And so was Cassandra.

999
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:22,412
Morning.

1000
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,483
Good morning.

1001
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,524
This is a talisman.

1002
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:33,332
As long as you're wearing it,
vampires can't touch you.

1003
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,265
You'll be safe.

1004
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,314
Thank you.

1005
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,321
Dylan. You are not gonna believe what I.

1006
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,246
Hi, Elizabeth.

1007
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,350
You're...

1008
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,233
I shouldn't have barged in.
I'm just not used to you...

1009
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,297
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I just...

1010
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,332
I guess we could just
talk about the location

1011
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,208
of the flesh-eating zombie
when you guys are done...

1012
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,368
...boning.

1013
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,449
I'm gonna go. I'm really sorry.

1014
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,451
Marcus. Come back, Marcus.

1015
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,238
So, you and Elizabeth?

1016
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:34,218
I think it's great.

1017
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,297
She seems really sweet. She seems
to like you, you seem to like her.

1018
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,391
It's great. You gotta move on, right?

1019
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,299
I mean, it's you know...
It's been some time.

1020
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,394
And you gotta kind of just
do what the heart...

1021
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,529
Shut up, or I'm gonna shoot you again.

1022
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,466
The big zombie was the key.

1023
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,478
I just didn't know how
he fit into all this.

1024
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:02,314
This place is like a maze, Dylan.
You know your way around here?

1025
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,349
Yeah, a little bit. Came with the job.

1026
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,226
The zombies turned it into a
penal colony a few years ago.

1027
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,495
They banish the ones who become
too dangerous or too decayed.

1028
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:16,430
Only the strongest survive.
And the others get eaten.

1029
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,435
"The others get eaten"?

1030
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,369
You mean, like, cannibal zombies?

1031
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:25,235
Duck. What?

1032
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,339
Duck.

1033
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,322
What the hell was that?

1034
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,283
Dum-dums. Zombie Stoppers.

1035
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,351
Cute.

1036
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,322
Sorry. Come on, we gotta go.

1037
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,355
Oh, my God. Wait, Dylan.

1038
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,328
If I ever get like that, you'll...

1039
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,467
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1040
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,306
Oh, you'll take care of it.

1041
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,405
Good, that's great. Thanks, Kevorkian.

1042
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,518
So, looks like there's
no zombies down here,

1043
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,486
so that's gotta be a good thing, right?

1044
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,413
Not exactly.

1045
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,221
This place is more overcrowded
than Riker's Island.

1046
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,228
If there are no zombies here, it's
because they're afraid of something.

1047
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,229
Great.

1048
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:16,321
I'm going down.

1049
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,071
You're going down?
You're going down there...

1050
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,328
...with the skulls and the bones
and the cannibal zombies?

1051
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:23,799
Okay, I'm gonna stay up here.

1052
01:12:23,836 --> 01:12:25,466
I'll Keep watch, 'cause
I haven't gone bananas.

1053
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:27,264
Yet.

1054
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,280
Definitely a flesh-eater.

1055
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,315
What are you looking at?

1056
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,512
Vampire blood from Corpus House.

1057
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,518
Someone's been controlling it.

1058
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,257
Dylan?

1059
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,453
You okay?

1060
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,412
I'm sorry.

1061
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,419
Oh, my God!

1062
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,289
Dylan!

1063
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,536
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God! Dylan, get me up!

1064
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,368
Dylan! Dylan!

1065
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:40,348
What are you doing up there?
Oh, they're filthy! They're filthy!

1066
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:41,449
Dylan!

1067
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,447
Dylan! Hurry up! They're gonna eat me!

1068
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,284
Stop! I'm one of you! I'm one of you!

1069
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,431
Oh, my God, they're touching me!
They're touching me!

1070
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,492
They're cold and they're
wet and they're touching me!

1071
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,233
Dylan, please! Dylan!

1072
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,471
Marcus.

1073
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,249
You're my hero.

1074
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,232
What are those?

1075
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,495
Wooden bullets.

1076
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,232
What are the wooden bullets for?

1077
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,238
Think about it.

1078
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,502
Who's had all the opportunity in
the world to know about the Heart?

1079
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,510
Who's been following me,
probably since I took this case?

1080
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,412
And who has everything to gain
from wiping out all the undead?

1081
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,473
I'm gonna guess someone who
doesn't like wooden bullets?

1082
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,376
Vargas has been in on
this since the start.

1083
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,250
Vargas.

1084
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,345
So, what's the plan?

1085
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,254
No plan.

1086
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,259
Just bigger guns.

1087
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:34,414
Open those.

1088
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,403
Dylan.

1089
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,311
What is your problem?

1090
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,351
What is my problem?

1091
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,378
I told you that I'd be back.

1092
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,328
No!

1093
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,398
What's wrong, you
don't like the sunlight?

1094
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,464
Maybe you can help me with
something. Where's the Heart?

1095
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,206
What?

1096
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,466
What are you talking about? I don't
know what you're talking about.

1097
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,409
Wrong answer, bloodsucker.

1098
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,416
- You're killing him!
- I know.

1099
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,515
Okay, all right! Okay, stop it!

1100
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:50,287
Okay. Yes. I had my people
looking for the Heart.

1101
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,357
But can you blame me?

1102
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,395
The thing is, it's a nuclear bomb, man.

1103
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,465
Whoever controls Belial...

1104
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,442
...controls the world.

1105
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,500
What is "Sclavi"?

1106
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,406
Sclavi? What do you mean, Sclavi?

1107
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:11,378
Okay, okay, I was just kidding,
I was just kidding.

1108
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,412
Sclavi, okay.
Sclavi is a vampire.

1109
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:18,520
One of the elders that helped
build Corpus House. All right?

1110
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,453
And where would I find him?

1111
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,258
He's a sleeper.

1112
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,425
He's a sleeper. Why do you even care?

1113
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,268
Okay, just leave me alone.

1114
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,405
I got pus all over my sheets.

1115
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,367
Maybe you should get some vitamin E.
We'll be back in a little bit.

1116
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,503
Yeah, and some, like, healing aloe!

1117
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,347
We've got half an hour before
the sun sets. Let's move.

1118
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,442
Well, where are we going?

1119
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,287
He said Sclavi was a sleeper.

1120
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,458
This is where they keep their relatives.

1121
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,455
Sort of like a retirement home.

1122
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,296
In a crummy shipyard?

1123
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,268
Well, would you have
thought to look here?

1124
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,499
So, what are these
crazy symbols everywhere?

1125
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,272
They're vampire blood types.
Each family has its own type.

1126
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,383
What's that?

1127
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,293
Vampire blood.

1128
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,354
Thought so.

1129
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,241
"Sergio."

1130
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,443
"Sclavi." Here he is.

1131
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,487
There's the Heart.

1132
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,290
Oh, my God.

1133
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,326
Looks like my grandfather on prom night.

1134
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,432
They're sleeping.

1135
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,433
Sorry.

1136
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,236
Oh, Jesus.

1137
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:20,271
I'm not gonna grab that.
Are you kidding me?

1138
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,408
Look, he's got a death
grip on it, literally.

1139
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,246
Your limbs are replaceable.

1140
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,776
Yeah, we already replaced one.
It was great for me. Remember that?

1141
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,478
Fine.

1142
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,253
You're a detective.
Just, you can get it.

1143
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,451
Just be careful when you do it, okay?
Don't just grab it, okay.

1144
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:35,496
Yeah.

1145
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,490
Tenderly, okay?

1146
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,227
Okay.

1147
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:52,311
Oh, my God! Dylan, oh, my God!
Run and save yourself!

1148
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:58,286
What happened?

1149
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,480
I guess you'll never know.

1150
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:08,419
I'm not built for this, man.
I'm not built for this.

1151
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:12,264
I think I just leaked something.
Oh, my God.

1152
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,307
You know, for someone who
thinks he's pretty smart,

1153
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,503
I certainly get the crap
kicked out of me a lot.

1154
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,278
Oh, crap.

1155
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,314
Dearly beloved,

1156
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:33,352
We have gathered here tonight to
pay our finial respects to Dylan,

1157
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,281
a breather who didn't
have enough good sense

1158
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,418
to keep his dumb ass retired.

1159
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,299
Please, don't interrupt the eulogy.

1160
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:52,337
I'll have you all know that I've been
crafting that for quite some time now.

1161
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,466
But recent events have
overshadowed my prepared remarks.

1162
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,510
I mean, what can I say about a man who...

1163
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:05,481
...not only killed off all of my Corpus
House competition back in the day

1164
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,482
but also brought...

1165
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,324
I'm sorry, I told myself
that I wouldn't cry.

1166
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:17,455
He also brought us the Heart of Belial.

1167
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,398
I mean, sure, we've had some
tough moments, some ups and downs...

1168
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,241
...but time heals most wounds.

1169
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,347
And if the rest of your life
weren't so regrettably brief,

1170
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:38,308
you would see that I
am a really fast healer.

1171
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,409
Let go of me.

1172
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,481
Oh, I almost forgot. I love
surprises. Here, bring her up.

1173
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:46,483
Guess who we found in your
shitty-ass little office? Come here.

1174
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,331
You little dog, you. Freaky-deaky.

1175
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:56,302
Why do you always pick
the prettiest girls?

1176
01:22:56,338 --> 01:23:01,275
I swear, if I didn't need a vessel
to turn into Belial, she would...

1177
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,403
You, young lady, would make a
great addition to my little clan.

1178
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:10,511
Mix it up a bit? Get away
from me. Go on, take her.

1179
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:15,455
You know, she kind of
reminds me of Cassandra.

1180
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:20,394
Right? Yeah, I knew
you were thinking it.

1181
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,264
She was a fighter. Yeah.

1182
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,399
And you know what?

1183
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,392
It made her blood taste
just a little bit sweeter.

1184
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:32,463
Easy. You calm down.

1185
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:36,341
Come on, how else was I supposed to
get rid of all those old bastards?

1186
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,311
You did the work for me, Quick-Draw.

1187
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,372
I swear.

1188
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,411
You humans, you're
predictable to a fault.

1189
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,488
You pull one string, a leg moves.

1190
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:51,289
You pull another, you pull out a gun.

1191
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:52,452
It's pathetic.

1192
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:54,318
I'm gonna kill you.

1193
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,252
Okay.

1194
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,295
Me first.

1195
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:06,297
Vargas!

1196
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,533
Well, this is a setback.

1197
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,370
Dylan? I feel like I've been stepped on.

1198
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,381
Dylan? Where the hell
are we? Where are we?

1199
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,491
We're in a crypt.

1200
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,460
We're in a crypt?

1201
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:03,259
What are we doing in a crypt?
Are you kidding me?

1202
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,262
Dylan. Dylan!

1203
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,501
Oh, my God, I need to call someone.

1204
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,337
Just hold on, just
don't panic, all right?

1205
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,431
Just calm down. Calm down! Stop.

1206
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,376
911, what's your emergency?

1207
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:16,467
- Hello?
- Hello.

1208
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:20,242
Yes, yes. We're trapped in a crypt.
We're trapped in a crypt.

1209
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,441
And I don't know where it is,
but it's dark,

1210
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,280
and it's cold, and it smells like shit!

1211
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:24,376
Can you give me your location?

1212
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:26,250
And I'm trapped down
here with my friend.

1213
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,381
And he doesn't know where we are,
and he's really scared.

1214
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,220
He's really scared,
and I'm trying to keep him...

1215
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,452
- I'm sorry, you're breaking up.
- Can you hear me?

1216
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:37,228
"More bars guaranteed," my undead ass!

1217
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,233
- Dylan! Dylan!
- Marcus!

1218
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,427
- Marcus!
- No! What?!

1219
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,266
Be quiet, please.

1220
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:45,372
Listen, Dylan, I'm just
trying to think. All right?

1221
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,370
What, what is it?

1222
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:54,505
Little-known fact. Zombies are
actually world-class diggers.

1223
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:04,315
Dylan, are you implying that I dig
us out of the dark, scary crypt?

1224
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,427
Bingo.

1225
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:12,227
No. Nope, no. Not gonna happen. Not.

1226
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:15,395
Hey, hey, big guy! Big guy!
Big guy! No, it's not happening.

1227
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:20,464
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

1228
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,239
Dylan, no!

1229
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,245
I hate you.

1230
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,417
That's not bad, actually.

1231
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,124
Who's your go-to guy now?

1232
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,359
Not bad for a zombie.

1233
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,395
Shit.

1234
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,239
What?

1235
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,375
She wasn't wearing the talisman.

1236
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:31,277
We're gonna save her.
I mean, we're on our way. We're going.

1237
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,337
She's not the one I'm worried about.

1238
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,521
What's the matter, pumpkin?

1239
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,396
Why the long face?

1240
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,489
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

1241
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:57,300
As a matter of fact,
you're gonna live forever.

1242
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:04,241
Yeah, see, if the myths of Belial
are true, you may even outlive me.

1243
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,382
But not before you've
brought every undead race

1244
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,281
down to their knees before me.

1245
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:15,279
Who knows, maybe the living, too.

1246
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:22,420
On, yeah. We're making you one
of us, if only for a brief moment.

1247
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:25,332
See, only the undead can become Belial.

1248
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:28,358
I know, I know...
I didn't make up the rules.

1249
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,274
I have a confession to make.

1250
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,507
I'm probably going to enjoy this.

1251
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,377
Mors tua, vita mea.

1252
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:45,419
I'm sorry?

1253
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,446
It's an old family saying.

1254
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:51,424
It means, "Your death is my life."

1255
01:28:58,118 --> 01:28:59,229
Sassy!

1256
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,402
Where is the Heart?

1257
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:44,211
It was Elizabeth the entire time.

1258
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,337
She was the one controlling
the tattooed zombie,

1259
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:50,340
and she was the one who had to
kill Gabriel, Slake, and you.

1260
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,478
All of them? I knew it.

1261
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,455
She's a monster hunter,
just like her father.

1262
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,254
Hey, should I have a gun?
I should have a gun, right?

1263
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,321
Looks like she's trying
to fulfil her legacy.

1264
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,424
Call Wolfgang. Tell him
to bring in the cavalry.

1265
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,324
Come on.

1266
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:24,268
Stop! Don't do it, Elizabeth.

1267
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:28,345
I knew that you were the only one
who would find it for me, Dylan.

1268
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:31,287
You of all people should
understand what I'm doing.

1269
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:33,384
You should understand why.

1270
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,418
Oh, I understand why.

1271
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:38,457
But this revenge, or whatever
it is, is not the answer.

1272
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,428
This has nothing to do with
my father being murdered.

1273
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:45,303
This is much bigger than that.
We are the good guys.

1274
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,307
By slaughtering millions
of innocent undead?

1275
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:52,269
No, that's where
you're wrong, Elizabeth.

1276
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,477
We're the good guys.
And you're the monster.

1277
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:01,253
I wish that I could make you understand.

1278
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,256
No, don't!

1279
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:05,325
Come on!

1280
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:14,390
No!

1281
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,208
Great.

1282
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:25,412
Oh, my God.

1283
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,324
Hang on, Dylan!

1284
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,232
Dylan!

1285
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,328
Not so fast! Stay away from him!

1286
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,236
Stop it! Marcus!?

1287
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,240
Elizabeth!?

1288
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:44,216
Marcus, seriously.

1289
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,249
Hey!

1290
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:02,225
Zombie power, bitch.

1291
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:47,412
Stop! You answer to me.

1292
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:05,391
Our enemies are the monsters
outside these walls, not here.

1293
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,309
I am your master!

1294
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,286
Well, what do we got here?

1295
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,350
Monster hunter in over her head?

1296
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:09,429
You think you can wipe us
all out with your pet monster?

1297
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,491
Well, guess what, piglet.
We're still here.

1298
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:17,494
And now, it's dying time.

1299
01:37:56,503 --> 01:37:57,470
Man.

1300
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,499
We're so discussing a raise.

1301
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,387
Good work, Dylan.

1302
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,430
A lot of people died for this.

1303
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:33,406
I need someone I can
trust to hold onto it.

1304
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:37,505
I'm sorry about your father.

1305
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:39,439
He was a good man.

1306
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,281
I wouldn't count my
father out that fast.

1307
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,343
Why don't you come down
to the plant sometime?

1308
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:48,421
But this time, leave the silver at home.

1309
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,258
Yeah.

1310
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,425
Let's go.

1311
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:03,231
You all right? You look like hell.

1312
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,294
Yeah.

1313
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,309
Next time, I pick the clients, okay?

1314
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,318
Hey. I feel like I have
something in my eye.

1315
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:19,308
Do I have something in my eyes?

1316
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,208
No.

1317
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,252
It's fine? Yeah.

1318
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,485
I can't... It feels weird.

1319
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,452
Call us a cab.

1320
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,258
Okay. Here.

1321
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:32,356
Just do it, please. Thank you.

1322
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:42,273
You know what? Let me... I'll throw
that away. Let me, I'll get that.

1323
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,368
It's all right.

1324
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:50,248
You know, I'm gonna hang onto
it for a little while, actually.

1325
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:53,249
I need to get some more
copies for my partner.

1326
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,255
Okay, I'll take care of that?
Sure.

1327
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:56,449
I'll get right on it.

1328
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:01,284
Wait, partner? Oh, my God, Dylan?
Did you just say "partner"?

1329
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:04,431
I mean, by partner,
I assume you're talking...

1330
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:06,365
Of course you're talking about me.

1331
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,230
Oh, my God, man! Oh, this is great!

1332
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:11,328
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't mean...

1333
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:13,397
I know you're in pain. I'm sorry.

1334
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:16,466
If I had another arm
right now, I would hug you.

1335
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:22,247
And, you know, we'll get you,
get you a new arm. Fresh eyes.

1336
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:24,341
You know what? This arm?
Actually I'm kind of starting to dig it.

1337
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:26,510
Smells like Old Spice.
Reminds me of my dad.

1338
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:29,312
Wait, eyes? What are you talking about?

1339
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,357
You'll see.

1340
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,349
Come on. I'll buy you a hot dog.

1341
01:40:33,914 --> 01:40:37,353
I ate a worm tonight. Not so bad.
Pretty good, actually.
