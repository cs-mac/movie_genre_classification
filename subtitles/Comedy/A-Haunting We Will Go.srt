1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,899
It doesn't work.
The tape may be entangled.

2
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,609
No use?

3
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,480
How about the reverse side?

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,990
You have imagination, preservation,
and heartlessness called destruction.

5
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,460
These words, in Sanskrit,
are expressed in one word, "Aum".

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,460
"Aum" symbolizes
the heartlessness of the universe

7
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,969
which lies at the essence of
absolute truth.

8
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:54,109
And together with
our pursuit for Truth (=Shinri),

9
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,579
"Aum Shinrikyo" was derived from
these two meanings.

10
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:04,609
Well now, if you are
in doubt of your existence,

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,819
why don't you knock
at the gate of "Aum Shinrikyo"

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,629
Truly, this actual world.

13
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,299
This so-called human world
will take us into "Mae".

14
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,280
"Mae" tempts us to believe
that our whole life,

15
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,849
from the moment we are born
through to our deaths,

16
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:39,920
is as if it were true and unbreakable.

17
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:48,819
But the reality must be that
many messengers are being sent down.

18
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,629
For instance, there is
the great Yama king appearing

19
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,640
in the Sutras
who exterminates evil people.

20
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,709
March 1996, Tokyo
Aoyama Headquarters

21
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,689
March 1996, Tokyo
Aoyama Headquarters

22
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,229
Hey, Araki

23
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,370
It's Nakasone from TV Asahi

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,099
Oh, not him again

25
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,439
He wants your opinion
on the Joyu trial today

26
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,939
Always the same question.

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,210
Tell him to send it by fax.

28
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,250
Were you close to Joyu?

29
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,979
Close? Well, I respected him.

30
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,789
He worked for the Space Development
Agency.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,400
I used to want to work there too.

32
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,620
How come?

33
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:06,009
Why'd you want to work there?
What about space interests you?

34
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:16,210
Well, it's a kind of riddle, isn't it?
A riddle, and mysterious too.

35
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,080
Like where do humans come from
and where they're heading?

36
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:30,840
Pick up the phone, ARAKI!

37
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,870
Hello.

38
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,650
I haven't heard the details yet, but
there were a lot of inaccuracies

39
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,509
in the indictment. But today

40
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,840
they'll go through all those details.
At the official trial...

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,319
It's about today's Joyu trial and
some related issues.

42
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,590
There'll be a lot of questions
today, so let's get them all via fax.

43
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,650
Is this a question?

44
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,020
Do they have one?

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,759
They want to talk to you...

46
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,069
Tell them to send their question by fax.

47
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,870
But, they're outside.

48
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,169
I don't care. That's their business.

49
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,639
I'm sorry. But our lines are flooded.

50
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,800
Could you send your questions by fax?

51
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:24,720
What's that?

52
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
Is that rubbish?

53
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,649
Uh. No.

54
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,470
It's vegetable protein.

55
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,480
It's a meat substitute.
We prepare it like this...

56
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,579
You have this everyday?

57
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,319
Everyday, that's right.

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,040
Don't you get bored?

59
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:59,860
No, no.

60
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,060
The hunger for all kinds of different

61
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:10,100
foods is the influence of carnal desire
on the diet.

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,970
I heard about a former believer
who visited.

63
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,660
Asahara arranged a meal.

64
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,779
A surprise - a juicy, red steak.

65
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,680
That's what the disciple must have
wanted to eat.

66
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,740
It would be a sin to eat what you want
elsewhere,

67
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,360
but if Master Asahara gave it to him,

68
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,360
he could eat it without sinning.

69
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,290
I think it's a kind of love.

70
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,620
But, what's the difference?

71
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,399
Even if it's the same food.

72
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,870
There's a difference eating with
or without Permission.

73
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,740
Would you explain your meal?

74
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,740
Not much to explain.

75
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,779
Rice, sesame, and hamburger.

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,019
But it's protein, not meat.

77
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,250
What's the egg?

78
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,930
Just a boiled egg.

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,490
And this broth?

80
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,160
Just a broth. I think.

81
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,870
You see you can slowly lose
your appetite. Eventually

82
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,569
you break it and you can live
without eating.

83
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,410
So you want to reject those moments
of pleasure that are. I think,

84
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:07,850
the most fulfilling moments of
human existence.

85
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,050
That's what Buddhism teaches...

86
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,720
Actually, I went too.
To sit in on Nakagawa's trial.

87
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,120
How was it?

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,060
Hmmm, well.

89
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,370
I didn't think he'd gone that far.
It was a bit of a shock.

90
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,189
So he admitted to the things that
media's reported?

91
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,069
I just came home, so I haven't seen
the news yet. But probably...

92
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,939
A complete confession?

93
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,639
Yes, that's what it was.

94
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,209
It was a shock?

95
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:49,420
Yes, what else is it, when you hear
it from a person's own mouth?

96
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,689
In my case, I don't have many of the
worldly joys of the laity.

97
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,730
Worldly joys like marriage and so on.

98
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,860
So, even if I were to quit Aum,

99
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,649
I'd like to get training
somewhere else.

100
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,750
So, more than Aum itself,

101
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,420
you're looking for a place outside
the lay world where you can train.

102
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,850
Hmmm...

103
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,389
It'd be great if there were a system
like Aum, a good training system

104
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,029
but, as far as I know,
there aren't any.

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,899
If there were a guru as great as the
Master. I might think differently.

106
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,539
But for now, I can't imagine
anyone besides the Master.

107
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,419
Must be cold out there. People
have their scarves on.

108
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,059
Windy too.

109
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,200
News crews?

110
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,200
What's it feel like from this side?

111
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,240
It's been a year since the subway
gassing. And Aum's first case...

112
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:23,940
Are you taping?

113
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,149
No, we're not. Would it be a
problem? This guy is.

114
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,690
He's asked us, so we let him.

115
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,460
We're not rolling yet.

116
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,830
It's really about whether we use
it or not.

117
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,440
I haven't spoken to the cameraman.

118
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,110
But, we're ready to roll anytime.
Now, you're saying we can't use it.

119
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,870
Right.

120
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,009
Tell us why.

121
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,480
Because we can't trust your show.

122
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,309
Please trust us.

123
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,309
Why? You don't respond to our
requests.

124
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,779
This is a question of journalistic
freedom.

125
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,899
I don't know if we're filming now,
but if we were, will you let us use it?

126
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,690
You don't know?

127
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,559
I operate independently of
the camera.

128
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:15,470
So maybe you're filming now?

129
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,970
Perhaps. Our camera is here
somewhere among...

130
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:20,909
Is that it?

131
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,509
No, they're different.

132
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,019
If we're not filming, we won't use
it, but if we are, then will you...

133
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,960
You said you weren't. How can you
ask that? You need to check first.

134
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,129
But I knew we wouldn't use it.
Please trust us.

135
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,240
If we've got this on film, then we
won't use it.

136
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,399
That should be a given.

137
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,870
I'm sure we're not recording...
I mean. I don't think we are.

138
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,940
"Don't think." There you go again.

139
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,980
Would you mind if we did?
The Nihon TV crew are right here.

140
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,480
Forget it. We can't deal with you.

141
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,669
Whys that?

142
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,950
This is Fuji TV.

143
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,820
What's your problem with Nihon TV?

144
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,090
Not Nihon TV. Just your show.

145
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,899
Are you filming now?

146
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,629
Please don't interrupt us.
Now about Nihon TV?

147
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,799
It's not Nihon TV, it's your program.

148
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,809
Just a bit.

149
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:26,990
Out of the question.

150
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,700
Even now?

151
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,000
You're shooting without asking?!

152
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,539
But. I just said I'm from Nihon TV.

153
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,879
But I told you not to.

154
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,950
This, neither?

155
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,779
This is why we can't trust you.

156
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,090
I definitely told you.

157
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,440
What's your problem?

158
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,690
You were blocking my view.

159
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,370
I was not.

160
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:58,440
Weren't you?

161
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,700
Just drop it.

162
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,580
You're the one getting in our way.

163
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,039
When we're discussing it...

164
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,149
Our position...

165
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,509
Convey the position we're in.

166
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,049
I'll relay what you're saying.
But, we also have to evaluate things...

167
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,480
So it may be hard...

168
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:19,620
Take into consideration my position.

169
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,759
But, I am thinking about you.

170
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,440
Think about my feelings.
Isn't that too much?

171
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,070
This is your job.

172
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,970
And yours too.

173
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm being made into the object.
It's my face on TV.

174
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,409
Okay, okay.

175
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,639
Don't use that picture.

176
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,909
It's not my decision.

177
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,419
What I'm... Oh, forget it.

178
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,149
I agree, but the company stance
of journalistic freedom...

179
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,389
So I came to Tokyo wearing
my sports gear

180
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,059
with two bags and a backpack.

181
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,200
Aoyama was crawling
with news crews and policemen.

182
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,210
And me, a nervous country bumpkin,

183
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,710
totally lost in the big city.

184
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,570
The police stopped me, and all of a

185
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,309
sudden started interrogating me,

186
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,919
asking my name and making me open
up my bags. And. That's right when

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,720
the media swooped down on me.

188
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,120
With their cameras pointing.

189
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:34,759
I thought, so this is what the media
do. That was my first impression.

190
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,009
Death is inevitable.

191
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,779
Hang in there!

192
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,809
Show me the jacket?

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,620
Asahara 's Hell

194
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,450
Who bought the book?

195
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,120
Well, either Araki or me buys them

196
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,899
when we go out.

197
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,909
What do you think of it?

198
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,769
It's hard to say.

199
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,919
Where's the screwdriver set?

200
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,389
I had it earlier.

201
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,679
Who's singing?

202
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,940
It's the Master.

203
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,840
He's got a good range.

204
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,580
Training does that to everything.

205
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:38,279
Once everything is explained, you
can understand anything, I think.

206
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,200
Opening up the chakra in the
throat frees the voice.

207
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:52,240
On good days, they say the Master can
sing the full range of a piano keyboard.

208
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:06,179
I think that there are actually gods
at the Fuji Dojo.

209
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:07,750
You feel spirits?

210
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,450
Well. They take the form of humans.

211
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:12,419
Like who?

212
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,820
They have supernatural powers.

213
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,820
What?

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,549
Supernatural powers.

215
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,169
Are they current members?

216
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,139
Yeah. So, here's a frontier
with the gods.

217
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,909
But they won't show regular people.

218
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,340
They're not people in the Dress now?

219
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:34,980
That's right. They'd stick out if
regular people saw them.

220
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,019
What powers do they have?

221
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,750
They can tell whatever I'm thinking.
Even if I don't say anything.

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,960
Something like mind reading?

223
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,690
Seeing the depths of the heart
is what we call it.

224
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,490
They do this all the time.

225
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,570
And levitation?

226
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,830
That's... just a trick.

227
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,980
I have no interest in that, and the
Master says

228
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,799
it will only come naturally.

229
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,200
I used to bind my legs...

230
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,099
I like this

231
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,319
with a seatbelt that I modified.

232
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:44,480
Why bind your legs?

233
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,890
To get rid of karma from Hell.

234
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,089
So you torture yourself?

235
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,420
Not so much "torturing" as...

236
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,160
You see, I did a lot of killing
when I worked for a company

237
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,769
that dealt in animals. There are times
when you just have to kill.

238
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,509
Pigs, actually. Well, at first I didn't
want to kill animals.

239
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,220
But thinking about my career,

240
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:21,089
I had to, because
it was a pork company. So, I did.

241
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,579
You know there are

242
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,730
so many ways to kill.

243
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,130
I did that for 12 years.

244
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,309
Not just animals, but flies
and maggots too.

245
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:42,500
It gets linked to your performance.
So, I'd do it.

246
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,480
Spraying insecticide. And killing.

247
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:55,109
Now, as a result,
we have poison gas attacks.

248
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,420
It comes back to haunt us.

249
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,789
They're entirely different.

250
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,740
They altered the image.

251
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,480
But you can tell.

252
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,740
If you know who to look for.

253
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,829
It's so obvious.

254
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,460
I didn't get it at first.

255
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Seeing myself talking on TV like that.
I was really taken aback.

256
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:56,509
I wasn't thinking about what to do
about it.

257
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,950
Instead, I just thought how
strange it all was.

258
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Then, later, I got calls from
my parents...

259
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,920
and from my old high school
and college friends.

260
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,470
They asked what I was doing on TV.

261
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,599
So, I said I was in the PR Dept.

262
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,240
Not really an answer, but...

263
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:23,039
Your being exposed like that

264
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,609
was because the people before you
had quit. So, it became all the harder

265
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,839
for you to leave.

266
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,589
Even if you did, you'd face a lot of
obstacles returning to the regular world.

267
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:42,099
So was this a choice of yours, given
that situation?

268
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,099
That's more the issue

269
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:49,670
that my parents and friends were
worried about.

270
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,609
How would I be treated by society.
Me personally that is.

271
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,069
Of course, I am concerned about
Aum's public image.

272
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,240
That's a completely different burden
I have to carry.

273
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,450
But, at a personal level,

274
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,329
I didn't care about the future

275
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,400
or about the effect of
becoming so public.

276
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,130
Because I'd already refused
society. And left home.

277
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:29,140
So, in that sense,
I wasn't as worried

278
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,910
as you might expect.

279
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,589
So, you weren't even thinking
that you might one day leave Aum?

280
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:44,589
Even if I left Aum, I didn't think that
society with its values. Values it would

281
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,289
continue to pursue, was a place I could
ever return to.

282
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,839
So, rather than never leaving Aum, it's
more an idea of not returning to society.

283
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,630
Right.

284
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,789
April 1996
Yokohama Seminary

285
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,769
April 1996
Yokohama Seminary

286
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,619
I am now experiencing with my body
the Buddhist doctrines

287
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,890
that I knew earlier only at
an abstract level,

288
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,859
and I feel that my heart has
found peace.

289
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,569
We're thankful for that.

290
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,640
That's right.

291
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:38,400
Aum's teachings may be great. But

292
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:42,029
you have to apply them to make
them your own.

293
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,710
So, although our human rights are
being ignored

294
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,690
and Aum is being abused, treated as
if we're not human,

295
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,329
still, now we can see how far
we've mastered Aum's teachings.

296
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,200
Or, it's a kind of training to see
whether we can learn them.

297
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,990
In that sense, I'm really pleased.

298
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,829
I know it's not a game of Othello
but, still, in Othello

299
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,509
even if the board's all black, you

300
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:20,079
can win by taking the corners.
That kind of situation can happen.

301
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,309
But even not,
I want to keep being white,

302
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,089
to increase even by one the number
of white pieces.

303
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,279
The Master's brainwaves are still.

304
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:35,269
That means, counter to media claims,

305
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,460
his subconscious is in command and

306
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,029
there's nothing like "mind control"
going on.

307
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,210
The moment the Master came to the
bank of the pond.

308
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,019
Something happened. I hadn't thought
there were fish living there,

309
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,660
but when the Master appeared, they
appeared in great number

310
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,029
all struggling to get close to him.

311
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:15,329
Even from my position, I could see

312
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,130
how happy they were splashing
about, how really happy they were.

313
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,549
That scene feels exactly right.

314
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:36,430
And there were so many birds, too,
which came flying in around him.

315
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,529
The lake was covered with them.

316
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,720
We, the birds, and the fish all
became the Master's audience.

317
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,640
Listening to what he said.

318
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,509
Even the animals can feel his
vibrations.

319
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,180
Right in front of you?

320
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,289
Well, there were actually 400
people there who saw that...

321
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,710
It wasn't a piece of bread?

322
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,059
No, no.

323
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,670
Follow the path of Boddhisattva
no matter how difficult.

324
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,609
The Guru is necessary.

325
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,549
But we also have the doctrines

326
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:38,680
that the Master interprets for us.

327
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:44,619
And then there are all the classic
Buddhist texts passed down.

328
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:52,250
I think that we can't do without
either of them.

329
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,190
But there's no chance that Asahara

330
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,799
will be released.

331
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,569
You won't see him ever again.

332
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,420
Maybe never talk to him.

333
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,190
That's true...

334
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,859
24th April 1996,
Kamikuishiki-mura Near Mt. Fuji

335
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,930
Asahara Shoko
at the opening hearings

336
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,680
News about Aum's Asahara's hearings
coming up.

337
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:47,349
Hearings of the Asahara Shoho trial

338
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:50,690
will start at 10 AM in Tokyo today.

339
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,329
The defendant faces 17 accounts of...

340
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,259
I'm sorry all I have here
is a fax

341
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:27,789
but, I have secured Permission
as you can see.

342
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:30,529
For the 24th, from 2 to 9 PM

343
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,130
and tomorrow from 9 AM to 9 PM

344
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:39,000
under certain conditions of course.

345
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:41,509
Did you ask me about this?

346
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,380
I don't know. Nihon TV put
the request in for me.

347
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,349
It's the first I've heard of it.

348
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:50,880
You have to get Permission

349
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,779
from Aum first. That's required.

350
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,019
Then, what's this?

351
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,690
You need two. First Permission

352
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,359
from the bankruptcy trustee,
then permission from the residents.

353
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,259
He didn't tell you that?

354
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,740
Nakamura from Nihon TV
arranged it for me.

355
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,680
Then, ask him. But I'm sure
the trustee told him.

356
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,809
The residents need to approve it.

357
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,349
So if I get their Permission, then
I can come in.

358
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,650
Well. You get that from me.

359
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:29,519
If you haven't been told about this...

360
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,490
It's the first I've heard about this.

361
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:37,900
I shouldn't have to repeat what is
common sense, but in addition to this

362
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:43,529
Permission, you also need the
consent of the residents on the site.

363
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,839
You give us these conditions here.

364
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,849
I'm wondering how binding they are.

365
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:56,349
What's the authority behind
your view?

366
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,519
You mean to just barge in?

367
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,009
That's not what I mean.

368
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,390
That's absurd. This is where we live.

369
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,589
So can I confirm this time?

370
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,960
With whom?

371
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,529
Right here.

372
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,130
Confirm what?

373
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:14,140
You said that I needed to get your
Permission

374
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:16,960
to do my report.

375
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:17,839
Of course.

376
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,509
So. What about this request?

377
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,079
What do you mean? I mean... well

378
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,450
I can't let you in.

379
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:27,339
I'm not talking to you.

380
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,279
I can't let you in.

381
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,579
So you're saying that I need to get

382
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,319
your approval, the residents' consent,

383
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,859
then, I submit this request to Mr. Abe

384
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,299
and get permission.

385
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,160
Then, I come back and arrange it to
go in with you.

386
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,779
Yes, this is common sense.

387
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,609
After NHK. We'd like approval too.

388
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,609
We want approval too.

389
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,720
It's not fair for just one crew...

390
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,289
It'd be more efficient to cover it as a
group, rather than just one network.

391
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,180
That's difficult.

392
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,559
The bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Abe...

393
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:17,069
So, as long as we get Arakis
permission we're OK. And Abe's.

394
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:21,670
So shut up, we're not asking you.

395
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:30,210
I was told that we need to negotiate
with you to go in.

396
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,309
From whom?

397
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,680
This fax.

398
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,549
Exactly!

399
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,289
So, I'm making a request...
of you... right now.

400
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,049
You just said you had the
trustee's Permission

401
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,349
and acted like you had the right to...

402
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,299
Not, that's not at all what I meant.

403
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,829
That's what I heard.

404
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,799
No, no, no.

405
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:56,140
I don't want to blame anyone, but

406
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:03,750
that lady started talking about
protocol and all.

407
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:15,059
That's what I had assumed, so my
language was a bit strong. You see?

408
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,210
No, I don't.

409
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,329
All right, I get it.

410
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,960
But now I'm asking you.

411
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,329
It's not practical.

412
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,940
When are we starting?

413
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:31,069
TV Asahi hasn't finished...

414
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,299
Okay, then.

415
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,809
With all the factors, like this here,
I'm suggesting we all hold off,

416
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:43,539
and please try to stop this petty
feuding among yourselves

417
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:53,779
Satiyan #6 is no good, so we'll do
NHK here

418
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:09,200
Will you let us film, if we promise to
do it without making

419
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,880
any individuals identifiable?

420
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,109
I've never vacillated on this issue.

421
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:25,099
I respect facts for what they are.

422
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,599
So you mean...

423
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:33,900
that you accept that certain things
have happened

424
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,440
that some unsolved incidents
have taken place?

425
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,440
My belief in the Master
is unchanged.

426
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,609
I think we need to stop.

427
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:55,220
When I answer, I must
come across as quite stupid.

428
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,720
Then let's stop.

429
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,190
It can't be understood with the mind.

430
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,160
So, no matter what I say, people are
going to take it

431
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,170
just to reinforce what they're already
thinking. Not what I'm feeling.

432
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:19,980
It's pointless, because regular people
can't understand the feelings of

433
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,710
people in training.

434
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,050
You're talking at cross-purposes.

435
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,949
This isn't going to amount
to an interview.

436
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,559
Don't say they can't understand.

437
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,820
It's too easy to give up.

438
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,769
No, they'll misunderstand.

439
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,599
So, if that's the case,
I'd rather not say anything.

440
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,269
Well there may be some...

441
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,880
but we can try to avoid them.

442
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,179
Most of what I say will be
misunderstood, I think.

443
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:03,349
It's really hard to do something

444
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,150
without misunderstandings.

445
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:15,570
It's the listener who misunderstands.

446
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,809
There are very few people, us included,
who really hear what the other is saying.

447
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,539
Few people have that
kind of a clear heart.

448
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,219
Let's end this.

449
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:42,630
Was this shot by a member?

450
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:48,929
We've been trying to record the
investigations as much as we can.

451
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,539
This is Satiyan #10.

452
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,639
How long have you been here?

453
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:00,900
It's my second time in the order.

454
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,820
The second time?

455
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,719
I was in the order before,
but dropped out.

456
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,579
Why?

457
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,090
My carnal desires won out.

458
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,099
Food, sex. Or desire for fame?

459
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,400
All of them.

460
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:24,599
Hatred, sex, food, my feelings
towards my parents.

461
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:27,909
The normal lot.

462
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,449
While I was dropping out.

463
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,159
I spent my time in general seeking
for ordinary happiness.

464
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:48,690
You made love to a woman?

465
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:49,659
Yes.

466
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,159
Wasn't it good?

467
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,000
At first, I thought I'd get married.

468
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,360
But along the way

469
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:08,849
I realized marriage would only
lead to suffering.

470
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,969
If you really wanted to make
each other happy,

471
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:19,260
you'd grow close, get married,
live the happily married life,

472
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,869
grow old together.

473
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,989
Watching your darling children
grow up.

474
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:36,179
People try to live this
supposedly ideal life.

475
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,309
But even if they do, it ends
with death.

476
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:47,210
The more you love, the more
painful death becomes.

477
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,750
Does this relationship really make the
other person happy?

478
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,019
Isn't it instead painful?

479
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:01,230
Helping someone get beyond
these feelings,

480
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:05,570
that's giving them true happiness,
I think.

481
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,909
I cut off the feelings of romance and
love that I had.

482
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,119
Not just that.

483
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:29,690
Instead, I'd teach the path of true
liberation for the self,

484
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,260
Now she's in training.

485
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,730
Is she here?

486
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,429
Not here.

487
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,329
So she is an Aum believer?

488
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,869
I guess she's still in training.

489
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,000
What do you say, now that
the leaders have confessed?

490
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,250
If the Master said we were going

491
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,789
to go save Hell, I think I'd pass,
but I hope

492
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,460
I'll become strong enough a disciple
to go along.

493
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,570
We're all training much harder
than when he was here.

494
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,230
That's a good thing.

495
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,699
That's why this happened.

496
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,239
That's right.

497
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,469
The Master created this predicament

498
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,869
Precisely for us because he is
trying to get us to train harder

499
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:31,650
I quit university
after my third day.

500
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,429
I quit because I saw the
people around me

501
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,130
and thought there's no
future for Japan

502
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,320
if these are the people who are
going to make up society.

503
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,610
It's no surprise society's in decay.

504
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:57,010
So, I thought somebody's got to
do something, someone has

505
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,840
to work toward building
an ideal society.

506
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:07,510
And I thought that I should
renounce the world.

507
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,889
So I entered the order.

508
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:10,110
I don't understand that leap.

509
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:12,889
It is a leap. I didn't understand either.

510
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,460
I thought you'd been taken hostage!

511
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,829
Tough, eh? Because you're so sincere.

512
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,610
Maybe, just maybe

513
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:30,940
someone will start
to understand.

514
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,769
That's right!

515
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,610
Arakis honesty just grabs you.
It's bound to move them.

516
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:42,420
They wonder how long I'll be doing this.

517
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,989
You are self-pitying yourself.

518
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,070
Like I said earlier, he's matured.

519
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:51,500
He really has. When the Master
returns,

520
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:56,260
or even if he doesn't, Arakis
gone up in level.

521
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,110
Guru Reserves Right to Plead

522
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,119
Asahara 's Evasive Deposition

523
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,150
Aum Members Huddle in Seclusion

524
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,869
Yes. That's right.

525
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:30,239
Today. We also know that

526
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:33,849
they're watching today's
arraignment on TV.

527
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,679
Deputy Spokesman Araki hasn't
stepped out, so nothing there.

528
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,579
He makes his followers call him
Master and reigns...

529
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:51,590
someone who ignores the law-governed
state can't be taken seriously.

530
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:58,559
After a commercial break...

531
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,000
A bad reputation...

532
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:04,699
What?
- We've got a bad reputation.

533
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,340
It's pretty bad.

534
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,940
It's a test for the disciples.

535
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,679
The disciples' ideas about what the
Guru is are destroyed.

536
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,280
One after another.

537
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,460
This is the point at which you keep
following the Guru

538
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:24,889
or lose faith and quit.

539
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,420
It's about destroying ideas.

540
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,000
You mean a kind of test, a trial?

541
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:39,469
An act for the disciples' training.

542
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:46,539
You're saying some disciples didn't
make it through this ordeal, this trial?

543
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,070
What about you, Konta?

544
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,519
It doesn't shake me.

545
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:01,230
Through what has happened, I've
always thought it doesn't matter

546
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,159
what kind of person the Guru is.

547
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,610
This is just an extreme I'm asking.

548
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:13,809
But what if there were a report that
Asahara prostrated himself

549
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,070
apologizing and crying out for help?

550
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,239
No difference.

551
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:23,780
Is that because you don't believe the
report, or you don't care if it's true?

552
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,480
Even if I saw it with my own eyes,
that wouldn't affect me. You see.

553
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:35,719
I'm confident only the Master can
offer the final interpretation.

554
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,099
It's not as if we were actually trying

555
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,380
to invade the privacy of the believers.

556
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,099
Concerned about your name?

557
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,510
How about yours? The media's?

558
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,159
But you think badly of us already.

559
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,690
So you don't mind? A bad reputation?

560
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,860
You're just quibbling with us.

561
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:07,929
I am not.

562
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,260
What kind of conditions
are you asking? Money?

563
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,530
Did you really need to say that?

564
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,360
You're saying the same to us.

565
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,440
What's most important is getting
the residents to agree.

566
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,780
I'm with him, with Mr. Araki.

567
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,719
Together?

568
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,289
Yes.

569
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:40,860
He's a member?

570
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,320
No. He isn't.

571
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,130
I have a consent form.

572
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:45,559
What agency are you from?

573
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:46,530
Freelance.

574
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,869
He claims to deal
with the group directly.

575
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,840
Does he have the right Permission?

576
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,880
Returning alone? With someone?

577
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,440
I'll be leaving alone.

578
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:01,349
Can I go now?

579
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:34,610
When I got home, my parents were
waiting for me with these long faces.

580
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,940
They told me to sit down, and I could
already guess what it was about.

581
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,320
Two parents?

582
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,420
"We need to talk," they said.

583
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:56,190
They Dulled out a book. Sure enough,
an Aum one, "What's this?"

584
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,329
"Asahara Shoko" I said.

585
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,630
So they asked.

586
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,440
"Are you reading this? You've even
underlined it".

587
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,769
"I'm learning from it." I said.

588
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,250
"Are you in this group?"

589
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:22,480
"Of course, I am. When I do something,
I hate going just halfway".

590
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:25,920
You said that?
In front of your parents?

591
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,900
It was the first time to broach
the topic.

592
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:32,860
Maybe I should have
comforted them,

593
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:39,940
or been a proper child. That's
what they were looking for.

594
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,539
But that's not my role, so I
left and entered Aum.

595
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:49,280
It's a good thing, I guess, that
I have siblings

596
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:55,989
so if my parents want that, they
can get it from the other two.

597
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:59,590
I can't do it. Won't do it

598
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,960
anymore. So here I am.

599
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:05,614
23rd July 1996, Tokyo
Defense Plea,
Ant-Subversive Hearing

600
00:49:05,649 --> 00:49:08,090
Z3th July 1996, Tokyo
Defense Plea,
Ant-Subversive Hearing

601
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,469
You wear this a lot recently.

602
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,650
Yes.

603
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:23,349
Is the suit you brought
today your own?

604
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:27,090
My only one. I brought it with me
from home when I entered Aum.

605
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,059
Just one?

606
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,949
Yep.

607
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,320
When did you use it?

608
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:37,900
University entrance ceremony. It's
the first and last suit I had made.

609
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,269
Did your parents order it for you?

610
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,380
That's right! You got it!

611
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,519
Araki, your shoes?

612
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,090
Maybe I can get some slippers.

613
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,619
You forgot your shoes?

614
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:07,590
I wasn't really thinking about it.

615
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:25,670
We're on a tight schedule, so
there'll be no individual questions

616
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,550
for the speakers.

617
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,750
They'll be giving speeches.

618
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,050
First, we'll hear from
Kaneko Toshiko.

619
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,820
Please step up.

620
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:59,139
Well, this is to say that,
the explanations from Aum are over now.

621
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:22,840
So there seems to be said that
Asahara instructed...

622
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:25,800
Whether it is true or...

623
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,960
79th June 1996, Tokyo
Kameido Headquarters

624
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:29,940
19th June 1996, Tokyo
Kameido Headquarters

625
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,309
It is written in the Bible
that each will go

626
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,949
before Christ to be judged

627
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,260
for the good or evil our
bodies have done

628
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:44,260
and to receive our due.

629
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,800
They've arrived.

630
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,150
Please step back.

631
00:52:19,329 --> 00:52:22,289
First, let's address the
transfer of leadership.

632
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,929
Who'll lead the order now?

633
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:28,030
His Excellency Akiteru Rinpochi and
His Excellency Ryokko Rinpochi.

634
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:28,929
Who're they?

635
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,840
The Master's, um, sons.

636
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,409
His first and second boys?

637
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:40,980
Yes.

638
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,889
So, your younger brothers?

639
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,219
You're the oldest girl,

640
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:46,820
Yes.

641
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:52,289
But the leadership passes onto
your younger brothers.

642
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,019
Yes.

643
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:57,559
The first through fourth children
are girls, and the fifth and sixth...

644
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,139
Please don't discuss our
private affairs.

645
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,170
Even if you know them. You mustn't.

646
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:09,639
You're not revealing any ages either.

647
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:12,340
I don't want my age known.

648
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:19,079
Are you representing Aum in
some way?

649
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,210
No, I'm not.

650
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:23,679
Is there a position inside Aum
that you are filling?

651
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,800
We all help the order.

652
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:33,460
But especially Their Excellencies.
As their older sister.

653
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,340
She's been by her brothers' side,
supporting them

654
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:41,800
I mean... well, it's natural but...

655
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,150
Not just that, I'm here to

656
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:49,380
strengthen the Aum position.

657
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,050
What do you mean?

658
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,480
That's right. For one of us

659
00:53:55,929 --> 00:54:01,230
to appear outside, that shows
you how serious we are.

660
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,489
With the change in leader, you'll
need to change your training.

661
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:09,599
I assume you'll want to.

662
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,239
No, not true.

663
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,670
There is a tradition of teachings.

664
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:17,980
By that, we mean they are passed down
naturally from generation to generation.

665
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:26,619
So if you deny the teachings,
there will be nothing afterwards.

666
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,289
So you haven't denied them?

667
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:33,619
We haven't rejected the teachings, but
there were some misunderstandings

668
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:39,699
so, concerning our doctrine, we
have. Um mm, been, well...

669
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,170
So you don't deny them, but
some need to be revised?

670
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,429
If we don't, you'll keep finding fault.

671
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,739
We're not "finding fault". During the
trial, some believers say they were

672
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,940
acting according to the teachings.
That's how we heard it.

673
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,090
How much are you changing?
You'll change the posters, and?

674
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,090
The tradition of teachings won't change.

675
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,760
But this poster is related to that
tradition, isn't it?

676
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,409
Related, meaning it's a question of
whom you devote yourself to.

677
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,840
It sounds like you don't understand
the structure of religion.

678
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:23,780
No one does, so...

679
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,139
sharp. Sharp.

680
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,579
Sharp, really sharp.

681
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,050
Standing firm...

682
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:41,329
We want to discuss three points
in this Dress conference.

683
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:48,230
First on the transfer of leadership.
Then...

684
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,570
A little more...

685
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,840
It's a secret.

686
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:03,469
7th August 1996
Kameido Headquarters

687
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,949
They look like regular children to me.

688
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,329
Trying their best to say something
by heart.

689
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:13,989
No. You're wrong.

690
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,199
At first glance,
they may look like that.

691
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:21,369
But, when I concentrate and listen,

692
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,639
even now my mind gets this
cold feeling.

693
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,929
Because you put this tape on.

694
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,110
Well, it started feeling cool
a little earlier.

695
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,809
What do you mean "cool"?

696
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:38,449
This energy enters...

697
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,920
Your mind?

698
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:41,449
No not my mind.

699
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:45,150
Because you're watching this video?

700
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,159
You have a long way to go.

701
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,969
The photos are too small.

702
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:06,239
Have you met them?

703
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:09,710
No I haven't, but I'd really
like to.

704
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:14,420
Till now, it's been the Master
who listened to my worries.

705
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:18,559
The Master's message was always
intense,

706
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,900
but I really like the children, too.
Their Excellencies the Rinpochi.

707
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,300
Each company can send 5 people

708
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,900
That's for TV.

709
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:33,760
Newspapers and magazines can
send 2 each.

710
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,150
And let me know if Osada shows up.

711
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:39,239
I did see Nihon TV's relay van.

712
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:40,969
The director called.

713
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,050
He's coming?

714
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,809
Those Nihon TV guys!

715
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,159
Shooting from the hilt!

716
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:52,130
Really?

717
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,369
That's their business, isn't it.

718
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,909
They've got to sell their papers,
and get their shows watched.

719
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,750
I guess it really can't be helped.

720
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,010
There'll be time for questions later?

721
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,880
We expect so.

722
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,679
Expect so? That's no good.

723
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,050
I'll check.

724
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,460
No one can report just this stuff.

725
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,750
As Aum believers, we have become

726
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,559
the subject of these events, and would
like the chance to express our ideas.

727
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,400
How long was that today?

728
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:37,289
Boy, today was long.

729
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,559
The questions didn't stop coming.

730
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,800
Such dreary questions too.

731
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:47,280
If told we put sarin in the wells,
they'd believe it and be terrified.

732
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,050
Or that rumor about Ecoli germs.

733
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,949
Jokes aside, I think there's a real
danger of us being demonized.

734
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:03,050
Starting with the hijacking...

735
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:59,610
Dad will understand your love
some day

736
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:18,139
let me hold
your shaking back shoulder

737
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:28,539
Good night good night baby,
suppressing your tears

738
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:39,059
Go to bed in silence tonight,
good night

739
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:51,199
Good night good night baby,
suppressing your tears

740
01:00:52,650 --> 01:01:01,750
Have a dream of happy tomorrow,
good night

741
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:21,869
Nobody will take away this
finally found happiness

742
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,329
It is for you and me

743
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:43,449
Let me wipe
your tear-wet cold cheeks

744
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,719
I'm saying that your group is
under suspicion.

745
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,960
You can't just claim that.

746
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:55,159
What? You forgot about the trial?
I know you're in the cult.

747
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,769
What's it got to do with you?

748
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:01,710
Since you're in the cult, I want
your name.

749
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,210
Why do I have to tell you?

750
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,750
Everyone in the cult better give
me their name.

751
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,139
I don't have to.

752
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,260
If you don't, you'll look suspicious.

753
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,380
That's entirely arbitrary.

754
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:15,719
See, you're acting suspicious.

755
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,800
Everyone here will vouch for me.

756
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,359
Get out of the way.

757
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:18,719
Get out of the way.

758
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,800
I'm not in the way.

759
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,980
Move away.

760
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,929
My friend's being detained.

761
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:28,070
Speak up. Why can't you tell me?

762
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,860
You're ashamed of something.

763
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,400
What is it?

764
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:39,110
You've something to hide?
What is it? Tell me.

765
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:46,679
Got a warrant?

766
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:47,909
No. It's voluntary.

767
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,920
The publics got to know
what you've done.

768
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:00,590
Why won't you tell us? You're
up to something, aren't you?

769
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:06,300
Are you trying to hide something?

770
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,199
Are you trying to hide something?

771
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,739
Don't push me. Don't push me.

772
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,019
Hold it...

773
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,510
What's your name?

774
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,800
That hurts. Ahh. It hurts.

775
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:37,789
You okay?

776
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:38,840
You alright?

777
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,480
The cop was dragged. Pushed.

778
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:54,179
You can't treat police like that.

779
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,449
You were being questioned.

780
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,519
Obstructing the police.

781
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,179
Obstructing the police.

782
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,730
This guy tried to run.

783
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:05,719
Then he dragged our guy down.

784
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:11,269
He ran for it when we were
questioning him.

785
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:20,250
Tripped up an agent when he
was under question.

786
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:25,010
6:35 PM. Arrested for
obstructing the police.

787
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:30,250
I saw it all.

788
01:04:31,269 --> 01:04:34,670
He's the one who dragged me.

789
01:04:34,869 --> 01:04:36,989
I saw it all. I saw it all.

790
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:40,530
Stop performing. It's a dirty trick.

791
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,610
Stop this now. Shame on you.

792
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,639
Cut it out, Mr. Araki.

793
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,610
You guys are lying.

794
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:57,079
No one's lying!
How dare you say that

795
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,809
Should you being saying that?

796
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:00,860
Yes. I should!

797
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,190
You're at fault.

798
01:05:03,429 --> 01:05:04,119
You're at fault.

799
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:05,289
He's been hurt.

800
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:05,719
You're full of lies.

801
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,860
A policeman's hurt. Show respect.

802
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,929
You work for the PR Dept., and
you dare say that.

803
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:14,630
I can't believe you're an official.

804
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,130
I'm telling the truth.

805
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:17,500
That's no truth.

806
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,739
Are you OK?

807
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:28,179
We don't know who you are. We
need your name. Without a name,

808
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,920
you can't get treated at the hospital.

809
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:35,760
Stop being so rough.

810
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:38,260
Don't worry. He's totally conscious.

811
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:39,760
Please stop that.

812
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,630
Get his pulse, his pulse.

813
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:47,400
While the ambulance is on its way,
we're just checking his pulse

814
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:51,769
Checking to see if he's all right.

815
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:54,329
Please calm down.

816
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:11,519
Step back. This is an investigation.
Back off. Please step back.

817
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:12,920
Hey you, who are you?

818
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,889
Mori. My name's Mori.

819
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:19,940
I don't care what you call freedom of
the Dress. You've been filming all along.

820
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:29,139
Good night good night baby,
suppressing your tears

821
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:39,889
Go to bed in silence tonight,
good night

822
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:50,360
Good night good night baby,
suppressing your tears

823
01:06:53,110 --> 01:07:01,980
Have a dream of happy tomorrow,
good night

824
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,860
Can't believe this.

825
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,500
I have three questions for you.

826
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:28,599
How much longer will you be here?

827
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:29,570
Till the end of the month.

828
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:32,099
Then you'll all leave?

829
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,960
That's right.

830
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,050
I don't care how you live your
lives. But we're all human.

831
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:45,019
It's OK to be religious, but
using the name Aum, really...

832
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,090
We are human indeed.

833
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,159
We all have blood in our veins.

834
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:51,820
We feel exactly the same. Really.

835
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,329
Seeing what happened today, I don't
think you can be a mediator.

836
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,460
And if you can't. Mr. Araki,

837
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,170
then, you should go live a normal

838
01:08:03,409 --> 01:08:08,710
life and find a proper job.

839
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,969
Find a regular place and work hard.

840
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,279
I can understand how unnerving
it is to see a disturbance

841
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,819
like this. But if you'd seen it from the
beginning. You'd understand.

842
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,899
If I'd done that, I'd want
to sock you one.

843
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:30,170
Become a businessman,
join a company.

844
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:34,630
Doesn't have to be a big place.
Sweat a bit, 'n work hard.

845
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:37,840
Bright guys like you don't
need to do this.

846
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,270
If you're smart, what should you do?

847
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:45,000
Become a boss, take charge of people.

848
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,310
I do try working as a missionary.

849
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:51,189
But, some of my friends
are really in a bind.

850
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:56,909
Never had and never will have anything
to do with the bad Dart of Aum.

851
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:02,529
It's like black and white. Aum is
black, and if you add that to white...

852
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:05,529
You guys are all black! Black can
never become white.

853
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:10,729
If you put it through a filter, it can.
That's our duty. What we have to do.

854
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,470
You're a "filter"?

855
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,270
That's right.

856
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:15,199
Your whole life as a "filter"?

857
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,510
I have to be.

858
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:18,590
What's your given name?

859
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:19,770
TA-TSU-YA.

860
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:21,289
Who?

861
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,890
I'm asking this man his name.

862
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,050
Yasuoka Takaharu.

863
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,050
How do you write "Takaharu"?

864
01:09:29,229 --> 01:09:32,989
The "taku" of Ding-Dong, the "haru"
of "security".

865
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,159
Okay. I see.

866
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:50,880
I'm calling about Yamamoto. Has he
been released yet?

867
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,439
He was arrested today.

868
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:59,189
He's being prosecuted tomorrow?

869
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:04,460
So. He's being prosecuted?

870
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,729
The first thing is stop him being
charged.

871
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:14,600
If there are any Darts on tape that'd
be good, we'd like to use them.

872
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,810
I don't think I can do that.

873
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,180
We can't do that. We can't show you

874
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,439
...I mean... give you the tape.

875
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:32,109
We're deciding how to react; I'll let
you know what we decide.

876
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:33,850
We should act before

877
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:40,899
the police take advantage of
the situation.

878
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,729
It's the same old pattern; hit, then

879
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:48,340
knocked down, then arrested for
obstruction while the cop grabs his leg.

880
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:53,140
I don't want to be useful to the police
nor to Aum. I'm totally neutral.

881
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,340
I need to confirm things for myself.

882
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,140
But can we say there's a tape?

883
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:02,649
Tell them there's a witness who has
proof. They'll remember.

884
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,050
Good point.

885
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,159
There was a third party with us,

886
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:16,590
a witness with convincing proof
of what happened.

887
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,140
And that we will be relying on.

888
01:11:19,369 --> 01:11:23,560
Given the inappropriate nature

889
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:29,409
of what happened, we're requesting

890
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:33,750
you to process his release quickly.

891
01:11:34,819 --> 01:11:37,284
9th August 1996
Two days later,
Kamikuishiki-mura

892
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:39,750
9th August 1996
Two days later,
Kamikuishiki-mura

893
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:20,619
You said I could have some time.

894
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:22,029
Did you figure out when?

895
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:25,130
Can we do this later?

896
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:19,520
It's 10:01 AM on the 12th.

897
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,649
This is the Criminal Division of the
Joto Police Station. We're calling

898
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:31,399
to speak with you about the video

899
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:37,770
of the incident in Kameido the
other day between an Aum member

900
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:44,284
and a policeman.
We'll call again later.

901
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,180
14th August 1996
A week after the incident, Tokyo

902
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:50,949
About the cameraman, the police.

903
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:55,409
Well, this really was a set-up.

904
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,000
Using a one-page leaflet, we could

905
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,960
link up to local citizen groups and
groups opposing the status quo.

906
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:09,029
We're not intimidated by the police, and
we are doing good work individually, but

907
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:12,770
the authorities get away with more
and more these days...

908
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:18,779
The prosecutor is debating whether
to Dress charges or not.

909
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:24,510
Of course, we want to convince him
not to.

910
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:29,449
We and our lawyer want to negotiate
with the prosecutor.

911
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:39,235
This is where the video comes in.

912
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,890
In Japan, once indicted, you have a
99.8% chance of being found guilty.

913
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:44,600
After being indicted, you've got little
chance.

914
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:45,739
If you're charged, it's all over.

915
01:14:45,909 --> 01:14:46,699
Basically.

916
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,479
And, in his case, the earlier incident
means no suspended sentence.

917
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:56,949
In media, there's one principle - to
provide the public with information

918
01:14:57,189 --> 01:15:03,449
And prevent it being used for
ulterior purposes.

919
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:07,619
That's our first resolve.

920
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,300
I know the truth. If I conceal it now,
an innocent person

921
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:16,369
might go to jail on false charges.

922
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:20,770
Can I ignore this under the pretense
of making a film?

923
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,680
I thought a lot about this, and I still
am thinking.

924
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:28,810
As Yasuoka told you,
our decision is this;

925
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,859
We'll provide your lawyer with the tape.

926
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:34,890
I'm the lawyer.

927
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:36,859
My name's Mori.

928
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:40,770
I can understand your position.

929
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:45,359
I'll only use it in relation to the
court case.

930
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,699
Thank you very much.

931
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:55,810
It's possible he'll be released before
the trial two days from now

932
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:59,609
if they accept this as proof.

933
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:04,859
Thank you for your help.

934
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:09,619
During questioning, the prosecutor
said a video had arrived.

935
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,619
Then. He left, and I was led back.

936
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:19,229
But ten or fifteen minutes later, he
rushed me up and released me.

937
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:25,899
16th August 1996, Kumamoto-ken
Night before turning
Over the temple

938
01:16:37,689 --> 01:16:40,619
There's stranger stuff over there.

939
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,319
They were making pipes.
This is the best Dart.

940
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,159
On! Y special personnel allowed!

941
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,170
This is pretty good too.

942
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:06,869
They did the cultures here.

943
01:17:10,689 --> 01:17:11,449
Really.

944
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:16,550
It's got a fan and all. They must've
been doing something here.

945
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,960
A duct.

946
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,029
Maybe a culture room.

947
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,359
Needles, right?

948
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:33,170
Horse needles.

949
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:39,520
Who knows if they used them
on horses? What's this water.

950
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:43,939
Dunno.

951
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,729
Smell it? Maybe it's alcohol.

952
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:49,979
What if it were sarin.

953
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:52,250
Stop it.

954
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,460
The police checked it.

955
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,720
That's right.

956
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:00,899
Whose room was this?

957
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:02,630
Murai.

958
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:06,000
His memo books are here.

959
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:07,199
His memo books.

960
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,680
Please call me_
Murai

961
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,890
"The advance of science and
the change in world view"

962
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:35,689
The following morning, 8:30 AM

963
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:51,850
20 dogs are taken away, 10:00 AM

964
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:14,140
That religion, Aum. And its followers.

965
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:20,180
Their way of thinking about things
is out of whack.

966
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:26,020
The lot of them don't produce a
thing. Not a help for us.

967
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:27,550
Your given name?

968
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,560
Hi-ro-shi.

969
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,520
Your title?

970
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,220
Deputy Spokesperson.

971
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:37,800
And your age?

972
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:46,399
The bankruptcy trustee arrives, 7:20 PM

973
01:19:59,689 --> 01:20:01,850
Let's shake.

974
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,930
Araki

975
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:34,760
Thanks for your advice.

976
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:36,020
Likewise.

977
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:38,890
Take care.

978
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:50,000
What did you say?

979
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:54,670
I couldn't hear.

980
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:56,810
That it's the end.

981
01:20:57,590 --> 01:21:00,279
And let's return to society.

982
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,939
I think that's it.

983
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,420
Who spoke first?

984
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,210
I did.

985
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,949
What did he respond?

986
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:09,109
That we learned from each other.

987
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:12,890
Maybe I said "each other".

988
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:25,729
30th August 1996
Giving up
Kameido Headquarters

989
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:37,720
Turning over the Aum Bldg. To the
Bankruptcy Trustee 8/30

990
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,680
Someone's up there.

991
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:45,260
The trustees, right?

992
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:52,899
Is it your first time inside?

993
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:54,829
Yes. First time.

994
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:04,369
You're all from the
neighborhood group.

995
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,550
Yes, that's so.

996
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:09,180
What do you think?

997
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:10,939
Really filthy!

998
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,399
Are there more?

999
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:22,159
This is it.

1000
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:34,569
Can our guards go? You ready?

1001
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,149
Please let us through.

1002
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:54,619
We affirm there'll be no
disagreement

1003
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:58,899
with however the trustees
choose to dispose of it.

1004
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:03,270
What are the Guru's teachings?

1005
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,210
Everyone. Hurry up.

1006
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:24,470
Kamei.

1007
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:32,600
With everyone slowly leaving. I wish

1008
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:38,970
you'd all call your families just
to say you're okay.

1009
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:43,510
It only takes a second to say,
"I'm training"

1010
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,649
"and I'm doing fine. Bye."

1011
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,220
We do that.

1012
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:51,409
Your parents call desperate...

1013
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,850
"I'm doing okay, take care of
yourselves."

1014
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,560
That's all it takes.
Whenever you've a chance.

1015
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,130
That's all it takes.

1016
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,430
I'll make a point of mentioning it.

1017
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:05,029
I'm asking you formally, okay?

1018
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:08,170
In some cases, they'll be glad

1019
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:11,760
just to know you're alive.

1020
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:16,510
He's a good, quiet kid.

1021
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:21,479
I know his mother, and I'd like
to believe anyone raised

1022
01:24:21,819 --> 01:24:23,909
by a mother like that must be okay.

1023
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,079
So. I'm asking you, okay.

1024
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:26,350
I understand.

1025
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,250
Take care now.

1026
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:31,890
I know your mother.

1027
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,829
I met her before.

1028
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:36,930
Really?

1029
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:45,500
Let's just say I really understand
your sense of responsibility.

1030
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:48,199
Convince her of that.

1031
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,649
Tough to be responsible.

1032
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:02,460
This'll do for the time being.

1033
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,430
We'll learn from our experience

1034
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,069
and do our best.

1035
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,279
If you're the spokesperson, then

1036
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:29,880
explain what the cult was
doing spreading anthrax!

1037
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:37,949
The police aren't investigating that.

1038
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,720
That's not the point.

1039
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:43,659
We want something from you.

1040
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:49,180
Nothings in the open yet.
I want the facts, too.

1041
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,399
You're being too
matter-of-fact, Mr. Araki

1042
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:57,109
That smell made people
suffer for real.

1043
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,539
I don't know if that was anthrax.

1044
01:25:59,689 --> 01:26:02,279
I'm not talking about anthrax.

1045
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:07,380
Your chemicals hurt people.

1046
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:11,989
I want to hear at least an apology
for making people suffer.

1047
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:17,590
I don't know if it was poison or not,
but that's what they say.

1048
01:26:18,369 --> 01:26:21,300
Get out. You bastard.

1049
01:26:23,609 --> 01:26:29,069
I heard that you were going to give
a response today. I was looking

1050
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:32,210
forward to finally getting a proper

1051
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:35,970
explanation from the Aum side.

1052
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:40,109
But, this is what we get. I'm really
disappointed.

1053
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:43,279
But I'd like an explanation too.

1054
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:48,560
Causing trouble like this,
putting us out like this.

1055
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:52,390
If you can't even apologize for
causing so much trouble.

1056
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:55,989
But I did apologize.

1057
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:30,840
It was really horrible having Aum
here. Their leaving changes that.

1058
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:41,039
Next month, the members will
evacuate the remaining facilities.

1059
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,550
This is Araki from Aum
Shinrikyo again.

1060
01:27:43,689 --> 01:27:47,819
I'm calling for Producer Morimoto.

1061
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,420
Still in a meeting?

1062
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,689
What did you eat last night?
Last night's dinner?

1063
01:28:02,109 --> 01:28:06,909
Last night was... last night
was white rice.

1064
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:08,710
All by itself?

1065
01:28:09,979 --> 01:28:12,939
Curry pilaf that's easy to make!

1066
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:16,779
Put rice on curry paste,
then stir. Voila.

1067
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:22,289
Araki, what did you have today?

1068
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,420
Or, haven't you eaten yet?

1069
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:29,890
I've got important work to do.

1070
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:32,260
And when you finish.

1071
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,890
Same stuff.

1072
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,100
Almost never changes.

1073
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:41,310
Today. Tomorrow, the day after...

1074
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,039
Which part is karma? All of it?

1075
01:28:44,189 --> 01:28:46,750
You get the pus out of your system.

1076
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:49,409
Impurity is discharged.

1077
01:28:50,989 --> 01:28:53,220
Sometimes over the whole body.

1078
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,819
Huh? That looks bad.

1079
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,560
Have you had this, Yamamoto?

1080
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,760
On my hands and feet.

1081
01:29:03,909 --> 01:29:07,840
I still have a scar. Where was it?

1082
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:12,640
See here.

1083
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,569
Looks scarred.

1084
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,050
No, this one's from my motorbike.

1085
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:23,619
I've called many times already, but
I'm trying to reach Producer Morimoto.

1086
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,090
Has his meeting ended?

1087
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:30,319
I want to give him my opinion of
his broadcasts so far.

1088
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:34,300
I keep trying to reach him.

1089
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,119
Could you give me your name?

1090
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:47,970
You can't give me your name?
What kind of company are you!

1091
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:54,180
I've been told before that he never
got a message from me.

1092
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:58,449
So I want to be able to say who took
the message.

1093
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:10,390
Personal? It's not personal! I'm asking
you as an employee of the company.

1094
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,640
They're avoiding you.

1095
01:30:18,609 --> 01:30:21,010
Could you give me your name?

1096
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:26,609
I've been forbidden by the company
to give out my name.

1097
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,659
You can't give me your name?
What kind of company are you!

1098
01:30:30,789 --> 01:30:32,409
I'm very sorry.

1099
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:38,189
I've been told before that he never
got a message from me.

1100
01:30:38,329 --> 01:30:41,890
So I want to be able to say who took
the message.

1101
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:48,270
I understand, but I've been told not
to give out personal information.

1102
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:53,470
Personal? It's not personal? I'm asking
you as an employee of the company.

1103
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:59,489
I can't give you my name. I've been told
by the company not to give it out.

1104
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:04,680
"Sunday" Producer, Mr. Morimoto

"since you don't have an adequate
understanding of Aum, I propose... _"

12th October 1996

1107
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:19,260
12th October 1996
Before turning over
Fuiijomiya Headquarters

1108
01:31:19,409 --> 01:31:25,369
Crimes on your hands, Aum, Get out!
Members. Wake up and Seek Reality!

01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,579
Yes. Thank goodness.

1112
01:32:07,289 --> 01:32:08,880
The karma left?

1113
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,310
Maybe just part of it.

1114
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:16,130
I thought it would take longer.

1115
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,600
Well, compared with before it came out,
before it got bad,

1116
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:25,800
does it feel any different?

1117
01:32:25,939 --> 01:32:29,029
My body feels lighter. That feeling

1118
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:33,430
that was Dulling me down has gone.

1119
01:32:34,579 --> 01:32:37,039
It looks to me...

1120
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:41,050
like a bad case of athlete's foot.

1121
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:42,949
Athlete's foot?

1122
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:46,750
Maybe. I don't know, some kind of
skin disease.

1123
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:52,159
Well, that may be so. But whether it's
an injury, or artificial, or something

1124
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,229
totally accidental, or a disease,
it's a concentration

1125
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:58,960
in one part of the body.

1126
01:32:59,109 --> 01:33:05,010
All together, you can see it as karma
that gets liberated.

1127
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:07,729
Can I come up?

1128
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:08,899
Yes.

1129
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,300
I convert!

1130
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:20,579
Master, Master, Master

1131
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:28,250
Reject sleep

1132
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:31,560
Reject Lust. Reject Food

1133
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:50,170
Sunday, Sept. 1996
thanks, friends

1134
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:56,619
I want you to look at us closely.

1135
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,750
I want you to record us.

1136
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:02,909
We don't have a tradition
of recording things.

1137
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:10,960
Even if we did, people would see
it differently, because we made it.

1138
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:13,369
I want ordinary people,

1139
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:21,380
people who can understand, to
see what they can see,

1140
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:26,239
to hear what they can hear.

1141
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:29,680
Do you think I can see?

1142
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:33,149
...Well...

1143
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:48,760
10th November 1996
Sendagaya, Tokyo

1144
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,180
Good morning.

1145
01:35:57,319 --> 01:35:58,979
Come on in.

1146
01:36:14,069 --> 01:36:15,619
Morning!

1147
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:23,470
Sorry it's so cramped and messy.

1148
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:27,010
So this is the main "hideout".

1149
01:36:27,149 --> 01:36:27,840
Hideout #1.

1150
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,350
Where you supposedly plot
your strategies.

1151
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:31,609
Hmm.

1152
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:34,289
And you're the radical right-winger!

1153
01:36:34,489 --> 01:36:36,180
Why make me a right-winger?

1154
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:37,840
You're the central protagonist.

1155
01:36:37,989 --> 01:36:38,949
No thank you.

1156
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:39,449
Who then?

1157
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,119
PR Dept. Chief Araki!

1158
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:19,520
Asahara shouldn't
kill insects either. Right?

1159
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:22,260
Well. That point is...

1160
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:27,569
that's a difficult one.

1161
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:30,199
It can't be explained quite so
simply.

1162
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:36,210
Basically, the destruction of
life is not allowed.

1163
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,039
Basically? Are there exceptions?

1164
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:44,619
No exceptions. It's just difficult
to put that in words.

1165
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:55,050
Going back to Kamiku today?

1166
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:58,819
I'll stop somewhere on the way.

1167
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:01,060
Are you being followed?

1168
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:03,109
Yep.

1169
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,539
I n a car?

1170
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:11,550
The police switch at the prefecture line.

1171
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:18,079
It's my first time not to see you in
robes. Is this your regular wear?

1172
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:23,420
I was meeting a regular person.

1173
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:29,100
"Regular"?
- So-called "regular".

1174
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:39,630
People like Inoue and Hayashi
have testified to the fact.

1175
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:45,520
But, I can't really say for sure.

1176
01:38:45,789 --> 01:38:53,060
All I can say is that it might have
happened.

1177
01:38:53,199 --> 01:39:01,500
When you read Hayashis
testimony, it's really detailed.

1178
01:39:02,439 --> 01:39:08,170
Like what he testified at the trial,
about using the umbrella.

1179
01:39:08,739 --> 01:39:17,300
I just think to myself
did he really do that.

1180
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:23,550
Part of me thinks that way.
I can't understand it all.

1181
01:39:24,329 --> 01:39:28,729
Human society is so contradictory.
Like all the murder of war.

1182
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:34,689
In war, there's no blame
for killing if you win.

1183
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:40,710
But that doesn't change the
fact of all those deaths.

1184
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:44,739
But no one raises the criminality
of that.

1185
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,039
There are so many hypocrisies.

1186
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:53,310
I've always wondered about
these questions

1187
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,079
Like is there really a world higher
than our human one,

1188
01:39:57,229 --> 01:40:00,819
These are religious questions
I've always had.

1189
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,449
And I've wondered who can
really answer them.

1190
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:11,729
Now these are questions I've
had since I was little

1191
01:40:11,869 --> 01:40:17,130
but the only one who could convincingly
answer those questions

1192
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:19,069
was the Master.

1193
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:27,140
So the things I learned, the teachings,
and the things I experienced -

1194
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:31,390
The secular world calls it mind
control...

1195
01:40:31,829 --> 01:40:36,020
These experiences, these things
I underwent,

1196
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:39,600
even with Inoue's and Hayashis
testimony,

1197
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:46,829
those deeper Darts in me, it's like they
haven't been touched at all.

1198
01:40:47,409 --> 01:40:51,310
There's this unshakable part inside
of me.

1199
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:02,579
17th November 1996
Hitotsubashi University

1200
01:41:03,529 --> 01:41:08,590
How often did you meet Asahara?

1201
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:15,829
While in Kyoto, I met him 5-6 times
over a year and a half.

1202
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:22,300
After entering the order, I began to
see him regularly.

1203
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:30,810
In Japan, you don't see people
choosing to adhere to values that

1204
01:41:30,989 --> 01:41:37,324
others find absurd, or creating unique
lifestyles like Aum has done.

1205
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:42,289
(Masa'aki Hukuda, Professor of law, Hitotsubashi University)
This is a good chance for you all
to review your own values.

1206
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:49,840
We'll start the Q&A with Mr. Araki,
with that in mind.

1207
01:41:50,369 --> 01:41:53,029
Would anyone like to start?

1208
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:59,630
I'm happy to be alive, and think
that can be a kind of philosophy.

1209
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,329
Wanting to be liberated,

1210
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:07,039
isn't that also a worldly desire?

1211
01:42:07,159 --> 01:42:10,279
They say Asahara eats like a cow.

1212
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:14,819
Had kids and even lovers too.

1213
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:19,689
I know it's a caricature, but

1214
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:22,960
it's true he has children.

1215
01:42:23,609 --> 01:42:28,439
He rides in a Mercedes and even
has a helicopter!

1216
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:33,659
Talk about worldly desires!

1217
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,869
The general attitude condemns

1218
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:43,470
Aum for not apologizing or paying
for its brutal crimes.

1219
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:49,319
After the guilty verdict, don't
you think that you should respond?

1220
01:42:49,529 --> 01:42:55,189
Or can you continue to claim that
you have nothing to do with it?

1221
01:42:55,369 --> 01:43:00,699
That you were not the perpetrators,
and continue to ignore the case?

1222
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:04,039
You walk kind of sadly.

1223
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,279
You're walking with downcast eyes.

1224
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,479
Would you like some hot water?

1225
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:18,149
No thanks.

1226
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:24,189
How about apple? Apples grow,
but you can eat them, right?

1227
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:29,329
It doesn't become a tree, right?

1228
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,329
The seed might sprout and grow.

1229
01:43:33,539 --> 01:43:35,060
The seeds...

1230
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:37,970
Do you have restriction on food?

1231
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,609
Yes.

1232
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:39,500
Who took these photos?

1233
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,609
I did.

1234
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:42,500
How come?

1235
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,350
Well, when I was in Kamikuishiki-mura.

1236
01:43:47,159 --> 01:43:53,859
I think the Japanese society
will face much trouble

1237
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:57,250
if the Anti-Subversives Law
goes into effect.

1238
01:43:57,369 --> 01:44:01,699
People will lose freedom of speech
and freedom of belief.

1239
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:07,029
"What is most unforgivable of
Aum members is that."

1240
01:44:07,779 --> 01:44:13,180
"They do not take joint responsibility
for the numerous crimes."

1241
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:17,939
"Continued existence of this injudicious"

1242
01:44:18,189 --> 01:44:23,779
"will allow similar vicious crimes
to follow in time to come."

1243
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:28,079
"They are not human
but aliens with human faces."

1244
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:31,619
"They are the shame
of Japanese people." Wow...

1245
01:44:33,699 --> 01:44:37,289
"It's out of the question
to even discuss human rights"

1246
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:39,300
"for a homicide-committing group."

1247
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,430
"They would have been all beheaded
if in ancient times."

1248
01:44:42,579 --> 01:44:46,439
"They can possibly appear at any time,"

1249
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:48,170
"but our apartment has
5 entryway from"

1250
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:49,909
"where visitors can freely
come in and out..."

1251
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:52,010
They call us 'injudicious group".

1252
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:53,979
Right. Such expressions are used too.

1253
01:44:54,159 --> 01:45:00,319
I have no idea why they can say
"not human but aliens with human face".

1254
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:03,920
Crime?

1255
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:05,159
Sa-ba-ki

1256
01:45:05,329 --> 01:45:06,189
I see.

1257
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:11,890
Once you are in the order,
husband and wife don't live together?

1258
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:13,430
No, they don't.

1259
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,470
They all live apart.

1260
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:22,149
So that means no offspring?

1261
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:23,579
Basically no.

1262
01:45:29,859 --> 01:45:32,850
Do you train to lose sex drive?

1263
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:35,250
Training to lose sex drive.

1264
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:36,720
What's that?

1265
01:45:36,899 --> 01:45:37,520
Is there such a thing?

1266
01:45:37,699 --> 01:45:39,750
Yes. I heard of it.

1267
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,430
It might be joy meditation.

1268
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:44,529
I haven't been instructed yet.

1269
01:45:44,739 --> 01:45:46,760
What do you mean?

1270
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:48,369
It's only for those who need it.

1271
01:45:48,539 --> 01:45:51,100
You mean you don't need it.

1272
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:52,439
I guess so.

1273
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:55,899
It's only for with strong sex drive.

1274
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:58,270
So you don't have much.

1275
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:00,609
First. There is the Universe.

1276
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:07,060
Then Heaven, Arsira, Human, Animal,
Hungry Ghost, and Hell.

1277
01:46:07,229 --> 01:46:08,520
This is our structure in Buddhism.

1278
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:14,029
Even gods in Heaven have many levels,

1279
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:22,670
and human spirit is not so superior
compared with the Universe.

1280
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,810
However, you can flee from human sin

1281
01:46:27,979 --> 01:46:30,210
and weave your way
up to higher stages,

1282
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:32,909
then. You will be happier.

1283
01:46:33,789 --> 01:46:36,220
This can be said from our world view.

1284
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:44,550
I'm not interested in having a talk

1285
01:46:47,569 --> 01:46:57,130
with a woman
regarding her as a woman.

1286
01:46:57,850 --> 01:47:01,579
I felt out of place
to regard women as feminine beings.

1287
01:47:01,779 --> 01:47:05,579
I must say that I was
very uncomfortable to be with women.

1288
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:07,550
Have you held a girl's hand?

1289
01:47:21,899 --> 01:47:23,590
Well, just at playing
in kindergarten at most.

1290
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:25,590
Kiss?

1291
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:32,970
Don't remember.

1292
01:47:34,109 --> 01:47:35,869
Making love?

1293
01:47:37,449 --> 01:47:38,470
I'm sure never.

1294
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,195
26th November 1996
Sendagaya, Tokyo

1295
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:43,170
26th November 1996
Sendagaya, Tokyo

1296
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,989
Democracy is at Stake!

1297
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:55,859
It's unrealistic to expect
a verdict by year's end

1298
01:47:56,199 --> 01:47:57,289
at such short notice.

1299
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:01,489
Normally, you'd have hearings and
discussions. Only 2 weeks for that

1300
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:06,569
means they have their minds set on
using the Anti-Subversives Law.

1301
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:08,979
Thank you for coming today.

1302
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:12,350
As we've announced to the Dress,

1303
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,180
the Defense wants to show Aum in its
current state to Drove that this Law

1304
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:23,449
is no longer applicable to the group.

1305
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:38,439
Around l3 media crews, you think?

1306
01:48:38,649 --> 01:48:40,310
You mean newspapers?

1307
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:43,970
They're doing interviews. Too?

1308
01:48:44,289 --> 01:48:45,380
Questions, yes.

1309
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:46,640
Interviews on camera?

1310
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:47,909
Probably.

1311
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:50,119
Can they show your face?

1312
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:54,050
Ah. Well, preferably not.

1313
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,520
It'll look better if we're open.

1314
01:48:57,029 --> 01:49:00,119
Well, my folks back home...

1315
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,560
What about me. My family will
never take me back.

1316
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:10,970
It's a family affair, but my brother
just got married...

1317
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:17,279
Personally I wouldn't care.
Well. Maybe they can't tell.

1318
01:49:17,489 --> 01:49:18,250
It'll be OK.

1319
01:49:18,989 --> 01:49:20,079
You're safe even on the wanted list.

1320
01:49:20,289 --> 01:49:22,619
Maybe just a profile.

1321
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,479
They'll only recognize Araki

1322
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:36,720
So you want us upstairs.

1323
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:55,340
Here are again some documents on
the Anti-Subversives Law.

1324
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:58,079
They're filed up here.

1325
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:59,779
When did you join?

1326
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:04,229
About 2,3 months ago.

1327
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:09,550
Eggs and soy sauce.

1328
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,359
Kelp broth.

1329
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:16,460
In the police search...

1330
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:21,010
Lastly, let's take a look
at the first floor.

1331
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:25,739
Here, some shoes...

1332
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:31,189
This may be taken wrong, but

1333
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:36,789
in this kind of situation,
under siege, you know...

1334
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,420
Society used to be more
ambiguous for me...

1335
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:46,300
But now I've come to see
society more clearly...

1336
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:56,829
Uh, I mean, I can't explain
it well. But...

1337
01:50:57,149 --> 01:50:58,739
What about society?

1338
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:08,109
Well, ah, the hypocrisy, if you may...

1339
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:13,409
December 1996

1340
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:19,529
He's no 8uru, just a
madman to me now.

1341
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:24,369
As the chief perpetrator of the
Aum crimes.

1342
01:51:24,539 --> 01:51:26,869
He should get the death penalty.

1343
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:31,979
The 21st century will come,
not Armageddon.

1344
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:35,810
For those who still believe in Aum,

1345
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,449
and revere me as Holy Progeny.

1346
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:43,819
Listen to me and disband Aum.

1347
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,689
Don't try to fool the people!
The Aum cult is evil!

1348
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:52,760
They strangled the helpless
child and buried him!

1349
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:56,409
Asahara gave the orders!

1350
01:51:56,750 --> 01:52:00,510
Why defend Asahara and Aum?

1351
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,439
Shame! Leftist lawyers!

1352
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:09,180
Aum murdered your colleague Sakamoto
and his family!

1353
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,779
We demand the Anti-Subversives Law

1354
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:16,949
be applied to the devil cult Aum!

1355
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,399
So that this killer cult will never
again threaten Japan!

1356
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:28,829
Lover of Aum follower 'fesses up!

1357
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,670
Love and sex of a fugitive.

1358
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:41,609
Devil AUM

1359
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,970
Stop! The Anti-Subversives Law.

1360
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:03,439
Hunger strike taking place

1361
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:05,239
Araki!

1362
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:08,079
The police don't want it, so
have some tea.

1363
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:10,640
Let me take a photo.

1364
01:53:14,489 --> 01:53:17,319
We took print-club photos yesterday.

1365
01:53:17,659 --> 01:53:21,220
With this on.
Do you know print-clubs?

1366
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:25,789
Tiny photos made into stickers.

1367
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:28,449
We made them with Prof. Fukuda.

1368
01:53:29,539 --> 01:53:30,560
In Shibuya?

1369
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,359
Take care, Mr. Araki

1370
01:53:34,510 --> 01:53:35,560
We support you.

1371
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:37,640
You support him?

1372
01:53:38,409 --> 01:53:39,770
As an individual, sure.

1373
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:43,119
Not the Araki of Aum?

1374
01:53:43,479 --> 01:53:45,970
No, Araki Hiroshi himself.

1375
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,510
Is he happy for that?

1376
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:58,359
Can't show joy, can he?
Because it'll turn to sorrow.

1377
01:54:47,609 --> 01:54:49,770
NO TRESPASSING

1378
01:55:35,899 --> 01:55:37,890
The stink in there!

1379
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,529
Can't stand it!

1380
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:43,859
What's this?

1381
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,319
The engine is running.

1382
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:47,670
It isn't locked.

1383
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,000
It's already closed.

1384
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:56,340
I got a phone call yesterday.
They're worried about me.

1385
01:55:56,619 --> 01:55:57,239
Who? Your mother?

1386
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,970
Yes, my mother.

1387
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:05,039
She said there's still a lot of
antagonism against us.

1388
01:56:12,130 --> 01:56:14,420
"Take care." she said.

1389
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:20,329
"There are people who still
despise you."

1390
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:26,609
"Watch your health."

1391
01:56:29,779 --> 01:56:32,510
Or rather,
"Watch out for dark alleys."

1392
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:36,810
Can't she come with you?

1393
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:50,489
Court dismisses Aum
Ant-Subversives case

1394
01:56:55,439 --> 01:57:00,670
We welcome the dismissal of the
Commission with relief.

1395
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:04,979
Our faith has been safeguarded.

1396
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:19,390
It's over.

1397
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:22,529
Blood was shed.

1398
01:57:22,739 --> 01:57:26,899
And, there's no doubt
that Aum was involved.

1399
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:28,640
You mean Aum members?

1400
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:32,670
Yes. Members of the order.

1401
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,470
Right? You've seen the trials
and heard the witnesses.

1402
01:57:42,859 --> 01:57:48,659
There's no way they weren't
involved in some manner.

1403
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,029
What society is asking
from you now is

1404
01:57:52,229 --> 01:57:57,560
to react according to the norms and
rules of this world.

1405
01:57:57,739 --> 01:58:03,109
Follow the proper courtesies
regardless of your religion.

1406
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:06,869
You caused people trouble,
so apologize.

1407
01:58:08,579 --> 01:58:12,840
If you do have any opinion
about the crimes,

1408
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:18,239
society expects you to express
your position.

1409
01:58:25,399 --> 01:58:27,260
Well, yes, society. Uh...

1410
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:50,510
So in that situation, ah...

1411
01:59:09,979 --> 01:59:13,069
If we start admitting one thing -

1412
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:17,079
that would be like acknowledging

1413
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:24,710
all the images that society has
created about Aum.

1414
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:29,520
That Asahara's a swindler, and that
we're all brain-washed.

1415
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:39,500
I guess it's true what happened was
horrendous...

1416
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:47,529
But can I confirm anything else?

1417
01:59:55,890 --> 02:00:01,619
I'm the type who won't
fence-sit.

1418
02:00:08,039 --> 02:00:12,939
If they ask why we're still
in the order, I have no reply.

1419
02:00:14,539 --> 02:00:21,100
Delighted with the verdict, Aum
members hold a press conference.

1420
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:29,579
You think the issue would be solved
if I go home?

1421
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,079
You mean, leaving Aum?

1422
02:00:34,729 --> 02:00:37,819
If my mother's worried about me...

1423
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:46,819
Her biggest worry would be resolved.

1424
02:00:47,109 --> 02:00:51,739
But other concerns would emerge,
isn't that the course of things?

1425
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:53,199
It is.

1426
02:00:56,779 --> 02:01:00,939
Her next concern would be
getting you a wife or job.

1427
02:01:01,159 --> 02:01:04,390
There'll be all sorts of anxiety.

1428
02:01:05,729 --> 02:01:08,890
But would going home really...

1429
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:15,520
For a parent, anxiety exists
because of love.

1430
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:22,359
So it becomes the toughest thing to
sever, whatever the worries are.

1431
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:26,439
You've got to cut the tie
to end the suffering.

1432
02:01:26,649 --> 02:01:31,210
But for a parent, that's
the hardest thing.

1433
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:38,920
It's painful for
the family left behind.

1434
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:45,750
Even if you tell them to sever ties
in order to avoid suffering

1435
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:50,289
your parents will still live
another twenty, thirty years.

1436
02:01:50,869 --> 02:01:55,199
Their wounds won't heal in that time.

1437
02:01:57,149 --> 02:01:59,880
They'll die with the suffering.

1438
02:02:01,149 --> 02:02:04,510
Those left behind can't be redeemed.

1439
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:06,539
They can't break away.

1440
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:14,180
Spiritual suffering befalls those
who are left by the ordained.

1441
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,279
If we all could join the faith...

1442
02:02:21,899 --> 02:02:28,270
It' s an eternal theological
contradiction.

1443
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:33,270
Renouncing the world is impossible
without overcoming this hurdle.

1444
02:02:33,949 --> 02:02:35,739
Renunciation is impossible?

1445
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:03,800
Well, I'd like to leave all behind...

1446
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:08,260
But family does Dull me back...

1447
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:14,850
Where will you be in 30 years?

1448
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:28,090
30 years from now...

1449
02:03:30,439 --> 02:03:32,369
We'll be touching it out with
Armageddon...

1450
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:40,500
2 months later
Kyoto, 18th April 1997

1451
02:03:41,979 --> 02:03:46,670
Thank you for traveling
with us today.

1452
02:03:47,289 --> 02:03:50,119
We're now arriving at Kyoto.

1453
02:04:11,949 --> 02:04:15,810
AUM. GET OUT NOW.

1454
02:04:23,859 --> 02:04:27,720
Unity until we recover our
Peaceful housing block!

1455
02:04:37,909 --> 02:04:40,699
The Truth and lies of Aum!

1456
02:05:13,939 --> 02:05:15,659
His photo shouldn't be there.

1457
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:19,300
He shouldn't be worshiped?

1458
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:20,470
Right. He's not.

1459
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,380
People can see.

1460
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:30,949
But it doesn't make a difference.

1461
02:05:40,130 --> 02:05:44,319
Will the photo be discussed
in the eviction trial?

1462
02:05:44,539 --> 02:05:47,829
No, they're just denouncing
everything left and right.

1463
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:51,409
But it makes no difference in
this trial, does it?

1464
02:05:51,609 --> 02:05:52,439
You're right.

1465
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:55,010
Are we too nervous?

1466
02:06:09,130 --> 02:06:13,930
"Your Honor, I'm on the Anti-Aum
Residents' Committee."

1467
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:21,270
"I'd like to present a personal opinion
that will help the Court."

1468
02:06:22,039 --> 02:06:29,239
"The 5 Aum residents have forfeited
collective responsibility for their crimes."

1469
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:33,409
"The stupid cult remains in existence."

1470
02:06:33,819 --> 02:06:38,949
"Brutal crimes will again take place
in the near future."

1471
02:06:39,229 --> 02:06:44,420
"I. A true Japanese could not reside
alongside this barbarous cult."

1472
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:49,399
"If we let them stay, we will be
the laughing stock of the nation."

1473
02:06:49,569 --> 02:06:55,199
"2. By winning this trial, we will
avenge the bereaved and"

1474
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:59,970
"the many who perished at the
hands of the criminals."

1475
02:07:00,619 --> 02:07:01,710
"October l997."

1476
02:07:02,050 --> 02:07:06,539
This document has actually been
submitted

1477
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:11,149
to the court, through their attorneys.

1478
02:07:11,689 --> 02:07:16,520
Eviction Trial
Mr. Araki will join our struggle!

1479
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:22,619
Any changes in your outlook on society,
before and after doing Aum's PR?

1480
02:07:26,369 --> 02:07:31,170
I feel like renouncing the world
all over again.

1481
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:33,000
Leaving it behind.

1482
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:34,859
You do?

1483
02:07:36,449 --> 02:07:40,250
In a sense, in these 2 years after
entering the order

1484
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:45,810
I had to face the temporal world
more than ever before in my life.

1485
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:50,750
What of the temporal world?

1486
02:07:52,829 --> 02:07:54,590
What... hmm?

1487
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:07,510
When I met my mother in Tokyo once,
my grandma was supposed to come.

1488
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:13,840
She suddenly fell ill, and
couldn't visit anymore.

1489
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,909
Sick of worry?

1490
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:23,289
She's pretty old.
She has a heart condition.

1491
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:26,390
She doted on you?

1492
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:28,529
Well... I guess...

1493
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:44,199
Our karma is linked.

1494
02:08:44,949 --> 02:08:47,350
Is Tanba and Osaka on the same line?

1495
02:08:50,659 --> 02:08:51,680
Going to Tamba?

1496
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:54,090
I'm going to visit home.

1497
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:55,350
Who is?

1498
02:08:55,529 --> 02:08:56,289
I am.

1499
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:01,659
Tanba? But your parents are
in Takatsuki

1500
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:02,859
Grandma.

1501
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:04,229
Oh, your grandma.

1502
02:09:04,369 --> 02:09:05,729
She's dying.

1503
02:09:06,810 --> 02:09:07,789
Say what?

1504
02:09:10,779 --> 02:09:14,680
It's not that I hate my parents now.
I can explain that to her.

1505
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:19,949
Rather, I want to fulfill the life
that my parents gave me.

1506
02:09:21,989 --> 02:09:26,850
I'm here with Aum because I don't
want to die an imperfect existence.

1507
02:09:27,029 --> 02:09:32,159
I want to continue on this road.

1508
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:42,869

GET OUT!

ANTI-AUM COMMITTEE

1516
02:10:08,369 --> 02:10:11,329
Residents Meeting
7th Report on the Aum Trial

1517
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:18,710
I walk alone deep in a forest,
To discover myself

1518
02:10:19,949 --> 02:10:27,350
On a path that unfolds
With the scent of trees

1519
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:35,930
At times, I am lonely
Singing songs with the mountain birds

1520
02:10:36,859 --> 02:10:44,689
My 8uardton angel urges me on,
Telling me to sometimes stop my way

1521
02:11:03,319 --> 02:11:10,810
You mustn't give up
Aim for the M�suji Mountain

1522
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:19,350
And the cedars point
Strai8ht to the sky

1523
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:28,109
Down and to the left
The path leads back to my native land

1524
02:11:29,119 --> 02:11:36,649
Up and to the right
It opens onto a new departure

1525
02:12:12,989 --> 02:12:20,390
It's been fifteen years now
Since I turned my back on my hometown

1526
02:12:21,699 --> 02:12:29,029
My parents have left this world
I hear their voices echoing

1527
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:37,500
People put the peaks before them
And read the direction of the wind

1528
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:46,789
No one to teach me,
I decide myself

1529
02:13:04,909 --> 02:13:12,439
People put the peaks before them
And read the direction of the wind

1530
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:21,359
No one to teach me,
I decide myself

1531
02:13:22,359 --> 02:13:30,960
By yourself alone, you overcome
The road you take
