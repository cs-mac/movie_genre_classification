2
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,070
The Ministry of State has been informed and
they have not observed any irregularities.

3
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:59,799
- What do you suspect that he wants to do?
- We don't know yet.

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,885
- I need a list of everybody in the building.
- That's more than 300.

5
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,670
Everybody has been checked
and we have their IDs.

6
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,570
Any other entrances used by journalists,
maintenance or cleaning staff?

7
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,915
We're sure that everything
is under control.

8
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,050
Even though we only got a very
flimsy description of the suspect.

9
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:15,250
Excellent, can I see that list?

10
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,650
Sarah, I have just spoken
to my head office.

11
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,700
Nobody at SIS knew about the Prime
Minister's car being in Jutland that day,

12
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:23,120
or tearing a page out of the notebook.

13
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,705
- No, but somebody must have done it.
- Can I get that list now?

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,755
Sarah, we have not torn that page out.
Believe it.

15
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,850
- Everything still points to Ussing.
- Except that the kidnapper says it's not.

16
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,120
- Here is the list.
- How about surveillance?

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,815
I would like to see
recordings for the past hour.

18
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,120
Sure, but like I told you we have
observed and checked everybody.

19
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,200
That is very reassuring but I still need
to see the surveillance tapes.

20
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,450
- Lund.
- Brix here, what is going on?

21
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,800
Goodbye. And good luck on the campaign.

22
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,235
Those 3 can become great ministers.

23
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,965
I've decided to carry out our austerity
measures and show our values.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,450
Why did you fire the Minister of
Finance without informing me first?

25
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,950
Because you wouldn't have agreed.

26
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,360
How about Kristoffer?
Has he gone ahead to the meeting?

27
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:11,935
No, he is at a security briefing.

28
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,370
Even if I wouldn't have agreed,
you should still have consulted me.

29
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,999
I can't have a minister working
against me, right?

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,665
Get a hold of Kristoffer
so we can leave.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
You are too vulnerable
to do it on your own.

32
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,450
The Zeuthen case is not closed yet,
you need to calm things down.

33
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:29,470
I do not want any unrest and that's why
we won't work with Rosa Lebech.

34
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,735
You will agree on that, I'm sure.
We are very strong right now.

35
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,870
There are three days to the election.

36
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,435
Ussing and the centre party
are down for the count.

37
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,720
We just need to get
Emilie Zeuthen back alive.

38
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:39,685
We also have irregularities.

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
I noticed that when I was looking
for the files requested by the police.

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,170
Our vehicle logbook from back then
is missing from the archives.

41
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,485
- What vehicle logbook?
- The vehicle's logbook...

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,170
I've just been told by security they
think the kidnapper is in the building.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,820
- The kidnapper is here?
- You have to go back to the Ministry.

44
00:03:56,855 --> 00:04:00,820
- Go now.
- But...

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,327
We have checked everybody.
As you can see we do a thorough job.

46
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:14,915
It could take all night.

47
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,100
The kidnapper could be deceiving you
and he's chasing Ussing.

48
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:21,060
No, it's not Ussing. He is at the
police station with his lawyer.

49
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,897
Brix says that he is
no longer a suspect.

50
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:25,565
- I am missing the last hour on this list.
- What you mean he's no longer a suspect?

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,385
Apparently he has an
alibi for that day and time.

52
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,035
He was at a hotel with a female member
of staff, and that has been verified.

53
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,585
This is unacceptable, they need to
get home, catch trains and planes.

54
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,100
You had visitors from a photocopier
service company today for a few hours,

55
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,770
and again 20 minutes ago, after normal
working hours, and he shows his ID.

56
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,085
We have background checks on all their
employees. They are here frequently.

57
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,335
His ID is also cleared for the Ministry
of State. I need to know where he is now.

58
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,170
Hey, how do you fast
forward on this thing?

59
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,500
The guy told us that he forgot to change
a toner in the administration wing.

60
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:11,100
- Is that the administration wing?
- No, the Ministry of State's red zone.

61
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,085
What are they saying?
Why is the kidnapper here?

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
They are not certain, it's
probably a false alarm.

63
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,300
It's really bad if we arrive
late for that election rally.

64
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:24,717
- You need to go to the panic room.
- Why?

65
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:28,535
- Just go.
- Where is Karen?

66
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,570
She was talking about some missing
files and trying to find a backup.

67
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,500
Excuse me.

68
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,200
Is there something I can help you with?

69
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,750
Hello, I'm talking to you.

70
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,750
The kidnapper has been
spotted, he is wearing a cap.

71
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,220
- I'm on it.
- You two, come with me.

72
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,220
You saw a guy fiddling
with the equipment.

73
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,415
I only saw from the back.
When you catch him...

74
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,800
Stop, everybody out of here except
the guys from the forensic team.

75
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:03,002
No, no, no, no!

76
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:06,270
Listen here. The kidnapper
stole a hard drive.

77
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:08,310
- Apparently.
- What's on that hard drive?

78
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:11,065
We don't know that yet.

79
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,650
Firstly, I would like to know
why the kidnapper was here.

80
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,835
He wants to find out who was driving
the minister's car on a specific day

81
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,170
during the election campaign
two and a half years ago.

82
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:22,520
Excuse me, Sarah Lund
from the crime division,

83
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,485
and Matias Borch from SIS.

84
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,550
The minister's car was not used
during the election campaign.

85
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:27,877
I believe I explained
that to you already.

86
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:31,170
The car was spotted by a boy who wrote down
the registration number in his notebook.

87
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,719
It was on 20 April
on the same day as..

88
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
It doesn't matter what date it
was, it can't have been that car.

89
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,799
Why should the kidnapper be interested
in my ministerial car? I don't get it.

90
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,750
It's Ussing who is involved, it has
nothing to do with the Prime Minister.

91
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:48,650
Ussing has been cleared of suspicion.
Our investigation leads us to believe

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,950
that Emilie was kidnapped because the
old case was closed down unsolved,

93
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:56,050
and that is why we need
to follow every lead.

94
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,050
So you think that we have
something to do with it?

95
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:05,100
- Not necessarily.
- The facts are like this.

96
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,100
We know that the car was over there.
We need to know who drove it.

97
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,850
Surely you understand it is in your
own best interest to answer questions.

98
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:18,620
The hard drive that the kidnapper took
apparently contains all the information

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,275
regarding the minister's car,
who drove it, where it was, GPS...

100
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,220
Am I to understand that I or some of my
staff are under investigation for murder?

101
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:28,877
That is not what we are saying.

102
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:31,970
- I suggest we just calm down and..
- The conversation ends here.

103
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,099
- We don't know what you're talking about.
- One thing is for sure.

104
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,320
The Prime Minister was
not in that car that day.

105
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,585
Your car was in that notebook and that
specific page was torn out.

106
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,450
I know there is something
that you're not telling us.

107
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:46,165
- You know who you are talking to?
- I am sorry about the phrasing...

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,685
That car, somebody put pressure on that
Deputy Prosecutor to close down the case.

109
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,220
If you know anything this
is the time to tell us.

110
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,520
We will get back to you.

111
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,250
Great work, just excellent

112
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,270
We have searched the whole
harbour and all the containers.

113
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:20,720
We have not found anything
suggesting where Emilie might be.

114
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,335
What about the iPad?
Did you send it to the police?

115
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,185
Yes, it is being tested but,
we haven't heard anyhing yet.

116
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,250
They found the place in the harbour
where the kidnapper was hiding.

117
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,615
They say she was kept there briefly,
before he left the boat in the harbour.

118
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,650
Any signs to suggest
that she is still alive?

119
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,900
- They didn't say.
- Where did he take her? Where?

120
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,800
The police believe that she was
taken onto a ship going abroad,

121
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,650
perhaps in a container.

122
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,350
23 ships passed through
during that period.

123
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:53,570
The problem is
that was three days ago.

124
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,335
The containers have
gone on different ships

125
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,355
and therefore the numbers of ships that
Emilie can be on has doubled.

126
00:10:58,362 --> 00:10:59,299
Plus harbours...

127
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
We will check all the
ships and all the harbours.

128
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,565
- Many of the ships are on the open sea.
- Call them back.

129
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Contact the shipping operators
and tell them we will pay.

130
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,300
It's not enough. Even if we pay
we cannot buy assurance.

131
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,735
She could have been brought ashore.

132
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,770
What about the people
calling in for the reward?

133
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:20,855
- Anything we can use?
- No, nothing, I'm sorry. Not yet.

134
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,520
Contact those ships.
And keep on taking those calls.

135
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,470
Any news?

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to call and
say good night to Carl.

137
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,070
Hear his voice.

138
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,270
It's not your fault.

139
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,600
Did you know about the iPad?

140
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,800
And that she was in the attic
talking to the kidnapper?

141
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,570
She was angry at us, both of us.

142
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,870
You've told me we will find her,

143
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,970
that's why I know we will find her.

144
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,450
- Okay?
- Okay.

145
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,070
...the calls for them to me.

146
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,800
Lots of people have not managed
to get through to the police.

147
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,820
They have started
calling direct to Zeeland.

148
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:05,800
100 million reward
is going to make them act insane.

149
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,300
I can see what's happening.

150
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,920
Robert.

151
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,800
It's always the same.

152
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,670
He has been unfair to you
and not paid attention to the children.

153
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:22,070
The cat, the iPad. I still don't know
if it's all Zeeland's fault,

154
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,700
because they are hiding something.

155
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,770
Robert and Zeeland are
not involved in anything.

156
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,950
That is also what the police are saying.

157
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,150
Hey.

158
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,620
You know I'll do anything for you.

159
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,970
- Maja.
- I want to go now to Carl.

160
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,865
Maritime maps and container numbers
suggest that she has been put on a ship

161
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,365
but we don't know any more.

162
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,619
- Send a copy of the info to Zeuthen.
- Okay.

163
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,350
And she has not left any
clues to where she was going?

164
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:10,350
If she was here, it was a short stay.
Just changing clothes and moving on.

165
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,785
Anything on the kidnapper?

166
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,770
We have plenty of fingerprints but
nothing that matches our database.

167
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,865
Another homeless knows nothing.
Only that he kept to himself.

168
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
What about the connection
to Louise Hjelby's mother?

169
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:22,300
Anything suggesting who he might be?

170
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,650
He kept a photo of her. So she must
have meant something to him

171
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,600
when she was young
before she got cancer.

172
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,300
Okay, the kidnapper took a hard drive.

173
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,385
As he no longer has his hideaway,
he's going to try and find a computer

174
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,915
so he can check its contents.

175
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,650
Okay I will try to search libraries
and Internet cafes. I will call back.

176
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:38,685
Thanks.

177
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,485
Somebody must know something.

178
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,449
What about the surveillance?
The photocopier service company?

179
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,070
The kidnapper broke into the company
car and stole a uniform and ID card

180
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
while the repair guy was away.

181
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,869
The only thing you see on the tape
is that he walks with a limp,

182
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,870
so it's amazing that he managed
to get away from you.

183
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:53,049
- Any update?
- Nothing new.

184
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,050
The Ministry of State must
tell us what they know.

185
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,735
If they know anything.
Right now it's just accusations

186
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,215
based on scribbling in a boy's notebook.

187
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,650
I would really like to have known
about these scribbles 12 hours ago,

188
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:04,404
when we last sat here and you told
us that SIS knew nothing about it.

189
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,399
- We had no knowledge about it.
- Obviously not.

190
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,570
But you must know whether the
minister's car was in Jutland that day.

191
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,670
It doesn't help Emilie that you are less
than forthcoming with information.

192
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,235
It was during the election.

193
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,270
We had better things to do,
than to watch a car in a garage.

194
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,870
Also the Ministry of
State says it is not true

195
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,144
Dyring, but the fact that that page
was torn out suggest that..

196
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,850
Speculations. It could have been
the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

197
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,170
Or an accident, maybe the boy did it.

198
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:28,835
No matter what, we have to show the
kidnapper that we are working on it.

199
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,870
We need to focus our investigation
on finding the kidnapper.

200
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:33,770
For fuck's sake, that is what we are doing!

201
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,044
- Borch, come here
- Let me explain.

202
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,045
Come here.

203
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,485
You have to bring it up with management.
We need to search the Ministry of State.

204
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
The small boy collects
licence plate numbers

205
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,420
I don't want to persuade management.

206
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,485
Then you have to figure out something.

207
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,470
We risk that the kidnapper
will never call again

208
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:58,970
if we don't do something.

209
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,150
I made a request that these
container numbers be given to Zeuthen.

210
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,150
I'll check up with them.

211
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,470
I have just received a complaint
from the Ministry of State.

212
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,115
- What's going on?
- We have a good explanation.

213
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,984
First the opposition party and now this.
It stops now

214
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,800
- Ruth.
- You will apologise to them.

215
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,570
Ruth.

216
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,300
We need to talk.

217
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,065
I don't want these accusations hanging.
I want everything regarding that car

218
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,119
- investigated, right now.
- I'm on it.

219
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,400
The problem is that the hard
drive and information are gone

220
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:36,865
and so is the vehicle logbook.

221
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm trying to contact
the chauffeur of the car.

222
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:39,585
Okay?
Security has been intensified.

223
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,800
SIS have requested that we
cancel our arrangement for tonight,

224
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,800
so I have moved a
fundraiser till tomorrow.

225
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,720
- What is the chauffeur saying?
- They will call and we will find out.

226
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,820
No, call them in for a meeting now.

227
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,200
If Emilie's life depends
on it, then I have to ask myself.

228
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,770
You don't need to talk to anybody else.

229
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,170
What?

230
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,720
It was me who removed the
logbook this afternoon.

231
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,050
I didn't want it ending
up with the police.

232
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,300
Not before I had a chance to talk to you

233
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,220
because the car was not
in the garage back then.

234
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,320
Who drove it?
What are you talking about?

235
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:21,320
It was your son.
It was Benjamin who drove the car.

236
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,035
It was during the
last election campaign.

237
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,700
There were demonstrations against the
Banks' involvement in the financial crisis.

238
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:32,550
It was violent, and Benjamin was
recognised as one of the troublemakers.

239
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,600
He was only 17 so they called me
because they couldn't get hold of you.

240
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,565
I didn't have any option so...

241
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,770
I persuaded one of the chauffeurs
to pick him up in the Minister's car

242
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,520
and drive him to Jutland
where we were at the time.

243
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,700
I arrived at the hotel. He somehow
managed to get hold of the car keys

244
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:47,700
and got away in the
Prime Minister's car.

245
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,250
It is in the vehicle logbook

246
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,220
20th of April
Passenger Benjamin Kamper

247
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,785
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I wanted to but

248
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,520
I did not want you to get involved
with me misusing the minister's car.

249
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,650
Benjamin was embarrassed and
made me promise not to tell.

250
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,300
He was not one to provoke.
He was angry and drunk.

251
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,120
- How long was he gone, in the car?
- I found him late in the evening.

252
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,600
He called me from some bus terminal.
He was sorry and out of petrol.

253
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,300
Why didn't you say something?
What about the girl? Did he meet her?

254
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:28,620
No, of course not. He just drove
around till he had calmed down,

255
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,350
and then I sent him back to Copenhagen.

256
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,750
You need to make a statement about
everything that happened that day.

257
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,750
What time he came over, what
he did, and when he was found

258
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,750
Any other files that you lied about?

259
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,049
- Answer.
- No.

260
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,150
Then you have to go to the police and tell
them everything. Everything.

261
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,665
If this comes out, then it will look
like it's us that put pressure

262
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,285
- on the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.
- I don't give a fuck.

263
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
The police need this
information right now.

264
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,570
They better see this.

265
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,220
I can confirm that we are currently
investigating events at the Ministry of State

266
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:07,470
and will continue doing that
until we have satisfactory answers.

267
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,385
- Anybody specific?
- I can't comment on that.

268
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,865
I want to make it understood

269
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,520
that we are doing everything we can
to get Emilie Zeuthen back alive.

270
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,000
I will man the phones and
prepare a press release.

271
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,049
Right.

272
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,270
We need to inform Benjamin's
mother, your ex-wife.

273
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,305
- I'll take that.
- Okay

274
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,185
Karen, can you make sure that

275
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,520
Kristoffer doesn't get anywhere
near me, I don't want to see him.

276
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Of course

277
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,120
Chairman Gidlsford has heard about the
accusations against the Ministry of State

278
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:46,085
and he's asking for an orientation
but I'll take care of that.

279
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,850
Somebody from the police is here.

280
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,285
It's that woman

281
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,449
- She says it is important.
- Okay.

282
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,865
Unless you can tell me where Emilie is,
we have nothing to talk about.

283
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,700
I just want to know whether you had
time to look at those container numbers

284
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:02,885
that I sent you.

285
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
It was a list of all the
containers in the harbour

286
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,920
three days ago. We have
searched most of them

287
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,370
and we are working on the rest.

288
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:11,765
Please inform us.

289
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Are any of the containers
of greater interest?

290
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:14,920
No.

291
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,335
What about the iPad?
Any clues about the kidnapper?

292
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,100
The forensic investigation is still
ongoing. It explains how..

293
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:25,550
It's Maya. She wants to talk to you,
she's down in the car park.

294
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:28,100
But I need some information
about some former employees.

295
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:31,770
- It will only take a minute.
- We are all very busy.

296
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,485
We still believe that the old case
will lead us to Emilie.

297
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,650
The kidnapper is the biological
father of the girl that got killed

298
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,350
and he could have been
employed by Zeeland.

299
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:49,285
We have already been very helpful,
lists of employees with photos...

300
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
The kidnapper is not somebody
who worked on an oil rig.

301
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,200
The guy we are looking
for has detailed knowledge

302
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:57,520
of computers, has a technical background
and knows everything about the harbour.

303
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
It must be in Roberts
Zeuthen's best interest..

304
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:02,052
Do not tell me what
is in his best interest

305
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:06,015
- I think I'm better qualified for that.
- Then help me.

306
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,420
We are looking for an
engineer or the equivalent

307
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,370
and something must have happened regarding
his employment when his daughter died.

308
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,370
I..

309
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,920
There were a lot of staff made redundant
21/2 years ago and reassignments.

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,370
- Why?
- The financial collapse.

311
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,550
Some of our competitors closed down and
Zeeland took on some of their employees.

312
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,470
But we couldn't take them all.

313
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,750
I will need those records,
maybe we can find something.

314
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,849
- I will make sure you get the information
- Thank you.

315
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,070
I want to make it clear

316
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:52,010
it would be unbearable for Robert
Zeuthen if Emilie dies

317
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,730
because the police failed
to solve some old case

318
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,340
and it would have ramifications
that go beyond our comprehension.

319
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,570
Hi.

320
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,910
Can we stay at your place?
In the guest room?

321
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:22,880
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, my lovely boy

322
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,585
- Just till we find something else.
- Of course.

323
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,020
- Come, let's go home.
- Thank you.

324
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,040
I'll get somebody to pick up your car.

325
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,015
We have received a written
statement from the Ministry of State.

326
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,480
They now admit that the minister's
car was indeed in Jutland on that day,

327
00:22:57,515 --> 00:23:02,515
but said that it was the Prime
Minister's son that took the car.

328
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:05,302
The vehicle logbook confirms it.

329
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:07,715
His son, what was he doing there?

330
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,400
The son got angry at his dad
and drove around in the car,

331
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,570
and somehow the logbook just
dropped off the shelf this afternoon.

332
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,440
And how can we believe it is time?

333
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,350
It was witnessed by the brother of
the Prime Minister, Kristoffer Kamper.

334
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,935
He will make a statement to us tomorrow.

335
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,730
♪I have moved in with a friend.
Thank you so much for the help, love Eva. ♪

336
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,700
We need to bring the
son in for questioning.

337
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,770
Lund, don't ever read any newspapers
or watch the news? The son is dead.

338
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,637
Officially it was an accident
but as far as I know,

339
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:42,965
it wasn't, it was suicide.

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,965
Only a few weeks after that
Kamper won the election back then,

341
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,060
but of course the head of DSIS doesn't
believe it could have been the son.

342
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:52,110
Let's pressure them and I will bring
the brother in for questioning.

343
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,770
Yes.

344
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,130
I waited out here for
half an hour, can we talk?

345
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:17,840
- Sure, come in.
- Thank you.

346
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,460
Did you hear about the
Prime Minister's son?

347
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:40,280
They are hiding something. It's shit.
That's not the whole story.

348
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:44,280
- What do you want?
- I have something you need to see.

349
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,460
The file on the Prime Minister's son.
I wanted to make sure that you got it.

350
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,460
- Couldn't it wait till tomorrow?
- Well...

351
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,020
I will not be there tomorrow.

352
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,570
I'm off the case
and I have to stay away,

353
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,910
and I am sorry I behaved like an idiot.

354
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,930
I should have told you
everything from the beginning,

355
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,260
but I really don't know what
happened to that page in the notebook.

356
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,860
I hope you believe me.

357
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,800
The kidnapping seems connected to an old
murder case that had been covered up.

358
00:25:58,835 --> 00:26:00,445
How did Zeeland respond to that?

359
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,530
I have been told that the Prime Minister's
car is now part of the investigation.

360
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,729
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

361
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,439
- What is your name?
- Astrid.

362
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,860
Hi Astrid, my name is Christian.
Shall we take some photos?

363
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,260
I have tried to get hold of Zeuthen's
personal assistant.

364
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:24,075
I want to explain to him what happened
but he hasn't returned my calls.

365
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,965
Kristoffer's having a meeting
with the police right now.

366
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,530
If anybody finds out about it,
then we will call it a briefing.

367
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:31,165
Thanks, let's just get through this.
How much time?

368
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,735
First up is a tour with
Ussing and the press

369
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,300
and then you will talk with
the children downstairs.

370
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,640
- We need to talk about something.
- I know the school needs an upgrade.

371
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:45,475
Benjamin was found very late. There's
half a day that nobody can account for.

372
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,330
He wanted to be alone, Kristoffer
already said it was nothing.

373
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:52,295
He committed suicide
less than two weeks later.

374
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,930
The police will be able to
put two and two together.

375
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:57,637
Those events are not connected.
He was depressed.

376
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,639
- Hello and welcome.
- Thank you.

377
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,425
The children are just
about to get ready.

378
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,170
I hope you don't mind
waiting just a little bit?

379
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:06,205
No, that's fine.

380
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,075
- It is here.
- Yes.

381
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,110
Nice drawings by the children.

382
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,350
The walls look better
with a bit of colour.

383
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,315
Definitely.

384
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,750
I must admit I was quite surprised to find
out that your car was suddenly of interest.

385
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,280
Don't worry, is not something that I'm
going to use for the election campaign.

386
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:31,280
Thank you.
But do not worry about me.

387
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,800
That's funny, that's
what my advisers told me.

388
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,620
They thought it would only be
fair after what you did to me

389
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:43,020
with the police and I'm
a trustworthy witness.

390
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,650
That's up to you and your conscience.

391
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,330
On the other hand, the facts are that
the old case was being covered up

392
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,348
- and somebody had a really good motive.
- Let me tell you something.

393
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,800
That you think your brother was a
bit slow in getting the truth out.

394
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,475
You must also be wondering whether his
good contacts in the ministries

395
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,510
might extend to the Deputy
Chief Prosecutor as well.

396
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:09,605
No, I will not listen to you about
these kind of accusations.

397
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,130
We will see, it will be bad for
your relationship with Zeeland

398
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,130
and the Emilie Zeuthen case.

399
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,650
Aren't we starting soon?

400
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:28,080
We need to cut this short.
The police need to see you.

401
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,045
What?

402
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,440
I think they suspect that Benjamin
might be behind the killing.

403
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,735
Benjamin Kamper, high school student,
mentally unstable,

404
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,045
bipolar aka manic-depressive disorder,
politically active on the far left wing,

405
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,710
closely associated with
Communist newspapers and so on.

406
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:51,860
But after a trip to Jutland
does his condition suddenly deteriorate

407
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:54,445
to the level that he leaves home

408
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,405
and jumps out in front of a
freight train a few days later?

409
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,330
Hi, you have called Eva, leave
a message and have a nice day.

410
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:02,045
Benjamin Kamper on the
other hand, told us that

411
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,950
there is no reason to believe that
he was near Louise Hjelby back then.

412
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,095
Did you find out anything about
former employees of Zeeland?

413
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,330
They are going to give us more information
later, but we can't wait for that.

414
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:14,225
Lund.
The kidnapper did not contact you

415
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,110
and I'm sure you can figure out
that there is no future for us here.

416
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,075
If we start digging up
old wounds without cause

417
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,110
into the Prime Minister's personal tragedy
in the middle of an election campaign

418
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:25,975
It's got to be him. This would also
explain why you would make

419
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,710
a Chief Deputy Prosecutor
cover up the case.

420
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,475
True. Okay, I'll see what I can do
but, it will be

421
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,510
the Prime Minister's decision
whether he wants to meet up with us.

422
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:36,529
Okay.

423
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,875
The file on Benjamin
Kamper was very useful.

424
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,680
Still, I suggest you don't trust Borch
in the future. Is that clear?

425
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,370
The kidnapper has not shown up at any
of the Internet cafes or libraries.

426
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,735
- What is going on with Borch?
- He has been taken off the case.

427
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,419
Did you find out anything about
Louise's mother, Monica Hjelby?

428
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,550
She lived in Skudehavnen. There' a woman
named Birt I'm trying to get hold of.

429
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,695
But, about Borch.

430
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,730
Borch has been taken off
the case. That's all I know.

431
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you have something to do with it?

432
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,260
Is it because you are is still
angry about what happened in Jutland?

433
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:17,000
- Or is it something else I don't know..
- Listen up, I have no idea.

434
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,510
Then why is his wife sitting
outside waiting to talk to you?

435
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,750
Hi, Sarah Lund.

436
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm actually on my way out
so maybe you can call...

437
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,500
He came back late last night.

438
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,060
He didn't go to bed.

439
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,030
I found him in the living room.

440
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,840
At first I thought it was the
case that he was working on,

441
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,560
but that's not the case, is it?

442
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,240
He says that...

443
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,840
that he loves somebody else.

444
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,550
It's you I presume?

445
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,420
Were you together
when you were in Jutland?

446
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,950
Are you in love with him?

447
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,565
It might be that you
have been lovers before

448
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,230
and still have feelings
for each other or something.

449
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,770
But we have two girls together
and he's their father.

450
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,450
Stay away from him.

451
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,480
Lund, let's go. We got the go-ahead
from the Ministry of State.

452
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,515
Okay.

453
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,515
You have our full support
but we do have a business to run.

454
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,045
Can we talk about this some other time?

455
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,110
You are unable to take care of
the daily running of the business.

456
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:04,150
For good reason, but it does create an
uncertainty throughout the company.

457
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:06,440
We need to show strong leadership.

458
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,060
That is the reason why we
would like you to step down

459
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:12,495
and let the board appoint a new CEO.

460
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,369
- I have always had your full support.
- You still have that.

461
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,000
Then you must know that I cannot
accept that Zeeland moves abroad.

462
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:21,245
There are reasons to reconsider.
Have you seen today's newspapers?

463
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,005
We'll stick to the agreement we made.
Zeeland stays in Denmark.

464
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
The Ministry of State is
under police investigation.

465
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,550
My duties can be covered by
the rest of the executives.

466
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,970
And if they can't, then
we hired the wrong people.

467
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,640
Make sure it works.

468
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,185
I will make sure that
Gidlsford understands

469
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
that for now he needs to
take these things up with me.

470
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:52,369
- I will arrange a meeting with him.
- Thank you.

471
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,765
- Besides that, anything else?
- With regards to Emilie,

472
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,400
they think they can narrow the search
down to 15 ships and six terminals.

473
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,695
- What is missing?
- Even with the payment,

474
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,640
it is still difficult to get access
to some ships and terminals.

475
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:09,770
Rotterdam, Hamburg,
Stavanger, and St Petersburg.

476
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,770
The police say they can't intervene.

477
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,850
I will personally go and talk
to the shipping operators.

478
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,985
Please prepare my jet.

479
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,530
I'll take care of Hamburg and Rotterdam,
you take Stavanger and St Petersburg.

480
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,530
Yes, understood.

481
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,370
My brother kept that Benjamin was
driven to Jutland in the minister's car,

482
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,850
until yesterday, hidden from me.
He wanted to protect me and my family.

483
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:33,680
It was an error and that is regrettable,
but I have nothing else to add.

484
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,130
Your son took off in the car at the
same time as a local girl disappeared,

485
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:42,529
she was held captive, raped, and killed
at an abandoned shipbuilders.

486
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,280
The Prime Minister has been made aware
of the old murder case, thank you.

487
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,280
I understand that your
son was manic-depressive.

488
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,000
How did he feel the following
days after that episode in Jutland?

489
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,965
- Anything other than ordinary?
- No, not really.

490
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,329
- Were you in contact with him?
- Yes.

491
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,335
- You were talking?
- Yes, of course we were talking.

492
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,985
There were times, he became reclusive,

493
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,050
but neither me or my former wife
noticed anything out of the ordinary.

494
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,600
So you just saw it
as a depressive phase?

495
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:12,005
It was a depressive phase.

496
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,750
He had stopped taking his medication
and we only noticed too late

497
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,310
Okay, anything else?

498
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We had a look at what Benjamin was doing
the weeks after he got back from Jutland.

499
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:26,930
He skips classes significantly
more frequently than before.

500
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,535
He's also absent from his part-time job

501
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,520
and he's buying a lot of wine and hard
alcohol, according to his classmates.

502
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,199
How did you get this information?

503
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,860
Lots of symptoms indicating
that things were not okay

504
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,400
Still you didn't think it was
anything out of the ordinary?

505
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:45,040
We just assumed that it was his disease.
We are not trained physicians-

506
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,245
I was also absent a lot back then.

507
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,715
Had his condition made
him act like this before?

508
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,240
I believe the Prime Minister has
answered all relevant questions.

509
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:55,075
But Benjamin himself

510
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,510
expressed that there was something that
had happened that he couldn't go on living.

511
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,130
He showed up on the psychiatric ward
the night before he disappeared

512
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,130
at Fredericksburg hospital.

513
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,110
He expressed distress and
wanted to be checked in by them.

514
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,550
He was informed by the staff
that he was under the legal age

515
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:13,170
and therefore needed
his parents' approval.

516
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,840
He then left the ward, but before that
he repeatedly told the psychiatrist,

517
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,280
and I quote:

518
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,095
'he had done something that his father
would never be able to forgive him for'.

519
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,800
He was then advised by the psychiatrist
to go home and talk to his father.

520
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,600
Did he do that?

521
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,740
On this specific evening,

522
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,510
I came home very late.

523
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,730
I thought everybody was asleep,

524
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,775
but Benjamin
was awake and..

525
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,640
he came downstairs.

526
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
Hmm

527
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,110
He asked if we could sit
in the kitchen and talk.

528
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,440
We hadn't done that for very long time,

529
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,910
so I was very happy.

530
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,970
He had difficulties expressing
what he wanted to say

531
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:28,970
and I was very tired.

532
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,710
In the end he said that it didn't matter
and then he went upstairs,

533
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:38,710
to his room.

534
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,675
The next morning when I woke up,
I made breakfast.

535
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,210
Then I went to his room
to try and wake him up.

536
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,170
The bed was empty, he was gone.

537
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,350
It might not be significant,
he was often like that.

538
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,500
Reclusive, restless..

539
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,515
If your son committed the murder

540
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,510
it is most likely that the
evidence will still be in the car

541
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,840
and our forensic team is capable of
finding evidence that is several years old

542
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,620
even if somebody tried to remove it.

543
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:15,480
He did not do it. It is completely
ridiculous to sit here and...

544
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:18,110
Stop it! What did Benjamin
say to you that night?

545
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,385
Anything that resembled a confession?
Or about the girl?

546
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,570
It doesn't matter what Benjamin Kamper
said because he is innocent.

547
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,910
The stolen hard drive was found
at an Internet cafe 15 minutes ago.

548
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,845
The kidnapper read the contents of the
hard drive and it confirms that

549
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,510
the minister's car was never near
the crime scene nor the harbour.

550
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:39,475
And what evidence do
you have to support that?

551
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,510
You can see where the car
had been on the map here.

552
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,335
The car had a GPS tracker installed
and all the data was on the hard drive.

553
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,370
I'm deeply sorry that you
had to go through this.

554
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,170
I expect an official statement from the
police clearing the Prime Minister ASAP,

555
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:55,440
and I trust you won't
waste any more time.

556
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:23,459
What happened? Did you put pressure
on him? What did they say?

557
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,757
The minister's car was never near
the crime scene. The GPS proves it

558
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,535
GPS, what GPS?

559
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,550
We don't know the whereabouts of
the kidnapper of Emile Zeuthen.

560
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:33,419
We have nothing.

561
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,640
Stop it, your are not going to
give up just because of a GPS.

562
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:38,135
- Did you ask him about...
- Yes, I asked him.

563
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,620
And if you have any doubt, then you can
go up there and ask him yourself.

564
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,560
What about the kidnapper?

565
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,360
Do you have the notebook?

566
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,419
We have checked all 13 cars from
that day, there is nothing.

567
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
Can I have the notebook?

568
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,929
One of the owners of the
thirteen cars, an old woman,

569
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,370
kept insisting that her car was never
anywhere near Jutland on that day.

570
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,510
So we have to go back and verify
everything from the beginning.

571
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:14,210
Your wife came to see me today.

572
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,480
I don't want that...

573
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,430
don't destroy anything.

574
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,149
Hello.

575
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,930
I am outside the Internet café
where we found the hard drive.

576
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:38,475
The kidnapper has had
about 30 minutes to get away

577
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,770
and he has likely found out that the
information on the drive is irrelevant.

578
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:42,170
So he's probably not in a very good mood.

579
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:45,020
I'll see if I can find
some witnesses.

580
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,675
Birte, the woman who knew Monica Hjelby
is at Skudehavnen right now.

581
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,130
I will go out there but
I can't do everything on my own.

582
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:52,425
Okay, great.

583
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,425
I need to go now.

584
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,477
Sarah, the kidnapper's not going
to give up. Neither should you.

585
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:03,860
I have to go now.

586
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,680
Leading up to when he left, you
saw somebody by the computers?

587
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:23,660
Sure, lots of people are by the
computers I don't know who they are.

588
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:26,260
But the hard drive...

589
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,715
What about that girl?

590
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,450
Do you think she saw something?

591
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,225
The kidnapper was last seen here.

592
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,275
A witness saw him driving
around in a blue estate car.

593
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,910
Check if any have been reported
stolen within the past 24 hours.

594
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:48,915
He is severely injured
he will seek treatment.

595
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,445
Hospitals, emergency rooms, we
need to check everything again.

596
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,970
The only thing that you will do is to
sit down and wait for briefing from SIS.

597
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,115
You gave the go-ahead
for me to go on TV.

598
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,660
Fom this point on, it will
be SIS that is in charge.

599
00:42:02,695 --> 00:42:05,530
You will do as they ask, and make sure
you get Sarah Lund under control.

600
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,080
Get her to make the coffee.
If I'm going to clean up your mess.

601
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,260
Get back to work. What are you looking at?
We'll continue until we get it in writing.

602
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,025
The plane is ready.
You'll be in Rotterdam before 6 o'clock.

603
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
I have notified the shipping
operator of your arrival.

604
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:26,187
I am going out to see Gidlsford
and then I'll go back home to pack.

605
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:27,880
Thank you, it's very nice of you.

606
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,820
Annett and the girls are
staying at the house in France,

607
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:35,150
so I might as well do something useful.
I will keep you updated.

608
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,700
Thank you.

609
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,730
Mr. Zeuthen, can I
disturb you for second?

610
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:43,620
A witness has shown up at reception.

611
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:46,295
- Who?
- A sailor from Sweden.

612
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,030
I think he might have seen something.

613
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,920
He is in a room here.

614
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,585
What is it that you have seen?

615
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,420
I was out sailing four days ago

616
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,255
It was about 3 a. m.
and it was freezing.

617
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,675
Suddenly I heard a
speedboat going very fast

618
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,150
and it didn't have any lanterns
and that was a bit strange.

619
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:18,892
I passed by coastal
vessel shortly after.

620
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:22,565
I saw the speedboat next to the vessel,

621
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,600
and then I saw a man together with
a small child boarding the ship.

622
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,040
Why did you contact
us and not the police?

623
00:43:36,075 --> 00:43:41,060
I tried but I couldn't get through

624
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,320
So you claim that you saw my
daughter in the middle of the ocean

625
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:50,930
in a sail boat in very strong wind
in complete darkness at 3 o'clock?

626
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,630
Yes.

627
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,445
Escort this man out.

628
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,480
150 cm high, 40 kg and long blonde hair.

629
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Black wellingtons, blue
raincoat, and no life preserver.

630
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,350
I could see this because
I was only 30 to 40 m away.

631
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,080
A work light was on, so I
could see everything clearly.

632
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,930
- I don't know if I should tell you...
- What?

633
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,970
It looked like she was waving.

634
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,440
What was the name of the vessel?

635
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,620
I would like to sort out
some formalities first.

636
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:46,930
If what you're saying is true, you will
get the reward without any delays

637
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:50,820
I would like to get some
kind of assurance of that.

638
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,180
Written agreement and 2% upfront.

639
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:01,475
- We do not have cash here.
- I can wait.

640
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,420
I will get the process
going, tell me more.

641
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,060
I prefer to wait.

642
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:31,770
- Can I get you something?
- A cup of tea with milk.

643
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:34,770
- Okay.
- Thank you

644
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,195
- Are you Birte?
- Who's asking?

645
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,025
Sarah Lund.

646
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,020
You knew Monica Hjelby,
the mother of Louise.

647
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,330
She was my tenant for 10 years up there.

648
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,205
Monica showed up one day.
She was pregnant,

649
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,205
with her nose in the air.

650
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,480
She said she only needed a place
to stay for three months but

651
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:27,165
But she just kept on staying?

652
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
What about Louise's
dad, did you meet him?

653
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,440
No, in the beginning she talked about
a guy who was going to come and get her,

654
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,570
but I have heard that story before.

655
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,800
Do know if she had any
contact with the father?

656
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:40,679
No.

657
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,840
Did a guy ever come here?

658
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:46,006
After she died, a guy came.

659
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:48,880
- Who was it?
- He said that he was an old friend.

660
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:53,150
- What did he want?
- Information, he asked after Monica.

661
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,440
And?

662
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,840
I told him that he could find
her in a grave at the cemetery.

663
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,585
Did he ask about anything else?

664
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,840
No, I just told him that
Louise was in an orphanage.

665
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,330
Can you describe how he
looked, anything special?

666
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,245
No, I don't remember.
Regular guy,

667
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,280
but it didn't sound like he
knew that Monica had a daughter.

668
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,280
I never saw him again.

669
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,260
Hello, this is Eva Laursen's midwife.
I don't know if you remember meeting me.

670
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:29,770
Yes, but the timing is not so good

671
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,080
I just want to know if you could
help us get hold of your son Mark?

672
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:36,595
- Why?
- Eva is at the hospital with cramps.

673
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,240
It's likely that she
will deliver prematurely.

674
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,825
Is it serious?

675
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,910
We can't tell yet, but we would
really like to get hold of Mark.

676
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,220
- Hello?
- I will try to get hold of him.

677
00:47:49,255 --> 00:47:52,120
Thank you, goodbye.

678
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,425
I'm sorry but I have to leave now.

679
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,850
But I'm sending out a colleague
to hear more about that orphanage.

680
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:08,240
I don't know much, I only know
that it was a public orphanage.

681
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:11,310
Monica got that "family fund"

682
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,260
- but maybe that's not important.
- What "family fund"?

683
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,700
It was some time before she died

684
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, she knew she was near the end.
She wanted to do something for Louise.

685
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,840
I helped write applications,

686
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,420
and when she got a positive reply from

687
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:34,020
Zeeland's family fund
she was so happy.

688
00:48:34,055 --> 00:48:37,219
- What fund? Zeeland?
- Yes.

689
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,240
For helping people like Monica
who are alone with a child.

690
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,310
Might be that the family
Zeuthen are loaded with money

691
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:47,135
but you still feel a
little sad for them.

692
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,930
They help so many children and then they
have to go through this with their own.

693
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,535
No matter what the prime minister claims
he owes the voters a proper account

694
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,515
of the government's involvement in the
tragic kidnapping case of Emilie Zeuthen.

695
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,480
Look, the government is not responsible
for the financial crisis or the kidnapping.

696
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:11,895
- To suggest that is...
- There is a cover-up.

697
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,570
We can only ask ourselves if the Prime
Minister is interested in the truth.

698
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:17,115
Could you please switch that off?
Thank you.

699
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,909
- I have just heard from Zeeland.
- And?

700
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,495
It sounds like they still
have confidence in us

701
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,510
and they are still backing the
government's austerity measures.

702
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,510
Karen, back then, in Jutland

703
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,710
did you have any
contact with Kristoffer?

704
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:35,320
No. He did not tell me anything, why?

705
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,000
The police are right.

706
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,910
Benjamin did change

707
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,500
I do not know why you couldn't see it.

708
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,150
In hindsight it's very clear.

709
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,130
Hindsight is always 20/20.

710
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,280
Don't get yourself worked up.
It's only guesswork from the police.

711
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,540
Christopher has accounted
for what happened.

712
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,600
You loved your son,
and I'm sure he knew that.

713
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,925
We saw the debate on TV.
Great work with Ussing.

714
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,640
What really happened?

715
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,280
I know something happened
with Benjamin over there.

716
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:54,022
- I just want to know what?
- Well...

717
00:50:54,057 --> 00:50:55,695
Stop it.

718
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,530
For fuck's sake, what happened?

719
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,785
He called me from the bus terminal.

720
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,120
I went over there to talk to
him, but he was out of his mind.

721
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,185
- Did he do something to the girl, or..
- Of course he didn't.

722
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,220
But something had happened
that triggered an episode.

723
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:15,765
He said he had been looking for you,
to make a show in front of the press.

724
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,549
- He said he saw something important.
- What was it?

725
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:23,510
It was some typical left-wing nonsense,
that we are kissing big business arses.

726
00:51:23,545 --> 00:51:26,295
What happened?
Why didn't you let me deal with it?

727
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,857
I thought he should leave you alone.
He would only fuck things up.

728
00:51:29,892 --> 00:51:32,750
I know he was in difficulties but you
have fought so hard for this election.

729
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:34,875
- And I wouldn't let him ruin that.
- What did you do?

730
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,315
He was a risk being near the press.

731
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,080
I put him on a bus to Copenhagen
to get his act together.

732
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,650
- Get his act together?
- He threatened to go to the press.

733
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:46,860
They would have eaten it up.
It was for his own sake, he was crazy.

734
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,810
What did he see?

735
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:58,135
- Answer.
- He had seen Karen.

736
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:02,950
She was in Zeeland's pockets and held
meetings with them behind your back.

737
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:06,050
What meetings?

738
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:12,130
Just some, guy but he
didn't even know who.

739
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,109
- The money and the contract are coming.
- Thank you.

740
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,880
Reinhart told me to tell you that the
meeting with the chairman went well.

741
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:24,715
Thank you.

742
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,205
- Where is he, I want to speak to him.
- He won't talk until he gets the money.

743
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,910
But we checked out his ID
and everything seems fine.

744
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,385
The police are here.

745
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,570
I've told them about the witness so they can
start the questioning as soon as possible.

746
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:36,645
I didn't call the police

747
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,969
We need to verify the information
with the police before we...

748
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,440
He described her blue raincoat
and that's enough for me.

749
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,005
He could not know anything

750
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,240
about that blue raincoat, it was
found at the kidnapper's hide out.

751
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:52,240
She had likely changed
into something else.

752
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,530
- Where is he?
- He asked direction to the parking.

753
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,200
- He wanted something from his car.
- Seal the building.

754
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,875
Robert, what is happening?
Where is he?

755
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,910
He accessed one of our computers.

756
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,095
Juncker here.
We need backup at Zeeleand.

757
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,130
The kidnapper might
still be in the building.

758
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,240
I was told I could find you at home.
I've tried calling you.

759
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:51,640
I'm about to leave. We have sent you
the information you requested.

760
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:55,040
We did not find anything in them.
I have a few very urgent questions.

761
00:53:55,075 --> 00:53:57,057
It's about Zeeland's children's fund.

762
00:53:57,092 --> 00:53:59,040
If we can sort it out while I lock up...

763
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,680
Zeeland's children's fund
is part of our CSR strategy.

764
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,040
We take social responsibility
and help those in need.

765
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,935
We help children in several countries,
but why is that relevant?

766
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:18,200
Because the girl from the old case was
placed in an orphanage named Mayfarm

767
00:54:18,235 --> 00:54:20,165
that was sponsored by your fund.

768
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,310
The orphanage was closed down. We have been
unable to find information from back then.

769
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:28,110
The fund must have had good reasons. They
find out what is best for the children.

770
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,399
But I need to catch a flight.

771
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,150
I believe the kidnapper contacted that
orphanage in order to find his daughter.

772
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,170
There must be something
in her file from back then.

773
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:40,405
It might even have his name and since it
was your fund that ran the orphanage,

774
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,530
then there is a chance that they
might have a copy of the records.

775
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:49,330
It's important, I need this
file if I going to find Emilie.

776
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,400
I will try to see if I can
find somebody you can contact.

777
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,000
Thank you

778
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,800
- Hello.
- It's Borch.

779
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,750
There is a reason why we
couldn't find that car.

780
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:31,200
We forgot to think that those numbers
are written down by a seven-year-old.

781
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,580
He made a mistake.

782
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:44,835
The first letter was the wrong
way around, so instead...

783
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,535
so instead of a Z he wrote S.

784
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,840
What that means is that it's a licence plate
that we have never been looking for before.

785
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,510
And you will not believe it.

786
00:55:53,545 --> 00:55:56,110
It's a Zeeland car.

787
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:02,480
And the car belongs to Reinholdt,
Robert Zeuthen's personal assistant.

788
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:07,025
Can you hear what I'm saying?
It's Reinholdt.

789
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,910
He has known the whole time that
it was him we were looking for.

790
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:20,039
- Name and phone number.
- Where are you? Sarah?

791
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,950
She is the head of Administration,
she should be able to help you.

792
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,910
I really need to get going now.

793
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,270
You knew Mayfarm?

794
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,130
Or you have been there?

795
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,530
I am the chairman of the fund.

796
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,930
I try to bring awareness
as often as I can.

797
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:52,830
Did you know her?

798
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,430
No, not that I can remember.

799
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,950
Who is it?

800
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,530
Excuse me.
A window might be open.

801
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,550
Stay where you are.
