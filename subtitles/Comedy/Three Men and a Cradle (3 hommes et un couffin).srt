1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,858
THREE MEN AND A BASKET

2
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,332
I'll be back

3
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:54,931
I've gotta run
but I've a favour to ask you

4
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:58,431
Whatever, but hurry
I'm really busy!

5
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:02,277
I'm supposed to get a valuable
package on Sunday, but I won't be home

6
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,975
Can I have it delivered here?

7
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,983
Yes, sure

8
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:07,075
- Will someone be here to receive it?
- Of course

9
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,678
Pierre and MicheI'll be here
I'm leaving for Japan

10
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,383
Will you tell them it'll arrive
sometime on Sunday?

11
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,291
Tell 'em just to put it aside
Someone will pick it up on Thursday

12
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:17,988
- Is that all?
- Yeah, I can trust you, right?

13
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:19,290
Sure, you don't have to
worry about a thing

14
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,390
You see, it's a bit tricky...
If it's here, I'll feel safer

15
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,925
- Don't worry, it's done, bye now
- Okay, I'm gone

16
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,875
My poor feet!

17
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,779
I told you the party will
wear you out

18
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:18,407
- That was neat, huh?
- Yeah

19
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,492
What's Jacques doing?

20
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,095
He's necking with a brunette
Sophie, I think

21
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,106
No, Lili's her name

22
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,506
Lili or Sophie
She's got a cute burn!

23
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:50,103
Nicole wouldn't shove off
I couldn't get near Natalie

24
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,307
- Jean-Marc's girl?
- Yup

25
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:54,907
A cracking lay according to him!

26
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,919
- Any whisky left?
- Check the cabinet

27
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:01,753
Sorry not to help
but I've got something going

28
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,156
- Aren't you leaving tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'm flying to Japan

29
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,557
At dawn, forget that
the concierge'll clean tomorrow

30
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,061
Just tiding up a bit

31
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:12,555
Hey, up all night then jet lag
in Japan... What a man!

32
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,569
That bum of hers!
A real dish!

33
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,366
We were just talking about that

34
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,268
Is it Lili or Sophie?

35
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:24,265
Clementine, guys
Did you score, Michel?

36
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,474
I've 34 drawings to deliver in 10 days
and no nights till then

37
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:32,074
But I'll catch up
Anyway, leave Clementine's number

38
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:35,382
I'll leave it by the door
tomorrow morning

39
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,583
I'll mark it with an X
If she's worth it

40
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:39,989
Well I'd better go

41
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:42,822
I won't wake you
See you in three weeks

42
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:05,279
Oh, wait, wait
I forgot something...

43
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,964
I'm so beat, I can't walk
I'm really beat

44
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,499
I feel like collapsing

45
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:45,777
Hell, I forgot to tell 'em
about the package!

46
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:47,786
Valery!

47
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,789
I've got to make a call

48
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:53,188
Sorry, captain...
I'll be right back...

49
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,418
I got it...

50
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,596
A package, Sunday...
They'll come for it on Thursday...

51
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:02,532
No problem... We'll put it aside
And mum's the word...

52
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,228
I'm in a meeting... Bye...

53
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,066
Kisses to the geishas!

54
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,736
I'm going for croissants...
3 or 4?

55
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,747
- What time's it?
- 10, To work!

56
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,249
- But I was at it till 6!
- Finished?

57
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,343
I didn't get anywhere

58
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:25,547
Like I said, coffee, croissants
and to work!

59
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,953
3 or 4?

60
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,478
6!!!

61
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,197
FOR JACQUES

62
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,905
What the hell is that?

63
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,007
You got to be kidding...

64
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,324
Michel!

65
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,725
Wake up!

66
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,127
- Hurry, come here!
- What is it!

67
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:14,064
Come see what's on the doorstep, quick!
That's some of a joke!

68
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:21,936
What is that?

69
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:25,272
You see, it's a basket
with a baby in it and a letter on it

70
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:30,338
Dearest Jacques, here's Marie
the fruit of our passion

71
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,438
I'll be in the States
for 6 months

72
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:35,247
Take good care of her
Good luck-Sylvia...

73
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,753
A nice gift from Jacques
to keep us amused...

74
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:39,550
- What're we gonna do?
- Give ger back!

75
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,455
- But she went to the states!
- There must be a way

76
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,753
- Got her number?
- Whose?

77
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:47,058
- Sylvia's!
- Why would l? Never heard of the girl!

78
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:50,155
- Don't you know her?
- No way!

79
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:54,157
If I had to know of all Jacques' girls
I'd be a full-time secretary!

80
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:57,171
- What're we gonna do?
- Look, she's waking up...

81
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:58,797
Look, she's laughing...

82
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:02,736
Now, she's crying!

83
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:07,409
- Please, she's not gonna start crying?
- It's getting serious

84
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,814
It's too much!
What are you going to do?

85
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,818
Now she's really crying!

86
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,012
- What's wrong with her?
- May be she's hungry

87
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:15,714
- Hungry?...
- May be we should feed her...

88
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:17,723
- With what...
- Milk

89
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:20,920
What has he done to us!
What a bastard!

90
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,427
A little package...

91
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,225
Just put it aside
till next Thursday...

92
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,923
- How can we take care of her?
- Call Jacques' mother

93
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,125
How could she stop this racket
from 500 miles?

94
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,431
- At least to ask her advice...
- That old harpy!

95
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,131
I can already hear
the questions firing...

96
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,935
What would Jacques do to us
if he finds out we called his mother?

97
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,636
- I could call my own mother...
- Leave our mothers out, please!

98
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,237
I promised Jacques to keep it secret
Let's handle it on our own

99
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,646
Let our mothers in
and we're stuck for 10 years!

100
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:48,243
Besides, if a woman stays here
more than a night, I move out

101
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:51,447
- We made a deal
- All right, go and ask the chemist

102
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:53,956
Good thinking
Damn! it's closed on Sunday!

103
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,151
- The 24-hour pharmacy...
- I'll go

104
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,557
You take the baby

105
00:08:57,594 --> 00:09:01,029
Take the baby!
I've never carried any...I'll drop it!

106
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:33,148
OK, ok, don't cry...
I'll hold you.

107
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:38,723
What's the best brand?

108
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,732
It depends on your
pediatrician's prescription...

109
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,233
The pediatrician, of course...

110
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:43,929
Give me the most popular

111
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:49,235
- All brands are popular, they're all good
- Ok, give me that one

112
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:51,742
- This one's formula-milk
- Is that bad?

113
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,835
No, It's very good

114
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,539
What's the difference?

115
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,549
The formula...
This one's formula-milk too

116
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,948
So there're several...

117
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,746
First age, or second?

118
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:04,845
- There are two ages?
- How old is the baby?

119
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,449
Well... It's a baby...
A little baby...

120
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,949
Stop crying!
Will you ever stop?

121
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:15,555
Please, just go to sleep!
What the hell is that jerk doing?

122
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,066
She seem very hungry

123
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,501
Please, sleep, baby!

124
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,562
Does she have teeth yet?

125
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,972
- That'd tell us about her age
- I didn't look

126
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:30,375
If she hasn't, she's probably
younger than 6 months now

127
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,573
- If she has teeth...
- She's older than 6 months!

128
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,980
Not at all, she could very well
have had teeth at 3 or 4 months

129
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:38,985
- Oh...
- Then...you need first-age milk

130
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,782
And still
it depends on the brand!

131
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:44,086
Some cover 3 months, some 4

132
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:46,684
- Other brands...
- How am I supposed to know?

133
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,694
- What's her weight?
- Well...the weight...

134
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,696
Weigh her
and according to her weight...

135
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,097
Never mind...
I'll take both ages

136
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,498
And see about the teeth

137
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,197
- Do you want bottles?
- Yes

138
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,534
The nipples, regular or 3-speed...
Ah, you can shift speeds...

139
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,267
There are different nipples, too?

140
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,669
It's about time!

141
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:17,548
Here's a package for you
What've you got there?

142
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:20,250
Oh, it's so cute! Is it yours?

143
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,656
- No
- It's so adorable

144
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,557
- Hi!... is it a boy?
- Yes... No, a girl

145
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,960
What's the baby girl's name?

146
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:30,057
- It's Marie
- lsn't that cute, Marie...

147
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,365
- I didn't know you had a baby
- No, it's not me...mine!

148
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,962
- Pierre's?
- No, Jacques

149
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:38,872
I mean, not Jacques' either
It's been lent to us

150
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,966
I mean...
she's leaving Thursday

151
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,774
- But where's her mummy?
- Ok, I'll put her to bed

152
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:47,474
You?
But where's her mother?

153
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:53,385
- She'll be back
- Here's an urgent package.../Can I hold her?

154
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:58,084
What nice fat cheekies!
You can tell she's well-fad

155
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,720
You're a chubby little thing...
Hey, she's soaked!

156
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,821
It's number 2...
Can I help change her?

157
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:08,233
Leave it, I'm experienced
Goodbye, Mrs Rodriguez

158
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:12,533
There, there, don't cry!

159
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:15,938
- I'm closing the door
- Well, I'll come back to see her

160
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,772
Sure, goodbye

161
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,375
What a leech!
And that other clown, where's he?

162
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:26,047
Go on, cry...

163
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:28,450
For her you smile
but for me it's all pouts

164
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:31,649
And who's been hauling you
around for hours?

165
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,248
How do you make a bottle?

166
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,157
First, you sterilize the bottles
Then...

167
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,354
Sterilize? How?

168
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:40,989
Well, to sterilize a bottle...

169
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,865
What the hell were you doing?
It's been hours!

170
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:49,963
I've had it, cries incessantly that brat
You're a real asshole!

171
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:51,871
Hey, you've never
talked to me like that!

172
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:54,376
What took you so long?
Had breakfast on the way?

173
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,175
- I haven't had a cup of coffee!
- Cut out the act

174
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,909
I had no coffee
The pharmacy took an hour!

175
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:03,509
- Here! I've got to work
- Why are you giving her to me?

176
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:06,612
I can't hold her and make a bottle
And why should I hold her?

177
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,815
That's your business
You found the kid!

178
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:12,019
That takes it!
You're the Bastard of the Year!

179
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,826
I'd like to point out that I found her
on my way out for your breakfast...

180
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,424
There she goes again...
Better feed her

181
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,629
It isn't that easy...
Frist, I must check the teeth

182
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,730
- Why?
- Food is different according to age

183
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,832
- We look on top or on the bottom?
- I don't know

184
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,775
Feel with your finger

185
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,942
Nothing... She must be less
than 9 months, I'll try first age

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,144
- She's soaked, get any nappies?
- Dammit!

187
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,447
I forgot that!

188
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,081
This time I'll go
lt'll be much quicker

189
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:53,758
You have the basic pad
the disposable nappy

190
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:56,960
- with elasticated legs or...
- Give me the most absorbent!

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,297
Maxy plus?

192
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,436
My trousers!

193
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:11,045
What a swine, she did it

194
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,344
Hand me the cotton

195
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:21,454
- Don't let her go!
- Take the cotton yourself, then

196
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,926
Hold her, for God's sake!

197
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,326
Hold her?
She's hysterical, this kid!

198
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:31,025
- Get rid of that towel
- She'll soil the couch

199
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:34,124
That shit sticks!
It won't get off easily

200
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,533
We'd need some kind of lotion...

201
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,036
- Aftershave?
- You nuts?

202
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,665
- Waste Saint-Laurent on this?
- Let's just put on the diapers

203
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,270
- The tabs go in the front or back?
- Who cares?

204
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:49,876
Hold her under the arms
I'll try this way

205
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,553
What's this crap?
They're much too big!

206
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:56,781
Not at all!
The more absorbent the better

207
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,284
But how does this work?

208
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:02,918
- Would you hold her!
- I'm weakening...

209
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,230
I didn't tighten it enough...

210
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:24,145
- What about laying her down...
- Not there, it's full of shit!

211
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,119
What the hell is the matter
with this diaper!

212
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:34,020
To think they bug us
all day long

213
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:36,923
with their TV ads...
Look, this stuff's worthless

214
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,224
Stick it, it gaps
unstick it, it's a mess

215
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,251
Let's start again

216
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,227
Oh, no she's pissing now!

217
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:49,634
The couch...
What a wretch this kid is!

218
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,230
The second the pad is off
and WHAMO

219
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:54,035
It's your fault, too

220
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:55,541
These nappies don't fit

221
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,133
D'you find them
in the fat ladies department?

222
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,441
It's floods for sure
I care about my furniture!

223
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:02,607
I'll go buy others
Meanwhile, you can clean up the couch

224
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,517
Fat lady, yourself!

225
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:38,212
Mr Jacques Duchemin...
Yes, he's a steward...

226
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,614
He's on a flight to Japan...

227
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,710
Yes, a very, very urgent message...
Family problem

228
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,017
He must call home immediately
because then he's going

229
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:51,425
to Thailand for 3 weeks
and will be unreachable

230
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,449
Thank you

231
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:55,759
- May be she's hungry...
- Already?

232
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,298
Hurry! She's famished

233
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:12,508
- Is it done?
- Coming!

234
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:05,490
God, wet again!

235
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,510
- You can't leave me alone
I can't handle it/-I'm seeing Nathalie

236
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,444
You really stink!
Me, do I go out?

237
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,036
I've been after
her for 2 months

238
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,241
Do that and I'm packing!

239
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:08,683
What a drag you are!
It was tonight or never!

240
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:17,755
I've got in a real mess...
My partner just called,

241
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:20,786
I've got to work all night
on a project for tomorrow

242
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,190
Of course not
I'm not seeing anyone else...

243
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:29,493
I swear, Nathalie...
I'm not lying...

244
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:13,209
It's Pierre... Iisten, I'm ill
Tell everybody

245
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,838
that I won't be at the agency
till Friday

246
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:50,432
Avoid pork, brains
fish, game, duck...

247
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,128
Wait before giving
wine and coffee...

248
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:56,536
In order to avoid stress
and fatigue, normal diet...

249
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:57,733
Ah, Restricted Foods!

250
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,072
Avoid artificial flavored food...

251
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:03,373
I'm sorry, Mr Porchat
I've got problems

252
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:06,506
The drawing won't be ready
before the end of next week

253
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:10,314
No, not this one, the one after

254
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,512
I'm really sorry

255
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,278
He didn't say what time?

256
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,783
He said Thursday, that's all

257
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,580
But Thursday is vague
We may rot here till 8 o'clock!

258
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,086
It's Ok as long as she goes

259
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:29,682
Then it's freedom for us
No more sleepless nights!

260
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,989
He could've called...
He must have our message by now

261
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:35,791
He wallows in Thai saunas
while we're up shit creek!

262
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:38,593
How could he act like this
dumping his shit on us!

263
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:41,533
We should drag him here
Hell with vacation!

264
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:46,029
- Bottle time soon...
- What a drag!

265
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,107
- Jacques Duchemin's?
- Yes

266
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,949
- We've come for the package
- Some package!

267
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,750
You can tell Sylvia she's a bitch!

268
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:05,347
- Sylvia?
- Yes, Sylvia!

269
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,654
Dumping on people like that!

270
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:10,957
- We shouldn't be mixed up in it
- We didn't know...a mix-up?

271
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:12,963
How could she just
dump her baby here?

272
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,555
It's okay to leave it here

273
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:17,362
but Jacques is in Japan
we coped with it all

274
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:20,962
- I don't understand
- You could've left a number...

275
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,562
We didn't even know
the kind of milk

276
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,664
Anyway, now you're here

277
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,677
She's got a bottle in 45 minutes
It's ready in the basket

278
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:30,475
There's a supply of nappies
lotions and everything...

279
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:34,573
But...iIt's a real one!

280
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,584
We don't really know her age

281
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:40,679
but I use 6 measures of powder
for 3 ounces of water

282
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:43,317
Here's the box of milk
plus one extra

283
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:47,326
Oh! get it... Powdered milk!

284
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,388
Okay... Good luck

285
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,797
Wait a sec...
we'll take the basket and the milk

286
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:55,701
but not the...
I mean, not what's inside?

287
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:56,795
What's inside?

288
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:59,931
you take the lot
it's a package deal

289
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:03,037
You carry it

290
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:04,941
We will go now

291
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:06,673
Where are you taking her?

292
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,246
Where it's planned

293
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:14,082
Don't you have a number, an address
so we know how she is?

294
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,051
I don't have it on me...
I'll contact you later

295
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:21,285
- Good bye
- Good bye

296
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:26,389
- Good riddance!
- To work, at last!

297
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:38,700
Care of Jacques...

298
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:43,505
Michel!

299
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:46,175
- What's this?
- A package, what else?

300
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:47,876
- Did you get this package?
- Yeah, why?

301
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,385
- When did it come?
- Don't shout!

302
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,580
When did it arrive?

303
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:54,681
I don't know... on Sunday
Mrs Rodriguez brought it up

304
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:55,985
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

305
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:58,993
The baby and the package
both came on Sunday!

306
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:00,927
- So?
- This is the package they came for

307
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:04,420
- not the kid, you moron!
- What package? What are you saying?

308
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:07,367
Look out the window
I'll run after them

309
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:12,071
Holy hell! Holy smoke!
Holy shit!

310
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,196
- Can you see them?
- There... with the bike...

311
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,914
Wait... Wait!

312
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,517
I'm glad I caught you...
There's a big mistake...

313
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:06,317
You must give me the basket
It was the wrong package

314
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:09,222
- The package you came for
- Shut up, there's a cop...

315
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:12,352
If you squealed on us
I'll blowyour brains out

316
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:17,055
Hello, gentlemen
What're you doing with that?

317
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,229
Were you trying to put the baby
on this motorcycle?

318
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:23,533
Of course not

319
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:25,937
Then why were you attaching it?

320
00:27:25,974 --> 00:27:28,442
They were just watching it for me
while I bought cigarettes

321
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:31,273
Registration papers, please

322
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,573
Give him the papers

323
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:42,845
Shit! I left it at home

324
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,357
Follow me to the station
we'll see about that

325
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,757
It's bottle time, I've got to go

326
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:50,660
Your papers, please

327
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:53,062
- Why me? What did I do?
- Show me your lD

328
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,464
I don't have them
I just went out for cigarettes

329
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,660
To the station, you too

330
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,829
Let's be serious, I can't take
my passport, voting card

331
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,203
rent book whenever
I go out for cigarettes?

332
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,003
And with a baby, huh?

333
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,906
Anyway, I have to give her
a bottle in 15 minutes

334
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:07,604
I can't go to the station now

335
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,944
Stop! Stop!...

336
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:20,314
Let's get to it
I asked for your papers!

337
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:22,722
Give me a break, officer
I've a bottle to give...

338
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,125
- I live next door...
- Then I'll follow you

339
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:29,222
Can't fool me!
Which way?

340
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:30,253
This way

341
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:38,339
So you don't know them?

342
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:39,431
I told you I don't know them

343
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:41,338
But you give them
your baby to watch?

344
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,936
- Just the time to buy cigarettes
- You go buy cigarettes

345
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:49,541
and they tie the basket
on their bike?

346
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:52,984
Can you go prepare the bottle
she's hungry

347
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,852
- Who's he?
- He's my flatmate

348
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:01,884
- I see, I see...
- No, 3 of us live together here

349
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,589
Even better!

350
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,426
Excuse me, please...
I'll go get the bottle

351
00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:15,536
We've got a real problem

352
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:19,398
See this package, it's dope
That's what those guys came for

353
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:21,912
If that cop finds it here
we're in for 15 years

354
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:25,404
So hide it wherever you want
but it's got to go

355
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,715
But not completely!
They'll be back for the bloody thing!

356
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:32,415
And then it's our lives
for their smack!

357
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:35,550
Let's sitck together
Michel, we're in deep

358
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,125
I picked it up...

359
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:49,228
It's a collect call
from Bangkok, Thailand

360
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:51,136
- Will you take it, sir?
- I accept...

361
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:54,437
Yes, I'll take it

362
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:57,138
Jacques? It's Pierre...

363
00:29:57,178 --> 00:30:02,138
Yes, we left a message...
No, no... Nothing special

364
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:04,742
We just wanted to hear from you...

365
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:09,051
Yes, the package came... And went

366
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:11,649
Why didn't you call earlier?

367
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:15,957
A what? A hot deal? I see...

368
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:19,988
You're lucky... I was saying
you're lucky...you, at least

369
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,766
Have a nice vacation...
See you in two weeks, bye now

370
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:26,669
So, your friend is in Thailand...

371
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:30,163
He couldn't call before
Because he is onto a hot deal

372
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,574
And he asks if the package came...

373
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:35,079
Seems I'm also onto a hot deal!

374
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:37,308
You'll explain to the chief

375
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:50,381
Good morning...What is it?

376
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:52,280
Nothing... A misunderstanding

377
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:55,184
- Did you give her the 5:30 bottle?
- I just did

378
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,313
- And changed her?
- No, she's wet

379
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,112
I'll do it

380
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:24,444
He's a steward...
He oftens flies to Tokyo

381
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,946
But why Thailand?

382
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:28,643
- He can vacation where he wants
- And he's making a move?

383
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:31,049
He was talking about some girl
He's very into it

384
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:34,351
In your opinion, why did your
baby sitters take off?

385
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:36,357
I told you I don't know them

386
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:39,848
And who's your friend
who just came in?

387
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:42,260
He's a cartoonist
We share the apartment

388
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,263
Whose child is it?

389
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:46,460
Jacques, we're keeping her
because the mother's in the States

390
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,900
They're separated
I've told you this 10 times

391
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,058
Okay, honey bun...

392
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,455
Let's go take a good nap

393
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,848
- A Martini?
- No, thanks

394
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:47,049
Don't leave Paris
in the next few days

395
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,147
- See you soon
- Good bye, detective

396
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,648
Come back when you want
you'll always be welcome

397
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,594
We've no particular plans
to leave Paris...

398
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:58,897
Good bye

399
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:05,600
It's the pits
They'll be on our asses

400
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:07,698
- Where's the package?
- Stowed away, don't worny

401
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:08,935
Where?

402
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,008
- This way, it's right on hand
- You crazy?

403
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,809
I put it under the cop's nose
he never caught on!

404
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:17,907
I told them we're keeping her
until Jacques comes back

405
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,919
we're in for another 15 days!

406
00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:25,218
- And I'm scheduled to work today...
Hey, don't let me down!

407
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:26,315
We'll share the work

408
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:30,624
Alone with her plus the cops, I'll crack
Take a maternity leave!

409
00:34:30,662 --> 00:34:33,563
Wait till we hear from the gang

410
00:34:41,972 --> 00:34:45,430
I won't be in for 2 weeks...
Something came up

411
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,443
Just personal problems

412
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:48,466
Okay, put him on

413
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,643
I can't explain...
I'm in a mess, that's all

414
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:56,345
Yes, yes, no, that's not it

415
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,684
Cool down, I'm coming
but only for an hour

416
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,182
I have to go to the office

417
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,385
I must go show them my drawings
otherwise they won't pay

418
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:06,087
- Right now?
- I've got 2 hours

419
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:07,095
before her next bottle

420
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:09,290
Dammit! I've got to go out too
They want me pronto

421
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:11,594
- A contract's pending...
- Go later

422
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,497
It'll be too late, it's 5 to 6

423
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:15,593
Same goes here
my boss leaves at 6:30

424
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:18,503
I can't anymore...

425
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:20,097
How did we get into such a jam!

426
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:23,507
What if we left her at Mrs Rodriguez?

427
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:25,135
Brillant!
Let's bring her the basket

428
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:38,020
Shit

429
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:39,422
the cops are already
grilling her!

430
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,926
We can't serve the dope
to them on a platter...

431
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:44,828
She's just had a bottle, she'll sleep

432
00:35:44,863 --> 00:35:45,830
Let's leave her upstairs

433
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:48,127
What can happen?
She's like clockwork

434
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,134
She won't budge

435
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,568
Sure! We'll be right back anyway

436
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:24,824
Michel, are you th!...

437
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,231
Michel, did you come al...

438
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,029
What the...

439
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:41,444
Marie!

440
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:46,541
Where are you!

441
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,021
My baby!

442
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:40,331
My precious!

443
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:18,551
- Come in, sirs...
- Search warrant...

444
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:21,253
Go right ahead, sirs, it's all there

445
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:23,660
I see you already had visitors...

446
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,163
But what is it you're looking for?

447
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,860
Probably the same thing
as your visitors

448
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:30,869
Didn't the concierge bring you
a package last Sunday?

449
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:32,200
It was chocolate

450
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:34,794
Let's get to work!

451
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,109
Would you mind if I look
in the bed, please?

452
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,491
I'll search the basket
if you don't object...

453
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:03,521
Please do

454
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:17,240
Thank you very much...

455
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:27,419
Good day...
We regret you didn't find anything

456
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:30,014
Thanks, see you sometime, maybe...
Have a safe trip home

457
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:33,754
We may find something sooner
than you think, wise ass

458
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:41,333
- Pierre! Pierre!
- Careful

459
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:42,231
They'll tail us

460
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:44,532
I bet there are already
two of them downstairs

461
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,663
I'll watch from the window
let's test it

462
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:15,498
I was right

463
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:18,329
They're there for good
We've got to play tight

464
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,201
Did you like the new decor?

465
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:28,732
Watch out, the cops are on us
See you at the meat stand

466
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:43,517
We were going to give it to you

467
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:44,819
We never tried to cross you moron
but we're being shadowed

468
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:47,828
Between 3 and 5 at Parc Monceau...

469
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,124
But the cops'll be there, too

470
00:41:49,163 --> 00:41:52,222
- Think I'm that dumb?
- You microhead

471
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:55,632
I'll slip you the package!
No risk!

472
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:57,830
I mean it! I love the kid
get it, scum?

473
00:41:57,871 --> 00:41:59,771
Parc Monceau, between 3 and 5

474
00:45:05,576 --> 00:45:11,640
Triple shit! What a jerk I am!

475
00:45:11,682 --> 00:45:15,344
Are you off your rocker?
What kind of slob are you?

476
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:17,284
Is it the latest thing
dumping rubbish?

477
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:22,453
Inside a trash can in Par Monceau?

478
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:24,686
- Yup!
- Good for you!

479
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:31,896
Why are you late?
If you keep...

480
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:35,794
- Me too?
- Yes

481
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:00,357
Only 7 more days...

482
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,759
4 more days...

483
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,562
Midnight...
Only a day and a half to go...

484
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:28,673
It's tomorrow... Tomorrow
God damn!

485
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:38,792
Customs... This way, please

486
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:07,147
I'm home!

487
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:09,247
Anybody home?

488
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:12,315
It's me!

489
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:13,757
You guys here?

490
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:17,161
I've got loads of presents for you...

491
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:20,862
Wake up!

492
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:25,463
Here you are...

493
00:47:29,374 --> 00:47:30,568
What's that monster?

494
00:47:33,178 --> 00:47:34,769
Here I am...

495
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,670
I've got presents for you...

496
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:42,574
What's with him?

497
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,990
What's wrong with you?
Why such long faces?

498
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,297
And what's that brat?

499
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,030
Is it because of that?

500
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,431
Well, we'll talk
when you stop sulking

501
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:24,314
And what that pigsty in my room?

502
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:26,120
Are you nuts?

503
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,424
Who the hell wrecked all my stuff?

504
00:48:29,462 --> 00:48:31,020
Answer me, guys!

505
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:33,623
I paid for the furniture, too

506
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:36,362
I demand some explaination!
I can demand reparation!

507
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:58,551
I already asked you about the brat...
I don't want that around

508
00:48:58,588 --> 00:49:01,079
Women are already out

509
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:02,887
so family life, forget it!

510
00:49:02,926 --> 00:49:06,384
Listen pal, you sit down
and open your ears up

511
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,523
You'll soon change your tune

512
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:12,197
What is this zoo?

513
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:14,293
And stop talking to me
like that, all right?

514
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:17,203
I'm talking like this
because you're a pain!

515
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:19,605
You have caused all the problems!

516
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:21,108
You think we like kids
n this house?

517
00:49:21,142 --> 00:49:23,610
But, when it's forced on you
you have to cope with it!

518
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:25,704
And that package!

519
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:26,805
And the apartment...

520
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:30,409
All our stuff is broken!
There's nothing left!

521
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:32,919
And we're exhausted
We've hardly slept in 3 weeks

522
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:36,616
A bottle every 3 hours, 2 at night
plus cops around the clock...

523
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,318
Real hide and seek!

524
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:41,418
And out of the blue, our hero calls
I'm in Bangkok...

525
00:49:41,462 --> 00:49:43,327
I'm onto a hot deal...
Did the package come?

526
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,830
Coming, it came!
2 of them!

527
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:48,732
Michel couldn't deliver his drawings
he may lose five thousand...

528
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:50,633
I couldn't go to the agency
in twenty days!

529
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,230
A real maternity leave!
My partner is screaming on the phone!

530
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:56,536
We had to juggle the cops
the dealers and the kid...

531
00:49:56,575 --> 00:50:00,033
And without Michel's brilliant idea
of hiding the dope

532
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:02,046
...in the nappy, hello jail!

533
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,744
- We nearly freaked out!
- They ransack the place

534
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:09,548
Pierre comes home
he finds it in the toilet

535
00:50:09,587 --> 00:50:13,148
- Boy, was he in a state...
- That's not the problem

536
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:18,856
We've been drowning in bottles, and shit
for three weeks, and we've had it!

537
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:21,557
What is this?
Cops? Baby?

538
00:50:21,598 --> 00:50:23,259
And who broke in here?

539
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:26,666
And why two packages?
And who dumped this kid on you?

540
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:28,364
And why didn't you go to work?
I don't understand

541
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:33,272
Why, why... two days with the kid
and you'll understand why!

542
00:50:33,308 --> 00:50:35,367
But who is that damn kid, anyway?

543
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:40,211
Her name's Marie and you shouldn't spit on
her because she's your daughter!

544
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:44,480
Can't waste our lives
wiping a baby's ass

545
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:45,918
Even if it's yours!

546
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:53,823
Paul? I brought you back a present...

547
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:56,518
Can't wait to see you...

548
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:08,202
Their only solution was
doped nappies, clever, no?

549
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:11,411
What are you talking about
doped nappies?

550
00:51:11,452 --> 00:51:13,920
Maybe you don't know I've got
a baby on my hands

551
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:18,325
Thanks to you!
Call that being a pal?

552
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,521
Have you asked yourself what
I'm supposed to do with the baby?

553
00:51:20,563 --> 00:51:23,327
- Is it your idea of friendship?
- Who's that damned baby, anyway?

554
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:27,827
I'm warning you, don't insult her

555
00:51:27,873 --> 00:51:30,534
Damn baby yourself!
it's my daughter!

556
00:51:30,575 --> 00:51:33,942
So don't spit on!

557
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,574
Say, mum, I'm bringing you
a little surprise...

558
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:40,076
If I tell, it's no surprise

559
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,447
You will soon find out

560
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:44,958
I think it'll make you very happy

561
00:51:44,993 --> 00:51:48,053
The next 4 are ready
lt'll last you till tomorrow

562
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:50,156
- Alright
- Tell her to let her sleep a lot

563
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,259
- Okay
- If her arse is red

564
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:53,565
tell her not to listen
to doctor's bullshits

565
00:51:53,604 --> 00:51:56,663
The only cure is a bottle
of water instead of milk

566
00:51:56,707 --> 00:51:59,369
In 3 hours, it's fixed
A miracle, a bottom like marble!

567
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:00,309
Give her water, got it

568
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:02,905
Pierre says to wash her clothes
with soap flakes

569
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:05,712
Where she's going
you'll find soap flakes, no problem!

570
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:07,845
Rinse 3 times in hot water

571
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:10,221
Rinse 3 times...

572
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:13,715
To help her sleep
we sing two-part lullabies

573
00:52:13,762 --> 00:52:17,129
- But my mother lives alone!
- She'll sing alone

574
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:18,928
All she has to do
is sing her a lullaby

575
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:20,435
- Got it
- And about the nipples

576
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:24,030
There're 3 speeds on the nipples!
Always use the slowest

577
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:29,034
...Number 1...It's super super important
The slowest, always

578
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:30,547
Otherwise it flows too fast
and it's bad for her digest...

579
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:32,777
I'd better hurry
I'll miss my plane

580
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:36,856
- Anyone here?
- There's me

581
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,755
- And Jacques?
- He went to Nice

582
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:40,454
He comes and goes the same day...
What a nerve!

583
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,654
He took Marie to his mother

584
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:44,756
- I made him 4 bottles of milk
- What an asshole!

585
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,268
Don't worry, I prepared 4 bot...

586
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:49,965
This guy's killing me!

587
00:52:50,006 --> 00:52:53,566
- What's wrong?
- He could've called me, at least!

588
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:57,274
- Sad she's gone?
- Absolutely not! What're you making up?

589
00:52:57,315 --> 00:52:59,510
I'm relieved! Good riddance!

590
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:03,612
- I prepared 4 bot...
- That lunkhead could've said something...

591
00:53:03,657 --> 00:53:05,624
Unbelievable...

592
00:53:05,658 --> 00:53:09,617
There're such things as phones!

593
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:13,155
...4 bottles for the trip!
I finally got it out!

594
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:29,347
God... Marie-Rose, look!
It seems I'm a grandmother

595
00:53:29,388 --> 00:53:30,685
Let me see her

596
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:38,294
God is she cute!

597
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:41,765
- What's her name again?
- Marie

598
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,362
Almost like you, Marie-Rose...

599
00:53:44,406 --> 00:53:47,569
God, to think I'm a grandmother...

600
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:51,376
You could've let me know earlier...
It's incredible...

601
00:53:51,415 --> 00:53:54,474
You never call, never write
never come to see me...

602
00:53:54,518 --> 00:53:56,076
But I'm here now

603
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,820
Did you see, she smiled at me...

604
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:03,919
Who's her mother?
Won't you introduce me?

605
00:54:03,962 --> 00:54:05,725
She's gone to the States for 6 months

606
00:54:05,765 --> 00:54:08,325
So who's taking care
of the baby for you?

607
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:11,827
Well, I was actually thinking of you...

608
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:15,240
I thought may be you'd like
to have her, till her mother's back

609
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:18,246
Yes, of course...

610
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:23,742
But the fact is that I'm leaving
in 3 days with Marie-Rose

611
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:25,948
on a cruise to the Caribbean
we're staying with friends

612
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,457
- Oh
- See, it's a real chance...

613
00:54:28,493 --> 00:54:30,961
A friend got us a cut-rate
on the cruise...

614
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:32,088
When will you be back?

615
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:36,957
I don't know... in 3 or 4 months...

616
00:54:37,004 --> 00:54:41,770
Then I'll be in Bordeaux to see a friends
So, I can't take care of her

617
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:43,572
- You've got loads of friends!
- That's right

618
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:45,978
The senior citizens card's great...

619
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:48,505
And I get bored here...
I'm so lonely...

620
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,280
Marie-Rose and I have so much fun

621
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:58,886
Remember last year in Marrakesh?
God, we really pigged out

622
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,525
See Marie, your granny's going
on a flink in the Caribbean

623
00:55:02,568 --> 00:55:05,161
She'll bring you a big exotic toy

624
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:24,955
- You brought her back?
- Yeah

625
00:55:24,996 --> 00:55:27,259
She's starving
put the bottle on

626
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:30,358
What happened?
Did you have a fight?

627
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:32,461
Damned senior citizens cards!

628
00:55:32,505 --> 00:55:36,498
- She refused?
- She's leaving for the Caribbean

629
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:40,405
then to Bordeaux to stay
with friends, then off again

630
00:55:41,817 --> 00:55:43,478
Has she got friends!

631
00:55:43,518 --> 00:55:45,884
The apple never falls far from the tree

632
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:48,186
- What do you mean?
- Nothing

633
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:49,715
You're not her son for nothing

634
00:55:50,827 --> 00:55:54,729
What would she do
in her age than travel

635
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,496
Old age doesn't exist anymore!

636
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:59,765
You have to come back, that's final

637
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:02,973
I travel, I can't take care of her...

638
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:05,769
Yes, but you're her mother!

639
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,771
What proves, I'm really her father?

640
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,980
The dates coincide...
That proves nothing

641
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,785
So you know it?

642
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:22,087
I don't, so you come back
and take her, Now!

643
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,294
Sylvia!

644
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:28,066
Sylvia, hello? Hello!

645
00:56:28,106 --> 00:56:29,801
Sylvia... For heaven's sake!

646
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,469
The bitch, she hung up!

647
00:56:33,513 --> 00:56:38,176
She's doing this on purpose!
I will find her, I will!

648
00:56:38,218 --> 00:56:39,583
Don't you have her address?

649
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:43,785
She got my message through
her agency, and called from a hotel

650
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:46,192
She's modeling all over the country

651
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:48,789
every week a new city
I'll never find her

652
00:56:48,831 --> 00:56:50,492
Especially now

653
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:52,933
she must've given
them the word about me

654
00:56:58,844 --> 00:57:02,540
Good evening, sir... Mrs Rapons
from Second Mother Agency...

655
00:57:02,582 --> 00:57:04,482
Oh, hello
Do come in, do come in

656
00:57:07,488 --> 00:57:08,785
Step this way

657
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:14,291
Wait a minute, please

658
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,100
Who's that?

659
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,300
A woman Must be the nurse
he found through an agency

660
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:38,184
- She wants to see Marie
- She's sleeping

661
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:39,920
Too bad, she's got to see her

662
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:43,193
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything

663
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:45,096
Don't go in my room
she's sleeping

664
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:48,000
Mrs Rapons the nurse...
She wants to see her

665
00:57:48,037 --> 00:57:51,097
Don't wake her up!
It'll take me an hour to calm her

666
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:52,403
I know, but she wants to see her!

667
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:57,403
- I'll go explain
- Please, I'm begging you, don't go

668
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,077
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it
- No, I'll do it

669
00:58:09,597 --> 00:58:13,191
Want to bet in 15 minutes
she'll slam out of the place?

670
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:18,068
If you can't even understand
that one shouldn't wake a child

671
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:20,372
take a refresher course

672
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:23,379
Sir, let me remind you
I never wanted to wake her

673
00:58:23,414 --> 00:58:26,076
but only to see her
Slight difference!

674
00:58:26,117 --> 00:58:30,577
It's normal I see the child
I'll be caring for night and day

675
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:33,091
Night and day?
You mean you'll be sleeping here?

676
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:35,890
Of course!
A second mother is a second mother!

677
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,693
- Where'll you sleep?
- If you'd please show me to my room...

678
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:41,098
I don't knowwhere Jacques
wants to stick you...

679
00:58:41,136 --> 00:58:42,000
May be in his room...

680
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:45,803
But I'm warning you
the 3 of us are real studs!

681
00:58:45,842 --> 00:58:46,809
That's not my concern

682
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:49,606
It'd be a shame at your age...
if you'd taken chastity vows

683
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:51,307
My concern is children

684
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:53,612
and as for screwing
I've got all I need at home

685
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:56,620
With a couple of days off a month
I wouldn't have any problem

686
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,213
My only interest here is the child

687
00:58:58,257 --> 00:59:00,451
and I can see she needs care

688
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:01,652
Oh really?
And why may I ask?

689
00:59:01,694 --> 00:59:05,755
It's quite clear listening to you, sir

690
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,165
Besides, you're not the father

691
00:59:07,201 --> 00:59:09,362
Now listen, Mrs Parons...
Ronpas...

692
00:59:09,404 --> 00:59:13,669
- It's Rapons, Mrs Rapons!
- Parons, Ronpas, Parons, hell!

693
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,370
- It's Rapons, Mrs Rapons!
- Rapons, whatever

694
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:18,175
The mother one can always tell
who she is

695
00:59:18,215 --> 00:59:21,378
but the father, who knows?
get off my back!

696
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:23,579
Never mind!
I won't talk to you

697
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,383
Show me the kitchen
and the bathroom, please!

698
00:59:25,423 --> 00:59:27,983
- Why?
- To prepare your shopping list

699
00:59:28,027 --> 00:59:30,393
You don't shop yourself?

700
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:33,193
No shopping, washing or cleaning
I'm a trained nurse

701
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:34,096
We don't need a thing

702
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:35,897
Have you sufficient
fruits and vegetables?

703
00:59:35,936 --> 00:59:39,497
We don't give her any of that
Only milk and cereal for now

704
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,007
It's not enough

705
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:43,409
At 3 months
you can begin a normal diet

706
00:59:43,445 --> 00:59:44,912
- That's bullshit
- Why?

707
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,005
You can't feed a baby
like an adult!

708
00:59:46,048 --> 00:59:48,608
- How do you know?
- I read books

709
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,415
The diets doctors prescribe today
are much too rich

710
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:53,116
I have my own special recipe
Mrs. Purons

711
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:54,715
It's Rapons, Mrs. Rapons

712
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:58,023
For example, what do you do
when they can't sleep?

713
00:59:58,063 --> 01:00:02,124
I try to calm them down
Sometimes, I give a sedative

714
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:03,829
I knew it, you cretin!

715
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:06,135
I said there's no point to this
I will not speak to you

716
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:07,333
I'm fully trained

717
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:10,434
I use the methods recommended
by the greatest pediatricians

718
01:00:10,478 --> 01:00:12,241
Medicine is serious

719
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,443
Know the song, Medicine's a whore
the chemist's her pimp?

720
01:00:15,484 --> 01:00:18,647
We probably don't appreciate
the same music I like opera myself

721
01:00:18,688 --> 01:00:22,555
Mrs. Napons, stay one more minute
and I'll break your neck!

722
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:25,153
- This my house, get out!
- It's Mrs. Rapons!

723
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:28,063
I've unlimited patience with children

724
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,159
but I'm not qualified
to take care of lunatics

725
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:32,194
Good day, and best regards

726
01:00:39,214 --> 01:00:41,580
I told you... 15 minutes timed

727
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:43,277
Listen guys
what are we going to do?

728
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:45,183
I tried everything
but nothing worked

729
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:46,984
My mother went on a trip
Sylvia is in the states

730
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:49,992
Pierre doesn't want a nurse
no day care

731
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:52,393
Mrs Rodriguez's dropped us
since the cops

732
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,990
Even the cleaning lady ditched us
What do you want me to do?

733
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:57,593
Want me to take the kid away?
Go to the social worker?

734
01:00:57,635 --> 01:00:59,626
Here come the viloins...

735
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:01,333
Really, what do you suggest?

736
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:04,832
What I suggest is that since your mother
comes back in 4 months

737
01:01:04,879 --> 01:01:07,848
Iet's not waste energy
looking for solutions

738
01:01:07,883 --> 01:01:09,941
We'll get roganized
the 3 of us'll take care of her

739
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:13,147
- What's 4 months, anyway?
- Get organized? How?

740
01:01:13,188 --> 01:01:14,450
First, I'm always travelling

741
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,254
Ask to be grounded
for serious family obligations

742
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:19,159
That is out of the question

743
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:21,561
I chose the job for travelling
I won't stop travelling

744
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,863
Then it's the social worker, not us

745
01:01:23,902 --> 01:01:25,369
4-hour nights, I've had it!

746
01:01:25,403 --> 01:01:27,462
Take it easy!

747
01:01:27,506 --> 01:01:31,169
- You'll ask to be temporarily
grounded and you'll...
- No!

748
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:34,976
And you'll do the 6 to 10 shift

749
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:38,576
That's 2 bottles, 2 changes
Plus the shopping after work

750
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,783
Since I work at home
I'll take 10 to 6

751
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:45,486
I'll stroll her in the park
but no more house chores

752
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:48,496
Pierre, you'll do the
6 to 10 PM shift

753
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:52,297
2 bottles, 2 changes
You bathe her, supervise the diet/do the wash

754
01:01:52,336 --> 01:01:54,600
Gonna live like nuns!

755
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,903
And what if she wakes up at night?

756
01:01:56,942 --> 01:02:00,343
- I was sort of thinking of you...
- I don't do nights, no way

757
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,348
Needless to say me neither

758
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:05,749
Bastards! I'm on the longest
8 hours straight!

759
01:02:05,787 --> 01:02:09,153
Nights are out
Let her scream, but without me

760
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:11,158
You're a crook

761
01:02:11,192 --> 01:02:14,650
We give you the easiest shift
the morning when she's all rosy...

762
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,564
We're been on nights for weeks
now you turn up your nose?

763
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:20,660
She's your daughter, after all!
Are you that horny?

764
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:23,468
Horny yourself!

765
01:02:23,508 --> 01:02:26,875
I won't ask to be grounded
Piss off!

766
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:30,211
I don't need you
I'll find a solution on my own

767
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:33,808
< Personnel Office >

768
01:02:38,026 --> 01:02:40,187
- Jaques?
- Oh, hi

769
01:02:40,228 --> 01:02:42,889
- Anything wrong?
- No, it's all right

770
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:44,899
What were you doing
seeing the boss?

771
01:02:44,934 --> 01:02:46,697
I asked to be grounded

772
01:02:46,736 --> 01:02:51,230
- He said no?
- He said yes, that's just it

773
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:58,106
I'm off, she ate well
she's falling asleep

774
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,948
She's crying... I'll go get her

775
01:03:00,987 --> 01:03:03,455
Let her cry
She'll stop in 2 minutes

776
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:06,652
- Needs to burp
- She won't sleep if you carry her

777
01:03:06,693 --> 01:03:10,652
I knowyou let ger bawl
for hours, but I can't

778
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:12,257
I never let her bawl for hours!

779
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:15,566
You'd find any book theory
for not taking care of her

780
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:17,163
What a schmuck!

781
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:20,267
- Get off my back
- Quiet... It's 10

782
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:22,779
It's not your shift, so drop it!
So go to work

783
01:03:22,813 --> 01:03:26,112
I'll hold her for 2 minutes
and then put her back to bed

784
01:04:29,428 --> 01:04:32,124
Hi, Michel
I just came by for a file...

785
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,036
- Everything okay?
- Fine

786
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:47,541
- Then I'm off to work
- Okay

787
01:04:52,257 --> 01:04:54,554
- The kid's fine?
- Fine

788
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:42,108
You look at me
you smile at me...

789
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,743
You like your little bath...

790
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:25,726
- Hell, she's crying...
- who?

791
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:29,333
Nothing... I'll be right back

792
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:03,812
It's okay, right?
You are alright, right?

793
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,095
- She's crying?
- Whenever I put her down

794
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,829
- May be she's thirsty?
- No she's teething

795
01:07:21,339 --> 01:07:23,830
- What am I suppose to do?
- We bought a syrup

796
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:29,239
Try to put her down, we'll sing

797
01:08:15,939 --> 01:08:17,839
This guy's completely nuts!

798
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,549
Are you gonna sing all night?

799
01:08:31,558 --> 01:08:33,753
Oh, a baby...

800
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:35,752
Sorry

801
01:08:38,466 --> 01:08:40,730
- Who's that hag?
- Whatch your tongue!

802
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,032
Does she have to shout?

803
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:45,234
I'm the one in charge
give me a break

804
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:48,039
Stop fighting, you two
She's sleeping!

805
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,639
As for your little father-knows-best act
Drop it, I've had it!

806
01:08:51,682 --> 01:08:53,240
Right! Same for me!

807
01:08:53,285 --> 01:08:56,277
If you want to argue
let's meet at Pierre's room

808
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:17,244
I'm no punching ball!

809
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:20,440
I'll tell you, the day her Mother comes back
it'll be heaven

810
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:25,820
Sorry to intrude
but I'm splitting

811
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:29,123
I'm no wallflower

812
01:09:29,162 --> 01:09:31,221
Don't go...don't go

813
01:09:31,264 --> 01:09:33,926
Just a little argument...
Here I go, back to bed!

814
01:09:33,968 --> 01:09:36,458
Sorry, I don't feel like it anymore

815
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,767
Bye

816
01:09:57,397 --> 01:10:00,559
When can I see you
without a crowd?

817
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:03,695
You're the busy one
You cancel our dates!

818
01:10:17,521 --> 01:10:21,719
Save room for the 3-tier cake
it's from R & M!

819
01:10:23,829 --> 01:10:26,992
Funny, I thought I heard a baby cry...

820
01:10:27,033 --> 01:10:30,833
- Really?
- But it could've been the metro...

821
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:38,105
Give her a drink?

822
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:40,910
Stop, he's filled my glass
at least 8 times!

823
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,417
No way, she won't take it

824
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:46,445
I sure will! But I'm drunk...

825
01:10:54,266 --> 01:10:58,964
- Tell me about Thailand...
- It was wonderful!

826
01:10:59,906 --> 01:11:03,569
Customs searched me...

827
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:05,408
Two hours in my shorts...

828
01:11:06,415 --> 01:11:11,317
- Excuse me...
- The art world in turmoil...

829
01:11:19,731 --> 01:11:21,528
But where is Jacques?

830
01:11:23,535 --> 01:11:27,096
What the fuck are they doing?

831
01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:29,801
They're preparing dessert

832
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:34,006
Come on back, guys
this is boring without you!

833
01:11:34,048 --> 01:11:35,845
I'll go get them

834
01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:42,123
- Try to put her in
- Hold your ears!

835
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:43,216
She must be teething

836
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:45,420
We can't let her cry here alone
poor thing...

837
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:48,625
Watching football, or what?

838
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,429
The guests...
Let's take her outside

839
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:52,960
Yes, we can't leave her like this

840
01:12:03,718 --> 01:12:06,278
- It's a baby!
- I told you I heard a baby

841
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,690
- What's that baby?
- Who's baby is it?

842
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:13,092
This is Marie, my daughter

843
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,597
Your daughter...
You sure?

844
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:18,590
- Congratulations
- She's so cute

845
01:12:18,636 --> 01:12:22,127
- Don't cry, Marie...
- There's too much noise, here

846
01:12:23,442 --> 01:12:27,242
- You won't mind me turning it off would you?
- Give her to me, I'll try

847
01:12:32,154 --> 01:12:35,316
- If you sit down, it'll be worse
- Have you had her for long?

848
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:37,221
A couple of months

849
01:12:37,259 --> 01:12:38,817
Who's her mother?

850
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:41,352
She's in the States
she'll be back soon

851
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,727
Does she always cry like that?

852
01:12:45,769 --> 01:12:48,761
She's just teething
Usually, she's adorable

853
01:12:52,178 --> 01:12:54,646
And what if you just put her to bed?

854
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,375
It's just a whim
Put her in bed

855
01:13:04,325 --> 01:13:07,590
I think little babies aren't
very interesting

856
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:08,595
Do you?

857
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:11,098
So do l, they only begin
to interest me around age 3

858
01:13:11,134 --> 01:13:13,602
Then you can teach them things
talk... but before that...

859
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:16,298
Before that, all they do
is sleep eat, cry...

860
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,205
Conversations are limited

861
01:13:18,243 --> 01:13:21,211
I wish babies were the only ones
with limited conversation...

862
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:23,009
Depends on what you call limited

863
01:13:23,048 --> 01:13:25,710
In the kingdom of the jerk
the cretin's one-eyed!

864
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:27,742
- What's that mean?
- Nothing

865
01:13:28,755 --> 01:13:30,416
I'll leave you
to your unperishable talk

866
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:33,358
I'll get the 3-tier cake, ok?

867
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:51,542
Nurseries aren't my kick
See you

868
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:52,447
Which way you going?

869
01:13:52,484 --> 01:13:53,849
Montparnasse
Want a drink at Select?

870
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,252
- Sure
- Can you drop me off at Vavin?

871
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:57,950
Sure

872
01:13:57,991 --> 01:13:59,788
- Bye
- Bye

873
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:01,317
Hey, where's Clotilde?

874
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:09,032
Well, since they're all going...
Coming, darling?

875
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,707
Tell Pierre that the jerks are tired

876
01:14:12,743 --> 01:14:16,338
- Bye
- See you later, bye

877
01:14:19,651 --> 01:14:22,518
- I don't know what got into him
- He was mad, really mad

878
01:14:22,555 --> 01:14:25,820
I may also be a jerk
but the fact is I'm tired

879
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:28,123
Let's go
We'll talk to him on Monday

880
01:14:28,161 --> 01:14:31,425
Here's the wonder...
Leaving?

881
01:14:31,464 --> 01:14:34,058
- We're worn out
- Where's everyone?

882
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:40,337
Pity for the cake
but we must go, sorry

883
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:42,969
- Never mind, it's okay
- Good bye

884
01:14:46,183 --> 01:14:47,741
Can you make
some room on the...

885
01:14:47,786 --> 01:14:51,278
Clotilde's plastered
I'll see her home

886
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:57,963
She's sleeping, we sang...

887
01:14:57,998 --> 01:14:58,555
Where are they?

888
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:01,500
- Gone! Clean the table for me
- Everyone? Why?

889
01:15:01,536 --> 01:15:04,004
Don't know, they seemed mad
Can you make some r...

890
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:05,404
Pierre!

891
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:06,634
Pierre, come see!

892
01:15:11,648 --> 01:15:13,616
They've all gone!

893
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:15,915
Serves them right!
A bunch of childless dipshits!

894
01:15:15,953 --> 01:15:19,115
- Say, can you make some room for the c...
- They can't stand kids

895
01:15:19,156 --> 01:15:22,421
I can't either, but that's no reason
They're all pigs!

896
01:15:22,461 --> 01:15:23,723
The hell with it!

897
01:15:23,763 --> 01:15:27,824
And Natalie says, It's a whim
put her to bed! She's a headcase!

898
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:30,734
Speak for yourself!
You shove your kid on us...

899
01:15:30,771 --> 01:15:35,435
Don't push it! My life is work
baby, no sleep, work

900
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:37,536
You don't do nights!

901
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,445
I haven't got laid for 6 months

902
01:15:39,483 --> 01:15:44,146
Forget chasing arse...
At night, I'm too tired to go out

903
01:15:44,187 --> 01:15:47,645
- When is Sylvia coming back?
- It's been 6 months and 4 days

904
01:15:47,692 --> 01:15:50,354
I'll give her the week
Then, I dump the kid

905
01:15:50,396 --> 01:15:53,263
I hope you'll ball
the hell out of her

906
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,359
- Don't worry, blood'll flow!
- We did what we could!

907
01:15:56,403 --> 01:15:59,304
We can't waste our lives
wiping a baby's ass!

908
01:16:29,476 --> 01:16:33,674
Hi, I'm Sylvia, Marie's mother
I've come for her

909
01:16:34,683 --> 01:16:36,776
Oh, it's you...

910
01:16:38,288 --> 01:16:40,085
Wait, I'll get Jacques

911
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:43,589
Is Marie ok?

912
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:45,857
In great shape...

913
01:16:45,896 --> 01:16:48,865
She was teething, these days...

914
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,992
Can I see her?

915
01:16:52,305 --> 01:16:53,999
Yes, she's here...

916
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:02,348
Hi, Marie darling...

917
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,252
Recognize mummy?

918
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:11,658
She's so changed, so beautiful...

919
01:17:22,674 --> 01:17:26,235
I did it to hurt Jacques
I never imagined I'd miss her so...

920
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,770
Hurt Jacques, I see...

921
01:17:29,784 --> 01:17:30,876
Is he here?

922
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:33,984
Is Jacques here?

923
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:36,489
I'll go get him

924
01:17:42,098 --> 01:17:43,395
Marie's leaving!

925
01:17:46,805 --> 01:17:49,296
So, five bottles...

926
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,202
The small ones, for water...

927
01:17:57,918 --> 01:17:59,317
The brush...

928
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:05,017
- Do you have a blender?
- A blender?

929
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,927
For bananas, carrots...
She gets them now

930
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:09,260
No, I don't

931
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:11,460
Well, here's ours

932
01:18:21,581 --> 01:18:24,379
- Want me to take her?
- No, I'll hold her

933
01:18:32,293 --> 01:18:34,591
Could you give these to Michel?

934
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:58,420
- Here are the bibs...
- Thank you

935
01:18:59,794 --> 01:19:03,661
I put the woolens on the bottom
and the nappies on the top

936
01:19:05,066 --> 01:19:07,864
- That's what you'll need first
- Yes, thank you

937
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,581
- You can come back for the cradle
- Yes, I will

938
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,150
- Hand me the pushchair...
- Where are you going to put it?

939
01:19:26,192 --> 01:19:28,456
Give me the pushchair

940
01:19:28,495 --> 01:19:31,692
- You really put us in a jam...
- I'm sorry

941
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,261
Really, it's been crazy
for the last 6 months

942
01:19:35,305 --> 01:19:37,068
I'm really sorry

943
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,972
We can't waste our lives wiping
a baby's arse

944
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:40,998
I understand

945
01:19:42,513 --> 01:19:46,279
Now that you're taking her back
let's forget all that

946
01:19:46,318 --> 01:19:47,410
Alright

947
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:51,989
- Have enough money?
- Enough

948
01:19:52,024 --> 01:19:54,993
- Got anybody?
- I don't need anyone

949
01:19:55,028 --> 01:19:57,690
I live alone
but I've got girlfriends

950
01:19:57,731 --> 01:20:00,222
Or guys who pass through
No more than one night work is

951
01:20:01,236 --> 01:20:02,497
Work is more important

952
01:20:02,537 --> 01:20:05,404
We've got it all

953
01:20:05,441 --> 01:20:08,239
- I've loaded everything
- Now for Marie

954
01:20:13,249 --> 01:20:16,218
Here, let's sit!

955
01:20:16,253 --> 01:20:17,242
That's taken care of!

956
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:21,919
Then I'll be off now
I can't thank you enough

957
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,429
- Take care
- Good bye

958
01:20:24,465 --> 01:20:26,159
Bye, Marie

959
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:40,943
- Well, we've done enough
- More than enough

960
01:20:40,984 --> 01:20:42,451
I forgot to tell her
how to make the baby food

961
01:20:42,486 --> 01:20:44,852
- She'll get along on her own
- Right, she will

962
01:20:44,889 --> 01:20:47,653
- Now the good life!
- Sleeping late...

963
01:20:47,693 --> 01:20:51,355
To hell with being grounded
off I go to Caracas!

964
01:20:51,397 --> 01:20:54,161
I won't leave Nathalie alone
till I get her into bed

965
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:59,661
For me, it's Charlotte, Clotilde
Ghislaine, Patricia, Sylvie, Renee

966
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:04,406
- There are so many...
- It's really exciting

967
01:21:04,446 --> 01:21:06,744
I've six months of sex
to catch up on

968
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:13,855
She forgot her squeaky giraffe...

969
01:21:35,785 --> 01:21:37,581
Natalie! Natalie!

970
01:21:46,598 --> 01:21:49,065
There are lot's of good stuff

971
01:21:49,101 --> 01:21:51,899
I'll tell you slowly

972
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:21,130
- Good night
- Rest tight

973
01:22:21,174 --> 01:22:23,767
- Good night
- See you tomorrow

974
01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:58,009
< Hotel Continental, Happy Easter! >

975
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,851
- Your profile shot is the best
- Right

976
01:23:30,893 --> 01:23:34,157
Don't forgot the client wants
the pictures by tomorrow...

977
01:23:34,196 --> 01:23:36,664
- Tomorrow is really important
- They're good, no?

978
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:38,257
- They are
- It's wonderful

979
01:23:38,301 --> 01:23:39,962
- Want me to take you home?
- No thanks I've an appointment

980
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:43,564
I forgot my bag, don't wait

981
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:45,303
- See you later
- Bye

982
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:54,984
Still there darling?

983
01:23:55,022 --> 01:23:58,115
Mommy's done with work
You were a super nice girl

984
01:23:59,627 --> 01:24:01,254
Now let's go home

985
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:05,362
You understand don't you darling?
Mommy's got to work

986
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:09,330
Now what do mommy
have to do next?

987
01:24:09,372 --> 01:24:13,240
Mommy's going to take off her high heels
and put on her good old shoes

988
01:24:13,278 --> 01:24:17,146
and her good old jacket...
Well that's it

989
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:23,177
Now home, for a big din din!

990
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,760
- Take off her high heels
- It's kind of like Romeo and Juliet...

991
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:41,175
- I told her something...
- Met a dead end

992
01:24:41,211 --> 01:24:45,909
This... this...

993
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:51,915
- You knowwhat this is?
- It was short...

994
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:01,667
Oh, my feet...

995
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:04,964
What is this?

996
01:25:06,776 --> 01:25:07,765
Hey, a giraffe...

997
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:12,580
By the way, have you had any news
from that kid you had?

998
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:29,166
Actually, I won't be able to...

999
01:25:29,204 --> 01:25:31,263
You put juice and cream?

1000
01:25:31,307 --> 01:25:34,571
It's nice of you...
You'll eat it with your girlfriends

1001
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:39,309
I'm with a friend...
I've got something urgent to finish

1002
01:25:40,818 --> 01:25:42,809
It'll take us the night, for sure

1003
01:25:45,123 --> 01:25:47,091
Sorry

1004
01:25:47,126 --> 01:25:48,320
I hope you're not angry...

1005
01:25:49,428 --> 01:25:52,829
We'll make it up
Kisses everywhere

1006
01:26:46,832 --> 01:26:49,699
They still live here

1007
01:26:49,735 --> 01:26:51,896
the 2 guys with the baby?

1008
01:26:51,939 --> 01:26:54,339
The ones who had trouble
with the police...

1009
01:26:55,342 --> 01:26:57,207
Oh yes, they do

1010
01:26:57,244 --> 01:27:01,271
I was on that case...
I quit the force, don't worry

1011
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:06,986
Do you see, I'm pregnant...

1012
01:27:09,993 --> 01:27:11,290
Yeah

1013
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,062
Shall we go out for air?

1014
01:27:18,103 --> 01:27:20,264
I wanted to ask them...

1015
01:27:20,306 --> 01:27:23,764
- It's been bothering me for a long time...
- What is it?

1016
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:27,770
The dope, it was in the nappy
wasn't it?

1017
01:27:27,816 --> 01:27:31,683
- Yes, why?
- I feel better knowing it

1018
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,585
Did you know her?

1019
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,091
- Who?
- The baby...

1020
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,593
That was my daughter
How did you like her?

1021
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,597
I didn't really look at her

1022
01:27:40,632 --> 01:27:44,397
but I should have
If I had I wouldn't've been fired!

1023
01:27:44,435 --> 01:27:47,495
If I could remake the world
if I were God

1024
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:50,338
I'd make Adam out of Eve's rib

1025
01:27:52,847 --> 01:27:54,313
Not the other way around

1026
01:27:54,347 --> 01:27:57,009
That's an idea

1027
01:27:57,051 --> 01:27:58,143
Why not?

1028
01:27:59,354 --> 01:28:00,446
But why?

1029
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:02,753
Things would've been clearer...

1030
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:06,090
No one would of made us believe that
a being came out of our rib

1031
01:28:07,997 --> 01:28:12,457
Because nothing comes out
of a man's rib

1032
01:28:12,504 --> 01:28:13,493
Never...

1033
01:28:15,808 --> 01:28:19,174
Just out of our prick... and still

1034
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:20,804
it all remains to be done

1035
01:28:21,915 --> 01:28:23,075
For sure

1036
01:28:23,116 --> 01:28:24,777
To make buildings, planes, cars

1037
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:28,414
that we know how...

1038
01:28:29,924 --> 01:28:31,084
It's useful...

1039
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,184
It's applied for a job with the
Water & Forest...

1040
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:36,494
Maybe no one made us believe it...

1041
01:28:36,533 --> 01:28:40,435
May be, we wanted to believe it

1042
01:28:45,043 --> 01:28:48,308
But let's face it

1043
01:28:48,348 --> 01:28:51,249
No one ever comes out of our rib

1044
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:34,797
The baby was white as snow
And the happy old days...

1045
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:37,101
Tomorrow, San Francisco

1046
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:39,507
Say hello to the Pacific for me...

1047
01:29:39,544 --> 01:29:41,204
I'm flying back the day after

1048
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:42,712
You'll be in a horrible bood

1049
01:29:42,747 --> 01:29:45,011
Jet lag ruids you, now

1050
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,017
What do you mean, now?

1051
01:29:46,052 --> 01:29:48,646
Before, you dind't
Now, it gets to you

1052
01:29:49,656 --> 01:29:52,624
- Before what?
- How should I now?

1053
01:29:52,659 --> 01:29:54,217
Before, that's all!

1054
01:29:54,261 --> 01:29:56,024
It doesn't get to me at all

1055
01:29:56,064 --> 01:29:58,555
- No more jam...
- I'm not going

1056
01:30:03,772 --> 01:30:05,467
I'm going to work

1057
01:30:11,783 --> 01:30:13,045
Are you eating here todight?

1058
01:30:13,085 --> 01:30:18,249
No, I'm going to the flicks with...
I forgot her name

1059
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:21,283
- Your lndian?
- No, she's Finn

1060
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:25,160
But what's her name

1061
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,498
Weird names they have!
Mathilde... Magdeleine...

1062
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,972
I don't remember... Ma something

1063
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:33,201
Marie?

1064
01:30:38,716 --> 01:30:41,081
Dasty cold I got!

1065
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:43,383
You think I'd bawling all the tibe
but it's odly the flu

1066
01:30:43,421 --> 01:30:45,286
I don't know what's got into me

1067
01:30:45,324 --> 01:30:49,192
Everything I draw stinks

1068
01:30:49,229 --> 01:30:51,924
- Really? Why?
- I don't know, I feel sluggish

1069
01:30:53,133 --> 01:30:54,430
Me too

1070
01:30:55,736 --> 01:30:57,897
Must be the weather...

1071
01:30:57,939 --> 01:30:59,236
All this rain...

1072
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:18,755
Hi, is Sylvia here?

1073
01:31:18,798 --> 01:31:22,666
She'll be back in an hour or two
About midnight, she said

1074
01:31:22,703 --> 01:31:23,897
Oh, I see...

1075
01:31:25,306 --> 01:31:27,273
Want to wait?

1076
01:31:27,308 --> 01:31:29,799
Why not?

1077
01:31:57,645 --> 01:32:01,842
- Is Sylvia okay?
- I don't know I'm medical student

1078
01:32:01,884 --> 01:32:04,785
I baby sit
This is my first night

1079
01:32:07,992 --> 01:32:09,289
Oh, I see...

1080
01:32:25,212 --> 01:32:27,510
I won't wait for her, after all

1081
01:32:28,517 --> 01:32:30,178
Give her this when she comes in

1082
01:32:30,219 --> 01:32:31,914
Sure

1083
01:32:40,632 --> 01:32:42,827
Shouldn't she be sleeping
at this hour?

1084
01:32:45,337 --> 01:32:48,737
She cries when I put her to bed
so I let her stay up

1085
01:32:54,849 --> 01:32:56,339
Haven't you got any tight?

1086
01:32:57,653 --> 01:32:59,553
Haven't you got any tights for her legs?

1087
01:33:02,892 --> 01:33:06,293
Tights? It's warm in here

1088
01:33:24,318 --> 01:33:27,378
- You want me to call them?
- No

1089
01:33:27,422 --> 01:33:29,219
But you should let them know
at least!

1090
01:33:30,225 --> 01:33:32,591
No I'm not going
I've had it with travelling

1091
01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:34,597
Hurry up, I'll call a taxi
You can make it

1092
01:33:34,631 --> 01:33:37,599
- Don't you dare call!
- Don't act like a baby!

1093
01:33:37,634 --> 01:33:39,101
They won't have time
to replace you

1094
01:33:39,136 --> 01:33:42,503
You'll lose your job!
How will you pay the rentt?

1095
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:45,135
I'll wash dishes
I'll move to a bedsit

1096
01:33:47,146 --> 01:33:48,407
What happened?

1097
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:51,212
I'm not going anymore
I'm fed up with their flights...

1098
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,913
With women who have the same ass...
With hotel rooms...

1099
01:33:53,954 --> 01:33:56,013
Duty free shops make me throw up!

1100
01:33:56,057 --> 01:33:57,752
I'd like to know what I live for!

1101
01:33:59,661 --> 01:34:00,889
Do you know why you live?

1102
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:22,483
I cooked... Pierr'll be here
and cheer you up...

1103
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:23,716
He's already here

1104
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,091
- I didn't hear him
- I did

1105
01:34:29,131 --> 01:34:30,325
He's in his hole

1106
01:34:32,035 --> 01:34:33,627
Wake up

1107
01:34:34,438 --> 01:34:35,836
It's steak...rare

1108
01:34:46,852 --> 01:34:50,652
Coming, Pierre? Dinner is on

1109
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,552
Let's eat

1110
01:35:36,747 --> 01:35:38,146
Is Jacques here?

1111
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:41,411
I'm freaking out...

1112
01:35:41,453 --> 01:35:44,047
- Can't handle it alone
- Jacques!

1113
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:47,755
Jacques, for god's sake!

1114
01:35:48,862 --> 01:35:51,729
My work never ends
My schedule is crazy...

1115
01:35:51,766 --> 01:35:55,031
I just did 4 days of posing...
Everyday, my work never...

1116
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:57,629
- I just did 4 days If posing...
- And?

1117
01:35:57,672 --> 01:36:00,004
- We'd finish at 3 AM...
- And?

1118
01:36:00,042 --> 01:36:03,170
At 5, she'd wake up!
Think how much sleep...

1119
01:36:03,212 --> 01:36:06,181
I know After the 5 AM bottle
comes the 8 AM

1120
01:36:06,216 --> 01:36:09,184
Without mentioning the cash
for the baby sitters

1121
01:36:09,219 --> 01:36:13,280
And baby sitters leave kids
half-naked and up all night!

1122
01:36:13,325 --> 01:36:15,486
That was you, the flowers?

1123
01:36:15,528 --> 01:36:17,291
I could've killed th guy!

1124
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:19,127
I can't handle it

1125
01:36:20,835 --> 01:36:24,998
My parents're in Brittany
Anyway, we're at odds

1126
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:28,202
- The kid needs to go to the park...
- For sure...

1127
01:36:28,243 --> 01:36:30,609
Need the time
Everyday... hard to find...

1128
01:36:30,647 --> 01:36:33,706
I have to work, I like it
and I need the money

1129
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:37,117
But to get a job, I need a sitter
You know for the money

1130
01:36:37,154 --> 01:36:40,419
So I work all day and
...not sure I'm taking good care of her

1131
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:45,759
Yes, you're, don't cry
She looks great

1132
01:36:47,466 --> 01:36:50,230
I'm craking up...
I haven't slept in 4 days...

1133
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:53,239
She must be teething
and I can't make it

1134
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:56,936
It's nothing at all
Some syrup will do

1135
01:36:56,978 --> 01:37:01,074
She pulled that on us, too
We lost all our friends for one tooth

1136
01:37:01,116 --> 01:37:02,777
Look at my face...

1137
01:37:02,819 --> 01:37:05,185
How can I pose like this?

1138
01:37:05,223 --> 01:37:07,384
And what'll do if they don't want me?

1139
01:37:07,425 --> 01:37:11,588
You look great, just sleep
At your age, it can all be fixed

1140
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:14,098
Sleep, sure, but when?

1141
01:37:14,132 --> 01:37:16,794
Well, leave the kid with us
a few days and go recover

1142
01:37:16,836 --> 01:37:18,633
We're experienced...
For us it's nothing

1143
01:37:21,342 --> 01:37:23,242
Can I really leave her with you?

1144
01:37:24,246 --> 01:37:26,806
Of course you can
come back when you want to

1145
01:37:26,848 --> 01:37:28,042
Take a rest

1146
01:37:31,755 --> 01:37:34,052
I brought her things
for a couple of days...

1147
01:37:45,471 --> 01:37:46,438
Isn't she hungry?

1148
01:37:46,472 --> 01:37:49,134
Yes, it's time for her bottle
It's in her bag

1149
01:37:49,175 --> 01:37:50,574
I'll heat some water

1150
01:38:28,558 --> 01:38:30,150
I'll make her bed

1151
01:38:45,574 --> 01:38:46,700
Hey, guys, come see...

1152
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,439
- Come look! Here!
- What is it?

1153
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,175
Come here and look!
