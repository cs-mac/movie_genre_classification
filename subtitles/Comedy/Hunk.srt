1
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,440
- NOW, MR. GOLDEN,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

2
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,340
- "HUNK."
CALL ME "HUNK" FOR NOW.

3
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,770
- ALL RIGHT.

4
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,700
- THANKS FOR SEEING ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

5
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,270
NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

6
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,740
- YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE
A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.

7
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,200
- YEAH, WELL, IT IS.

8
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,470
FOR HIM.

9
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,100
- WHO IS HE?

10
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,440
- HIS--HIS NAME IS
BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

11
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,970
- WHERE IS HE?

12
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,670
- RIGHT HERE.

13
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,900
I'M BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

14
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,600
ON THE INSIDE ANYWAY.

15
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,370
- LOOK, PLAYING AT
SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT MY--

16
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,700
- YAH, I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW.

17
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,900
LOOK, DOC, DIDN'T YOU EVER WANT
TO BECOME SOMEBODY ELSE?

18
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,170
SOMEBODY EXCITING,
SOMEBODY FANTASTIC?

19
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,440
I JUST HAPPEN TO BE THAT
SOMEBODY FANTASTIC BRADLEY

20
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,200
BRINKMAN WANTED TO BECOME.

21
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
AND THEN BECAME.

22
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,700
- SOMEBODY WITH A FANTASTIC
IMAGINATION, YOU MEAN.

23
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,600
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT YOU GOTTA HEAR MY STORY.

24
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
TIME IS RUNNING
OUT FOR BRADLEY.

25
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,140
AND FOR ME.

26
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,670
- ALL RIGHT.

27
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,300
I'LL HEAR YOUR STORY, BUT TIME
IS RUNNING OUT FOR US AS WELL.

28
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,470
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST BEGIN

29
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,340
WITH THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU
BEGAN--

30
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,800
- AND BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

31
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,040
- THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU
AND BRADLEY BRINKMAN BEGAN

32
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,700
TO FEEL THIS WAY.

33
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,800
- DOCTOR, IF I CONVINCE YOU,
WILL YOU TAKE MY CASE?

34
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,540
- I'M LISTENING, MR. GOLDEN.

35
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,470
- UP UNTIL SIX WEEKS AGO, I
REALLY WAS BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

36
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,140
HACK, COMPUTER HACK.

37
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,540
I SPENT THE FIVE YEARS
SINCE COLLEGE CHAINED TO A

38
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,240
COMPUTER KEYBOARD.

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,200
EXCEPT FOR MY
IMAGINATION, THAT IS.

40
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,270
I ALWAYS DAYDREAMED
ABOUT BEING ONE OF THOSE

41
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,040
IMPOSSIBLY COOL GUYS
YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES

42
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,670
OR COMMERCIALS.

43
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,800
YOU KNOW, THE GUY THAT
DRIVE MASERATIS AND RUN

44
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,170
MAJOR CORPORATIONS.

45
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,340
THE KIND THAT DRIP WITH
WOMEN AND SELF CONFIDENCE.

46
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,740
YOU KNOW, THE GUY THAT LOOK
GREAT IN THOSE BIKINI BRIEFS

47
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,640
THAT RIDE UP THE
CRACK IN YOUR BUNS.

48
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,270
UNFORTUNATELY, PERPETUAL
DAYDREAMING DIDN'T LOOK

49
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,140
GREAT TO MY BOSS,
CONSTANTINE CONSTAPOPOLIS

50
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,000
OF CONSTAPOPOLIS COMPUTERS.

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,800
- DAYDREAMS?

52
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,640
I'M PAYING YOU TO
WRITE FOR ME DAYDREAMS?

53
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,340
- HI, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS.

54
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,570
I WAS-- I REALLY--
I JUST DRIFTED OFF.

55
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,300
- YES, WAY OFF, BRINKMAN.

56
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,240
WAY OFF.

57
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,340
WAY OFF.

58
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,140
YOUR PROGRAM
PROPOSAL'S SO BAD,

59
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,070
THE K-9000 SHUT
DOWN WITH D.I. AGAIN.

60
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,140
- "DIGITAL INDIGESTION"?

61
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,800
- I'LL-- LOOK AT THIS.

62
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,370
CAMELS 'R' US.

63
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,370
THE BEDOUIN PROGRAM.

64
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,940
WHO'S GOT A CAMEL
WITH A FLOPPY HUMP?

65
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,970
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

66
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,870
CONVERSATIONAL ICELANDIC.

67
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,370
WHO ARE YOU
GONNA SELL IT TO?

68
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,870
PENGUINS ON TOUR?

69
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,040
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

70
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,370
SUSHI TOWERS.

71
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,900
EAT WHAT YOU BUILD.

72
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,000
YOU KNOW YOUR WORK HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE--

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,100
- SUSIE ELOPED WITH HER
AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR. I--

74
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,400
- YEAH?

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
- I KNOW I KNOW-- HOW WOULD YOU
FEEL IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,940
REJECTED YOU BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T WEAR A LEOTARD AND

77
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,870
COUNT DURING SEX?

78
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,500
- LOOK, I'M RUNNING A
BUSINESS HERE.

79
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,300
YOU HAVE TWO
WEEKS--TWO WEEKS!

80
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,540
--TO MAKE A MONEY-MAKING
IDEA UP HERE,

81
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,870
OR ELSE YOU'RE OFF STUFFING--
- THE GRAPE

82
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,270
all: THE GRAPE LEAVES IN MY
ONE-EYED FATHER'S

83
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,670
GREEK RESTAURANT,

84
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,400
CYCLOPS WEST.

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,940
- THANK YOU, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS
FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING

86
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,240
AND GENEROSITY.

87
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,040
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.

88
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,070
- THE NEW PROGRAM
WAS DUE AT 9:00 A.M.

89
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,170
I WAS DESPERATE
FOR A CONCEPT.

90
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,100
ANY CONCEPT BUT EVERYTHING I
WROTE READ LIKE A ONE-WAY

91
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,570
TICKET TO THE SOUVLAKI
LINE AT CYCLOPS WEST.

92
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,100
IT ALL SEEMED BEYOND HOPE
WHEN I PUNCHED A DESPERATE

93
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,570
PLEA INTO THE MACHINE.

94
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,000
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,340
- WHAT HAPPENED?

96
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,600
- SOME KIND OF DIGITAL VULTURE
APPEARED ON MY SCREEN,

97
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,340
AND THEN THE
COMPUTER BEGAN WRITING THE

98
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,170
PROGRAM BY ITSELF.

99
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,870
- WHAT PROGRAM?

100
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,000
- THE YUPPIE PROGRAM.

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,200
A MULTI-COMPATIBLE LIFESTYLE
BUDGETING--

102
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
- YOU WROTE IT?
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MINE.

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,800
WHY, I SAVED A FORTUNE
STOCKING MY WINE CELLAR ALONE.

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,540
NOT TO MENTION THE
COMPLIMENTS I GET FROM YOUR

105
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,570
RECIPE FOR MICROWAVE PATE.

106
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,240
- LIKE I SAID, THE
COMPUTER WROTE IT,

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,870
BUT I GOT THE CREDIT.

108
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,470
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
PATE OR PASTA MACHINES OR

109
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,740
THE YUPPIE-ING OF SUBURBIA
UNTIL I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT

110
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,870
READING IT MYSELF.

111
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,900
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

112
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,300
HOW CAN A COMPUTER
WRITE BY ITSELF?

113
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,370
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

114
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,600
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
ANYTHING YET.

115
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,740
I WOKE UP A HERO AND BECAME
AN EVEN BIGGER ONE WHEN

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,540
LEGIONS OF BABY BOOMERS SNAPPED
UP 50,000 COPIES

117
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,740
IN THE
FIRST SIX WEEKS.

118
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,340
MOM WAS PROUD.
DAD WAS PROUD.

119
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,470
HECK, EVEN SUSIE CALLED
TO SAY SHE WAS PROUD TOO.

120
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,370
TO HAVE YOURS TRULY FOR
A PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL

121
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,770
EX-BOYFRIEND.

122
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,170
MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS PAID ME
A GIANT ROYALTY AND GAVE ME

123
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,570
THE SUMMER OFF WITH PAY TO
WRITE ANY PROGRAM I WANTED.

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,840
- SOUNDS WONDERFUL SO FAR.

125
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,600
- ALL I KNEW ABOUT YUPPIES
WAS THEY WEAR REEBOKS TO BED

126
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,740
AND WOULD HOCK THEIR HEALTH
CLUB CARDS FOR TEN MINUTES

127
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,540
ALONE WITH A DOVE BAR.

128
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,170
- HMM, WHERE DOES HUNK GOLDEN
FIT IN?

129
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,870
- AT THE BEACH HOUSE
I RENTED IN SEA SPRAY.

130
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,070
- SEA SPRAY?
PRETTY SWANKY PLACE.

131
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,340
- SWANKY?

132
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,000
WELL, LET'S SAY SEA
SPRAY IS SWANKY,

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,440
IF YOU'VE GOT BIG
BUCKS TO BURN.

134
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,940
THE ONLY THING SWANKY ABOUT
THE PLACE I COULD AFFORD WAS

135
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,970
THE DRIVEWAY.

136
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,170
THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS THE
OLDEST AND GRUNGIEST PLACE

137
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,870
ON SEA SPRAY BEACH.

138
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,770
BYE-BYE, BONUS.

139
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,370
IT WAS BUILT BY SOME OLD SEA
CAPTAIN WHO RAN OUT OF MONEY

140
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,440
AND RAN OUT OF TOWN BEFORE
HE COULD COMPLETE HIS

141
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,640
SAILING SHIP OF A HOUSE.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,600
IT WAS IDEAL FOR
INVESTIGATING THE

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,540
YUPPIES-AT-PLAY LIFESTYLE
ON WHICH I WAS

144
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,300
SUPPOSEDLY AN EXPERT.

145
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,040
I'D LEISURELY CONCOCT MY
NEXT PROGRAM AND SPEND THE

146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,870
REST OF MY TIME MAKING
MY DAYDREAMS COME TRUE.

147
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,440
- SO FAR, SO GOOD.

148
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,100
- EXCEPT THAT I
WENT A BIT TOO FAR.

149
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,470
NOW, THERE'S HELL TO PAY.

150
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,600
IN MY DAYDREAMS, ALL
I HAD TO DO WAS WINK,

151
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,940
AND THE WOMEN
WOULD COME RUNNING,

152
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,840
AND THERE WASN'T A BEACH
FULL OF TANNED AND TONED

153
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,900
COMPETITION EITHER.

154
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,600
THE OLD BOD DEFINITELY
COULD'VE USED A WORK-OUT.

155
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,540
- OH, THESE ARE FABULOUS.

156
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,340
LITTLE PIGGY
SALT-AND-PEPPER SHAKERS.

157
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,140
OH, I'VE GOTTA ADD
THESE TO MY COLLECTION.

158
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,770
OH, WELCOME TO SEA SPRAY,
WHERE THE WELL-TO-DO DO WELL

159
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,340
AT DOING WELL.

160
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:47,770
I'M POLLY CLUTTER, BUT
EVERYBODY CALLS ME "CHACHKA."

161
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,200
- I'M BRADLEY BRINKMAN,
BUT EVERYBODY CALLS ME

162
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,340
"BRADLEY."

163
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,800
YOU'RE IN MY LIVING ROOM.

164
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,100
- THOUGHT SO.
I SAW YOUR CAR OUT FRONT.

165
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,540
IS THAT A LOANER WHILE
THE B.M.W.'S IN THE SHOP?

166
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,800
- NO, ACTUALLY.

167
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
- OH, LOOK.

168
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,970
SOMEBODY IS GONNA FINALLY
GENTRIFY THIS OLD MESS.

169
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,400
GOOD FOR YOU.

170
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,340
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
RENTING THIS OLD MESS FOR

171
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,700
THE SUMMER.

172
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,270
- WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD AFFORD TO BUY.

173
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,470
HE STARTED THIS PLACE AND
NEVER QUITE FINISHED IT.

174
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,470
CAPTAIN CRABIT.

175
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,970
- HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT CAPTAIN CRABIT?

176
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,640
- WHEN I WAS A KID, I USED
TO HIDE FIRECRACKERS IN HIS

177
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,170
BARBECUE AND THEN LISTEN
FOR HIS HOT DOGS TO EXPLODE.

178
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,040
OH, HE ALWAYS HAD A FIRE
GOING, THAT CAPTAIN CRABIT.

179
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,340
- NO KIDDING.

180
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,740
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
PUT ON YOUR BATHING SUIT?

181
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,200
CHACHKA'S GONNA TAKE YOU
ON THE GABBY GUIDED TOUR.

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,340
- THE GABBY GUIDED TOUR?

183
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

184
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,770
IT'S FREE.

185
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,740
- SOUNDS GREAT.

186
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,570
HOW COME THEY
CALL YOU CHACHKA.

187
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,000
- OH, 'CAUSE MY HOUSE
IS FULL OF CHACHKAS.

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,970
I COLLECT THINGS.

189
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,840
KNICK-KNACKS.

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,040
BRIC-A-BRAC.

191
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,400
I'M AN INCURABLE COLLECTOR.

192
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,300
WHEN I MOVED OUT HERE FROM
NEW YORK IN THE '50s,

193
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,870
THE ONLY BUILDING
ON THE BEACH

194
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,600
WAS MY DAD'S HOT DOG STAND,
WEE WILLIE'S WEENIES.

195
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,140
- ♪ WEE WILLIE'S WEENIES, TOP
OFF WITH CHEESE AND BEANIES ♪

196
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,200
both: ♪ WEE WILLIE'S WEENIES,
BITE DOWN ON ONE TODAY, OLE ♪

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,670
THAT'S IT!

198
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,200
OH, IN THE '60s THIS PLACE WAS
BUFF BLUFF TOPLESS BEACH.

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
ON A HOT DAY, THE BOOBS WERE
PACKED TIGHTER THAN EGGS IN

200
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,000
YOUR EASTER BASKET.

201
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,540
- BORN TOO LATE.

202
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,640
- IN THE '70s MAHATMA
MAHARAJI WENT BANKRUPT

203
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,600
BUILDING THE WORLD'S FIRST
AND LAST CONDO COMMUNE.

204
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,070
NOW, WE'VE GOT YUPPIES.
WHO'S NEXT?

205
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,940
- SHE IS.

206
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,140
- WHO?

207
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,540
- HER.

208
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,600
SHE'S NOT REAL.

209
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,770
- WHERE IS SHE?

210
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,640
- RIGHT THERE.
NEXT TO THOSE SURFERS.

211
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,470
- THERE'S JUST A
COUPLE OF SURFERS.

212
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,140
- THE MOST GORGEOUS CREATURE
IN THE GALAXY IS STEAMING

213
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,170
RIGHT THIS WAY.

214
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,340
- YOU'RE IMAGINING THIS.

215
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,640
- HUH?
WHERE'D SHE GO?

216
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,440
WHERE'D SHE GO?

217
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,500
- HEY, HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

218
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,470
SHE DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE,
BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER HERE.

219
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,370
HEY, HEY, COME ON.

220
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,500
TIME TO MEET THE HEAVY HITTERS
ON THE SOCIAL CIRCUIT.

221
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,770
OH, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

222
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,340
THEY'RE ALL HERE.

223
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,670
- DON'T WORRY.

224
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,470
WE'LL GET THIS ONE.

225
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,370
- IN "THE ADVENTURES OF
ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE,

226
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,340
"ARCH-VILLAIN BORIS BADENOV
WAS NAMED AFTER THE TITLE

227
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,700
CHARACTER IN WHAT
FAMOUS RUSSIAN OPERA?"

228
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,970
- OPERA.

229
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,840
GIVE ME A BREAK.

230
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,100
- IGOR STRAVINSKY, RIGHT?

231
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,600
- IGOR STRAVINSKY, WRONG.

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
- OUR TURN?

233
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

234
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,670
- NO, YOU'RE THE BEST.

235
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,540
- BUT YOU'RE THE CUTEST.
- YOU'RE THE CUTEST.

236
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,470
both: TIE.

237
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,670
- BORIS GODUNOV, RIGHT?

238
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,070
- SEA SPRAY BEACH RULES FOR
TRIVIAL PURSUIT PROHIBIT

239
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,540
SAYING THE CORRECT ANSWER
TO THE LOSING TEAM.

240
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,500
- THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET ONE RIGHT NEXT TIME.

241
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,300
both: NO.

242
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,170
- WHO IS THIS GUY, CHACHKA?

243
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,670
- BARRY BRINKMAN.

244
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,100
HE JUST MOVED IN.

245
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
- IT'S BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

246
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,870
SORRY.

247
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,000
- BRADLEY.

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,900
I WANT YOU TO MEET

HISTORY OF RATCHET,
SLAMMER AND HOPS.

251
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,440
- RATCHET, SLAMMER,
HOPS AND ROYCE,

252
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,940
IF I HAVE A SAY IN IT.

AND I WILL.

254
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,570
I ALWAYS DO.

255
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,570

GOING TO SPRUCE UP THAT

261
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,600
DILAPIDATED OLD DUMP.

262
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,100
THANK GOD.

263
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,470
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
RENTING IT FOR THE SUMMER.

264
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,670
- YEAH, YOU DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD AFFORD TO BUY.

265
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,000
NEED ANY COCKROACH TRAPS?

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,740

270
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,940
CUT LIKE A ROOKIE ON
UNCONDITIONAL WAIVERS.

271
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,170

CUT IT WITH YOU, CAN'T I,

272
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,470

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,840
- OH, THANKS.

279
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,540
HOW FLATTERING.

280
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,740
YOU PLAY V-BALL, BRINSKY?

281
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,840
- V-BALL?

282
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,170
V-BALL. OH, YEAH.

283
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,770
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I
HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IN AGES.

284
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,140
- DON'T WORRY.

285
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,300
SKEET KNOWS ALL THE RULES.

286
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,300
- THERE ARE A FEW DO'S AND
DON'TS IN V-BALL, BRINSKY,

287
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,600
SO LET'S START
WITH THE DON'TS.

288
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,070
YOU DON'T REACH
UNDER THE NET.

289
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,370
YOU DON'T RUN INTO THE NET.

290
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,370
AND YOU DON'T KICK SAND ON
AN OPPOSING PLAYER

291
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,700
WHEN HE'S DOWN.

292
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,940
GOT THE PICTURE, BRINSKY?

293
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,900
- SO WHAT IF THEY ALL ACTED
LIKE THEY HATED ME FROM BIRTH?

294
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,100
THERE WAS AN AURA
TO THEIR ARROGANCE.

295
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,170
I HAD TO FIT IN.

296
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,640
I YUPPIED OUT MY HOUSE WITH
EVERY TRENDY APPLIANCE MY

297
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,700
CREDIT LIMIT COULD BEAR.

298
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
AH, SO WHAT IF THE STUFF
WOULD NEVER FIT IN MY STUDIO

299
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,300
APARTMENT AFTER THE SUMMER.

300
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,870
I WAS LIVING IN THE MOMENT.

301
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,140
I EVEN PERSONALLY
STONEWASHED ALL MY CLOTHES.

302
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,940
I STILL HAVEN'T
FIGURED OUT WHY.

303
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,840
SEA SPRAY BY NIGHT
MEANS THE SAND CASTLE.

304
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,740
THE MEN ARE LOW ON BODY
FAT, THE WOMEN ARE HIGH ON

305
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,770
THEMSELVES ... AND WHATEVER
ELSE IS GOING AROUND.

306
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,670
I WAS READY FOR STEP TWO,
INVITING THE WHOLE BEACH TO

307
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,040
AN OPEN HOUSE AT MY PLACE.

308
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,970
I'D PARTY THEIR ASSES OFF.

309
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,070
INCLUDE MYSELF IN
WITH THE IN CROWD.

310
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,240
THE SEA SPRAY CROWD
ACCEPTS NO SUBSTITUTES,

311
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,700
AND I FELT LIKE
A SUBSTITUTE.

312
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,270
- HEY, HI, COASTER.

313
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,640
HOW'S IT GOING, GUY?

314
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
- WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT OUTFIT?

315
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,000
- WELL, I GOT IT AT
THE SEA SPRAY GALLERIA.

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,540
- OH, ALEXIS, DARLING.

317
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,040
BRINKMAN HERE WENT
SHOPPING AT

318
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,000
THE SEA SPRAY "SCHLOCKERIA."

319
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,940
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

320
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,600
WE'RE EXACTLY IDENTICAL.

321
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,970
- OH, FAT CHANCE.

322
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,870

OH, GIORGIO
SPERMATUCCI STONEWASH.

326
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,370
SPERMATUCCI, MY
FAVORITE DESIGNER.

327
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,640
- THEY'RE 100% COTTON.

328
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,300
- THEY STONEWASH THEIR
DENIM IN SYNTHETIC STONES.

329
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,140
- BRINKMAN, A LITTLE ADVICE,
THE ONLY THING THAT YOU'LL

330
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,970
LAY TONIGHT IN THAT
IS LINOLEUM.

331
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,170
- OH, YEAH, YOU GUYS,
HERE'S AN INVITATION.

332
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,940
MY OPEN HOUSE.

333
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,400
TRY AND DROP BY.

334
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,140
- CATERED NO DOUBT BY
CHARLES DE GRAVY DU POISSON.

335
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,600
OH, WE WILL BE
THERE WITH BELLS ON.

336
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,040
BELLS.

337
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,100
- DING AWAY.

338
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,700
- AND THEN I SAW HER.
AGAIN.

339
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,370
- ARE WE PUMPED
IN THERE, BRADLEY?

340
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,400
- I WAS DANCING WITH THAT
INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS WOMAN

341
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,740
FROM THE BEACH,
BUT SHE VANISHED.

342
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,640
- OH, SURE.
HOW COME I CAN'T SEE HER?

343
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,800
WHERE'D SHE GO?

344
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,470
- HELL, IF I KNOW.

345
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,970
- THE FINAL SCORE FOR MY
OPEN HOUSE WAS HOST-ONE,

346
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,900
GUESTS-ZERO.

347
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,370
TALK ABOUT WOUNDED PRIDE,
MINE WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL.

348
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,970
A NIGHTMARE IN LEFTOVER
ARTICHOKE HEARTS.

349
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,770
- HELLO.

350
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,400
CHACHKA, UH-- CHACHKA,
BABY, HOW ARE YA?

351
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,270
OH, FANTASTIC.
FANTASTIC TURN-OUT, YEAH.

352
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,140
YEAH!
WHAT?

353
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,400
OH, YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OVER.

354
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,370
OH, BABE, WE'RE
GONNA MISS YA, YEAH.

355
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,370
GREAT PARTY, BRADLEY.

356
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,740
YEAH, DUDE, GREAT PARTY.

357
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,600
WHAT?

358
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
LEFTOVERS?

359
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
UH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

360
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,370
THESE PARTY ANIMALS,
THEY ARE PIGGING OUT.

361
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,170
YEAH, PIGGING OUT, YEAH.

362
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,840
WHAT?

363
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,900
BABE, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
YOU GOTTA SPEAK UP FOR ME, OKAY?

364
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,100
NO, NO, HONEY
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

365
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,900
I'LL TALK TO YOU
TOMORROW, OKAY?

366
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,940
YEAH, YEAH.
BYE!

367
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,870
"ANY LEFTOVERS."

368
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,800
SHE'LL PROBABLY BE RIGHT
OVER WITH TUPPERWARE.

369
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,600
- SUPPOSE YOU GAVE AN OPEN
HOUSE, AND NOBODY CAME.

370
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,640
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW,
CAN WE, COMPUTER CHAMP?

371
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,700
- WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T DISAPPEAR.

372
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,200
OKAY.

373
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,070
WHO ARE YOU, AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT ME?

374
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,770
AND AM I THE ONLY
PERSON WHO CAN SEE YOU?

375
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,140
- AROUSED?

376
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,300
YOUR CURIOSITY, I MEAN.

377
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,200
BRADLEY, A GIRL IN MY LINE
WORKS UP A DEVILISH THIRST.

378
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,100
AREN'T YOU GONNA INVITE
ME TO STAY FOR A PERRIER?

379
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,670
WOW, THE FOOD'S JUST
TO DIE FOR, BRADLEY.

380
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,440
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
BE ONE FABULOUS HOST.

381
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,200
IT'S A SHAME YOU
DON'T RECOGNIZE IT.

382
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,600
- YOU'VE HAD THE FOOD,
AND YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.

383
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,270
NOW, WHO ARE YOU?

384
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,070
- MY NAME'S O'BRIEN.

385
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,570
- JUST O'BRIEN?

386
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,240
- JUST O'BRIEN.

387
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,500
- AND WHERE DO
YOU LIVE, O'BRIEN?

388
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,900
- HELL.

389
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
I HAVE A LARGE STUDIO APARTMENT
AT 1,700 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

390
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,500
OF COURSE, I WANT A ONE-BEDROOM
AT 2,500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

391
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,540
OR A LOFT IN THE CELSIUS
NEIGHBORHOOD,

392
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,240
BUT ANYTHING OVER 2,000 DEGREES
IS A FORTUNE.

393
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,500
IT'S HELL TO FIND A DECENT
PLACE TO LIVE IN HELL.

394
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,670
- WHO WRITES YOUR MATERIAL,
DAVID LETTERMAN?

395
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,940
CUTE.
VERY CLEVER.

396
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,440
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

397
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,900
- OKAY, LISTEN UP, BRADLEY,
BECAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA READ

398
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
YOUR BLACK MAGIC
RIGHTS ONCE.

399
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,770
- OH.

400
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,570
- BE FOREWARNED--

401
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,000
- SORRY.

402
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,370
- BE FOREWARNED, YOU'RE
ABOUT TO BE SOLICITED FOR A

403
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,170
SUPERNATURAL EXPERIENCE.

404
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,340
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CALL AN EXORCIST.

405
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,870
IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD AN EXORCIST,

406
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,970
ONE WILL BE
APPOINTED TO YOU.

407
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,200
ANY BLACK MAGIC COVENANTS
HEREAFTER EXECUTED BY YOU

408
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,070
CAN AND WILL BE USED TO
ASSERT DARK DOMINION OVER

409
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,400
YOUR SOUL.

410
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
ANY QUESTIONS?

411
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,370
- YEAH.
WHY ME?

412
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,440
- I'VE HAD MY EVIL
ON YOU A LONG TIME.

413
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,770
BRADLEY, YOU NEED
A FRIEND RIGHT NOW.

414
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,840
WHO DO YOU THINK INSPIRED
THE YUPPIE PROGRAM?

415
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,540
- WAIT A MINUTE.

416
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,300
THIS WAS ON MY COMPUTER.

417
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,670
YOU POSSESSED MY WORD
PROCESSOR THAT NIGHT?

418
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:15,240
- LET'S CALL IT
"TEMPORARY OCCUPANCY."

419
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,400
- THIS CONVERSATION IS
INSANE, AND SO ARE YOU.

420
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,740
- ONE QUESTION, BRADLEY.

421
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,740
ARE YOU HAPPY YOU RENTED THIS
FABULOUS HOUSE

422
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,500
SO CLOSE TO ROYCE, COULD WIPE
HIS TOPSIDERS ON YOUR FACE

423
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,270
AT THE DROP OF A FRISBEE?

424
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,770
HAPPY WOMEN AROUND HERE

425
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,970
WON'T GIVE YOU THE CORRECT TIME
OF DAY AT A ROLEX CONVENTION?

426
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,070
- WELL--
- I CAN MAKE YOU OVER.

427
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,070
MAKE YOU INTO THE
KIND OF MAN YOU'VE ALWAYS

428
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,240
DAYDREAMED ABOUT.

429
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,470
THE KIND OF MAN
WOMEN WANT MOST.

430
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,870
AND MEN WANT MOST TO BE.

431
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,700
A HUNK.

432
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,370
HANDSOME, TANNED, TONED.

433
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,970
RICH, BRADLEY.

434
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,770
SUCCESSFUL.

435
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,870
ADMIRED.

436
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,700
- WHAT'S ALL THIS
GONNA COST ME?

437
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,940
- OH, YOUR SOUL, SILLY BOY.

438
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,940
AND WOULD YOU
BELIEVE, RIGHT NOW,

439
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,140
WE HAVE A NO-OBLIGATION
SELL-YOUR-SOUL-FOR-THE-SUMMER

440
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,670

441
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,440
AND IF YOU ARE NOT
100% SATISFIED,

442
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,570
YOUR OLD BODY AND OLD
SOUL WILL BE REFUNDED.

443
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,040
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL.

444
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,400
- ARE YOU PART OF
THE PACKAGE DEAL?

445
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,140
- OH, THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
INCORPORATED,

446
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,470
FORBIDS MY DATING CLIENTS
WHILE THEIR SOUL IS IN

447
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,840
SPIRITUAL ESCROW.

448
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,940
- THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
INCORPORATED?

449
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,100
- THE BOSS NEEDS TAX
WRITE-OFFS JUST LIKE YOU.

450
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,300
- WE'LL STILL SEE
EACH OTHER, WON'T WE?

451
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,070
- OH, FOR ETERNITY,
IF YOU WANT.

452
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,140
SO GIVE IT A GO
FOR THE SUMMER?

453
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,140
- AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO SIGN
SOMETHING IN BLOOD, RIGHT?

454
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,500
- A HYPODERMIC PEN.

455
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,570
NO MUSS, NO FUSS.

456
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,970
IT'S MY LATEST INVENTION.

457
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,900
- OW!

458
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,800
- DONE.

459
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,700
- NOW WHAT?

460
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,970
- NOW, WAIT.

461
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,640
A NEW LIFE AND A NEW BODY
BEGIN TOMORROW AT SUNRISE.

462
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,740
SWEET DREAMS,
BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

463
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,840
THIS MAY BE THE LAST
WE SEE OF THE OLD YOU.

464
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,200
BYE.

465
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,540
- BYE.

466
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,170
OH, WEIRD.
REALLY WEIRD.

467
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,770
- THAT NIGHT, I
HAD A WILD DREAM.

468
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,670
AT LEAST, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A DREAM.

469
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,570
- OH, MAN, WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

470
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,540
WAIT A MINUTE.

471
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,400
WHOSE ARM IS THIS?

472
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,840
WAIT A MINUTE.

473
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,700
WHOSE ROOM IS THIS?

474
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,940
STILL DREAMING.

475
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,500
I'M NOT DREAMING.

476
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,970
THIS IS REAL.

477
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,600
WHERE'D ALL THIS COME FROM?

478
00:31:53,070 --> 00:32:02,170
OH, MY GOD.

479
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,740
O'BRIEN REALLY DID IT.

480
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:22,800
SHE REALLY...REALLY DID IT.

481
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,500
HEY, THAT'S NOT OSCAR.

482
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,700
MY BEST FRIEND SINCE THE
SEVENTH GRADE IS MISSING.

483
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,870
O'BRIEN?

484
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,940
O'BRIEN, WHAT THE
HELL-- CHACHKA, HI.

485
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,740
- YOU KNOW ME? I'D REMEMBER
MEETING YOU.

486
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,340
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE
LEFTOVERS FROM LAST NIGHT,

487
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,840
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF
FOR MISSING YOU.

488
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,170
I MEAN, IT.

492
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,200
NO, BRADLEY'S STILL
DREAMING, I THINK.

493
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,700
I MEAN, HE'S STILL HUNG
OVER FROM THE PARTY.

494
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,770
- OH, LOOK.

495
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,440
HE REDECORATED
THE WHOLE PLACE.

496
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,770
- YEAH.

497
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,770
WOW.

498
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,900
SHE SURE DID.

499
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,100
I MEAN, YES.

500
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,770
YES, HE DID.

501
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,840
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

502
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,670
- A REAL HUNK.

503
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,740
I MEAN, IS THAT YOUR
NEW CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY?

504
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,900
- NEW CAR?

505
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,840
WHAT NEW CAR?

506
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,340
YOU MEAN, THIS CAR?

507
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,370
- NO.

508
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,400
THIS IS MY GASTROMOBILE.

509
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,170
- AH, IT'S INTERESTING, YES.

510
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,640
- THE NEW CAR IS OVER HERE.

511
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,000
IS IT YOURS?

512
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,970
- CAR OF MY DAYDREAMS.

513
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,840
UH, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

514
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,670
- WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY?

515
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,770
- I'M NOT SURE.

516
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,500
I MEAN, BRADLEY AND
I ARE VERY CLOSE.

517
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,700
LISTEN, HAVE YOU SEEN A
WOMAN ABOUT 5'9", DARK HAIR,

518

REALLY GORGEOUS?

519
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,870
- NOT YOU TOO.

520
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,070
- NEVER MIND.
SHE'LL TURN UP.

521
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,800
I HOPE.

522
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,740
LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

523
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,440
H.G. WHO IS H.G.?

524
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,770
NOT ONLY
WAS I NEW TO CHACHKA,

525
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,870
BUT EVERYTHING I NOW
OWNED WAS NEW TO ME.

526
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,100
HOW WE DOING, SUSIE?

O'BRIEN.

529
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,270
"HUNK GOLDEN?"

530
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,940
MY NAME IS "HUNK GOLDEN?"

531
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,140
I'M RICH.

532

O'BRIEN!

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,170
O'BRIEN.

535
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,340
- IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO
KEEP FROM RIPPING HIS TOWEL

536
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,740
OFF WITH MY TEETH.

537
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,470
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

538
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,000
HE DIDN'T SAY.

539
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,670

540
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,000

- OH, NOW, THAT'S
A PERFECT SPECIMEN.

545
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,370

592
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,400
ASSHOLE SOMETIMES.

593
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,040
- WHERE'D YOU

594
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,870

FROM THE FRIDGE.

599
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
- ODDS AND END FOR 40.

600
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,240
IMPRESSIVE.

601
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,470
- WHERE'S BRADLEY?

602
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,870
- BRADLEY, HE'S DOWNTOWN.

603
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,870
BIG FAMILY EMERGENCY.

604
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,740
- FIGURES.

605
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,600
- I WANT A WORD WITH
YOU, MR. HUNK GOLDEN.

606
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,000
- THE LAST TIME SHE HAD
A WORD WITH SOMEBODY,

607
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
HE COULDN'T TALK FOR A WEEK.

608
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,500
WANT A CRACKER?

609
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,540
- I'M NOT EATING.

610
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,600
- WHY NOT, BUBBY?

611
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,040
- I'M FAT.
- YOU'RE NOT FAT.

612
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,300
- OH, YOU ARE NOT FAT.
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL GAZELLE.

613
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,370
- I'M HUGE.

614
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,700
- YOU'RE NOT HUGE.
- YOU ARE NOT.

615
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,540
- YOU'RE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING IN THE WORLD.

616
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,940
- I'M A BEACHED WHALE.
- YOU'RE NOT A BEACHED WHALE.

617
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,870
- I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT SKEET.

618
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,540
I DON'T KNOW MY
OWN STRENGTH.

619
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,670
HOW IS HE?

620
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,940
- UNCONSCIOUS UNDER
A 20-POUND ICE PACK.

621
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,000
YOU ANIMAL.

622
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,840
- I'M AN ANIMAL?

623
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,900
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
SO SAVAGE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

624
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,300
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

625
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,500
- DO I KNOW?

626
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,800
I JUST MET MYSELF FOR
THE FIRST TIME TODAY.

627
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,440
- YOU KNOW WHAT SOMEBODY
OUGHT TO DO TO A BRUTAL

628
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,070
BASTARD LIKE YOU?

629
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,070
- UH, NO.

630
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:22,000
- SOMEBODY SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING THAT BIG LUMMOX

631
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,670
IN HIS PLACE.

632
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,040
YOU'RE A WALKING A
CHUCK NORRIS MOVIE,

633
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,300
AND I'M NOT WAITING TILL
YOU'RE OUT ON VIDEOCASSETTE!

634
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,170
- UH, IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T NOTICED,

635
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,700
THIS HOUSE IS
FULL OF GUESTS.

636
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,740
- AND ALL THE WOMEN
WANNA TAKE YOU SOUTH OF THE

637
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,040
MASON-DIXON LINE.

638
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,400
- THINGS LIKE THIS NEVER
HAPPEN TO BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

639
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,800
- WELL, WHY WORRY ABOUT THAT
LITTLE OLD TADPOLE WHEN WE

640
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,040
GOT A BIGGER FISH TO FRY?

641
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,100
- WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO JOCKEY THIS BED?

642
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,740
- DALLAS GENERAL HOSPITAL.

643
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,740
BEFORE BECOMING AN
ANNIHILATOR CHEERLEADER,

644
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,040
I WAS STRIPPED OF
MY CANDY STRIPES.

645
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,170
- WELL, ONCE A CANDY-STRIPER,
ALWAYS A CANDY-STRIPER.

646
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,400
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.

647
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,370
- YOU WANNA SEE MY STRIPES?

648
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,040
OKAY!

649
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,540
THEY'RE INVISIBLE.

650
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,140
- OH, I CAN SEE
'EM JUST FINE.

651
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,440
- WHOO!

652
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,940
OH-OH-OH!
- OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH!

653
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,270
- WHOO!

654
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,240
WHOO!

655
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,870
AH! AH! AH! AH! AH!

656
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,570
WHOO!

657
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,340
- OH! OH! OH!

658
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,540
- WHOO!

659
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,640
- AH AH AH!
- WHOO!

660
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,570
- WHAT A DIFFERENCE
A DAY MAKES.

661
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,170
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

662
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,870
WHERE IS BRADLEY BRINKMAN?

663
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,440
- YOU'RE STILL
BRADLEY INSIDE.

664
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,200
ONLY NOW, YOU'RE
GETTING RESULTS.

665
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME
GORGEOUS KOOK, NOT SATANA,

666
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,000
QUEEN OF DARKNESS.

667
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,540
- WILL YOU RELAX?

668
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,970
ENJOY LIVING IN THIS GORGEOUS
NEW CHASSIS FOR A WHILE.

669
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,570
- YOU KNOW, I DRANK
EIGHT MARTINIS.

670
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,000
I'M NOT EVEN HUNG OVER.

671
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,570
- THAT'S NOTHING.

672
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:43,170
TOMORROW, WE BEGIN
NEW BODY ORIENTATION.

673
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,140
ARE YOU GONNA BE SURPRISED.

674
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,440
- WHAT ABOUT MY OLD BODY?

675
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,140
- THE TRIAL OFFER EXPIRES
THE MIDNIGHT AFTER LABOR DAY,

676
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,970
BUT YOU'LL
NEVER GO BACK.

677
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,640
NOBODY DOES.

678
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,700
TRUST ME.

679
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,940
I DESIGNED YOU MYSELF.

680
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,400
YOU'VE GOT THE THIGHS
OF SYLVESTER STALLONE,

681
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,870
THE PELVIS OF ELVIS PRESLEY,

682
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,500
THE NAVEL OF ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER,

683
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,540
THE NIPPLES OF ROBERT REDFORD,

684
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,940
THE EYES OF PAUL NEWMAN, AND
THE SCHLONG OF KING KONG.

685
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,370
I GAVE YOU PERMA-FIRM FLESH,
WRINKLE-PROOF PERMA-TAN SKIN,

686
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:29,900
UNFRIZZABLE HAIR,
UNBREAKABLE BONES,

687
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,640
SELF-CLEANING CAVITY-PROOF
TEETH, ODORLESS SWEAT.

688
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,570
WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR SOUL
LIVES ON IN HELL IN HUNK FORM

689
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,070
FOR ETERNITY.

690
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,340
GORGE YOURSELF ON THE MOST
FATTENING FOOD

691
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,340
IN ALL CREATION AND
NEVER GAIN WEIGHT.

692
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,470
CHUG 12 TIMES THE ALCOHOL
CAPACITY OF A PERSON

693
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,300
TWICE YOUR SIZE.

694
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,700
YOUR LIVER WAS DESIGNED
BY DEAN MARTIN.

695
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,100
AND TO PROTECT OUR
EVIL INVESTMENT,

696
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,540
YOU'RE A NATURAL
MARTIAL ARTS MASTER.

697
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,500
JUST ASK SKEET.

698
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,840
LET'S NOT FORGET WHY
WE PACKAGED YOU SO STUNNINGLY--

699
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,570
WOMEN.

700
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:40,440
YOU'LL BE A MOVING TARGET
FROM NOW ON FOR ANYONE WHO

701
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,700
LOVES LUSCIOUS-LOOKING MEN.

702
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,440
YOU'RE BOUND TO OVERDO THE
SUPER-STUD BIT AT FIRST,

703
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,800
BUT YOU'LL KNOW WHEN
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

704
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,440
WORSHIP THY WHEELS.

705
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,300
A HUNK IS NAKED
WITHOUT HIS CAR.

706
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,500
AND DO EVERYTHING FIRST.

707
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,100
A HUNK SETS TRENDS.

708
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,370
UNDERDRESS TO IMPRESS.

709
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,940
A HUNK LOOKS HIS BEST WHEN
HE LOOKS LIKE HE DOESN'T

710
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,840
CARE HOW HE LOOKS.

711
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,670
- THAT IS THE MOST
INCREDIBLE, RIDICULOUS,

712
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,040
PREPOSTEROUS STORY
I HAVE EVER HEARD.

713
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,500
- BUT IT'S TRUE.

714
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,900
- YOU REALIZE I JUST
TAPED YOUR ENTIRE SESSION,

715
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,100
AND ON THE BASIS
OF THAT ALONE,

716
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,600
I COULD HAVE YOU HELD FOR
OBSERVATION AT ANY MENTAL

717
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,300
WARD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY,

718
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,300
BUT THAT'S WHAT FASCINATES ME.

719
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,240
YOU SOUND DELUDED, BUT
SOMETHING INSIDE ME TELLS ME

720
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,740
YOU'RE NOT.

721
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,940
- YEAH, WELL THE ME
INSIDE ME KNOWS I'M NOT.

722
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,770
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE HAS A
DEMONIC WHIM AND TURNS ME

723
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,940
INTO A HAMSTER?

724
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,670
OR A HIGH SCHOOL
DRIVER'S ED INSTRUCTOR?

725
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,870
- DON'T PANIC, HUNK.

726
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,370
DO I BELIEVE YOU?

727
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,400
NO.

728
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,600
CAN I HELP YOU TO HELP YOURSELF?
MAYBE.

729
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,600
- ALL RIGHT.

730
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,170
WHERE DO I START?

731
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,540
- WELL, YOU SAY YOU'RE
BRADLEY BRINKMAN,

732
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,940
AND THAT BRADLEY BRINKMAN'S
DREAM IS TO BECOME A HUNK,

733
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,240
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

734
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,140
- SO BE A HUNK.

735
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,300
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT WHILE WE'RE

736
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,000
GETTING TO THE REAL
ROOT OF YOUR PROBLEM.

737
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,670
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF YOU
COULD MEET O'BRIEN

738
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,570
THAT WOULD PROVE EVERYTHING.

739
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,870
- I DOUBT WHETHER O'BRIEN OR
BRADLEY BRINKMAN EXIST

740
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,700
OUTSIDE OF YOUR IMAGINATION.

741
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,370
SO UNTIL OUR NEXT SESSION,
JUST LIGHTEN UP.

742
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,200
THERE ARE WORSE FATES THAN
BEING A DROP DEAD GORGEOUS GUY

743
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,570
WITH A PAD AT
THE BEACH, YOU KNOW.

744
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:08,040
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, DOCTOR?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

745
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,170
- MY CLIENTS AND MY
FRIENDS CALL ME SUNNY.

746
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,600
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
AFTER I POWDER MY NOSE.

747
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,900
- YOU PROMISE.
- MM-HMM.

748
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,140
- WHOA.

749
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,400
CHICKY, CHICKY, CHICKY
DEAR OF THE SEA,

750
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,340
WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?

751
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,640
AWW, COME ON, BABE.

752
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,470
SAVE THAT COLD FISH STUFF
FOR ALL THESE NERDS AND

753
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,470
"TUNA" IN TO ME, SUSHI TAIL.

754
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,800
WHAT'S WRONG?

755
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,540
HAS CATFISH GOT
YOUR TONGUE, HUH?

756
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,540
- BABE!

757
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,670
- OOPS.
GOTTA GO.

758
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,270
BUT I JUST LOVE RAW FISH.

759
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,570
- WAS BIGGSY-WIGGSY A GOOD
WITTLE BOY WHILE MOMMY

760
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,900
POWDERED HER NOSY-WOSY?

761
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,270
- THE GOODEST.

762
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,440
- I'LL BET.

763
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,570
- EXCUSE ME.

764
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,700
HEY, MARTY, HOW ABOUT A CAMPARI
WITH A SPLASH OF ORANGE?

765
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,170
- SINCE SHE TOLD ME--

766
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,100
- SO HOW WAS THE
CATCH OF THE DAY?

767
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,500
- AH, PRETTY FRESH.

768
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,770
- "PRETTY FRESH"?

769
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,140
HEY, I PROMISED YOU PARADISE,
AND I DELIVERED.

770
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,540
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

771
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,840
A LIFE OF EARTHLY PLEASURE
IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AFTERLIFE

772
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,200
OF THE INTERNAL INFERNAL GOD OF
HELLFIRE AND STAPH, RIGHT?

773
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,940
- SOMEBODY MENTION ME?

774
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,740
- HUNK, MEET THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD

775
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,700
OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
INCORPORATED--DR. D.,

776
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,500
THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

777
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,140
- THE DEVIL IS A DOCTOR?

778
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,470
- A DOCTOR OF DEATH, SWORN
TO THE HYPOCRITIC OATH--

779
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,800
TO TAKE LIFE WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

780
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,170
- WAIT A MINUTE.

781
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,240
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE THE GUY
THAT USED TO OWN THIS HOUSE.

782
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,840
THAT CAPTAIN CRABIT GUY.

783
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,370
- OH, I LOOK LIKE MANY DIFFERENT
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

784
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,640
ALL OF THEM ROTTEN.

785
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,570
- WELL, YOU DRESS
LIKE GENGHIS KHAN.

786
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,600
- ATTILA THE HUN.

787
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,170
WE'RE SACKING
ROME IN 451 A.D.

788
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:39,300
ACTUALLY, I JUST POPPED
IN FOR A COKE CLASSIC.

789
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,470
- WHO'S SHE?

790
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,270
- CHINCHILLIA.

791
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:47,200
A LITTLE ROMAN SLAVE GIRL
I RESCUED

792
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,440
TO KEEP ME WARM AT NIGHT.

793
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,970
SHE ONLY SPEAKS
LATIN, I'M AFRAID.

794
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:55,800
"E PLURIBUS UNUM," MY DEAR.

795
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,570
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A
MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

796
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,270
451 A.D.?
THAT'S 15 CENTURIES AGO.

797
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,170
- WELL, IF HISTORY'S
GONNA REPEAT ITSELF,

798
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,740
I HAVE TO KEEP EVIL GOING
IN THE PAST AS WELL AS THE

799
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,670
PRESENT AND FUTURE.

800
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,240
THIS IS THE WORST DEMON
POWER SHORTAGE WE'VE HAD

801
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,200
SINCE EVERYONE WENT HOLY
FOR THOSE BLASTED CRUSADES.

802
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,770
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU.

803
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,300
- ME?

804
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,640
- YES. YOU.

805
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,470
IN ANOTHER 50 YEARS, YOU'LL
BE ASSISTING ALL THE BIGGIES

806
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,300
OF BADNESS--IVAN THE
TERRIBLE, JACK THE RIPPER,

807
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,770
BENITO MUSSOLINI, AND FIRST
DIBS ON DELECTABLE FRINGE

808
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,640
BENEFITS TOO, MY BOY.

809
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,370
NOW, O'BRIEN, IF YOU
NEED ME ON MONDAY,

810
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,270
I WILL BE AT THE
FRENCH REVOLUTION,

811
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,800
BEHEADING AMBASSADORS.

812
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,340
TUESDAY, CHAMPAGNE WITH
CAIN FOR KILLING ABEL.

813
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:05,240
WEDNESDAY NIGHT, POLO WITH THE
FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE.

814
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,200
THURSDAY, THE
1906 SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE.

815
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,170
WHAT A BLAST THAT WAS.

816
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:17,840
FRI--OH, FRIDAY, I SINK
ATLANTIS FOR THE WEEKEND.

817
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,100
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT.

818
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,870
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT
HAPPENS TO HER?

819
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,270
- OH, I'LL PROBABLY KILL HER
IN THE TROJAN WAR

820
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,470
OR TURN HER INTO A HULA-HOOP
IN THE 1950s.

821
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:29,940
I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHICH YET.

822
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,070
- KILL HER?

823
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,070
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'LL KILL HER.

824
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,740
A HULA-HOOP IS TOO CRUEL.

825
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,800
EVEN FOR ME.

826
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,970
- NO, NO, I DIDN'T MEAN
"TO KILL HER." NO.

827
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,270
- DON'T BE SO
SQUEAMISH, MY BOY.

828
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,600
THERE ARE VICTIMS
ALL THROUGH HISTORY.

829
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,440
MY VICTIMS.

830
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,940
O'BRIEN'S VICTIMS.

831
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,900
AND SOON, YOUR VICTIMS.

832
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,300
- BODY COUNT IS THE BOTTOM
LINE IN OUR BUSINESS.

833
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,370
- THIS IS BEGINNING TO SOUND

834
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,640
LIKE A HORROR FILM HERE,
O'BRIEN.

835
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,670
- OH, I ALWAYS SAY,
"ART IMITATES DEATH."

836
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,600
BYE-BYE, HAPPY HUNK GOLDEN.

837
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,340
I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE
MIDNIGHT AFTER LABOR DAY

838
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,040
TO CLOSE THE DEAL.

839
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,540
WE'LL BE EXPECTING
APPALLING, HORRIFYING,

840
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:23,270
HORRIBLE, GHASTLY
THINGS FROM YOU.

841
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,870
CIAO, BABY.

842
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,800
- I ASSIST IVAN
THE TERRIBLE?

843
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,240
- IT'S NO BIGGIE.

844
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,600
SO EVERY FEW CENTURIES YOU
RE-PERPETUATE EVIL

845
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,400
SOMEWHERE IN HISTORY.

846
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,700
- OH, A TIME-TRAVELLING SATANIC
SALESPERSON, LIKE YOU.

847
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,740
- RIGHT.

848
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,370
THEN WE CAN BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

849
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,670
THINK OF IT.

850
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,970
DECEMBER 6, 1941.

851
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:53,470
WE HIT TOKYO TO SCARF SOME
SAKE AND SUSHI IN TIME TO

852
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:56,470
BOMB PEARL HARBOR
ON DECEMBER 7.

853
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:59,270
TALK ABOUT ROMANTIC.

854
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,800
- YEAH.

855
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,470
FINALLY MEET A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

856
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,600
AND SHE WANTS ME TO
BOMB PEARL HARBOR.

857
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
"TALK ABOUT ROMANTIC."

858
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,240
- YOU MET THE DEVIL?

859
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,200
- EVERYTHING WAS GOING
LIKE A CHARM TOO.

860
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
JUST LIKE O'BRIEN
SAID IT WOULD.

861
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,400
- AND WHAT DID THE
DEVIL LOOK LIKE?

862
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,640
- HIS NAME IS DR. D.

863
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,770
HE WAS DRESSED LIKE
ATTILA THE HUN.

864
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,370
- ATTILA THE HUN?

865
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,100
- AND HIS CAPTIVE ROMAN
SLAVE GIRL WITH HIM,

866
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,340
NAMED CHINCHILLA
OR SOMETHING.

867
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,070
- WELL, SHE'LL NEVER BE
COLD WITH A NAME LIKE THAT.

868
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,140
- HE'S GONNA KILL HER DURING
THE TROJAN WAR OR TURN HER

869
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,970
INTO A HULA-HOOP
IN THE 1950s.

870
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,000
HE'LL DO IT TOO.

871
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,500
- I'M SURE HE WILL.

872
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,100
- GONNA TRAVEL
THROUGH TIME TOO.

873
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,300
- HUNK?

874
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,540
- YEAH.

875
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,400
- HAVE YOU BEEN
TAKING DRUGS?

876
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,600
- FOR WHAT?

877
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,270
I WAS FLYING HIGH ON MY OWN
TILL DR. D. SHOWED UP.

878
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:04,570
- MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE OUR
NEXT SESSION AT YOUR HOUSE.

879
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,400
- OH, YOU MAKE HOUSE CALLS?

880
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,700
- NO.

881
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,200
NOT NORMALLY.

882
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,500
BUT I THINK MAYBE SOMETHING
AT THE SEA SPRAY SETTING

883
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,200
MIGHT REVEAL CLUES THAT I
JUST CAN'T DISCOVER HERE.

884
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,300
- STILL THINK I'M
JOKING, DON'T YOU?

885
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,670
- NO.
I THINK YOUR PANIC IS GENUINE.

886
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,600
JUST NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THE SOURCE.

887
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,840
- IF I COULD ONLY GET YOU AND
O'BRIEN IN THE SAME ROOM.

888
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,040
SHE'S EXHIBIT A-PLUS.

889
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,840
- HOW'S TUESDAY AT TEN?

890
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,070
- GOOD.

891
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,870
DOC!

892
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,000
I MEAN, SUNNY.

893
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,470
UH, COME IN.

894
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,840
I HAD A LATE NIGHT.

895
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,970
- SO IT SEEMS.

896
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,800
- AIR DEUTSCHLAND.

897
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,670
THE MESSERSCHMITT SISTERS.

898
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,640
URSULA...

899
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,400
UND UMLAUT.

900
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,540
ICH BIN EIN BERLINER!

901
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,770
THEY FOLLOWED ME HOME FROM THE
7-11 AND SANG BEATLES SONGS

902
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,270
AT THE DOOR TO ME IN
GERMAN TILL I LET THEM IN.

903
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,470
- IT'S ALL PART OF OBSERVING
YOU IN YOUR

904
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:22,170
SUPERNATURAL HABITAT.

905
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,700
- TOUCHE.

906
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,640
WELL, NOW,
WHERE WERE WE, DOC?

907
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,970
- LET'S GET YOU
OUT IN PUBLIC.

908
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,340
I WANNA SEE YOUR HUNK
MAGNETISM AT WORK.

909
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,370
- THE BEACH.

910
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,670
PERFECT.

911
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,000
HANG ON.
HELLO?

912
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
- BRADLEY.

913
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,870
IT'S CONSTAPOPOLIS CALLING.

914
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,640
AND HOW IS DOING OUR
LITTLE GENIUS, EH?

915
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,040
- IT'S MY BOSS.

916
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,840
BRADLEY'S BOSS,
CONSTANTINE CONSTAPOPOLIS.

917
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,500
HELLO, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS,
HOW ARE DEMETRA,

918
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,970
DEMETRIUS AND CONSTANTINE, JR.?

919
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,900
- IS THIS BRADLEY BRINKMAN?

920
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,240
- OF COURSE.

921
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,300
- IT DON'T SOUND
LIKE YOU, BRADLEY.

922
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,140
- HE DOESN'T
BELIEVE I'M BRADLEY.

923
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,200
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

924
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,040
YEAH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TRY TO DO MY OLD VOICE.

925
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,540
ONE MINUTE, MR. C.
DOORBELL.

926
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:31,340
UH ...
HELLO, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS.

927
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,700
YES, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS?

928
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,640
YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. CONSTAPOPOLIS.
GOT IT.

929
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,170
[as Bradley]
THANKS FOR THE BAKLAVA.

930
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,300
EVERYTHING WAS FANTASTIC.

931
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,300
- THAT'S MY BRADLEY.

932
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,870
SO HAVE YOU WRITTEN
PROGRAM X YET?

933
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,440
NO, DON'T TELL ME.
DON'T TELL ME.

934
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,240
I'LL WAIT TILL YOU COME
BACK AFTER LABOR DAY, HUH?

935
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,470
HUH?

936
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,600
- PROGRAM X.

937
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
LABOR DAY.

938
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
UH, RIGHT.

939
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,940
EVERYTHING IS COMING
ALONG JUST FINE.

940
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,500
- OH, LISTEN, THE
DISTRIBUTORS NEED IT BY

941
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,970
NOVEMBER, SO YOU MUST
DELIVER IT AFTER LABOR DAY.

942
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,840
NO PRESSURE, OF COURSE.

943
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,240
- NO SWEAT.

944
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,800
NO PRESSURE AT ALL. RIGHT.
COMING UP RIGHT AFTER LABOR DAY.

945
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,870
- GOOD, GOOD. TELL ME, BRADLEY--
WHAT IS IT? HMM?

946
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,740
GIVE ME A HINT.
JUST A LITTLE HINT.

947
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,240
JUST A TINY, LITTLE HINT.

948
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,740
JUST A--NO, NO, DON'T TELL ME.

949
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:25,600
NO. JUST A LITTLE.
COME ON.

950
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,570
- AND RUIN THE SURPRISE?

951
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:31,700
- "AND RUIN THE SURPRISE."

952
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,900
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

953
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,240
A GENIUS, YOU HEAR ME?

954
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,170
BRADLEY, I KISS YOU. MWAH!

955
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:50,700
"AND RUIN THE SURPRISE."

956
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,500
- HI, GARRISON GAYLORD HERE.

957
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:59,740
THIS WEEK ON "FILTHY RICH,"
WE SCAMPER ALONG THE SLEEK,

958
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:05,340
CHIC, SUNNY SHORES OF THE
GREEK ISLAND OF IMPHAL,

959
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,900
A MILLIONAIRE'S PARADISE.

960
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,270
- CUT!

961
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,570
- WHAT?

962
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,470
- NUMBER ONE, GARRISON,
YOUR FLY IS OPEN.

963
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:17,940
- OH.

964
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,140
- AND TWO, LAST
WEEK WAS IPINO.

965
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,740
THIS WEEK WE'RE
IN SEA SPRAY,

966
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,770
HOME OF THE POLAR ICE
CAP YOU'RE DRINKING.

967
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,240
- ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

968
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,670
- OKAY.

969
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,570
- I'VE GOT IT NOW.
- YOU'VE GOT IT NOW.

970
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:31,800
- YES.
- YES.

971
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,840
- I'VE GOT IT.

972
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,970
- OKAY, LET'S TAKE TWO.

973
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,240
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT ALL
ABOUT THAT NEW PROGRAM I WAS--

974
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,240
I MEAN, BRADLEY
WAS SUPPOSED TO WRITE.

975
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,570
- DO YOU SEE HOW
THIS OBSESSION

976
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:49,070
WITH AN IMAGINARY PERSONALITY
TORMENTS YOU?

977
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,100
LET IT GO.

978
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,600
- SUNNY, BRADLEY
IS NOT IMAGINARY.

979
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,900
- I'M READY.

980
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,500
- ROLL TAPE.

981
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,570
- "FILTHY RICH."
TAKE 12.

982
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,000
- AH. HI, GARRISON GAYLORD HERE.

983
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,440
THIS WEEK ON "FILTHY RICH,"
WE SCAMPER ALONG THE SLEEK,

984
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,540
CHIC, SUNNY SHORES
OF SEA SPRAY,

985
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:19,470
HOME OF THE POLAR ICE CAP I AM
DRINKING.

986
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,470
OH...

987
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,000
- OH, NO.
NOT AGAIN, GARRISON.

988
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,940
- IT WAS THE SAME BLINKING
THING I DID IN MONACO.

989
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,400
- NO, IN MONACO, YOU SET THE
DUCHESS OF DUNGLEMORE'S WIG

990
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
ON FIRE.

991
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,570
DO YOU REMEMBER?

992
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,640
- NYET.

993
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,870
- I DO.

994
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,240
THAT'S OUR BREAK, EVERYBODY.

995
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,270
CUT!

996
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,100
GET HIM INTO WARDROBE.

997
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,800
- ALL MY WARDROBE IS
BACK IN MY MOTEL ROOM,

998
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:47,170
SO THAT YOUR WARDROBE PERSON
WON'T STARCH MY COLLARS

999
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:50,400
INTO CARDBOARD.

1000
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,100
- OH, NOW HE'S WALKING--
WHERE'S HE GOING?

1001
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:01,800
- ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT SHOT
IS AT THE END OF THE PIER.

1002
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,640
- WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT
ANY AFTERLIFE

1003
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,470
OR AFTER-DEATH EXISTS.

1004
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,140
- I'M PROOF, SUNNY.

1005
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,570
- MORTALITY MEANS LIVING WHO YOU
ARE AND LOVING WHO YOU ARE

1006
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,440
RIGHT NOW.

1007
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,400
HOW ELSE CAN
ANYONE LOVE YOU?

1008
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,140
- I'M SORRY.

1009
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,270
- HEY, WASN'T THAT
GARRISON GAYLORD?

1010
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,270
- I DON'T KNOW.

1011
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,270
- HUH.

1012
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,840
- ANYWAY, WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SAY--

1013
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,040
- OH, MY BLEEDING
DRIVER'S NEVER HERE.

1014
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,270
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

1015
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,240
OW!

1016
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,200
OH!

1017
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,740
- OH!

1018
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,640
HERE COMES GARRISON. HE'S IN
REVERSE AND OUT OF CONTROL.

1019
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,240
- IF HE KILLS
HIMSELF ON CAMERA,

1020
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,770
THE RATINGS ARE
GOING TO SOAR.

1021
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,400
- YOU WANT IT?
YOU SHOOT IT.

1022
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,840
- WATCH OUT!

1023
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,200
- THERE IS A DARK
POWER, SUNNY.

1024
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,640
I'LL PROVE IT
TO YOU SOMEHOW.

1025
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,400
- HEY, YOU TWO, WATCH OUT!

1026
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,370
- WHOO-HA-HA!

1027
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,440
OH, I GOT THE
WHOLE THING ON TAPE!

1028
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,170
BABY!

1029
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,870
- THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
ASTONISHING FEATS I HAVE

1030
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,100
EVER SEEN.

1031
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,500
- HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, GUY.

1032
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,800
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A HERO.

1033
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,340
- A SUPERHERO.
YOU SAVED US ALL.

1034
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,700
- NEED ANY MORE
PROOF, SUNNY?

1035
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,900
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1036
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,170
- HUNK.

1037
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,400
HUNK GOLDEN.

1038
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,000
- OH, "THE INCREDIBLE HUNK."
I CAN'T BEAR IT.

1039
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,540
YOU TWO MARRIED?

1040
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,070
- UH, NO.
I'M HIS PSYCHOLOGIST, ACTUALLY.

1041
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,440
- OH, EVEN BETTER.

1042
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,540
- WHAT AN EXCLUSIVE.

1043
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,740
- PUMPING THAT MUCH
ADRENALINE MAKES

1044
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,840
ANY MAN A SUPERMAN.

1045
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,840
- ADRENALINE
WON'T STOP A JEEP.

1046
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,640
- YOU JUST SAVED MY LIFE.

1047
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,440
LOOK FOR YOUR
ANSWERS IN THAT.

1048
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,340
HUNK GOLDEN IS A HERO
FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.

1049
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,600
LOOK, THE MESSAGE IS SIMPLE--
THE WORLD NEEDS YOU.

1050
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,240
THE WORLD NEEDS TO BELIEVE
IN SOMEONE

1051
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,970
WHO RISES ABOVE THE ORDINARY.

1052
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:23,270
AND THAT SOMEONE IS YOU.

1053
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,570
- I'D REALLY GO MAD
WITHOUT YOU, SUNNY.

1054
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,040
I'D BETTER GO. U.C.L.A.
IS RUNNING SOME MORE TESTS.

1055
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,540
- YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

1056
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,870
SAME TIME TUESDAY?

1057
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,470
- YEAH.

1058
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,940
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE
YOUR ONLY CLIENT.

1059
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,500
- I TRY TO MAKE THEM
ALL FEEL LIKE THAT.

1060
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,070
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

1061
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,940
- NO.

1062
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,600
WE CAN'T.

1063
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:28,600
I CAN'T HELP YOU LIKE THIS.

1064
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,400
YOU'RE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE MAN.

1065
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
INSIDE.

1066
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,640
NOT JUST OUTSIDE.

1067
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,070
WE BETTER--

1068
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,070
- WAIT AND SEE.

1069
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:46,800
- YEAH.

1070
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,970
- SEE YOU TUESDAY.

1071
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,700
- THINK YOU HOOKED HIM?

1072
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,400
- THE CHEAP STUNT
WAS THE CLINCHER.

1073
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,000
- HE'S A BRIGHT BOY.

1074
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
THE KIND I NEED TO
START WORLD WAR III.

1075
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,540
THERE'S JUST ONE
TEENSY LITTLE PROBLEM.

1076
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,270
- AND WHAT'S THAT?

1077
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:26,870
- YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH
ANOTHER ONE, O'BRIEN.

1078
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,600
- I AM NOT IN
LOVE WITH HUNK.

1079
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,900
- PROMISES, PROMISES.

1080
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,740
YOU ALWAYS COME ON
LIKE GANGBUSTERS,

1081
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,070
THEN YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH THE POOR SLOB,

1082
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,100
AND THEN YOU END UP TALKING
HIM OUT OF WHAT YOU COST ME

1083
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,140
A FORTUNE IN SPECIAL
EFFECTS TO WOO HIM INTO.

1084
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,470
- CAN A SORCERESS HELP IT,
IF SHE GETS EMOTIONALLY

1085
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,240
INVOLVED WITH HER WORK?

1086
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,070
SOUL SEDUCTION IS DRAINING.

1087
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,370
- OH.

1088
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:55,100
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THE BAD OLD DAYS?

1089
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,340
LIKE WHEN YOU HAD THAT IDEA
ABOUT THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE.

1090
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,040
A BIODEGRADABLE DEATH ZONE.

1091
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,400
WITH GREAT FISHING.

1092
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,170
I WAS SO PROUD OF YOU.

1093
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,470
- I HID AL CAPONE'S SECRET
VAULTS

1094
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,840
FROM GERALDO RIVERA,
DIDN'T I?

1095
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,170
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DID.

1096
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,470
POOR GERALDO.

1097
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,570
I JUST LOVED THAT.

1098
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:21,840
- BESIDES, HUNK IS
FALLING RIGHT INTO LINE.

1099
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,540
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

1100
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,840
HE'S RICH.
HE'S FAMOUS.

1101
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,070
HE'S FALLING IN LOVE.

1102
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:30,240
HE'LL NEVER WANT TO
CHANGE BACK AGAIN NOW.

1103
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,470
NOW, THAT HE FELL IN
LOVE WITH YOU, DOCTOR.

1104
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:35,100
- HUNK'S OURS.

1105
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,370
I THINK.

1106
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,700
- YOU THINK?

1107
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,870
YOU THINK?

1108
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:45,740
I WARNED YOU ABOUT
THESE TRIAL OFFERS.

1109
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,040
YOUR DEAL EXPIRES THE
DAY AFTER LABOR DAY TOO,

1110
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,800
YOU KNOW, O'BRIEN.

1111
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,640
DON'T FORGET THAT.

1112
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,800
ANOTHER FAILURE, AND I'LL
HAVE TO TURN YOU BACK INTO--

1113
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,140
- NO.
NOT THAT.

1114
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,740
LOOK, JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER YEAR.
ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.

1115
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,570
- OH, LOOK AT YOU.
LOVE. YOU REEK OF IT.

1116
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,800
- YOU OWE ME A
SOUL A CENTURY.

1117
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,900
YOU ARE 0 FOR 99 YEARS.

1118
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,970
NO SOUL, NO DEAL.

1119
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:12,600
NO DEAL, NO O'BRIEN.

1120
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,800
- OKAY.

1121
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,640
LOOK, I MAKE HUNK FALL IN
LOVE WITH SUNNY--

1122
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,370
- AND NOT VICE VERSA.
- NOT VICE VERSA.

1123
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:23,940
AND SUNNY CONVINCES
HIM TO KEEP THE DEAL,

1124
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,770
AND THEN WHAT
HAPPENS TO SUNNY?

1125
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,540
- SUNNY?
WHY SUNNY?

1126
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,500
SUNNY?

1127
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,600
THE TUESDAY AFTER LABOR
DAY, SUNNY DISAPPEARS.

1128
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,400
HE NEVER SEES HER AGAIN.

1129
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,540
- OH, HUNK WILL
BE HEARTBROKEN.

1130
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,940
- OH, IF YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH HIM, IT WON'T MATTER,

1131
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,000
WILL IT?

1132
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,340
- IF HE EVER FINDS OUT,
HE'S GONNA HATE ME FOREVER.

1133
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,240
- WELL, THAT
CAN BE ARRANGED.

1134
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,000
I'LL BE WATCHING
YOU, O'BRIEN.

1135
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,770
HEIL HITLER.

1136
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,400
I WISH I NEVER INVENTED
THAT CLICKING BUSINESS.

1137
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,440
CIAO, SWEETHEART.

1138
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,870
- GARRISON GAYLORD HERE.

1139
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:14,840
TWO WEEKS AGO
ON "FILTHY RICH,"

1140
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,070
WE SHOWED YOU A REAL
LIVE ACT OF SUPERHEROISM.

1141
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,200
AS IT UNFOLDED RIGHT
BEFORE OUR CAMERAS.

1142
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,700
IN THE TWO WEEKS SINCE,
HUNK GOLDEN,

1143
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,940
THE SUPERMAN WHO
SAVED MY LIFE,

1144
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,600
HAS BECOME THE STUFF
OF AMERICAN LEGEND.

1145
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,100
A "FILTHY RICH" CAMERA CREW
AND I SHARED IT WITH HIM.

1146
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,700
"HUNKMANIA" IS SWEEPING
SEA SPRAY

1147
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,670
AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

1148
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:50,500
HUNK WANNABES CAMP AROUND
HIS HOME 24 HOURS,

1149
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,700
DESPERATE FOR JUST A LOOK AT
THE HUNK HIMSELF.

1150
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,140
HUNK'S SPORT COAT IS
THE BRAND-NEW LOOK,

1151
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,900
THE FASHION LOOK
OF THE 1980s.

1152
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,900
PROMOTIONAL OFFERS HAVE BEEN
FLOODING IN SINCE DAY ONE.

1153

JEANS TO DOG FOOD,

1154

FROM HEALTH CLUBS
TO HEMORRHOIDS,

1155
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,000

THE NEW JAMES BOND.

1157

PLAYBOY WANTS HIM.

1159
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,940
PLAYGIRL WANTS HIM.

1160
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,900
METEORIC FAME HAS
ALREADY FORCED HUNK INTO

1161
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,870
SELF-IMPOSED SECLUSION.

1162
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,600
CONSTANTLY AT HIS SIDE
THROUGHOUT THE DIZZYING SIEGE

1163
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,740
IS LOS ANGELES PSYCHOLOGIST
SUSAN "SUNNY" GRAVES

1164

WHO HE RESCUED.

1165
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:45,700
ARE THEY IN
ROMANTIC CAHOOTS?

1166
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,540
WILL SUCCESS
SPOIL HUNK GOLDEN?

1167
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,440
CLOSE FRIENDS SAY
HE'S CHANGED ALREADY.

1168
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,600
- U.P.I., SHMOO-P.I.,

1169
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,700

01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,970
YEAH, YEAH, HUNK-BURGER

1171
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,070
I'M SOLD OUT TILL 1992.

1172
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:03,400
UGH.

1173
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,270
HUNK GOLDEN.

1174
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,770
YEAH.
YES, SENATOR.

1175
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,300
NO, I'VE ALREADY BEEN ASKED
TO BE PUT ON

1176
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,170
THE STATE FLAG OF HAWAII, BUT--

1177
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,170
- HUNH! HUH!

1178
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,370
- CAN YOU HANG A SECOND,
SENATOR?

1179
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:22,740
HI. AGGRESSIVE LITTLE
THING, AREN'T YOU?

1180
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,400
THERE YOU GO.

1181
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:41,340
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
DROPPING IN.

1182
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,940
NO, SENATOR, I COULDN'T
PICK A FAVORITE STATE.

1183
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,070
OF COURSE, IF YOU'D LIKE TO
SPONSOR A BILL PUTTING ME ON

1184
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:49,800

1185
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:57,370
GOD DAMN IT, SUNNY!

1186
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,540
THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST
LIKE A BUNCH OF PIRANHA!

1187
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,770
BITE, BITE, BITE.

1188
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,140
- HUNK, COME ON. JUST--

1189
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,800
- SUNNY,
I'VE HAD IT OKAY.

1190
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,570
WATCH THIS.

1191
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,070
WAITING FOR SOMETHING
MORE GOLDEN?

1192
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,740
WELL, HERE IT IS--A
PERSON-TO-PERSON MESSAGE.

1193
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,470
STAY THE HELL

1194
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,100
TAKE THAT, FAT BOY.

1195
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,100
- STOP IT, HUNK.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY. HUNK, STOP IT.

1196
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,300
HUNK, DO YOU WANT TO BE ON THE
SIX O'CLOCK NEWS DOING THIS?

1197
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,900
- SURE, I DO.
I LOVE THE PUBLICITY, HONEY.

1198
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,270
- GIVE ME THIS.
GIVE IT TO ME.

1199
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,570
- FINE.
JUST FINE.

1200
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,740
- YOU CAN'T LET IT
GET TO YOU LIKE THIS.

1201
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,870
- I'M STARTING TO FEEL
DIFFERENT INSIDE.

1202
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,940
ALMOST LIKE A DEMON.

1203
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,800
- DEMONS DON'T EXIST.

1204
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,640
JUST PEOPLE AND PRESSURES.

1205
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,870
- YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE IT WHEN
YOUR GARBAGE IS FRONT PAGE NEWS.

1206

EXTRA! HUNK TOSSES LEAN CUISINE,
CAPPUCCINO GROUNDS

1207
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,070

1208
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,970
READ ALL ABOUT IT!

1209
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,000
- IT WON'T ALWAYS
BE LIKE THIS.

1210
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
YOU WON'T ALWAYS LIVE
UNDER THE MEDIA MICROSCOPE.

1211
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,170
YOU'LL COOL OFF, AND THEN
WE'LL HAVE--

1212
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:53,900
AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR
PRIVACY AGAIN.

1213
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,300
- YOU CAN SAY "WE."

1214
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,500
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

1215
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,100
- AND AFTER LABOR DAY TOMORROW,

1216
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,970
WE'LL BE OUT OF IT TOGETHER.

1217
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:04,970
YOU'LL FINALLY BE HUNK
GOLDEN IN YOUR OWN MIND.

1218
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,640
- KINDA LIKE BEING IN IT
TOGETHER

1219
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,200
WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

1220
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,370
- SO DO I.
BUT THERE ARE BETTER THINGS

1221
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,240
TO BE IN TOGETHER THAN THIS,
YOU KNOW.

1222
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:37,400
- THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

1223
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,770
- HUNK, WAKE UP, IT'S ME.

1224
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:03,970
YOUR OLD BODY?

1225
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,070
THE BODY YOU'RE ON
VACATION FROM, REMEMBER?

1226
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,270
- WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

1227
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:08,700
- EXACTLY.
HELL.

1228
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,140
I ESCAPED WHILE THEY WERE
WATCHING

1229
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,670
"THE POSSESSED" AND
"THE WRESTLERS."

1230
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,700
- HANG ON JUST A MINUTE.

1231
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,470
HEY, SUNNY.
SUNNY, WAKE UP.

1232
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,400
BRADLEY'S HERE.
WAKE UP.

1233
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,300
- HUNK, I DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

1234
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,500
- WHY WERE YOU IN HELL?

1235
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,840
- WHERE ELSE ARE THEY GONNA
HOLD THIS BODY IN ESCROW

1236
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,700
WHILE YOU DECIDE
WHO TO BOFF NEXT?

1237
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,100
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

1238
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,170
- WHAT A SLEAZEBAG
YOU'VE BECOME.

1239
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,300
HOSING DOWN INNOCENT FANS.

1240
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,340
- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

1241
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,070
- HOW'D I KNOW THAT?

1242
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,340
YOU'RE RUNNING AS A
MINI-SERIES ON DEMON TV.

1243
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,070
KILLER RATINGS.

1244
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,200
AND EVERYONE DOWN THERE'S
RIPPING OFF THEIR COATCOAT
SLEEVESSLEEVES.

1245
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,740
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO ME?

1246
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,600
- THE HELL YOU DON'T.

1247
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,800
EVIL HAS TAKEN
ROOT IN YOUR SOUL.

1248
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,640
AND IT USED TO BE
SUCH A NICE SOUL.

1249
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,600
LONELY, BUT NICE.

1250
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:02,800
- IT'S THEM.
IT'S THEM!

1251
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,970
I CAME TO WARN YOU.

1252
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,200
DR. D. IS FOR REAL
AND SO IS HELL.

1253
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,070
HUNK, I KNOW YOU
CAN FEEL IT ALREADY.

1254
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,540
- HEY, SUNNY. SUNNY. YOU'RE
MISSING IT. WAKE UP. WAKE UP.

1255
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,400
- FORGET ABOUT HER AND
THINK ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

1256
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,470
IT IS SLIME TIME DOWN THERE.

1257
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:21,570
EX-GAME SHOW HOSTS, USED-CAR
SALESMEN, TV SPOKESMODELS.

1258
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,670
EVEN MRS. KREPPEL.

1259
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:23,800
- NO.
- YES!

1260
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,270
MRS. KREPPEL, THAT NINTH
GRADE BIOLOGY BITCH THAT

1261
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,700
FLUNKED US.
TWICE.

1262
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,070
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?

1263
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,370
- THINK. THINK IF IT'S WORTH IT.
- WHAT ABOUT SUNNY?

1264
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:33,500
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER, AND IT'S
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

1265
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,900
- DON'T YOU THINK
I CAN FEEL THAT?

1266
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,700
BUT A LIFETIME WITH HER IS A
ONE-NIGHT STAND COMPARED TO

1267
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,800
AN ETERNITY OF EVIL.

1268
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,240
HUNK!

1269
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,440
I KNOW YOU. I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

1270
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,970
- BRADLEY!

1271
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,400
SUNNY'S GOTTA SEE THIS.

1272
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,940
SUNNY, SUNNY, WAKE UP.
- WHAT IS IT?

1273
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,870
- BRADLEY WAS JUST HERE. THEY
CAME AND CARRIED HIM

1274
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,770
BACK TO HELL. COME ON. COME ON.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

1275
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,700
- I WAS IN SUCH A DEEP SLEEP.
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

1276
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,540
LOOK, SUNNY.

1277
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,200
- YOU WOKE ME UP TO SHOW
ME THE BEDROOM DOOR.

1278
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,000
- NO, NO, NO. JUST A MINUTE AGO,
THESE ARMS CAME

1279
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,300
AND PUNCHED HOLES RIGHT THROUGH
THE DOOR AND PULLED BRADLEY

1280
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,470
RIGHT BACK THROUGH THE WOOD.

1281
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,270
- HONEY, HONEY, YOU WERE
JUST DREAMING, OKAY?

1282
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:21,000
- NO.

1283
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,540
THEN HOW DID I GET THIS
SPLINTER IN MY FINGER, HUH?

1284
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,400
- I DON'T KNOW.
I-I-I DON'T KNOW, HOW?

1285
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,570
- FROM THE HOLE IN THE DOOR.

1286
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:31,970
- HUNK, THE ONLY IN THIS
ROOM IS IN YOUR HEAD.

1287
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:34,040
LOOK, YOU'RE JUST UPSET,
BECAUSE YOUR WHOLE BRADLEY

1288
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,100
FANTASY SHATTERS
TO BITS TOMORROW.

1289
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,240
- SUNNY, DON'T BE
MAD AT ME, OKAY?

1290
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,300
- HONEY, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

1291
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,400
I JUST WANT US
TO GET PAST THIS.

1292
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,900
I WANT IT TO BE THE TWO OF
US, NOT THE THREE OF US.

1293
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,440
- LOOK, YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE
THE BEST THING THAT

1294
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,570
EVER HAPPENED TO ME, RIGHT?

1295
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,400
- WHY DON'T WE SHOWER AND
GO HAVE SOME BREAKFAST, HUH?

1296
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,800
- YEAH. YEAH.
I'LL JOIN YOU IN A SECOND.

1297
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,070
- GOOD.

1298
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:36,700
- GET IN.

1299
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,440
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1300
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,200
- I WAS SWIMMING KOSHER HOT DOGS
FROM MIAMI TO HAVANA FOR FIDEL

1301
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,200
DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
WHEN BRINKMAN ESCAPED.

1302
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,640
- SPIRITUAL
SEPARATION ANXIETY.

1303
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,000
HIS GOOD HALF IS SO STRONG.

1304
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,370
- YES, SO DON'T WIMP OUT.

1305
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,970
GOOD MOVE SUGGESTING
BREAKFAST.

1306
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:03,140
BUT LISTEN, DON'T LET HIM
SLEEP BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

1307
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,140
- HE'S STILL TIPPED
IN OUR DIRECTION.

1308
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,940
- YES, BUT ONE MORE SILLY,
SAPPY, SENTIMENTAL DREAM,

1309
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,940
AND HE'LL BACK OUT
AT THE LAST SECOND.

1310
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,840
- TALKING TO ME, HONEY?

1311
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,640
- [as Sonny] I'M SINGING IN
THE SHOWER, DEAR!

1312
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:21,040
NOW LISTEN, KEEP HIM
AWAKE, AND HE'S OURS.

1313
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,970
- RIGHT.

1314
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,070
- WELL, THAT DIDN'T
SOUND LIKE SINGING TO ME.

1315
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:36,100
- THEN YOU
WEREN'T LISTENING.

1316
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,470
I LOVE YOU.

1317
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,500
- GREAT BREAKFAST.

1318
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,940
- MM-HMM.

1319
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:04,370
- SWEETHEART, I'M STILL A
LITTLE JANGLED

1320
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:07,570
FROM BRADLEY LAST NIGHT.
MIND IF I TAKE A NAP.

1321
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,640
- MM-MM. I THINK A NAP'S
A GOOD IDEA.

1322
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,600
YOU WANT TO BE IN TIP-TOP
SHAPE WHEN THEY PRESENT YOU

1323
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,400
WITH THE KEY TO SEA SPRAY
AT THE CLUB TONIGHT.

1324
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,870
- RIGHT.

1325
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,470
- SWEET DREAMS.

1326
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,400
BYE, HUNK!

1327
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,370
- HELLO?

1328
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:19,770
HELLO?
HELLO?

1329
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,870
HELLO?

1330
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,300
- HI.
- HI.

1331
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,370
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NAP?

1332
01:20:58,370 --> 01:20:59,600
- SABOTAGED.

1333
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,500
AFTER YOU LEFT, EVERY
APPLIANCE IN THE HOUSE

1334
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,400
TURNED ITSELF ON.
I COULDN'T TURN 'EM OFF.

1335
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,170
I MEAN, DON'T YOU HEAR IT?

1336
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:09,840
- HEAR WHAT?

1337
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,070
- IT STOPPED.

1338
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,570
- HUNK, ARE YOU
HAVING ANOTHER DREAM?

1339
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,400
- NO, NO, NOW, SUNNY,
SUNNY, I--I--NEVER,

1340
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,140
NEVER, NEVER WENT TO SLEEP.

1341
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:23,840
TEN MINUTES AGO, THEY WERE ALL
RUNNING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

1342
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,800
- HUNK, NOTHING RUNS
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

1343
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,300
- YEAH.

1344
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,470
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T WRITTEN
YOUR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH FOR

1345
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,900
THE BANQUET TONIGHT, SO WHY
DON'T--

1346
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,540
- SUNNY, SUNNY, FORGET ABOUT THE
BANQUET.

1347
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,600
YOU'RE MEETING THE DEVIL
TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.

1348
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
- SETTLE DOWN.

1349
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,900
- MAYBE O'BRIEN TOO.

1350
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,340
- ALL RIGHT.

1351
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,700
SUPPOSE I DO MEET THE
DEVIL, WHO YOU GONNA CHOOSE?

1352
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,300
ME OR BRADLEY?

1353
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,070
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, SUNNY.

1354
01:21:57,070 --> 01:22:00,040
I STILL DON'T KNOW.

1355
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,700
- LET'S GET A SHOT
OF US SHAKING HANDS.

1356
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,770
- WHY NOT?

1357
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,170
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

1358
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:33,200
- IT'S TWO MINUTES LATER THAN
THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED ME.

1359
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,940
IT'S 10:32.

1360
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,900
- WE HAVE TO MEET DR. D.
AT MIDNIGHT.

1361
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,400
I'M GONNA SLEEP TOMORROW,
NO MATTER WHO I AM.

1362
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,300
- AND I'LL BE WITH YOU.

1363
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,200
- NO MATTER WHO I AM?

1364
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,540
- YOU'LL BE HUNK.
YOU'LL SEE.

1365
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,900
- I SURE WISH O'BRIEN
COULD SEE ME

1366
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,400
GETTING THE KEY TO THE CITY.

1367
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,470
- I'M SURE SHE'S WATCHING.

1368
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,500
- LOOK AT THAT [indistinct].

1369
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:09,770
REMINDS ME OF THE COCKTAIL
LOUNGE ON THE LUSITANIA.

1370
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:12,100
HAPPY MEMORIES.

1371
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,470
BON APPETIT.

1372
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,440
- ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.

1373
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,840
IT'S AWARD TIME.

1374
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,970
AS PRESIDENT OF THE SEA SPRAY
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION,

1375
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:34,140
IT IS MY HONOR
TO HONOR ONE OF OUR OWN.

1376
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:38,540
A MAN I AM PROUD
TO CALL MY FRIEND.

1377
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,670
WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED
HERE AT SEA SPRAY,

1378
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:45,640
I REALIZED HE WAS
SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL.

1379
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,900
AND NOW THE WORLD
KNOWS IT TOO.

1380
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,240
- WHAT A PHONY.

1381
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,400
- HUNK, WE'RE PRESENTING YOU
WITH THE KEY TO SEA SPRAY

1382
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,670
TONIGHT, BUT YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
TO USE IT. WHY?

1383
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:08,870
BECAUSE OUR HOMES AND HEARTS
ARE OPEN TO YOU FOREVER.

1384
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:19,000
- A LITTLE BIT CORNY,
BUT THE CROWD'S WITH HIM.

1385
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,440
WHAT DO THEY KNOW?

1386
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,340
- HUNK GOLDEN, PLEASE STEP
FORWARD FOR THE PRESENTATION.

1387
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,570
AND IF I MAY SAY SO, THIS KEY IS
NOTHING COMPARED TO THE LADY

1388
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:42,640
WHO IS THE SUNNY SIDE IN HUNK'S
LIFE--DR. SUNNY GRAVES.

1389
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:58,570
AND HERE TO PRESENT THE KEY IS
THE HONORARY MAYOR OF SEA SPRAY,

1390
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:02,600
THE STAR OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE
LITE KNOCKWURST COMMERCIALS,

1391

SKEET MECKLENBURG!

1392
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,370
- THANK YOU.

1393
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,740
HUNK, EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS
THAT I HATED YOU ON SIGHT,

1394
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:26,140
AND WELL, I'VE GOT
TO HAND IT TO YOU,

1395
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,900
YOU DID PUT ME IN MY PLACE.

1396
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:39,500
THEY CALLED YOU A SUPERMAN
FOR DOING IT AND SOMEHOW IT

1397
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:45,000
SEEMS LIKE A SUPERGUY
DESERVES MORE THAN A KEY,

1398
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
DESERVES A CROWN.

1399
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,970
- SKEET, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

1400
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:53,840
WE HAD T-SHIRT RIGHTS.
HUNK!

1401
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:58,140
HUNK!

1402
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,200
- HELL OF A SUPERMAN.

1403
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,170
- IF THAT SKEET
SCREWS UP MY PLANS,

1404
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:06,600
I'LL BRING HIM BACK
AS A WHOOPEE CUSHION.

1405
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,900
- HUNK?

1406
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,700
- HUNK, WAKE UP.
HUNK, YOU'VE GOT TO WAKE UP.

1407
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:15,200
- WILL SOMEBODY WAKE THAT SUCKER
UP? I NEED HIM.

1408
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,470
- HUNK, PLEASE, WAKE UP.

1409
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:20,000
COME ON.
YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP.

1410
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,670
- BRILLIANT STROKE, HUNK.

1411
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,840
MAKING OUR DEVILS BRIGADE
RAID ON SEA SPRAY LOOK LIKE

1412
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,440
AN ENEMY SNEAK ATTACK.

1413
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,800
- I PROMISED YOU WORLD
WAR III BY DINNER TIME.

1414
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:55,440
- LOOK, ALL THOSE YUPPIE SNOBS
YOU HATED ARE DEAD MEAT NOW.

1415
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,040
- DEAD MEAT NOW.

1416
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,040
- DID YOU KILL THEM
ALL YOURSELF?

1417
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,300
- SHUCKS, DR. D.

1418
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,200
- OH, DON'T BE MODEST.

1419
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:10,040
- MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT.
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT.

1420
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:15,570
- CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.
GOOD BOY.

1421
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:26,140
THERE'S JUST ONE
LITTLE FORMALITY.

1422
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:33,300
BEFORE YOU CAN TRULY COMMIT
YOUR SOUL TO MY WICKED WORK,

1423
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,770
YOU MUST GET RID OF
YOUR BETTER HALF.

1424
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:38,070
WE'VE ALL THE
FIXINGS RIGHT HERE.

1425
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:42,100
THAT SAPPY, SENTIMENTAL
SIDE OF YOUR SOUL

1426
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,370
MUST BE DESTROYED.

1427
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:47,570
YOU READY TO SAVE
YOURSELF, BRINKMAN?

1428
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:50,240
- HUNK, DON'T DO THIS TO US!

1429
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,570
ALL EVIL AND NO PLAY
MAKES HUNK A DULL DEMON!

1430
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:57,000
- READY.

1431
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,500
- YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME!

1432
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,940
THE GOOD THINGS ARE
WHAT LIFE'S ALL ABOUT.

1433
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:05,540
YOU CAN'T WANNA BE THE GUY
WHO STARTED WORLD WAR III.

1434
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:08,770
- AIM.

1435
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:11,040
- ALL THIS JUST TO GET LAID
MORE AND A GUEST HOST

1436
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,800
ON THE CARSON SHOW?

1437
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,540
PLEASE, GIVE AN INNOCENT
BETTER HALF A BREAK. HUH?

1438
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:20,240
- MY FAVORITE WORD--FIRE.

1439
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,100
- HUNK! PLEASE! NO! DON'T!

1440
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,640
- FIRE, FIRE, FI--

1441
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:37,040
- WAIT. OH HE'S ALL RIGHT.
WAIT.

1442
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,300
- YOU'RE ALL STILL ALIVE.

1443
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,340
- OF COURSE,
WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

1444
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:44,000
EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT ATE THE ROAST BEEF.

1445
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,100
- FOR A SECOND THERE, I WAS
KILLING ALL MY-- --YOUR

1446
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,000
INVESTMENTS GOODBYE.

1447
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,270
- WHAT HAPPENED?

1448
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:52,570
- SKEET CROWNED YOU WITH
THE KEY TO SEA SPRAY.

1449
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:53,570
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

1450
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:55,700
- YEAH.

1451
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:57,940
WHAT TIME IS IT?

1452
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,040
- MY WATCH STOPPED.

1453
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,300
- IT'S TEN MINUTES
TO MIDNIGHT.

1454
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,340
- HUNK!

1455
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,040
- HUNK, COME ON.
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

1456
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,940
- YOU AND I HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH DR. D.

1457
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,170
- HUNK, YOU CAN HAVE A
CONCUSSION. NOW, COME ON.

1458
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:09,440
- COME ON.
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1459
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,340
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. THE KEY,
THE PRESENTATION--

1460
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,370
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1461
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:13,400
- TO THE DEVIL!

1462
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:17,740
- both: OUR INVESTMENTS.

1463
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,600
- NO WAY I'M GONNA BE THE GUY
WHO STARTED WORLD WAR III.

1464
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,040
- HOW CAN YOU HAVE STARTED A
WAR THAT HASN'T EVEN BEGUN?

1465
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,200
- IN THE FUTURE, IT HAS, SUNNY.

1466
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,140
IT STARTS RIGHT
HERE IN SEA SPRAY.

1467
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,970
- WELL, IT'S
ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

1468
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:37,300
WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE
ONE MINUTE FROM NOW?

1469
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,600
- BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

1470
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,100
- WHAT?
- SUNNY.

1471
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:45,300
SUNNY, I KNOW IF YOU TRULY
LOVE ME--THE ME INSIDE--

1472
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,200
IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER TO YOU
IF I COME BACK JUST IN

1473
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,400
A DIFFERENT KIND OF BODY.

1474
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,040
- I DO LOVE YOU.

1475
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,370
I LOVE WHAT'S INSIDE.

1476
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:55,570
BUT HUNK YOU HAVE TO
ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE.

1477
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:58,940
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU
SOUND JUST LIKE O'BRIEN.

1478
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,100
THE ONLY LIMITATION IN OUR
RELATIONSHIP IS THAT YOU

1479
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:05,740
CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

1480
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:07,400
WHEN YOU MEET DR. D. A FEW
SECONDS FROM NOW,

1481
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,440
YOU WILL, THOUGH. COME ON.

1482
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,470
TOLD YOU HE'D
BE HERE, SUNNY.

1483
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:23,970
- IS THIS SOME
KIND OF TRICK?

1484
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:25,470
- WISH IT WERE.
COME ON.

1485
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:41,040
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

1486
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,740
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY, I
WHIPPED UP A FEW LITTLE

1487
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:47,000
GOODIES TO CELEBRATE
OUR CLOSING OUR DEAL.

1488
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,540
- DR. D., AT YOUR
SERVICE, SUNNY.

1489
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,770
- AND IMPECCABLE SERVICE IT
IS TOO.

1490
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:54,300
SEE? CANNIBAL CANAPES,

1491
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,900
ALL-WHITE MEAT MISSIONARY
(NO AGNOSTIC FILLERS),

1492
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,800
FANTASTIC TITANIC
ICEBERG LETTUCE SALAD,

1493
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,040
KILLER TOMATOES, AND
DEVILED EGGS A LA MOI.

1494
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,570
- THERE'S NO DEAL, DR. D.

1495
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:09,840
- WHAT?

1496
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,340
- A LIFE OF SELFISH PLEASURE
AND AN ETERNAL AFTERLIFE

1497
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:16,740
AS ONE OF YOUR HENCHMEN
IS A ROTTEN EXCHANGE.

1498
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:19,600
I WANT SUNNY TO MEET
O'BRIEN RIGHT NOW.

1499
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,140
- O'BRIEN WILL BE
AROUND, ALL RIGHT,

1500
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,300
BUT LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT O'BRIEN.

1501
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,300
WHY LET A FEW
DREAMS SCARE YOU,

1502
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:28,000
WHEN YOU CAN BE A LIVING
NIGHTMARE YOURSELF?

1503
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,440
- I WANNA BE BRADLEY
BRINKMAN AGAIN.

1504
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,300
WHY CAN'T O'BRIEN
BE HERE TO SEE THIS?

1505
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,040
- OH, SHE'LL SEE
IT, ALL RIGHT.

1506
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,170
SO BE IT.

1507
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:40,500
EXIT, HUNK GOLDEN.

1508
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,900
ENTER, BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

1509
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,500
- THIS IS BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

1510
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,500
THIS IS ME.

1511
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:01,070
IT HAD TO BE
THIS WAY, SUNNY.

1512
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:02,470
- I KNOW.

1513
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:06,240
- THE GAME IS UP FOR HER
TOO, BRADLEY BRINKMAN.

1514
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:10,840
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

1515
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,340
- WHAT?

1516
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,770
- OH, THE DEVIL
MADE HER DO IT.

1517
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,840
- AND I THOUGHT
THAT YOU LOVED ME.

1518
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,440
- I DID.

1519
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,000
I MEAN, I DO.

1520
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,770
BRADLEY, YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

1521
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:30,500
ALL THE DREAMS WERE TRUE.

1522
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,270
I HAD TO LIE TO GET
YOU TO CLOSE THE DEAL.

1523
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,270
YOU BELIEVED IN
YOUR OLD SELF MORE.

1524
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:37,770
- AND I BELIEVED IN YOU.

1525
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:38,800
NOW WHAT?

1526
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,370
- DISMISSAL.

1527
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:43,070
- MY DEAL'S UP TOO.

1528
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:44,370
- YOUR DEAL?

1529
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:48,800
- FABULOUS DEAL TILL SHE
GOT SENTIMENTAL AND SLOPPY.

1530
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,500
- I HAD TO LAND A SOUL A CENTURY
FOR DR. D. OR LOSE MY DEAL.

1531
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,600
- SHE HASN'T MADE A SCORE SINCE

1532
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,470
OTTO VON BISMARCK IN 1887.

1533
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:02,600
- I'M TOO MUCH A ROMANTIC
TO KEEP RECRUITING NICE GUYS

1534
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,240
FOR THE DEVIL'S WORK.

1535
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,840
NICE GUYS LIKE YOU.

1536
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,170
- THEN WHY DO YOU
KEEP DOING IT?

1537
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,570
- I WAS AFRAID.

1538
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,900
I AM AFRAID.

1539
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,440
TO BE THE REAL ME.

1540
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:22,400
THE ONE THAT SOLD THEIR SOUL TO
DR. D. IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1541
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,770
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE SUNNY.
OR YOU WERE.

1542
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,800
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TAUGHT
ME THAT PEOPLE EXIST ON THE

1543
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,540
INSIDE, NOT ON THE OUTSIDE.

1544
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:33,140
EVEN IF IT WAS TO DECEIVE ME,
THE LOVE I FELT FROM YOU

1545
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:38,900
CAME FROM SOME WONDERFUL PERSON.
I THINK--

1546
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:42,870
- I'M REALLY TOUCHED.
I -- VERY TOUCHING.

1547
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:46,800
BUT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
TO CATCH AN ILL WIND TO BEIRUT.

1548
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:55,700
LOOK. SINCE IT'S
HITLER'S BIRTHDAY,

1549
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,900
I'LL MAKE YOU ONE LAST
OFFER--SIX MONTHS' EXTENSION

1550
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,500
TO MAKE GOOD ON BEING BAD.

1551
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,240
- NO WAY.

1552
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,270
- SIX MONTHS?

1553
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,570
- NO, DON'T.

1554
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:07,470
WHOEVER YOU ARE OR WERE.

1555
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:09,440
DON'T BE AFRAID.

1556
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,100
THERE IS A PERSON INSIDE OF
YOU WHO IS WARM AND LOVING.

1557
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,200
I KNOW.
I'VE FELT IT.

1558
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,800
- O'BRIEN.

1559
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,370
REMEMBER HOW
LONELY YOU WERE?

1560
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:22,400
- CAN'T BE LONELIER THAN
RUNNING A TIME-TRAVELLING

1561
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,600
SELL-YOUR-SOUL-TO-SATAN
SERVICE.

1562
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,240
- WELL--

1563
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:32,270
- DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE THE
PERSON WHO YOU ARE INSIDE.

1564
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,340
- STRONG ENOUGH TO COME BACK
TO EARTH

1565
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:37,200
AS YOURSELF USED TO BE?

1566
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,500
- I WAS.

1567
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,070
- I'M STAYING WITH--

1568
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:45,540
- UNLIMITED CREDIT ON
"INFERNOCARD?"

1569
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:51,440
- I'M STAYING WITH BRADLEY.

1570
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,600
- YES!

1571
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,970
- OH, TO HEAVEN
WITH BOTH OF YOU.

1572
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,840
THERE ARE PLENTY OF TAKERS
ACROSS THE CENTURIES TO

1573
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,240
CARRY OUT MY MASTER PLAN

1574
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,240
TO MAKE ALL THE HAPPY ENDINGS IN
HISTORY

1575
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,540
EVIL ONES.

1576
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,270
LIKE ALL THOSE
LASSIE MOVIES.

1577
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,740
SO BE IT.

1578
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,600
THERE SHE IS.

1579
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,440
PRINCESS LUCILLA OF LENINSHIRE,
JUST AS I FOUND HER IN THE

1580
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:26,700
TENTH CENTURY, AFTER HER FATHER
SOLD HER TO THE VIKINGS.

1581
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,740
NINE CENTURIES OF VICIOUS,
VILE TRAINING DOWN

1582
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:35,070
THE TUBES OF TIME.

1583
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:38,040
- LUCILLA.

1584
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,570
WHY DID YOUR
FATHER SELL YOU?

1585
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,400
- BECAUSE I WASN'T AS BEAUTIFUL
AS MY SISTER, PRINCESS KASAVA,

1586
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,500
SO I SOLD MY SOUL
TO DR. D.

1587
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,300
TO ESCAPE AND BECOME
BEAUTIFUL ... LIKE YOU.

1588
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,370
- YOU'RE A PRINCESS.

1589
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:01,940
- A PRINCESS WITHOUT A
CASTLE, WITHOUT A JOB.

1590
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:04,600
WELL, I'LL BE GOING.

1591
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,640
- WHOSE SIDE ARE
YOU ON THIS TIME?

1592
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,240
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

1593
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:12,540
AS LONG AS MANKIND
IS MISERABLE.

1594
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,740
CIAO.

1595
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,840
- SO YOU'VE BEEN--

1596
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,900
- RETURNED TO EARTH TO LIVE OUT
THE REST OF MY MORTAL LIFE.

1597
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,040
LIKE YOU.

1598
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,300
- LIKE ME.

1599
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:37,900
WHO WOULD EVER BELIEVE THIS?

1600
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:40,000
- YOU WOULD, BRADLEY.

1601
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,600
OH, MY GOODNESS BRADLEY, WHAT
ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM?

1602
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,870
IT'S DUE TODAY.

1603
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:55,270
- IT CAME TO ME LAST NIGHT
WHEN I MET THE REAL YOU.

1604
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:56,400
- WHAT IS IT?

1605
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,500
- "THE PRINCESS PROGRAM"--

1606
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,870
HOW TO LIVE ROYALLY ON A
REGULAR WEEK'S PAY.

1607
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1608
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,470
- WHAT DO I THINK?

1609
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,000
BRADLEY?
- HM?

1610
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,870
- ARE YOU
DISAPPOINTED?

1611
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:18,870
- DISAPPOINTED IN WHAT?

1612
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:21,540
- THAT YOU GAVE
UP THE NEW YOU,

1613
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,570
ENDED UP WITH THE OLD ME.

1614
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:26,400
WHO'S ALWAYS SECOND BEST.

1615
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,070
- YOU'RE SECOND BEST?
NEVER.

1616
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:34,270
NOT 900 YEARS AGO,
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.

1617
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:57,000
- FUNNY. HUNK DISAPPEARS, AND
BRADLEY BRINKMAN RETURNS.

1618
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,470
THEY BOTH WERE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE SAME WOMAN TOO.

1619
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:04,570
- AND IT LOOKS LIKE BRINKMAN
FINALLY GOT HIMSELF A GIRL.

1620
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,100
- WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

1621
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,670
HUNK MUST'VE
RUBBED OFF ON HIM.
