00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:10,684
*

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:20,688
*

3
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,335
Chaubier, France.

4
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,710
Raw cow.

5
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,108
Each washed rind by Cleo
seems to be a variation

6
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,712
on a theme held together
by the notes of regional citrus

7
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,715
present in the character
of all his work.

8
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,689
La Ventana curado, Spain.

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,849
Raw goat.

10
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,856
Created in the 16th century
by a community

11
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,689
of Benedictine monks.

12
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,755
The goats grazed
the base of the volcano

13
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,203
at La Ventana.

14
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,399
*

15
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,832
Le Guise, France.

16
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,937
Raw cow.

17
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,869
Washed daily in the
traditionally prepared bath

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,975
of salt water and pumice wine,
from grapes hand-picked

19
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,249
by the sons of the house
of Guise.

20
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:26,789
*

21
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,120
At the age of 23
a world of possibilities

22
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:32,888
had been narrowed to just two.

23
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,626
I could return to the typist
position at my father's gallery,

24
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:39,434
or I could follow Frederick
to the farmstead,

25
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,867
where I would spend
every day in the sun

26
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,242
learning to make wheels
of reblochon.

27
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,313
I came to my decision
rather quickly.

28
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,042
I took the position as a typist.

29
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:55,353
(liquid bubbling)

30
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,222
(squeaking)

31
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,623
Compound A.

32
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,164
Dilutions of three to one,
two to one, and one to one.

33
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:03,861
Compound A.

34
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,691
Pork and beans.

35
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,385
One to one, wafting.

36
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,957
One-to-one, wafting,
pork and beans.

37
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:08,895
Whoo.

38
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,529
That'll singe your nose hairs.

39
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,663
(bottles rattling)

40
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,068
One-to-one elimination
due to acrid smell

41
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,129
uncharacteristic
of target material.

42
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,438
Nose hairs.

43
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,669
Two-to-one, wafting.

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,574
(buzzing)

45
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,365
It reveals no acrid smell.

46
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,506
Uh, uh--

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,410
The two-to-one wafted.

48
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,111
Tasting.

49
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,111
(buzzing)

50
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,542
Tasting compound A,
two-to-one,

51
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,377
target material pork and beans.

52
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,953
Elimination due to overtly
pronounced bean characteristic.

53
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,851
Overly pronounced--

54
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,622
Overtly.

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,520
Be pronounced.

56
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,221
Overtly pronounced bean
character.

57
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,323
Wafting three to one.

58
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:33,954
(buzzing)

59
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,417
Three to one.

60
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,255
None.

61
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,419
Uh, three to one wafted.

62
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,687
Tasting.

63
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,555
Tasting compound A,
three to one dilution,

64
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,093
target material pork and beans.

65
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,658
Eh, the beans are less
intrusive.

66
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,756
Uh, unobtrusive beans.

67
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:44,897
I have pork character.

68
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:45,972
You have poor character.

69
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,129
Pork character.

70
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,137
Pork character.

71
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,768
Compound A.3-1 cleared.

72
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:50,843
To the next sampling groove.

73
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,671
A.3-1 cleared.

74
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,266
(buzzing)

75
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,037
Orange juice.

76
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,514
Orange juice.

77
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,113
My orange juice.

78
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,514
Oh.

79
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,306
Yes, sir.

80
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,226
(bottles clinking)

81
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,863

84
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,067
Mm.

*

86
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,211
The woman who worked
to my immediate left

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
seemed to derive
a great deal of pride

88
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,575
and satisfaction
from her typist position.

89
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,251
The same could
not be said of myself.

90
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:40,023
*

91
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,363

*

94
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,403
I began to lament
my day-to-day struggle

95
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,832
as if I were reading it
in poor fiction,

96
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,637
a pitiable character
put upon by circumstance.

97
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,971
(engine puttering)

98
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:10,117
*

99
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,590
Is, uh, this
small business loans?

100
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,560
That's Debbie now,
starting today.

101
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,358
Thanks.

102
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,029

103
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:21,961
You're leaving?

104
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,625
Oh, yeah.

105
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,603
I got placed back--

106
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,931
Can I have your chair?

107
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:25,465
Um--

108
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,169
It has armrests.

109
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,869
Can I have your chair?

110
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,240
Hey, that's mine!

111
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,868
Um, I'm not leaving just yet.

112
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:30,703
Ooh, that's perfect.

113
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:31,168
Uh, no!

114
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:31,944
Hey!

115
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,642
I brought that from home!

116
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,244
Hey!

117
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:35,775
Hey!

118
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:43,619
*

119
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,691
Is this small business loans?

120
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,390
(sighing)

121
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,262
That's Debbie now,
starting today.

136
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,989
(laughing)

137
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,318
Mrs. Aldrich lived two miles
from my father's summer home

138
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,994
in Normandy.

139
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,233
She made fresh
neufchÃ¢tel with milk

140
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,028
from her two does
and served it with parsley

141
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,261
and new onions.

142
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,968
It was from those afternoons
that I did fall so deeply

143
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,372
in love.

144
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,673
(groaning)

145
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,605
You ready?

146
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,709
Yes.

147
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,710
(laughing)

148
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,282
Go on.

149
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,839
Go.

150
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,376
Okay.

151
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,880
Okay.

152
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,117
Oh, my--

153
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,091
This is like the one I had
in my summer abroad.

154
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,291
Gosh.

155
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,692
I wish we had walnuts.

156
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,494
We had camembert and wal--

157
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,566
I know.

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
(sighing)

159
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,095
I looked for this everywhere
when I got back!

160
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,207
You can't get it here.

161
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,469
It's unpasteurized.

162
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,237
It's from raw milk.

163
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,205
Hm.

164
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,113
It's illegal here.

165
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,205
Illegal?

166
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,576
Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,124
Where did you get it?

168
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,150
Um, I know people.

169
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:17,227
*

170
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:27,240
*

171
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,094
(siren wailing)

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,720
(dog barking)

173
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,855
(cart crashing)

174
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,832
(engine clicking)

175
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,143
Look.

176
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:16,124
*

177
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,156
Look at this.

178
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,960
(goat bleating)

179
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,031
Look at this.

180
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,329
Be careful.

181
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,230
It's a goat.

182
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,201
It could be dangerous.

183
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,429
(groaning)

184
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,833
(goat bleating)

185
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,596
(laughing)

186
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,135
Hello, my name is Artois.

187
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,410
If I am alone, I am lost.

188
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,509
Please make return
of me to address.

189
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,080
Farm Road 60.

190
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,012
(goat bleating)

191
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,147
Do you think they'll come back?

192
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:41,951
I don't know.

193
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:42,622
Maybe we should take him--

194
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,320
Where'd be go?

195
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,290
(goat bleating)

196
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,991
Hey, baby, I found it.

197
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,396
I had to process this thing
today, this application.

198
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,630
A married couple about our age.

199
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,668
You got a bottle opener?

200
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,442
Packed.

201
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,799
Already packed.

202
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:04,597
(sighing)

203
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,868
I think I have one in my pants.

204
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,576
Um, you know where my pants are?

205
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,138
Oh, thanks.

206
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,408
They want...

207
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,346
over by that pet store
at Bit Street.

208
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,693
They want to open
a cupcake shop.

209
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,649
Uh, a bakery?

210
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,087
No, a cupcake shop.

211
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,992
That sells cupcakes?

212
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,123
Yeah.

213
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,187
She wants to get out of teaching
and open a shop

214
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,326
selling cupcakes.

215
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,300
That's stupid.

216
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,558
Oh, here it comes.

217
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,896
Don't get any on the mattress.

218
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,002
I didn't.

219
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,573
Okay.

220
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,101
Um...

221
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,967
glasses.

222
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,937
I think--

223
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:42,775
Packed.

224
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,840
Yeah.

225
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,807
(clinking)

226
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,381
(paper rustling)

227
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,388
I--I mean, I can make
a pretty mean cupcake.

228
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,990
It doesn't mean that I'm--it
doesn't mean

229
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,692
I'm gonna quit my job.

230
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:57,864
It doesn't mean I think
I can make a go of it

231
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,261
as a professional.

232
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,162
What?

233
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,463
Some people
are so stupid.

234
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,596
Yeah?

235
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,043
Still though, I can see us
doing something like that.

236
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,439
Like what?

237
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,240
Like that.

238
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:17,512
You know, open a place.

239
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,354
You could make the cupcakes
or whatever.

240
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,751
I could do the books.

241
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,123
We could go to work together
every day, you know?

242
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:25,722
(laughing)

243
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,193
Yeah.

244
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:34,331
I--if you're gonna do it,
if--if you're gonna do it right,

245
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,431
you don't just serve cupcakes.

246
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,603
Hm.

247
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,501
I would serve coffee and tea.

248
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,235
Create a place
where people can read,

249
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,112
work, whatever.

250
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,341
(laughing)

251
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,007
Make sandwiches.

252
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,506
You could serve wine in the
evening!

253
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,117
I don't--

254
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:55,978
Yeah!

255
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,516
Hm.

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,820
If you're gonna do it,
you gotta do it right.

257
00:11:58,852 --> 00:11:59,522
I agree.

258
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,692
Yeah.

259
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,891
And as for the people,
the couple,

260
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,133
did they get the loan?

261
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,999
No.

262
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,798
It was the denied.

263
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,971
(sighing)

264
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,899
Yeah.

265
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,665
Some people are so stupid.

266
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,236
Yeah.

267
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:30,154
*

268
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,083
(growling)

269
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,218
(laughing)

270
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,193
(sniffing)

271
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,530
(groaning)

272
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:56,039
*

273
00:12:56,043 --> 00:13:01,713
*

274
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,118
(slurping)

275
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:15,830
*

276
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,003
They're watching me.

277
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,401
This I am now certain.

278
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,432
Who?

279
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,967
Your Food and Drug
Administration.

280
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,274
Your fascism and Drug
Administration.

281
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:26,966
(laughing)

282
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:27,667
Right.

283
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,037
Three days.

284
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,806
Three days I have seen this man
in the same spot.

285
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:46,225
*

286
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,829
I am pretty sure he's homeless.

287
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,802
(trash rattling)

288
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,374
Well of course, he looks
like he's homeless.

289
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,535
What's with your face?

290
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,406
What's with your face?

291
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,854
Uh, your--your glasses.

292
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,319
Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,179
Artisanal Market.

294
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:21,258
*

295
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:33,641
*

296
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,613
(siren wailing)

297
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,875
(cart slamming)

298
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,446
This is very special.

299
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,516
One of the last in the world.

300
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:32,095
*

301
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,633
Whoa.

302
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,037
So, you like?

303
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:49,022
*

304
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,049
What is this?

305
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:57,393
*

306
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:01,364
Notes on the Production
of a Superior Goat Cheese,

307
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,204
by Eva Verrane.

308
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,030
Translated into 12 languages
since 1945.

309
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,337
Eva Verrane.

310
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,308
The chÃ¨vre divin, French.

311
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,441
Raw goat.

312
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,175
From legendary cheese maker
Eva Verrane.

313
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,712
She's dead now.

314
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,718
This is from the very last
season.

315
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,193
I'll wrap some up for you.

316
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:36,930
*

317
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,273
"All that I am is born from my
work.

318
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,900
Nothing is equal,
nor is anything more essential

319
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:50,306
than the joy that is knowing
this is mine, I created it,

320
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,113
and it is good."

321
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:58,517
But is it internally flawless
or externally flawless?

322
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,321
That's what they don't tell you,
and if it is internally

323
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,794
flawless, how do you know?

324
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,363
Did you get a second opinion?

325
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,062
After Chesterfield proposed
to me,

326
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,434
I had this ring rated

327
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,731
by three different jeweler's
by week's end.

328
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,803
Isn't that right?

329
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:12,871
Right, right.

330
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:13,569
Three.

331
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Wonderful.

332
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,844
(laughing)

333
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,668
And of course, Angie
will be my maid of honor.

334
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:33,751
So, do you two still plan
on making a go of this?

335
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,118
(laughing)

336
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:37,757
Yes.

337
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,890
Of course.

338
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,355
-How?
-Mom.

339
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,963
We'll talk on the phone,
and I'll go up there and--

340
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,655
sometimes, and she'll come
down here sometimes.

341
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,927
Mm-hmm.

342
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,995
And how long do you think
you can keep that up?

343
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,543
Virgil brought something!

344
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,405
Just for us.

345
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,043
Yes.

346
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,736
Yes, yes.

347
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,347
He brought something.

348
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,549
It is an aged goat.

349
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,181
There's actually a very
interesting story

350
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,646
behind this cheese.

351
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,554
In France--

352
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,485
Uh, no thank you.

353
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,892
I'm not eating dairy.

354
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,730
We're not eating dairy.

355
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,401
Right, right.

356
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:27,914
So, Angie, in Detroit
during your internship,

357
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,910
were there a lot of men there?

358
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,514
Boys your own age, I mean.

359
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,264
(coughing)

360
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,791
Oh, uh, so, I don't know
if you remember a little thing

361
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:52,826
we worked on about,
um, three months ago,

362
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,535
flavor 242-240.

363
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,009
Not specifically.

364
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,538
Target material was raspberry
sorbet.

365
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,975
I--no.

366
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Wrap your eyes
around this, my friend.

367
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,246
Seven-hundred
and thirty-two dollars.

368
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,194
And nine cents.

369
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,460
Your contractual percentage
of the sale of 242-240.

370
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,660
Uh, raspberry sorbet.

371
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,091
Confederated out of Michigan
bought it up.

372
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:20,586
Thank you.

373
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,457
(laughing)

374
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,334
You're welcome.

375
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,162
Don't spend it all in one place.

376
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:27,367
Oh, uh, in a related matter,
I'm sure you'll be delighted

377
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,710
to hear that you'll be going
to Detroit after all.

378
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,378
What?

379
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,750
Detroit, the transfer
you put in for?

380
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,981
Really?

381
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,515
Really.

382
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,321
(laughing)

383
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,092
Oh, God.

384
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,919
Oh, thank God!

385
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,988
Sorry, sorry.

386
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,185
It just said it would be another
year--another year

387
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,128
before anyone left the gourmet
sensations line.

388
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:58,904
The what now?

389
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,501
The gourmet sensations.

390
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,373
Um, this offer didn't come

391
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,212
from the gourmet sensations
line.

392
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,539
But I--I didn't--I don't think
I applied anywhere else, did I?

393
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,236
It looks like we're
headed up there

394
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,878
to open up...

395
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,783
the sorbets line.

396
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,675
Sorbets?

397
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,216
No, no.

398
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,221
Sorbitz.

399
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,392
(making Z sound)

400
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,650
It's got a Z in it.

401
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,058
Confederated pharmaceuticals
brings you, Sorbitz.

402
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,291
Registered trademark.

403
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,356
The only cough drop
that combines the soothing

404
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:33,096
action of synthetic eucalyptus
with the fresh taste

405
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,602
of raspberry sorbet.

406
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,965
Flavor 242-240, your work.

407
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,135
It's mine?

408
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,442
It's yours.

409
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,384
You created it.

410
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,110
*

411
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,745
Is it good?

412
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,620
I don't know.

413
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,849
*

414
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,054
Thank you.

415
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,345
Thanks.

416
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:03,558
*

417
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,526
(gagging)

418
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,466
(spitting)

419
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,475
(groaning)

420
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,511
(spitting)

421
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,378
It's bad.

422
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,647
(crashing)

423
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:26,445
I thought of you, I did!

424
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,546
I can't!

425
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,517
So, do--don't think that I
just--

426
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:29,785
I don't understand!

427
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:30,992
He handed me the pen,
and he asked me to choose.

428
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:31,993
He asked me "yes or no?"

429
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:32,694
And I thought of you.

430
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,455
I--I did.

431
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,463
You tried, right?

432
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,464
You--you told him--

433
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,455
Of course!

434
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,356
Of course!

435
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,297
My mother's asleep downstairs.

436
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:38,831
She is asleep.

437
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,265
Of course.

438
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,099
Of course I--every week,
every other day I'm in there,

439
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,304
I'm asking again.

440
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,636
Fitznicholas tells me
nothing's changed!

441
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,841
You said anything!

442
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,012
If anything opened up,
anything--

443
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,940
But this--

444
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:49,805
But this?

445
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,982
Not this, then what?

446
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:55,111
If we beg, Virgil, if we beg,
then we do not choose.

447
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,977
This was the one, the only one!

448
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,846
Why not this?

449
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,865
(clearing throat)

450
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,265
There was this cheese--

451
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:20,966
Pardon?

452
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,507
There was this cheese.

453
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,782
Yens gave it to me,
and I tasted it.

454
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,051
It was goat.

455
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,918
It was really good,
and then this book--

456
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,119
-I read this book.
-A book.

457
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,850
Uh, this lady in France
with goats, she's dead.

458
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,157
It doesn't matter.

459
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,988
Uh, but I tasted it,
and it was so good

460
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,557
that it made, uh...

461
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:49,366
it reminded me of something
that I had forgotten,

462
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,072
and then the lady, that--
-Dead lady?

463
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:56,413
Yeah, France, she said,
"You are what you create."

464
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,843
You see?

465
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,580
(laughing)

466
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,746
Like it was a trap.

467
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,245
Like they had planned
it this way.

468
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,116
Fitznicholas, he has me taste
them, and they're awful.

469
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,186
They're bad.

470
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,193
"You created them!"

471
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:20,666
And so, you know,
and--you know, I--and I--

472
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,300
(laughing)

473
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,936
And so you turned it down?

474
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,273
And--and I--no!

475
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,007
Okay, no, no.

476
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,712
There's this beautiful
and magnificent cheese,

477
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,145
and then there are these cough
drops that taste like poison,

478
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,693
and--and I had to choose.

479
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:46,862
And so you turned it down,
and I am still going

480
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,733
to Detroit alone.

481
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,133
No.

482
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,473
Yes.

483
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,675
Virgil--

484
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,652
(sighing)

485
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,382
Never mind.

486
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,188
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,590
Virgil?

488
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,992
I've done a really stupid thing.

489
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,834
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,702
(sighing)

491
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,179
What's that?

492
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,012
This.

493
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,177
Seven-hundred and thirty-two?

494
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,884
I will use this money
to buy you a ring.

495
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,946
An engagement ring?

496
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,194
I know it's not a lot, and a
job.

497
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,718
I'll--forget Fitznicholas
and cough drops.

498
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,555
I'll start looking for new jobs
in Detroit.

499
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,060
I'll find one.

500
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,760
I will.

501
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,791
What's a Sorbitz?

502
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,885
I love you.

503
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:59,197
I'm sorry, and I will
make my way back to you.

504
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,731
When?

505
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,166
Soon.

506
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,135
(wind blowing)

507
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,311
(beeping)

508
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,405
Hey, babe.

509
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,377
I hope you're outside.

510
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:20,946
It's finally getting warmer
here.

511
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,957
It's a gorgeous day.

512
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,159
Oh! Did you hear anything
from Wienerbaum?

513
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,461
I had a good feeling about this.

514
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:31,934
Well, anyway, I love you.

515
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,674
I miss you.

516
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,270
Bye.

517
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,243
(beeping)

518
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,337
(beeping)

519
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,405
Hey, babe.

520
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,414
I hope you're outside.

521
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,946
It's finally getting warmer
here.

522
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,323
It's a gorgeous day.

523
00:25:53,352 --> 00:26:03,402
*

524
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:09,495
*

525
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,695
(gasping)

526
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:16,637
*

527
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,746
(paper crumpling)

528
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:28,818

529

532
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:15,802
*

533
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:36,055
"I pondered the question
for some time before applying.

534
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,818
I knew that my answer
would not satisfy

535
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:41,757
the sensibilities of this
particular periodical,

536
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,534
so I responded simply and
honestly.

537
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,073
The greatest cheese I ever
tasted

538
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:51,169
was the first cheese I made
myself.

539
00:27:52,671 --> 00:28:02,721
*

540
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:12,725
*

541
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,918
I took great care in the
selection

542
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,823
of my starter culture.

543
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,655
These bacteria
will not only sour your milk

544
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,831
but will go far in determining
how your product ages.

545
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:57,871
*

546
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:01,544
I paid a local butcher
to slaughter a succulent kid.

547
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,513
Once dried, we are able
to extract from its stomach

548
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,483
what is needed.

549
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,818
Hopefully the technologies
of our modern age will promise

550
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:15,891
a less distasteful alternative
to this rather brutish process.

551
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:25,972
*

552
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:32,765
*

553
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,935
The digestive enzyme rennin
coagulated the liquid milk

554
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,235
proteins into solids.

555
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,447
I achieved a clean break
after about four hours.

556
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,250
The milk had separated
into solid curd and liquid whey.

557
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:55,334
*

558
00:29:55,327 --> 00:30:05,337
*

559
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:26,161
I prefer to hand ladle
so as to maintain the integrity

560
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,692
of the individual curds.

561
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:37,766
*

562
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:47,509
*

563
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,716
I allowed the press
to act upon the curds

564
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,448
for a full 12 hours
so as to extract

565
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,924
as much of the remaining whey
as possible.

566
00:30:54,954 --> 00:31:05,004
*

567
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:11,197
*

568
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:15,737
It is of the utmost importance
that the press is left

569
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:19,954
undisturbed during this period."

570
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,349
(crashing)

571
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:22,881
No!

572
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:23,575
No, no, no!

573
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,475
Oh, no.

574
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,386
No.

575
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,333
(crashing)

576
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,831
(wind blowing)

577
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:52,908
*

578
00:31:52,911 --> 00:32:02,921
*

579
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,385
(yelling)

580
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,976
(rubber stretching)

581
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:14,756
*

582
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:24,770
*

583
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,566
It is...

584
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,713
good.

585
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,568
Hm.

586
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:05,308
(sighing)

587
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:08,284
(laughing)

588
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,647
You did this with milk
from the grocery store?

589
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,785
Uh-huh.

590
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,061
Hm.

591
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,090
What?

592
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,186
Teats.

593
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,427
Teats ?

594
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,601
Teats .

595
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:24,429
What?

596
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,273
Teats.

597
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:29,298
All great cheese
comes from raw milk,

598
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,535
not this pasteurized bullshit.

599
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,270
Raw?

600
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,944
Straight from the teat.

601
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:35,813
Teat.

602
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,811
Teat.

603
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,713
The problem with teats
is that they are usually

604
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,805
attached to cows.

605
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,149
I would not know where
a fellow like you could find

606
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:49,515
a teat.

607
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:52,485
(car engine revving)

608
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,061
(goats bleating)

609
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,630
Howdy.

610
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,703
Twenty dollars American,
and he's yours.

611
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:37,202
Hey there, guy.

612
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,236
Better watch out now.

613
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,440
He'll piss on you.

614
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,941
Oh.

615
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,072
Ah.

616
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:44,909
Uh, thanks.

617
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,753
Yeah.

618
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,048
That's my piss rag.

619
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,850
Twenty dollars American.

620
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,152
No, no thanks.

621
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,554
I don't think I have much use
for a bull goat.

622
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:54,145
Buck goat.

623
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:54,916
For a buck goat.

624
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,123
Not at the present moment.

625
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,564
Uh, that's fine.

626
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,759
I call him Artois
after my pawpaw

627
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:06,233
and like pawpaw he's gonna
make a great stew.

628
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,569
(goat bleating)

629
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:24,623
*

630
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:31,856
*

631
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,290
(goat bleating)

632
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,002
Virgil, you still there?

633
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,470
Wh--what? Yeah.

634
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,899
-Yeah, yeah.
-Your birthday?

635
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,774
I thought I'd come and visit
you for your birthday.

636
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,073
Oh, that'd be good.

637
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,474
(goat bleats)

638
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:48,536
What was that?

639
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,284
What? Uh--

640
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,409
(goat bleat)

641
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,213
Who is that?

642
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,484
Are you alone?

643
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,482
Yes, of course.

644
00:36:55,514 --> 00:37:00,954
Uh, that was, uh,
the radio--the TV.

645
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,216
Okay. Something wrong?

646
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,355
No, no, baby, I'm just
real busy right now.

647
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,961
Um, got to get some more
applications done.

648
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,432
Workin' hard. Goodnight.

649
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,260
(sighing)

650
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,926
The unique character
of my cheese would result

651
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,234
from a confluence
of many elements.

652
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,037
Perhaps none more important
than the selection

653
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,669
of the location
of my farmstead.

654
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:28,306
*

655
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:32,647
The land, the terroir,
it would be the constitution

656
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,724
of this grazing foliage
that would determine

657
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,424
the character
of the milk produced,

658
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,227
and consequently,
the ultimate flavor

659
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,059
and complexity of my cheese.

660
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,065
*

661
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,738
The land should be glorious
and fertile.

662
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:56,379
Grasses and cloves,
alfalfa, wild flowers,

663
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,108
and water.

664
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:02,553
The character of the land
is the character of the cheese.

665
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,751
*

666
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:11,694
Unexpected new cheeses
come from unexpected new places,

667
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:17,363
places that the world
has not yet tasted.

668
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:21,766
*

669
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:50,557
*

670
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:54,026
Hello?

671
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,665
(glass breaking)

672
00:38:55,701 --> 00:39:09,721
*

673
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,348
(clinking)

674
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:21,433
*

675
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:27,327
*

676
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,535
(clinking)

677
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:38,078
*

678
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:42,405
And I suppose that your company
has a great deal of experience

679
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,518
in setting up these types
of operations?

680
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,920
-My what?
-Your company?

681
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,521
I--you mean my job?

682
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,831
Thank you for coming.

683
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,159
But--no, please.

684
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,504
I don't think you quite
understand

685
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,699
what it is I'm trying
to do here.

686
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,011
All right.

687
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,879
What is it you're
trying to do here?

688
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,310
Well, I...

689
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,405
Thank you for coming.

690
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,447
May the confused steps
that brought you across

691
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,383
my property
carry you doubly quick

692
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,487
in the opposite direction--

693
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,519
-Wait!
-Yes?

694
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:33,157
I'm supposed to go
to work tomorrow.

695
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,698
Yes.

696
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,495
I can't go back now.

697
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,251
Do you know how it is
that you came to find me here?

698
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,117
Well, I...

699
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,731
Basset hounds.

700
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,330
Basset hounds?

701
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:05,361
Basset hounds!

702
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:10,735
Basset hounds?

703
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,139
Basset hounds!

704
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,200
When I was a young lad,

705
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,438
not far removed in age
from yourself,

706
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,713
I had the firm
and resolute intention

707
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:20,953
to become a champion breeder
of these most beautiful

708
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,949
and noble creatures
which scuttled majestically

709
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,252
across the earth.

710
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,653
Basset hounds.

711
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,685
Basset hounds.

712
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,160
Oh, I read the books.

713
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,629
I learned the trade,
and I decided that just as soon

714
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,030
as my time as a claims adjuster
had afforded me sufficient

715
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:41,803
financial security
that I would go to my brother,

716
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,543
resign my position,
and purchase attractive land,

717
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:49,041
not entirely dissimilar
to this one.

718
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:54,354
Took me 31 years to achieve
what I have set out to do.

719
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:57,019
Just a hair longer than outlined
in my five-year plan.

720
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:57,818
Perhaps it would be
best if I just--

721
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,619
And then!

722
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:03,351
And then I did
a very silly thing.

723
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:07,658
Walked out on my brother,
I walked out on my career,

724
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:12,603
on my life, and I spent
everything I had

725
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:18,041
on this muddy little corner
of nowhere.

726
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,909
It was at this point
that I made a rather

727
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:22,038
disheartening discovery.

728
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:25,183
*

729
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,350
I don't give a damn about
basset hounds anymore.

730
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,320
There is something
about pushing a rock

731
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:36,189
up a hill for 30 years
that will take all the romance

732
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:44,131
out of what is essentially
just a floppy-eared dog,

733
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:49,072
and take all the romance
out of everything.

734
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,070
All I can see
when I close my eyes

735
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,014
are rising liability rates

736
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,170
in the new year!

737
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,637
Uh-huh.

738
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,176
*

739
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,211
You have a girl?

740
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:06,077
*

741
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,317
Pardon?

742
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:10,922
You have a girl?

743
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:13,356
Yes.

744
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,491
Marry her.

745
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:20,167
Get yourself a dog
and some neighbors,

746
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,498
because one thing that
you don't want to be

747
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,003
is a 55-year old man with--

748
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:30,306
with what amounts to little more
than a 200-acre cemetery plot

749
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:33,951
and no reason to get out
of bed in the morning,

750
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:37,479
save habit...

751
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:42,145
and a desire
to figure out where the hell

752
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:45,887
you're gonna spend
the rest of eternity.

753
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:49,134
*

754
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,630
I haven't slept above ground
in so long I can't remember.

755
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:54,425
(yells)

756
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,695
Oh!

757
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:58,244
I've dug 100 holes all around!

758
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,709
And it is my firm
and resolute intention

759
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,739
to put at least one
of 'em to good use!

760
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:03,714
Okay.

761
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:04,882
And what I don't
intend to do

762
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,580
is to allow some mumbling,
bumbling child--

763
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,582
to go trembling,
scattershot

764
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:13,584
all over my final
resting place!

765
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:16,348
And certainly not
with any goats!

766
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:44,379
*

767
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:54,392
*

768
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,307
No!

769
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:12,311
(panting)

770
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:24,985
Angie?

771
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,663
Virgil.

772
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:27,661
Ms. Dickenson?

773
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:29,332
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.

774
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,000
I was trying to reach Angie
up there.

775
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,030
Just a moment.

776
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,165
It's him.

777
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,902
Virgil?

778
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,807
Angie.

779
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,369
I got your message.

780
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,178
Is your mother--

781
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,750
She's staying
with me for a bit.

782
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:51,719
She just showed up?

783
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,789
I called her.

784
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:56,019
I asked her to come.

785
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:59,364
I've just been
a little lonely lately.

786
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,597
Me too.

787
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:11,101
You know,
I can't wait to see you.

788
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:15,408
I still have the money,
the money for the ring.

789
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:24,718
About that, Virgil,

790
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:29,919
my mother doesn't think
that's such a good idea.

791
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:33,825
That what's a good idea?

792
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:35,189
Your birthday.

793
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:38,696
She thinks...

794
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:44,639
I really should
be focusing on my job.

795
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:48,109
You're not coming.

796
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,079
We'll talk later, okay?

797
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:53,509
Bye.

798
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:39,261
(car swerving)

799
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:42,062
Listen!

800
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:45,503
(slam)

801
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,470
Listen.

802
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:52,198
Listen closely to what's
about to be said.

803
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:55,367
It is my firm
and resolute intention

804
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,606
to found and operate
my own farmstead

805
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:04,182
from which I will produce a
superior artisanal goat cheese.

806
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,815
Is that all?

807
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,921
I may not have capital,

808
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:11,394
I don't have experience,

809
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:12,962
nor do I have
any intention

810
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:16,461
of asking
for favors, pity,

811
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:20,304
sympathy from you
or anyone else.

812
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:23,471
What I do have, however,

813
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,141
is a sound
business proposal.

814
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,879
(sighing)

815
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,381
I'm listening.

816
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:42,045
-One wheel.
-One wheel.

817
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,217
One wheel, two goats.

818
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,594
-Two goats.
-Two goats.

819
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,692
You permit the grazing
of just two goats

820
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,164
on the northeastern end
of your land,

821
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,163
out of sight
and out of mind.

822
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:51,234
-How long?
-Not long.

823
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,802
The few months requisite
to produce

824
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,130
a single wheel of cheese.

825
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:56,695
-Single wheel?
-A single wheel.

826
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,679
Why would I be in any way
inclined to accept?

827
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:13,986
Because in six months

828
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:15,619
the International
Cheese Consortium

829
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:18,263
will hold their bi-annual
conference in this city,

830
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,459
and I will retrieve for you
a contract for the production

831
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:22,491
of goat cheese
on this very property!

832
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:25,597
For how much?

833
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:30,800
$50,000.

834
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,535
-How?
-I will.

835
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,340
-How?
-I will.

836
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:36,672
I just need
the go-ahead from you.

837
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:44,045
Where are the goats?

838
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:47,622
$731, $732.

839
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,692
(goat bleat)

840
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,330
(panting)

841
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,028
Let's talk goats.

842
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:38,267
(goats bleating)

843
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,944
Guten Morgen.

844
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,075
Good morning.

845
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:47,251
Coffee?

846
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:49,548
Oh, thank you.

847
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,580
So, this is it?

848
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:53,246
(goat bleat)

849
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,294
Yes, this is it.

850
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,591
(goat bleat)

851
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:01,632
What does your Angie
think of all of this?

852
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,789
Angie has stopped calling.

853
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:05,758
(phone ringing)

854
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,614
(goat bleat)

855
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,970
Hello?

856
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,377
Hey, Virgil!

857
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,309
Virgil, uh--

858
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:20,814
(paper crinkling)

859
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:21,805
Gurdies!

860
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,576
Yes, hi.

861
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,454
Uh, this is Ronaldo Reid
calling from

862
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,653
the Wienerbaum Food Labs
in Detroit.

863
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:31,485
I've got your application here
and I was wondering--

864
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:35,532
we've had something open up
and thought maybe we could

865
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,700
get you in here for an interview
sometime next week.

866
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,300
How does Thursday sound?

867
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,903
(clunking)

868
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,313
How about Friday?

869
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,975
(dial tone)

870
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,690
*

871
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:12,455
After I was relieved of my
position with Artisanal Market

872
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:15,227
I bummed around Asia
for a while.

873
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:17,766
Through a series
of what could, in retrospect,

874
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:21,512
be viewed as poor decisions
on my part, I found myself

875
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,939
in the indentured servitude
of a Nepalese man named

876
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,644
Wop Sang.

877
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:29,246
Cruel task master, yeah,
but prior to my being liberated

878
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,380
by the friars of a nearby
Tibetan monastery,

879
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,947
he was able to impart to me
the ancient techniques

880
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,085
of effective vaccimulgence.

881
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:47,161
*

882
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:57,174
*

883
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,686
The yaks I milked
were much larger of course,

884
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:13,491
but the principal
is the same.

885
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:16,964
*

886
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,764
The grains will keep
the beast pacified

887
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:20,926
while I clean
and massage the teat.

888
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:25,335
*

889
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,440
Are these cheerios?

890
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:29,713
Yeah.

891
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,810
They were all I could procure
on short notice.

892
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:42,893
*

893
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:52,897
*

894
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:06,278
(liquid squirting)

895
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:13,821
*

896
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:26,103
*

897
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:36,106
*

898
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:03,627
Einz.

899
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:06,568
*

900
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:07,574
Zwei.

901
00:55:07,605 --> 00:55:10,375
*

902
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:11,508
Drei.

903
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:14,852
*

904
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:15,849
Vier.

905
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,080
*

906
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,075
FÃ¼nf.

907
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:22,016
*

908
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,492
Sechs.

909
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,821
*

910
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:30,657
Seiben.

911
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:32,195
Acht!

912
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:42,209
*

913
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,079
Nuen.

914
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:55,346
*

915
00:55:57,221 --> 00:56:07,261
*

916
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:17,274
*

917
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:30,776
It is complete.

918
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:36,785
*

919
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,991
You and me will change
the bandage on alternate days

920
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:42,734
for the first couple of weeks
till the cheese has formed

921
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,860
its own rind.

922
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,866
If that's okay with you?

923
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:51,698
*

924
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:53,896
Come in when you need to.

925
00:57:53,938 --> 00:58:03,978
*

926
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:13,991
*

927
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:53,704
Be warned.

928
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,171
We see all.

929
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,770
(screams)

930
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,440
(coins clinking)

931
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,335
(knocking)

932
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,366
Hey.

933
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,270
*

934
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,942
Hey.

935
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:40,342
*

936
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,347
(beep)

937
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:42,678
Virgil, pick up the phone!

938
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,253
I was locking up
the shop tonight

939
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,521
and the man with
colorful hair was--

940
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,480
(beep)

941
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:51,894
(sighing)

942
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:13,783
What?

943
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:16,081
Hm?

944
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:18,883
You came all the way here.

945
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:23,386
You wanted me here
for your birthday.

946
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,760
Yeah.

947
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,530
What--what--when?

948
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,729
It's your birthday.

949
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:35,272
Today's your birthday.

950
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,169
I guess I must have--

951
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:40,502
(laughing)

952
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,080
I thought you said--

953
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:46,309
Hm?

954
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:50,553
What about what your mom--

955
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,220
(sighing)

956
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:56,189
Things were so
busy back then,

957
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,360
and I was lonely.

958
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:04,527
My mother...

959
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:07,931
I told her.

960
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:11,435
I told her that I love you

961
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:14,238
and she couldn't do
anything about it.

962
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,407
I tried to call you.

963
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:19,842
I tried all week.

964
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,477
Oh.

965
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,811
My phone's been giving me
some problems.

966
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:31,258
And I think I need
to get a new one.

967
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:33,788
What now?

968
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:34,764
Now?

969
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,692
Now.

970
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:40,967
Now we go and...

971
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:46,597
I thought you were going
to take me to find a ring.

972
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,706
Uh--

973
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,039
*

974
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,575
(laughing)

975
01:01:53,610 --> 01:02:02,550
*

976
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:05,786
What's wrong?

977
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,293
Nothing.

978
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,256
It's just such
a beautiful day outside.

979
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:15,066
It'd be a shame
to waste it.

980
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:18,569
Cramped up in a jewelry store
all day long.

981
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:21,812
You know, there's always
tomorrow.

982
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,109
Okay.

983
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,611
Yeah?

984
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,952
Okay.

985
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:30,048
Okay.

986
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:34,792
It is a really nice day.

987
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,449
Yeah.

988
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,586
And I know just
where I want to go.

989
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,093
Where?

990
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,260
I feel like I haven't
been here in forever.

991
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:49,927
Yeah, me too.

992
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,638
Great weather.

993
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,540
Yeah, me too.

994
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,035
What?

995
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:01,076
What?

996
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,951
Nothing.

997
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,750
Uh, great weather.

998
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,682
Great weather.

999
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:16,030
Is anything wrong?

1000
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,600
No.

1001
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,399
You seem...

1002
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:26,643
I don't know,
strung out.

1003
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,710
I know why you're frustrated.

1004
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:33,079
Working so hard to find a job
in Detroit and getting nowhere,

1005
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,440
filling out all those
applications

1006
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,178
and sending them off.

1007
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:36,312
So many.

1008
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,146
And I'm the one putting
the pressure on you.

1009
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:40,782
Really, don't beat yourself
up about it.

1010
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:46,557
Sometimes I forget how lucky
I am to have you.

1011
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,060
Babe?

1012
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:49,362
Yeah.

1013
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:51,233
About all that.

1014
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,401
Yeah?

1015
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:53,759
There's kind of sort of
somethin' I--

1016
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:54,527
(goat bleat)

1017
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,774
Jesus!

1018
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:58,399
Baby!

1019
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,835
-It's a goat!
-Yeah, it's a goat!

1020
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:01,811
No, no, no,
don't do that!

1021
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,808
No!

1022
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:03,669
Why not?

1023
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:04,737
It's an animal.

1024
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,944
It could be dangerous.

1025
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:08,647
I think--yeah!

1026
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,218
I think this is the one
we saw before.

1027
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:13,078
Really?

1028
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:14,617
No.

1029
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:17,021
I think that one
had more hair.

1030
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:17,964
Virgil?

1031
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:19,388
Yeah?

1032
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,262
This goat has
your name on it.

1033
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:27,134
"V. Gurdies."

1034
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:29,834
Well, that could be
any Gurdies.

1035
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,396
Not necessarily me.

1036
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:34,965
What?

1037
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,065
Wow.

1038
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:37,236
Same name as me.

1039
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:38,544
Mm-hmm.

1040
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:39,505
You know, we should
look him up in the phone book

1041
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,453
when we get home.

1042
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:43,548
Speaking of heading home,
I'm a little bit tired.

1043
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,080
I think we should get
heading home.

1044
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,275
You know, and that's where I
keep my phone book after all,

1045
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,347
and speaking of phones,
I need a new cell.

1046
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,956
You think Circuit Center's
still open?

1047
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:52,788
I bet if we hurry
we can make it.

1048
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:04,528
Angie?

1049
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:08,308
Angie?

1050
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:11,038
You awake?

1051
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:02,531
(yells)

1052
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:17,344
(phone ringing)

1053
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,757
Hello?

1054
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,188
Oh, hi.

1055
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:34,823
Sorry.

1056
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,928
Uh, I think I might--

1057
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,200
I'm looking for
a Virgil Gurdies.

1058
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,299
No, no.

1059
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,500
You have the right number.

1060
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:45,002
He's not here right now.

1061
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:51,178
(door creaks)

1062
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,393
Hey, babe.

1063
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,660
Come on cheese!

1064
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:07,920
I just went to go--

1065
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,027
I mean, you ruined
the surprise.

1066
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,660
Surprise!

1067
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:12,725
Um, yeah.

1068
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,332
I went to the place
down the street,

1069
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,034
the one you like.

1070
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:24,713
Your phone works.

1071
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,511
Oh, yeah?

1072
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,513
You got a call
from a Ronaldo.

1073
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,646
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, a Ronaldo.

1074
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,880
Wienerbaum Food?

1075
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,015
He says he's been
trying to reach you.

1076
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,619
Oh, huh.

1077
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:36,891
It may be some good news.

1078
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,160
It may be some good news
about a job maybe.

1079
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:40,719
Uh, maybe.

1080
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:45,127
I mean, I--I'll have
to check I guess.

1081
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:47,402
Shame they didn't
send you a letter.

1082
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:48,831
Yeah, seriously.

1083
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,995
Did you want one of these?

1084
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:52,944
Sausage?

1085
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,407
Maybe a letter
like this one.

1086
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,813
-What--what's that?
-It was open.

1087
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:02,314
It was on top of
the fridge so I--

1088
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:03,446
"Dear Mr. Gurdies,

1089
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,180
Thank you so much
for your application.

1090
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:06,845
We would love--"

1091
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:08,623
What is this?

1092
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:09,922
-Angie--
-Why are you lying?

1093
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:12,923
I--I--Angie, I can explain.

1094
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:49,432
That's it?

1095
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,399
Yeah.

1096
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,672
Why?

1097
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:07,542
I don't remember.

1098
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,776
All I...

1099
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:24,393
I have a lot of time
up there.

1100
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:27,698
I have a lot of time.

1101
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:31,371
You know, that apartment
is like a little gray box.

1102
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:35,071
I thought I could make it
into a home and I waited.

1103
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,944
I left you one side
of the closet empty.

1104
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,483
I know what it sounds like.

1105
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,038
I--I know
what it looks like.

1106
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:42,506
It wasn't the waiting, Virgil!

1107
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:45,176
I could handle the waiting
because I knew--

1108
01:09:45,215 --> 01:09:49,285
because I thought
that you were doing

1109
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,119
everything you could
to get back to me.

1110
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,164
I was!

1111
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,258
I am.

1112
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:59,161
But maybe I have to do this.

1113
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:11,212
How long until you're done?

1114
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,381
Tonight.

1115
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,880
With this, with all of this?

1116
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:37,803
Look, um, I'm gonna see
my mother before I leave.

1117
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,074
That's where I'll be if...

1118
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,676
That's where I'll be.

1119
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,979
Angie.

1120
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:50,651
Angie!

1121
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,150
Angie, wait!

1122
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,893
Stop, Angie!

1123
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:20,139
*

1124
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:34,423
*

1125
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,258
(cracks)

1126
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:46,342
*

1127
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:56,346
*

1128
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:29,609
*

1129
01:12:29,613 --> 01:12:39,623
*

1130
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:01,784
Ready?

1131
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:05,521
Ready.

1132
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:15,833
Don't worry.

1133
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:17,789
We'll be back real soon
to get the rest of your books

1134
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:19,657
and your cooking stuff.

1135
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:21,396
-Real soon.
-No need.

1136
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,871
No?

1137
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:27,269
No, I think I've got that out
of my system for a while.

1138
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:29,173
Let's go.

1139
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:40,578
(train horn)

1140
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:50,092
*

1141
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:51,256
Lots to manage, there.

1142
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:52,904
Yeah.

1143
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:57,269
*

1144
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,400
-I like it.
-Yes?

1145
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,074
Yeah, no, I do.

1146
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,942
Yes, yes, yes!

1147
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,270
-Do you need a hand?
-No, I got it.

1148
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:04,665
-Okay.
-I just--never mind.

1149
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,338
*

1150
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,075
And then we can billow through
your closet.

1151
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,311
I can't believe you're here!

1152
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:10,575
(laughing)

1153
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:11,524
So, where's the bedroom?

1154
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:12,418
It's that way.

1155
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:20,358
*

1156
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,828
(bass rumbling)

1157
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,800
(dog barking)

1158
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:41,112
The first day
is always the hardest.

1159
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,714
I'm sure you'll fit right in.

1160
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:45,146
I'm only a phone call away
if you need me.

1161
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,921
I think I'll be fine.

1162
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,850
I think I'll be more than fine.

1163
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:49,585
Yeah?

1164
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,519
Yeah.

1165
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:55,115
New job, new place, new town.

1166
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:58,528
I think it'll be different.

1167
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:03,034
Different is good.

1168
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:05,796
Anything different is good.

1169
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,165
Bachelors in chem...

1170
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:10,044
...and bio chem.

1171
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:13,143
Two years internship.

1172
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:16,246
Two years apprenticeship.

1173
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:18,979
Everything looks in order.

1174
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:24,524
I'd say we can get you
started right away.

1175
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:27,664
Mr. Fitznicholas?

1176
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:28,961
No.

1177
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:32,502
It's Nitzficholas.

1178
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,698
Mr. Nitzficholas, to you.

1179
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:43,874
Compound A,
dilutions of three to one,

1180
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:46,837
two to one,
and one to one.

1181
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,806
(sighing)

1182
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:51,779
Compound A.

1183
01:15:51,815 --> 01:15:54,315
Camembert and walnuts.

1184
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,050
One to one, wafting.

1185
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,056
(police sirens)

1186
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:12,138
*

1187
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:15,238
Do you--

1188
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:18,541
is that the brown rice
or the white?

1189
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,984
The white.

1190
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,209
Oh.

1191
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:26,345
*

1192
01:16:26,382 --> 01:16:27,422
You--

1193
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,790
The white.

1194
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:42,629
*

1195
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,366
What's this?

1196
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,070
Cheezewhirl.

1197
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,302
-Cheesewhirl?
-No, no.

1198
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,307
Cheezewhirl.

1199
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,369
("Z" sound)

1200
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:52,537
It's got a "Z" in it.

1201
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:53,935
Cheezewhirl.

1202
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:58,507
New camembert cheezewhirl.

1203
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,847
They picked up
the flavor profile

1204
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:03,523
for their new gourmet
international line.

1205
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,392
Yeah.

1206
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,250
I bet.

1207
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,218
Try it.

1208
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:08,885
No, thanks.

1209
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:10,885
(cheezewhirl spraying)

1210
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:20,967
*

1211
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:30,350
*

1212
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:33,479
I'll, uh, hit you up
with the details inside.

1213
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:36,446
This is only the beginning!

1214
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,785
Do you know
anything about cheese?

1215
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:41,193
No.

1216
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:43,894
This is what they got us
tryin' to tackle next.

1217
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:45,587
Goat cheese.

1218
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:46,828
I can't make heads or tails
out of it.

1219
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:48,733
Tastes a bit off to me.

1220
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:49,965
This is supposed
to be the good stuff, too,

1221
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,069
so they say.

1222
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:56,871
ChÃ¨vre d'Eva.

1223
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,836
Tastes a bit off to me,

1224
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:03,046
but I suppose
I can stomach a bit more.

1225
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:10,389
*

1226
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,889
Hey!

1227
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,121
Be careful with that,
that's expensive stuff.

1228
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,916
Get away.

1229
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:16,458
-Give--
-Get back!

1230
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:18,692
You can pry this out
of my cold, dead hands

1231
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:21,258
because I will not let
another ounce of this

1232
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:24,497
go down the gullet
of a goon like you!

1233
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,633
*

1234
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:27,538
Why you little--
I'm gonna kill you!

1235
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:28,540
(gasping)

1236
01:18:28,571 --> 01:18:38,611
*

1237
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:48,624
*

1238
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,180
(police siren)

1239
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:42,984
(thunk)

1240
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,623
(groaning)

1241
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,293
(angelic choir)

1242
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:58,085
*

1243
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,097
(speaking French)

1244
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:06,699
*

1245
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:10,965
I'm sorry,
I don't speak French.

1246
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,907
Is this better?

1247
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:16,813
Yes, thank you.

1248
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:19,446
A writer writes, Virgil.

1249
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:22,622
A painter must paint.

1250
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,521
What, then,
must a maker of cheeses do?

1251
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:29,255
*

1252
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:31,292
Come back.

1253
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:32,197
Come back!

1254
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:37,198
It is you who must come back.

1255
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:42,273
*

1256
01:20:59,155 --> 01:21:00,955
Virgil?

1257
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,933
Hey.

1258
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:07,832
I must go back.

1259
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,844
I must create something.

1260
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,139
Something
that is good,

1261
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:21,743
and without that,
I have no pride.

1262
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:26,047
Without pride
there can be no respect.

1263
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,453
Without respect--

1264
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,758
there can be no love.

1265
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,925
I'm going back.

1266
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:48,966
(sighing)

1267
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:57,007
-I can't go with you.
-I wouldn't ask you to.

1268
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:59,846
-I can't wait for you.
-I wouldn't ask you to.

1269
01:21:59,882 --> 01:22:04,552
Not without some end in sight,
and I can't know that.

1270
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,787
No.

1271
01:22:06,822 --> 01:22:08,992
No, you can't.

1272
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:14,297
But I will return.

1273
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,070
I'll prove to you
I'm someone worth loving.

1274
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,729
I will.

1275
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,167
I'll prove it to myself first.

1276
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:25,206
I'll become something I'm not.

1277
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:27,081
Not yet.

1278
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,940
What's that?

1279
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:31,848
You'll know it when you see it.

1280
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,889
I'll see you?

1281
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:09,492
*

1282
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:19,495
*

1283
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:41,776
(gun click)

1284
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:42,887
(goat bleat)

1285
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:44,418
No!

1286
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:45,123
No, please!

1287
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:46,294
Please!

1288
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:47,462
No!

1289
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:50,590
No, please.

1290
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,826
$20 American.

1291
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,970
Seven--

1292
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:01,772
I've got eight.

1293
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:07,339
No!

1294
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,736
(gun shot)

1295
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,645
(goat bleat)

1296
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:20,121
(gun shot)

1297
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:22,086
(creaking)

1298
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:40,444
I have a plan.

1299
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,980
The International Cheese
Consortium,

1300
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,387
do you still have your contacts
in the inside?

1301
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,620
Yeah.

1302
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:55,255
The conference,
how much time do we have left?

1303
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:57,261
Three weeks.

1304
01:24:58,494 --> 01:24:59,464
That's not much time.

1305
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:01,525
Not enough for a hard cheese.

1306
01:25:01,564 --> 01:25:03,234
The cheese press is--

1307
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:04,696
is out of order
at the present moment.

1308
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:06,603
Out of order--
what happened?

1309
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:08,265
That's not important, okay?

1310
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:09,914
Okay.

1311
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,438
Change of plans.

1312
01:25:11,474 --> 01:25:13,144
We'll get started right away.

1313
01:25:13,176 --> 01:25:14,336
Get started?

1314
01:25:14,377 --> 01:25:16,477
Get started on what?

1315
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,288
I have an idea.

1316
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:26,692
Yens, buy me a bottle of vodka.

1317
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:29,986
Here's some money.

1318
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:34,755
Virgil, I don't think
that's very constructive.

1319
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,057
Just get me the bottle.

1320
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:37,268
I'll get started here.

1321
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,570
Get started on what?

1322
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:43,937
I'm gonna pick blackberries!

1323
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,772
*

1324
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,608
(goat bleat)

1325
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,313
*

1326
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:53,815
Notes on the production
of a goat cheese.

1327
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:56,319
The goats are walked daily
through the same sections

1328
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,322
of the northern meadow,
so that they may forge

1329
01:25:58,354 --> 01:26:00,564
through the blackberry bushes.

1330
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:03,159
It is from the terroir
that the milk

1331
01:26:03,192 --> 01:26:05,162
and consequently
the cheese

1332
01:26:05,194 --> 01:26:07,134
will be given
uniquely regional

1333
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,372
characteristics
and complexities.

1334
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:17,609
*

1335
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,610
(liquid squirting)

1336
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:29,692
*

1337
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:39,695
*

1338
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,160
The layer
of carbonized ash

1339
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:18,898
reduces the acidity
of the cheese,

1340
01:27:18,934 --> 01:27:21,044
permitting
the growth of mold to ripen

1341
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,009
and develop the flavor.

1342
01:27:23,038 --> 01:27:32,048
*

1343
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,320
Time constraints
have forced us

1344
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:35,219
to shift from a hard,
aged cheese

1345
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,720
to a soft,
fresh Neufchatel .

1346
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:41,163
As such, we will set the milk
at a lower temperate

1347
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:45,329
so as to maintain the larger,
softer curds.

1348
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:47,031
*

1349
01:27:47,062 --> 01:27:49,332
The wild blackberries,
native to the land,

1350
01:27:49,365 --> 01:27:52,295
are integrated
at this early stage

1351
01:27:52,335 --> 01:27:53,895
to allow the flavor
to develop fully

1352
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:55,336
into the curd.

1353
01:27:55,371 --> 01:28:05,411
*

1354
01:28:05,414 --> 01:28:15,424
*

1355
01:28:23,566 --> 01:28:25,826
This is it.

1356
01:28:25,868 --> 01:28:28,768
This is it.

1357
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,384
This is it.

1358
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:33,708
*

1359
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:38,212
I give to you
the blackberry chÃ¨vre.

1360
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,476
This is mine.

1361
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:43,316
I have created it.

1362
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:48,562
And it is--

1363
01:28:48,591 --> 01:28:50,531
(crash)

1364
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:57,804
(gasps)

1365
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:00,841
What's goin' on?

1366
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,437
What the hell is goin' on?

1367
01:29:03,472 --> 01:29:05,312
No, no, no!

1368
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,880
No, no, no, no, no!

1369
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:11,452
Be careful!

1370
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,468
Are you Yens Berlin?

1371
01:30:02,498 --> 01:30:04,268
Was?

1372
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:06,099
Are you?

1373
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:08,766
Yeah.

1374
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,744
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1375
01:30:19,882 --> 01:30:23,252
I'm Agent Brown
with the FDA

1376
01:30:23,285 --> 01:30:25,215
and you're under arrest
for conspiracy to import

1377
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,563
and distribute illegal,
unpasteurized cheese.

1378
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:29,931
Oh, my God.

1379
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,088
Shizer.

1380
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:33,126
Yeah, yeah.

1381
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:35,301
I told you--

1382
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,930
told you they were watching me.

1383
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:37,965
Take 'em away.

1384
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,770
(gasping)

1385
01:30:39,802 --> 01:30:40,842
I told you
they were watching me!

1386
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:42,569
No, no--
I'm sorry.

1387
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:43,405
Yens!

1388
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,308
Yens, Yens!

1389
01:30:44,339 --> 01:30:45,139
You wouldn't listen!

1390
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,443
Oh, God.

1391
01:30:46,475 --> 01:30:47,435
Confiscate everything.

1392
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:48,136
Take that cheese.

1393
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:48,576
No, no!

1394
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:49,781
Give it.

1395
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:51,182
(yelling)

1396
01:30:51,213 --> 01:30:53,183
No, my cheese!

1397
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:55,015
Don't forget the goats.

1398
01:30:58,253 --> 01:30:59,593
This operation is goin' down.

1399
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:00,292
What--no!

1400
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:01,222
No, no, wait.

1401
01:31:01,256 --> 01:31:02,216
Yens had nothing to do with it.

1402
01:31:02,257 --> 01:31:02,787
This is mine!

1403
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:03,785
I--I created it!

1404
01:31:03,826 --> 01:31:04,456
It's mine!

1405
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:05,063
Save it.

1406
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:06,703
No!

1407
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:08,099
You can get it all back
after we finish

1408
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,260
with the legal proceeding.

1409
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,997
How long will that take?

1410
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:11,973
About six months.

1411
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,900
No--no, no, no.

1412
01:31:12,935 --> 01:31:13,595
I--I need it.

1413
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:15,136
I need it!

1414
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,510
Everything depends on it!

1415
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,437
We're outta here.

1416
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:25,752
(helicopter taking off)

1417
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:45,872
(goat bleating)

1418
01:31:55,644 --> 01:31:57,714
Artois.

1419
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:00,982
No!

1420
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:02,346
Oh, my God, no!

1421
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:03,794
No.

1422
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,031
(goat bleat)

1423
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,433
(sighing)

1424
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:28,682
God.

1425
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:37,554
(goat bleat)

1426
01:32:44,727 --> 01:32:47,227
The Pecorino Clermont.

1427
01:32:47,262 --> 01:32:49,362
Its unique aging process

1428
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:52,367
originated
in the 8th century A.D.,

1429
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,640
when the township of Clermont
was set upon by marauders.

1430
01:32:56,672 --> 01:32:59,842
Refusing to give in
to the marauder's demands,

1431
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:01,805
they buried
their wheels of cheese

1432
01:33:01,844 --> 01:33:03,454
beneath the ground

1433
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:06,048
so that even
if their lives were taken,

1434
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:11,421
that which they held most dear
would remain untarnished.

1435
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:13,723
I must pause here
to remark

1436
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:16,056
that upon first encountering
this story,

1437
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:19,801
I could not help but draw
the obvious parallels.

1438
01:33:19,828 --> 01:33:22,228
My first attempts
at the making of reblochon

1439
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:23,874
had failed.

1440
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:26,999
I was faced with the prospect
of returning to my position

1441
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:31,105
as a typist
at my father's gallery.

1442
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:34,309
As I sat at the train station,
ticket in hand,

1443
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:35,982
I considered,

1444
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:39,351
was my cause any less
worth fighting for?

1445
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:44,021
Had I given up the fight
without unsheathing my sword?

1446
01:33:44,052 --> 01:33:49,222
Would I prefer my position
as a typist to death?

1447
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:53,427
My struggles seemed
so trivial compared to theirs,

1448
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,031
but sure enough,

1449
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:58,773
the township of Clermont
was able to repel the marauders,

1450
01:33:58,801 --> 01:34:02,741
though not without
some loss of life on both sides,

1451
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:06,981
and when they exhumed their
precious wheels of pecorino,

1452
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:09,439
they rejoiced
in their discovery

1453
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:12,277
that the process
of being aged underground

1454
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:15,324
had imbued them
with a unique and wonderful

1455
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:18,350
character and complexity.

1456
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,116
So from that day onwards,

1457
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:23,525
each season
in the last 1,200 years,

1458
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:26,658
they've buried their cheese
beneath the ground

1459
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:29,525
to uncover them
on the anniversary of the day

1460
01:34:29,564 --> 01:34:34,174
they repelled the onslaught
and won their future.

1461
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:36,773
Virgil?

1462
01:34:36,805 --> 01:34:38,635
Are you listening?

1463
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,350
Yes.

1464
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,145
Go.

1465
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:50,053
It is your destiny.

1466
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:52,915
*

1467
01:34:52,955 --> 01:34:54,915

1468

1469

*

1470
01:36:20,075 --> 01:36:22,005
(ground crumbling)

1471
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:13,397
Angie?

1472
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:15,758
There's someone here to see you.

1473
01:37:46,328 --> 01:37:48,728
Miss Angie?

1474
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:52,598
Yes.

1475
01:37:52,634 --> 01:37:55,374
I have special instructions.

1476
01:37:55,403 --> 01:37:59,313
I am to deliver this in person.

1477
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:01,781
Yes?

1478
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:03,573
(thunder clap)

1479
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:13,645
*

1480
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:23,658
*

1481
01:39:56,524 --> 01:39:58,494
(yelling)

1482
01:39:58,526 --> 01:40:08,566
*

1483
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:18,580

1484
01:41:53,508 --> 01:41:55,478
(angelic choir)

1485
01:41:55,510 --> 01:42:10,430
*

1486
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,598
Is this small business loans?

1487
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:18,968
*

1488
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,100
It is.

1489
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:24,466
I have an application.

1490
01:42:24,506 --> 01:42:27,236
A guy about my age,

1491
01:42:27,275 --> 01:42:29,675
he wants to make cheese.

1492
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:33,781
