1
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:19,860
Love scene no. 1

2
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,165
<i>Here I lie.</i>

3
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:34,039
<i>The rain is falling on my face.</i>

4
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,208
<i>But I feel nothing.</i>

5
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:43,285
<i>In a moment they'll bring white tape
to mark out my profile.</i>

6
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:50,927
<i>A good shot:
The victim in the rain.</i>

7
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:57,063
<i>Direct flash. Razor sharp.</i>

8
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,967
<i>The woman.</i>

9
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,803
<i>There always has to be a woman.</i>

10
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,477
<i>There she is.</i>

11
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:15,187
<i>Dear Mette...</i>

12
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,749
<i>...I don't know where I am going.</i>

13
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:23,359
<i>Only that I've got my back
against the planet...</i>

14
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,566
<i>...and I'm on my way away.</i>

15
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>Love scene no. 2</i>

16
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:44,206
<i>We could go to Polynesia.</i>

17
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:46,512
Have we won the lottery?

18
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:51,355
If we forgot about a new car?

19
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,919
I am not driving another foot
in that old wreck.

20
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:59,055
New car, new flat, new lamps,
new paint. Everything is new.

21
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,497
The Paracetamols.

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,431
This new stuff makes us old.

23
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:03,969
Do you know where they are?

24
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,402
Yes. Near the Equator.

25
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,371
Uh?!

26
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,347
Here.

27
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:20,113
How many times have we made love?

28
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:26,959
If we say the first five years
about five times a week.

29
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:32,529
The next five, maybe twice.

30
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,305
<i>2000 times?</i>

31
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,212
It's not enough, damn it.

32
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:02,153
<i>What are you doing?</i>

33
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:10,464
Love scene no. 3

34
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:38,828
I am afraid.

35
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:44,327
No, no, no...

36
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,564
Here.

37
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:59,379
Or I won't be able to see you.

38
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,620
I love you.

39
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,186
I love you.

40
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,065
I love you.

41
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,599
JUST ANOTHER LO VE STORY

42
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:29,945
<i>Tibetan monks think</i>

43
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,453
<i>that sexual abstinence
gives absolute insight.</i>

44
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:39,189
- Mette, are you asleep?
- Yes.

45
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,061
Shall we go into the living room?

46
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:45,791
<i>Why?</i>

47
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,625
<i>All I could see was darkness.</i>

48
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:55,706
<i>But from bed height
I could see a long way.</i>

49
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:59,677
<i>My agents reported back
on everything...</i>

50
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,010
<i>The secretive coasts of Polynesia.</i>

51
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:07,350
<i>The deserts of Arizona.</i>

52
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:10,389
<i>The reefs of the Dead Sea.</i>

53
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,887
<i>I was king of the world,</i>

54
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:17,623
<i>and my throne stood far
to the north in a tiny country</i>

55
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,255
<i>that called itself Denmark.</i>

56
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:23,359
<i>In a new flat that smelled
of fresh paint</i>

57
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,772
<i>in a faceless new part of town,</i>

58
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,843
<i>mortgaged up to the hilt,</i>

59
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:33,777
<i>and with a battered old car
in the car park downstairs.</i>

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,816
<i>Two lovely children,
Klara and Frederik.</i>

61
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:41,148
<i>And my beautiful wife Mette.</i>

62
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:46,183
<i>And a job that was slightly unusual.</i>

63
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:51,797
Daddy, what's your job?

64
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,593
I work for the police.

65
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,600
Daddy photographs
dead bodies, Klara.

66
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:57,033
Here.

67
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,729
You can photograph dolly, then.

68
00:05:59,339 --> 00:05:59,862
Yes.

69
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,702
Hold her steady.

70
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:06,878
She certainly resisted.

71
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,744
<i>Joking helps you to survive.</i>

72
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,476
"Manicure from hell. "

73
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:15,787
<i>But Poul just wasn't funny.</i>

74
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:20,224
<i>Frank often wondered
which was the scarier:</i>

75
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:24,524
<i>Poul or the crimes.</i>

76
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:33,070
He beat her unconscious
and then he pushed the skewer in.

77
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,106
And then he kicked it.

78
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,232
<i>Where is he?</i>

79
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,276
Upstairs with the children.

80
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:42,941
The children?

81
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:48,085
They didn't mention any children.

82
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:54,388
"I love Malthe, Tulle and Charlotte,
so we are going away together. "

83
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,728
"Up yours. "

84
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:06,167
Four spelling mistakes
in three sentences.

85
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,814
<i>I had always wanted
to be a photographer,</i>

86
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,652
<i>ever since I was 14.</i>

87
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:30,896
<i>I wanted to photograph
the beauty of the world.</i>

88
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,158
<i>To fly across the world
in a helicopter,</i>

89
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,665
<i>and photograph downwards.</i>

90
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,996
<i>Landscapes.</i>

91
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:43,004
<i>Not dead children.</i>

92
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,851
<i>I didn't know a thing about Julia.</i>

93
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,543
<i>But I'd end up loving her.</i>

94
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,415
<i>With unbridled passion.</i>

95
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,013
<i>With unbridled passion.</i>

96
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,954
<i>That was how you loved Julia.</i>

97
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:09,765
<i>Like in a movie. Dramatically.
Exaggerated.</i>

98
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:11,632
<i>A chance meeting.</i>

99
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:14,206
<i>A moment of madness...</i>

100
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:21,845
<i>...and the world
as you know it vanishes.</i>

101
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,980
<i>Julia was on the run.</i>

102
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:33,923
<i>Not from a grey humdrum existence,
but from a sharp, black shadow</i>

103
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,723
<i>that had drilled into her neck.</i>

104
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,427
Hello, Mommy. It's me.

105
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,495
No, we're fine.

106
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,802
<i>We're still in Hanoi.</i>

107
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,896
But...

108
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,975
I am coming home.

109
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,408
Yes.

110
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,246
No, I'll be on my own.

111
00:08:56,983 --> 00:09:02,080
Sebastian has some business.
So he'll be coming later.

112
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:07,657
It's a little silly,
but there's so much going on.

113
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:14,792
Mom, I miss you.

114
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,665
<i>Julia was on the run.</i>

115
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,670
<i>Julia wanted to get away.</i>

116
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:24,869
<i>Julia was definitely getting away.</i>

117
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:29,975
<i>All the way away.</i>

118
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,251
<i>Unlike me.
I never went away.</i>

119
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,728
<i>I was always on my way home.</i>

120
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,433
<i>We're going to be late again.</i>

121
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:25,095
<i>Why do I get this feeling of déjà-vu?</i>

122
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,971
- It's a pile of crap.
- Yes. That's what I keep telling you.

123
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,132
You mustn't swear.

124
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,472
Yes, you may swear
at crappy old cars.

125
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:32,566
It's a pisspot.

126
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,909
- Yes, it's a pisspot.
- Come on, Dad!

127
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,606
There's nothing wrong with it.

128
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:40,675
- It's just...
- That's the fourth time this week.

129
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:42,448
- It's just what?
- It's just...

130
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:46,753
- It's stubborn.
- Yes. It runs in the family.

131
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:51,193
Crappy, lousy, stupid car...

132
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:53,162
Now, now, young lady!

133
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:57,961
There.

134
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:06,311
<i>Will you do the shopping?</i>

135
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:11,273
<i>We need black bread,
yogurt, vegetables.</i>

136
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,784
Klara needs a new drinks bottle.

137
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:17,515
- Hasn't she just had one?
- I chucked it out.

138
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:18,783
<i>Why?</i>

139
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:22,327
I read about plastic and cancer.

140
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,886
<i>- Was that what it was made of?
- You never know.</i>

141
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,522
Buy a metal one.

142
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:27,656
Okay.

143
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,428
Phthalates.

144
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,870
Honestly!

145
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,777
Oh, come on!

146
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,453
No...

147
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,501
Duck!

148
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,578
Don't look!

149
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:19,082
Close your eyes, Frederik!

150
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,364
Sebastian?

151
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,736
Everything is going to be okay.

152
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:46,744
I can't see.
I don't want to die.

153
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,740
I don't want to die, Sebastian.

154
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:49,576
It will be okay.

155
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,240
Get a blanket!

156
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,648
Easy now.

157
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:58,185
I can't see anything.

158
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,891
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die, Sebastian.

159
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,531
I don't want to die.

160
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,137
Here...

161
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,176
I'm a doctor.

162
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:26,910
Are they...?

163
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:35,652
Oh, God!

164
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:53,070
She went into a coma.

165
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,874
Did you check out her ID?

166
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:56,915
I don't have access.

167
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,108
I'll phone Bundgaard.

168
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:03,846
Am I a criminal?

169
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,356
No matter what, drivers approaching
from behind must ensure at all times

170
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,483
that it is possible to brake

171
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:10,528
if a preceding vehicle
finds itself in trouble.

172
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:11,886
But I still feel...

173
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:14,023
You were driving
an irresponsible heap of junk.

174
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,567
You nearly took it in the rear, Jonas!

175
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,466
Hi.

176
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:21,972
Poul, go get a nasty pastry.

177
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,201
I can't. I'm off to forensics.

178
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,340
She's Julia Castlund.

179
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,576
- Castlund?
- The art dealer.

180
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,243
Her dad owns the biggest
publishing house in Scandinavia.

181
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,322
She must be his daughter.
Her mother is Swedish.

182
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:41,154
She flew from Hanoi to Frankfurt
and rented a car.

183
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,191
I'm going to see her.

184
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,891
Jonas.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,163
I'm partly to blame.
I want to see how she is.

186
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,532
Is she a looker?

187
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,470
<i>Why?</i>

188
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,440
Beautiful women and a mystery.

189
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:00,842
Isn't that how all film noirs begin?

190
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,154
I am looking for a patient
in Intensive Care:

191
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:13,850
Julia, Julia Castlund.

192
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,120
Are you family?

193
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:16,559
No.

194
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:18,186
Sorry, we can't disclose anything.

195
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,288
She was...

196
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,764
Didn't you hear me?

197
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,926
I can't help you.

198
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,512
Yes?

199
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,015
Julia Castlund?

200
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,381
- Are you family?
- Yes.

201
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:43,649
I am her boyfriend.

202
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,623
Hello.
I'm Magnus Castlund.

203
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,956
Should I wait outside?

204
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,621
I'm not sure I...

205
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,133
It's him.

206
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,039
Sebastian!

207
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,335
You're Sebastian?

208
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,779
<i>We haven't heard
a word from you?</i>

209
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,682
Frankfurt?
Did you fly via Frankfurt?

210
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:15,845
Or via London?

211
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,422
<i>Why didn't you answer our calls?</i>

212
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,547
<i>We left thousands of messages!</i>

213
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:19,920
You had business in Hanoi?

214
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,358
You came straight from Kampuchea?

215
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,520
Sebastian!

216
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:31,627
You've heard of mobile phones?

217
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:34,598
He's not as bad as I thought.

218
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,231
<i>Angkor Wat...</i>

219
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,173
The night you both phoned.

220
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:41,007
It was your first night...

221
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:42,705
Julia seemed transformed.

222
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,806
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,150
This is quite difficult.

224
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,515
It's difficult?

225
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,111
- Quite difficult?
- Yes.

226
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:53,214
He finds it quite difficult.

227
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,387
And this is...

228
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:56,586
Sebastian.

229
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:57,822
He's getting cold feet.

230
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,192
Now, then, Monica!

231
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:05,199
<i>What were you thinking?!</i>

232
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,430
<i>Why didn't you tell the truth?</i>

233
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,168
Listen, their daughter
was all smashed up.

234
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:11,265
They were all in tears.

235
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,244
It was fucking embarrassing.
It was only for five minutes.

236
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,144
And when the real Sebastian
shows up?

237
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,681
<i>We'll take it from there, all right?</i>

238
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,343
I just don't get
what you were doing there.

239
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:23,321
That wasn't even the worst of it.

240
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,687
You should've heard the doctor
when I was on my own with him.

241
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,386
The girl you knew was full of life.

242
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:34,194
This girl may be on a respirator
for the rest of her life.

243
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,827
"I see lots of people run away. "

244
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,667
I see lots of people run away

245
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,742
because they don't want
to be saddled with it.

246
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,368
"It's a matter of life and death. "

247
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,539
It's a matter of life and death.

248
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:54,244
<i>"Will you help or will you not?
Don't break now. "</i>

249
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:57,254
Don't break now.

250
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,914
"Do you understand?"

251
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,616
Sit down.
Do you understand?

252
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,456
Sit down.

253
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,524
Julia...

254
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,660
I am here.

255
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:17,766
<i>We are together again.</i>

256
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:21,176
I won't leave you.

257
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:23,306
But you've got to come back to us.

258
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,882
Kiss her.

259
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,816
Maybe...

260
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:32,322
Maybe she'll feel it.

261
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,393
- Kiss her.
- Yes.

262
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,610
Thank you, Sebastian.

263
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,305
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

264
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:57,746
At a friend's place.

265
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,518
<i>Why not stay with us?</i>

266
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:05,056
I'll be fine at Frank's, so...

267
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,681
But thanks anyway.

268
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,157
Call us.

269
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,057
Yes.

270
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,325
<i>What did you do</i>

271
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:21,498
while you were alone with that
defenseless woman in the dark?

272
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,631
<i>What did I do?</i>

273
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,902
Hold her hand?

274
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,240
<i>Or... Where did you hold her?</i>

275
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,873
That's so sick, Frank!

276
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:41,259
Hello, Sebastian.

277
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,089
My name is Irma.

278
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,894
I've come to wash Julia.

279
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,488
But you can wash her.

280
00:19:55,541 --> 00:20:01,946
It's her armpits and between her legs.

281
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:06,848
And anywhere you can feel
she's burning.

282
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,619
Call me if you need me.

283
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:29,697
Sebastian?

284
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:32,072
Julia.

285
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,543
Sebastian.

286
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,379
Are you mine?

287
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:43,921
I have searched for you for ages.

288
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,955
<i>Where have you been?</i>

289
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,861
Round about.

290
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,228
Have you come home now?

291
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:57,893
Yes.

292
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:01,131
Till death us do part.

293
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:05,933
No. Nothing will part us.

294
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:08,240
Not even death.

295
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:12,776
Julia, who are you?

296
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,817
<i>Where have you come from?</i>

297
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,813
<i>Where have you come from?</i>

298
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:03,025
<i>Why didn't I leave Julia right there?</i>

299
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:07,995
<i>Perhaps because my life
was just too real.</i>

300
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:12,335
<i>And Julia's was mysterious.</i>

301
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:16,109
<i>Beautiful women and mystery.</i>

302
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,313
<i>I expect that's what it was.</i>

303
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,575
<i>I was curious.</i>

304
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:25,983
<i>I was just curious.</i>

305
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:28,660
<i>What are you doing?</i>

306
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,691
- I'm from the scientific support unit.
- Ah, okay.

307
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:37,358
You find loads of weird things
in people's cars.

308
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:41,098
I once found a pair of shoes.
And I found a Teddy bear.

309
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,741
And I once found
a whole tin of Coca Cola

310
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,140
nobody had drunk from.

311
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:51,410
I once found a dead cat in the trunk.
That was disgusting.

312
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:52,848
Did you find anything
in the trunk of this one?

313
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,347
Listen, it's important.

314
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,318
Yes.

315
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,088
- You did?
- Yes.

316
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,186
<i>What?</i>

317
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,082
<i>What did you say his name was?</i>

318
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,917
Sebastian. Christersson.

319
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,490
Sebastian Christersson.

320
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,686
You'll have to go back to tell them.

321
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:39,761
I... I'll just keep out of it.

322
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,427
And bump into the whole bunch
of them one day?

323
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:48,028
<i>With Mette and the kids?</i>

324
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,734
<i>What do you reckon Mette
will say to that?</i>

325
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,517
No.

326
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,417
I'd better go back, hand them the case
and tell them the truth.

327
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:05,820
Good thinking.

328
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,856
<i>Dear Mr. And Mrs. Castlund.</i>

329
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:17,231
<i>I have committed a crime.</i>

330
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:21,204
<i>I came stomping in on you
like some clown in oversized shoes.</i>

331
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:26,175
<i>You were in shock, and I hadn't
the guts to tell you the truth.</i>

332
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,706
<i>I am not Sebastian.</i>

333
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:31,408
<i>I saw Julia's crash.</i>

334
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,644
<i>I wanted to see
how she was doing.</i>

335
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:37,552
<i>I am a photographer
with the scientific support unit,</i>

336
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,920
<i>and I found this case in her car.</i>

337
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:44,086
<i>Forgive this stupid misunderstanding.</i>

338
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:48,292
<i>I wish you all the best
at this difficult time.</i>

339
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,729
<i>Yours truly, a friend.</i>

340
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,031
Sebastian?

341
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:58,875
Sebastian!

342
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,740
Have you talked to the staff in IC?

343
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,513
- No.
- You'll be so pleased.

344
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,024
You'll be so, so pleased.

345
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:18,553
Julia has come round.

346
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:42,853
But the chances of it returning
are pretty good.

347
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,821
Sebastian has arrived.

348
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,063
Sebastian?

349
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:59,069
Your Sebastian.

350
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:05,500
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

351
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:07,579
I don't know anyone
called Sebastian.

352
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:16,884
Julia, have you a boyfriend?

353
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:21,715
Sebastian...

354
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,456
Julia...

355
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:30,297
<i>We'll take it slowly one more time.
Let's try again.</i>

356
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:35,398
This is Sebastian.

357
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:39,342
Your boyfriend.
You met him in Asia.

358
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,902
You spent nine months there.

359
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:44,846
Oh, God!

360
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:51,213
I'm sorry.

361
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:00,526
I don't remember a thing.

362
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:37,266
Julia, Julia, Julia...

363
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:44,609
How are you feeling?

364
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,644
I think it'd be best for us
to talk about this.

365
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,508
- This is too stupid.
- Yes.

366
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,740
I know what you're thinking.

367
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:52,817
I talked to Dichmann.

368
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:57,287
Julia may be in a wheelchair forever.

369
00:27:58,523 --> 00:27:59,888
Listen...

370
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,286
...this is all...

371
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:08,264
...a big misunderstanding.

372
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:13,695
Here. I've signed it.

373
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:15,731
Put any figure you want.

374
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:19,709
- Money doesn't matter.
- Precisely.

375
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:22,371
<i>What matters is helping Julia.</i>

376
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:28,381
I'm employing you to help
my daughter.

377
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,183
I'm buying a bit of your time.

378
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:35,850
<i>What happens later is of no concern.</i>

379
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:40,858
Give her a bit of love,
for God's sake.

380
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:46,997
Look at her!
My daughter is a wreck.

381
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:51,508
You can't back out now
when she needs your help.

382
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:54,008
You can at least pretend.

383
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,938
<i>Write 100,000.</i>

384
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,712
<i>A million. Whatever.</i>

385
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,052
I have known women who can
pretend to love for much less.

386
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:12,387
If I told you I wasn't Sebastian...

387
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:20,696
I'd call you a damned coward.

388
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:25,977
I beg you!

389
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,310
Sebastian?

390
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:31,507
Julia wants to talk to you.

391
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,860
Dichmann says
you're my best medicine.

392
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,690
Oh?

393
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:49,227
Have we known each other long?

394
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:52,894
A few months.

395
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:57,197
Dad says we phoned
from Cambodia.

396
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:00,208
<i>Angkor Wat.</i>

397
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,114
<i>What happened there?</i>

398
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:05,916
<i>What happened?</i>

399
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,212
How did we meet?

400
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:15,649
There was a bonfire.

401
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,522
It was evening.

402
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:22,965
Huddles of people
gathering in the twilight

403
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,597
getting to know each other.

404
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,506
People from all over.

405
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:31,900
<i>Was I alone?</i>

406
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,308
Yes.

407
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:35,674
And so were you?

408
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:37,914
Yes.

409
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,314
<i>What do you look like?</i>

410
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,218
Ordinary.

411
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:48,050
Tall or short?

412
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,749
Dark or fair?

413
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:50,885
Dark.

414
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,123
Ordinary.

415
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,994
I blend into the wall.

416
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,160
<i>What happened?</i>

417
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:03,207
You were on your own.

418
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,344
<i>With a Danish flag
on your backpack.</i>

419
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:09,208
I offered you a bottle of Chang.

420
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,545
Chang?

421
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,416
Yes, it's the local gnat piss.

422
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:20,181
<i>Two Danes in Angkor Wat.</i>

423
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:24,160
Some coincidence!

424
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:27,561
Love at first sight.

425
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,634
If you believe in that.

426
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,526
<i>What do you do?</i>

427
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,468
I'm a photographer.

428
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,075
I travel around.
I take photographs.

429
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,542
For what?

430
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:45,482
National Geographic.

431
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,449
Features. Bits and pieces.

432
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,110
Do you love me?

433
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,589
Of course I love you.

434
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,190
You hesitated for too long.

435
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:07,027
I don't love you.

436
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:10,102
No.

437
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,541
I don't fall in love.

438
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:17,708
That's sad.

439
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:22,345
I have always been terrified

440
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:29,951
of a life of habit, appointments,
regular meals.

441
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,760
I hate rituals.

442
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,393
I don't want to be tied down.

443
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:45,173
Can you imagine such a life?

444
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,535
<i>What life?</i>

445
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,544
Husband, wife, a home.

446
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,108
Two screaming brats
and a miserable job.

447
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,983
Television.

448
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,720
Friends round for supper
on Saturdays.

449
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:05,353
Regular days for sex
once the kids are in bed.

450
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,363
No.

451
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,956
I can't imagine it.

452
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:12,502
It must be dreadful.

453
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:16,299
Or absolutely wonderful.

454
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:22,777
Everything so predictable.

455
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,746
Still no Other Half, Frank?

456
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,441
As far as I know.

457
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,080
<i>What was our secret?</i>

458
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:32,452
<i>Can I surprise you with a rum
and Cola or a gin and tonic?</i>

459
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:34,024
<i>We could...</i>

460
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:38,619
I'll have a rum and Coke
without the Coke.

461
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,558
<i>We could see.</i>

462
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,663
See?

463
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,194
Feel things.

464
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,198
<i>We were refugees
from a tiny country.</i>

465
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:59,648
<i>We wanted to see a world far bigger
than coffee, herring and chatter.</i>

466
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:05,215
<i>And you provoked me.
And I provoked you.</i>

467
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:09,418
<i>We kept surprising each other.</i>

468
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:12,088
Always another experiment.

469
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:13,991
And always...

470
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,533
...always love.

471
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:17,760
<i>Sex?</i>

472
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,838
Several times a day.

473
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,241
Liar!

474
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,436
No.

475
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:28,771
Did I come?

476
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,382
<i>What?</i>

477
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:32,211
I can never come.

478
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:35,951
You always came.

479
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:40,891
Are you full of yourself of what?

480
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:42,187
Pardon?

481
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:49,897
Nice to see you.
Good of you to come.

482
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,491
<i>We've just said that!</i>

483
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:53,571
Thanks for asking us.

484
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,662
Did you sleep well?

485
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:01,072
<i>Well, it is nice to see you.</i>

486
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:06,449
<i>Where did we go after Angkor Wat?</i>

487
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:09,714
At the rate I am going, I reckon
we are soon going to run out of wine.

488
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,345
<i>Where are the other bottles?</i>

489
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,718
Polynesia.

490
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,426
<i>What?</i>

491
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:16,755
<i>What?</i>

492
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:21,521
- Polynesia?
- That's a long way to go.

493
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,225
Yes.

494
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,601
I always wanted to see Polynesia.

495
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,266
Are you ill?

496
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,679
Had you heard that Carsten
and Henriette are splitting up too?

497
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,646
He found a Pole. The bastard.

498
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,739
Did she come cheap?

499
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:44,413
Marriage is like a new car.

500
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:48,083
You're thrilled when you drive it
off the forecourt; it's all shiny.

501
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:51,685
Slowly you lose interest.
You don't wash it.

502
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:53,058
You don't vacuum the mats.

503
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:54,688
<i>We're thinking about a new car.</i>

504
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:58,860
You leave an empty bottle
under a seat.

505
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,871
The only thing you want
is a new one.

506
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:03,736
If only you'd been regular.

507
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,104
Just once a week.

508
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,701
<i>1) Wash the car.</i>

509
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:09,370
<i>2) Vacuum.</i>

510
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,312
3) Run a damp cloth
round the interior.

511
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,940
<i>4) Wash the hubs.</i>

512
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,076
You'd always have a new car.

513
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,347
He's down there all day long.

514
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:23,688
Someone must have poisoned
my apple.

515
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:30,130
You kissed me, and I woke up.

516
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:32,963
<i>Want to try again?</i>

517
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:43,939
My face is a wreck, isn't it?

518
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:46,846
You are beautiful.

519
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:11,131
I think you're feverish.

520
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:19,340
I'm going out for a bit.

521
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:22,117
<i>What?</i>

522
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,217
I need some air.

523
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:27,348
<i>We've got visitors, darling.</i>

524
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,923
Julia, there is something
I have to tell you.

525
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,266
It's hard for me to say this.

526
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,096
I know what it is.

527
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,038
Go now.

528
00:37:42,974 --> 00:37:46,171
I don't know
what it was like out there,

529
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:49,610
but it's all different now.

530
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:56,416
You don't need me,
and I don't need you.

531
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,955
Okay.

532
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:12,201
<i>- What did you think I wanted to say?
- Go. Just go.</i>

533
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,184
<i>What is happening?</i>

534
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,004
<i>What happened last week
is happening this week</i>

535
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,270
and will happen next week.

536
00:38:53,378 --> 00:38:54,504
I am dying, Frank.

537
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:57,513
<i>Who isn't?</i>

538
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:59,580
I feel...

539
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:03,310
Feel what?

540
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:04,786
Limp.

541
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:08,120
Join the Marines.
Grow a moustache.

542
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:10,217
<i>What's worse?</i>

543
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,729
The caves of Afghanistan
or screaming kids and a wife

544
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,799
who's always got a headache?

545
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,367
I don't know!

546
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,732
But maybe you've struck lucky.

547
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:25,935
You and Mette and all your friends
who have seen the light!

548
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,740
If there is any?

549
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:35,308
Hey, is anyone breathing out there?
Can you hear me?

550
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,945
Have you seen the light?

551
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:39,117
Listen.

552
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:45,760
If you need to stretch your legs,
buy a blow job off a Lithuanian.

553
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:50,357
Get it over with.
They're dirt cheap.

554
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:51,992
Julia needs me.

555
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:54,571
"Julia needs me. "

556
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,331
"Julia needs me. "

557
00:39:57,442 --> 00:40:00,070
Julia needs you, does she?

558
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:02,146
Jonas, you are not Sebastian, okay?

559
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:06,114
You're Jonas, Jonas.

560
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,763
I don't know
if they're breathing, Frank.

561
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:25,927
I fucking don't know.

562
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:28,403
They're not.

563
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,674
I am Jonas.

564
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:32,504
Yes, you are Jonas.

565
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,703
He'll show up tomorrow,
and all hell will break loose.

566
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,973
<i>- Who?
- Sebastian.</i>

567
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,446
Sebastian Christersson is dead.

568
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:43,415
<i>What?</i>

569
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:46,490
Murdered. I circulated his name
round Interpol.

570
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,458
I heard from Hanoi yesterday.
They found him in his hotel room.

571
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,425
He'd been shot at point blank range.

572
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:53,659
I'm going to see her.

573
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:54,925
Damn it, Jonas.

574
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,331
Am I mad?

575
00:40:57,435 --> 00:41:00,427
Yes! You're in love!

576
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:35,765
Is there anybody there?

577
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:40,142
<i>Who's that?</i>

578
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:44,780
Sebastian?

579
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:48,243
Is that you?

580
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,535
<i>Were you asleep?</i>

581
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:14,569
<i>I don't know.</i>

582
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:22,475
Are you okay?

583
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,216
<i>I thought I heard you just now.</i>

584
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,058
<i>Maybe I was dreaming.</i>

585
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:34,460
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

586
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:35,623
<i>A lot.</i>

587
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,368
I'm happy you're here.

588
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,877
Yes.

589
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:52,046
Aren't you going to answer it?

590
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,918
Never mind that.

591
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:59,550
<i>It might be urgent.</i>

592
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:31,084
Take me.

593
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,298
Do you want to make love?

594
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:44,463
No, thanks.

595
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:57,146
Are you playing away?

596
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:58,806
Mette...

597
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,151
I want to know.

598
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:09,090
<i>Will you tell me the truth?</i>

599
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,557
Stop it.

600
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:15,356
<i>Will you tell me the truth?</i>

601
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:17,560
Yes.

602
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:20,134
I'll tell you the truth.

603
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:27,641
Turn me over.

604
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,140
Is there somebody else?

605
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,685
No, Mette.

606
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:03,475
<i>Where did you go?</i>

607
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:11,611
I needed to stretch my legs.

608
00:45:30,674 --> 00:45:33,370
Because I get the feeling
we may be needing two cars.

609
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:35,809
And so you bought one.

610
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:37,881
Spending money helps
when one's frustrated.

611
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,415
That much shopping?

612
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:43,214
I'm that frustrated.

613
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:47,323
Sit down.

614
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:57,424
<i>- What the hell's going on?
- What do you mean?</i>

615
00:45:57,568 --> 00:46:02,232
These aren't my fucking size!

616
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:07,376
My butt is too big
after having two kids.

617
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:12,539
I had no idea that dirty panties
turned you on!

618
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,947
<i>Where did you get them?</i>

619
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,416
From here.

620
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:27,988
<i>Well done, Mette.</i>

621
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:30,733
Do you know what that is?

622
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:36,569
Evidence from a crime scene.

623
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:37,899
Goodness!

624
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:41,000
And you've mauled it.

625
00:46:42,646 --> 00:46:47,242
For the last forth night
you've been out of here, Jonas.

626
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:50,420
You don't talk to me.
You don't touch me.

627
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:52,216
You've gone.

628
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,917
<i>What's happening?
Where are you?</i>

629
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:12,667
Is that your hotline?

630
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:16,438
Mette speaking.

631
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:19,108
Hello?

632
00:47:19,216 --> 00:47:20,274
No, I am not Julia.

633
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,514
I don't know if this is her phone.

634
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:24,847
<i>Wait a second.</i>

635
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:26,786
Is that her name? Julia?

636
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:29,285
Someone wants to talk to her.

637
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:30,587
Hang up, Mette.

638
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,787
I guess this is her phone,
but she's not here at the moment.

639
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:35,764
I think she is busy
fucking my husband.

640
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:37,458
Please try again later.

641
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:39,833
<i>- Where are you going?
- To work.</i>

642
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:42,303
<i>What's going on?</i>

643
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:43,896
Nothing.

644
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:04,358
It's a fantastic house.

645
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:11,890
From the beach you can see
all the way across to Kullen.

646
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:18,870
And all the time
there's the sound of the sea.

647
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:22,669
You feel the sun on your back.

648
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:24,941
It sounds lovely.

649
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:29,513
As soon as I'm discharged, we'll go.

650
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,248
For a month or two.

651
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:35,721
I'll need help, after all.

652
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:38,727
There is nothing I'd rather do.

653
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:48,002
Something fantastic has happened.

654
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:53,473
You've got me pregnant.

655
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:07,617
It's amazing.

656
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:11,994
Yes... But when?

657
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:13,796
Before or after?

658
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:14,625
<i>What do you mean?</i>

659
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:17,331
Here or in Asia?

660
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:22,237
Here. Right here.

661
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:28,736
That's fantastic.

662
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,684
An amazing recovery.

663
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:43,692
I've seldom seen the like.

664
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:46,830
A couple of weeks ago
she was close to dying.

665
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,421
And now we can send her home.

666
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,992
<i>With some help, of course.</i>

667
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:57,938
Julia has told you she's pregnant?

668
00:49:58,442 --> 00:49:59,739
Yes.

669
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:01,674
It's fantastic.

670
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:03,507
Yes.

671
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:06,348
Sebastian?

672
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:14,253
I don't know how to put this.

673
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,350
Though, maybe it is very simple.

674
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:21,928
You may be the biggest bastard
I have ever met.

675
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:23,499
You disgust me.

676
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:26,633
<i>What?</i>

677
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:27,829
How dare you?

678
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,664
You pervert.

679
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,082
<i>Where are you going?</i>

680
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,421
I can explain.

681
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:53,827
<i>What is there to explain?</i>

682
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,801
It all just happened.
The misunderstanding.

683
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,569
But what has happened
between us...

684
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:07,033
...the feeling is real.

685
00:51:07,144 --> 00:51:08,668
- The feeling is real?
- Yes.

686
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:12,237
I don't know what happened in Hanoi
or what she went through.

687
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:19,178
But we'll figure it all out together.
And I'll tell her who I really am.

688
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:21,382
<i>What the hell are you on about?</i>

689
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,121
Screwing your girlfriend
while she's in a coma!

690
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,094
That's disgusting!

691
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:34,228
<i>What?</i>

692
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,431
<i>We test her urine every day.
We know precisely when it happened.</i>

693
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:40,101
She was in a coma, damn it!

694
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,615
Perhaps you should check
on who's been running around...

695
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:49,777
Are you insinuating that we go round
shagging the patients?

696
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:52,214
I'm trying to tell you...

697
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:55,553
Forget it!

698
00:51:55,993 --> 00:52:01,158
I am only covering up
for you for her sake.

699
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:07,170
I insist that you see a psychiatrist.
Here's a phone number.

700
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:11,273
Give them my regards
and tell them it is urgent.

701
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,899
- Dichmann!
- Shut up.

702
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,808
- Dichmann!
- Shut up!

703
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:26,882
Hey!

704
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,023
Hey!

705
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:57,810
You want a search of the hospital
for a man in bandages?

706
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,912
- Yes, something is not right.
- Yes, you shagged her.

707
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:01,581
Not till later.

708
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:03,626
So somebody
must have mixed up the samples.

709
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:06,161
How can you be sure
Sebastian is dead?

710
00:53:06,263 --> 00:53:08,094
They found the corpse,
brought him in,

711
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:09,529
and filled in a death certificate.

712
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:10,691
Here it is.

713
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:13,326
<i>- Where did you get it?
- They faxed it.</i>

714
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:15,166
I wanted to be sure.

715
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:16,762
If you're running around
with his name,

716
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:19,035
you don't want anyone
after your head, do you?

717
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:21,576
There's a short translation
on the back.

718
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:24,946
He was shot in the chest.

719
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,743
And transported to hospital

720
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,478
where he was declared
dead on arrival.

721
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:32,815
Keep it. It's a present.

722
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:35,756
He seems to have been
one of those losers

723
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:39,226
who goes backpacking
to get off with girls.

724
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:41,559
He gets a job at a bar in Pattaya,

725
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,997
runs out of cash, needs money
for coke or what's even worse.

726
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:48,231
He meets some low-life Chinese
and makes a buck ferrying suitcases

727
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:49,327
for them from Beijing to Sydney.

728
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,997
Does Hanoi know that?

729
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,166
Maybe that's what Julia did too?

730
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,472
She had money.

731
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:57,411
Maybe she was getting
her own back on her dad.

732
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:59,038
The Hearst syndrome?

733
00:53:59,149 --> 00:54:00,776
They want to talk to her.

734
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:02,380
Maybe it was them who phoned?

735
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:05,546
<i>Why? She doesn't know anything.</i>

736
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,549
How's Mette feeling?

737
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:12,884
Hellish.

738
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:17,263
Remember back at school?

739
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:19,892
Those leather bracelets?

740
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:25,407
<i>We wrote the names of the girls
we wanted to get off with.</i>

741
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:27,909
Yes, you had Lise.
I had Joan.

742
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:29,740
Until we swapped.
They never knew.

743
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:32,280
<i>- We just swapped.
- Yes.</i>

744
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:34,077
Everything was simpler then.

745
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:44,584
If you don't want Mette,
I'll have Mette.

746
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:50,858
<i>- Are you threatening me?
- With what?</i>

747
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:51,727
Mette is my wife.

748
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:54,804
That's right. Fuck feelings.

749
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,339
- Make up your mind.
- Fuck you!

750
00:54:57,441 --> 00:54:58,806
<i>Whom do you have feelings for?</i>

751
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:03,278
Fuck you back, Jonas.
I'll tell you whom I feel for.

752
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,714
For the poor sods I see
in silly dead positions every day

753
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:10,582
due to something in their love lives.

754
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:14,418
Hurt, hatred, cheating, rage.

755
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:17,618
You know why that jerk took out
his whole family the other day?

756
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,889
His wife kicked him out.

757
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:21,294
Then she got custody of the kids.

758
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:26,301
And then she shagged his best mate.
Is he mad or is she?

759
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:26,926
I don't know.

760
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:30,930
I do not know, Jonas.

761
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:33,709
I believe in the Muslim way.

762
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:38,075
Do it for practical reasons.
Do it to have children.

763
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:42,481
Do it for a camel.
Draw up a contract.

764
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:48,990
Fuck the love bit.

765
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:58,523
- Are we feeling cynical today?
- And you're a pathetic romantic.

766
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:01,195
Like this stupid cow.

767
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:03,602
She left a note.

768
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:12,672
"Tell everyone
that if Johnny hadn't left me

769
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:16,651
I'd still be dancing
among the living. "

770
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:23,190
Nine spelling mistakes
in one sentence.

771
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:29,031
Couldn't you at least
have got the spelling right?

772
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:32,363
Are dyslexia
and unrequited love infectious?

773
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:37,873
<i>- Henriques?
- What?</i>

774
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:39,498
<i>Where is love actually located?</i>

775
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,245
Know what?
It's right here.

776
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:52,853
In the area where pleasure
meets association.

777
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:54,651
There.

778
00:56:54,758 --> 00:57:01,095
That's where desire, a progressive
instinct, crosses harmony,

779
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:04,463
its opposite, the need for peace.

780
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:06,468
Two completely
irreconcilable commodities.

781
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,198
That's why the result is always hell.

782
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:14,573
Unfortunately, it can't be excised
without inflicting greater handicaps.

783
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:17,010
Your two lovely kids...

784
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:20,546
<i>What will become of them?</i>

785
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,787
Know what?

786
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,753
I make myself sick.

787
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:35,828
But must life go on hold?
Until one's kids have left home?

788
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,461
Is that the kind
of father Klara and Frederik

789
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:42,561
will have to grow up with?

790
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:45,231
Hey, are you two
coming down for lunch?

791
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:48,243
It's heart casserole today.

792
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:51,676
Go on ahead.
I'll be right with you.

793
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:55,240
<i>Where do they get the hearts from?
Just asking.</i>

794
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,744
<i>We've run out of everything.</i>

795
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:31,881
<i>What?</i>

796
00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:34,388
Practically everything.

797
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:38,192
Do you remember
if we're short of toilet paper?

798
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:42,657
<i>Wake up! Toilet paper!</i>

799
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:44,728
Jonas!

800
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:47,497
Please!

801
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:52,564
Don't spoil our morning.

802
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:55,938
Make an effort.

803
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:01,083
Mette...

804
01:01:12,148 --> 01:01:14,582
<i>Where did you get to?</i>

805
01:01:17,187 --> 01:01:19,052
I can't do it.

806
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:21,418
Do what?

807
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:23,253
This.

808
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,860
<i>Would you rather shop elsewhere?</i>

809
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:31,594
I'm sorry.

810
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,999
Is that alcohol I smell?

811
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:40,505
<i>We're good together in many ways,
but it's not enough.</i>

812
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,578
<i>What are you saying?</i>

813
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:44,306
I can't take it anymore.

814
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:47,906
One day we'll die.
One day we'll have gone from here.

815
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:52,651
<i>What are you on about?</i>

816
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:54,690
This.

817
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:57,885
You can't take what?

818
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:02,059
Everything, Mette, everything.

819
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:08,531
Are you leaving me?

820
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,605
Is this a good place for it?

821
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:17,236
No place is good for it.

822
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:20,744
- Are you crazy?
- Everything is no more than so-so.

823
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:24,018
But life is more
than Saturday shopping.

824
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,917
- Pull yourself together!
- I want more than that.

825
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,793
Is it her?

826
01:02:36,933 --> 01:02:40,198
You are destroying our lives.

827
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:44,540
Destroying our lives!

828
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:03,409
And finally one day you announced
with steely determination,

829
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,617
"I'll never find a husband
in this poky little country. "

830
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:15,361
"I'll have to get out there
and look for one. "

831
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:17,057
Because, of course, you wanted
to find a man.

832
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:18,259
Obviously.

833
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:20,563
You'd made up your mind.

834
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,831
And what kind of man?

835
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:30,107
Not just any man: A normal man!

836
01:04:30,213 --> 01:04:36,152
The first time we saw Sebastian
we thought, "This can't be Sebastian. "

837
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:43,624
He wasn't a rock climber
or a drug dealer or crazy in any way.

838
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:46,490
No, he was completely normal.

839
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:48,393
Thank you, Sebastian.

840
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:56,098
For being so wonderfully courteous,
kind, ordinary, and normal.

841
01:04:56,206 --> 01:04:59,175
Thanks, Sebastian.

842
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:03,979
Cheers!

843
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:10,415
<i>The setting might have been false,
but the feeling was real.</i>

844
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,250
<i>Reality was far off.</i>

845
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:17,053
<i>I doubted
if it would ever come back.</i>

846
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,094
<i>Every day postponed the day
I would tell Julia the truth.</i>

847
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:25,698
<i>And finally it no longer mattered,</i>

848
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:32,630
<i>for Sebastian's face took hold
and Jonas disappeared.</i>

849
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,363
You didn't cash that bank check.

850
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:03,003
<i>What check?</i>

851
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,035
You are silly.

852
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:41,301
This must be the day God created
as the prototype for all good days.

853
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,409
How about we make a baby today?

854
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:54,849
<i>We've known each other for...</i>

855
01:06:54,957 --> 01:06:59,417
Forever.

856
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,059
Only forever?

857
01:07:03,132 --> 01:07:04,565
Hey?

858
01:08:56,379 --> 01:08:59,837
You'll enjoy the cottage.

859
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,944
You are in no state to go anywhere.

860
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:05,782
<i>Whether it's a cottage or not.</i>

861
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:08,413
I don't think you should go yet.

862
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,157
<i>We'll cope.</i>

863
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:14,195
There's a lot to cope with.

864
01:09:14,797 --> 01:09:16,264
It's nice and peaceful.

865
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:19,499
And you can phone.

866
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:21,126
It's only an hour away.

867
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:24,502
Quite so. Just an hour.

868
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:43,082
Julia...

869
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:47,860
I love you.

870
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:52,066
Nothing can part us.

871
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:57,036
<i>Nothing can part us.
Not even death.</i>

872
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,258
I had a weird dream last night.

873
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:52,827
I was having a swim.
A whale came along.

874
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:57,856
It opened its mouth to swallow me.

875
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:00,367
But standing on its tongue
was an old man

876
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:07,432
with a Ho Chí Minh beard,
shouting, "Look out! Look out!"

877
01:11:08,744 --> 01:11:11,679
But it wasn't Ho Chí Minh.

878
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:16,878
Because his T-shirt
had his name on: Jonah.

879
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,654
I thought, why is Jonas
in the whale called Jonah?

880
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:24,248
I don't know any Jonases.

881
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:27,692
And why Ho Chí Minh?

882
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:31,122
Yes, why?

883
01:11:32,268 --> 01:11:36,136
"Jonah" backwards spells "Hanoi".

884
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,540
Have you ever hit me?

885
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:45,104
No.

886
01:11:47,383 --> 01:11:49,578
Have we ever had a fight?

887
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:50,617
No. No.

888
01:11:53,756 --> 01:11:57,453
I'll get a rug. And some tea.

889
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:44,098
<i>You have six new messages.</i>

890
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:46,674
<i>The first new message:</i>

891
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:49,244
<i>Hi, it's me.
Call me. Now.</i>

892
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:54,679
<i>Where are you?
Call me.</i>

893
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:59,720
<i>Jonas, goddamn it!
This is bad.</i>

894
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:02,052
<i>I've got to talk to you.</i>

895
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:08,790
<i>I fingerprinted that wheelchair,</i>

896
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:13,665
<i>the one you said
the Bandaged Man was in.</i>

897
01:13:13,903 --> 01:13:15,894
<i>The prints belong
to Sebastian Christersson.</i>

898
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:19,441
<i>Call me!</i>

899
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,539
I am dead.

900
01:13:24,146 --> 01:13:29,345
Do you understand?
I am dead.

901
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:31,509
<i>I got onto Hanoi.</i>

902
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:37,525
<i>I traced him to an apartment hotel
in Copenhagen.</i>

903
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:45,291
<i>I'm going to pull him in and find out
what the heck is going on.</i>

904
01:13:45,401 --> 01:13:48,336
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

905
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:34,580
- Hi.
- Hi.

906
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,574
Is Julia in?

907
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:39,180
<i>What do you want?</i>

908
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:42,880
I am her boyfriend.

909
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:44,459
Sebastian.

910
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,558
Is she in?

911
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:50,632
No.

912
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:58,774
Doesn't the sign say Castlund?

913
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:01,138
There's no Julia here.

914
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:03,174
Sebastian!

915
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:12,411
Julia?

916
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,515
<i>Where is she?</i>

917
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,889
<i>We were down by the water.</i>

918
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:22,159
And you are...?

919
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:25,193
<i>When did you get here?</i>

920
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:28,196
It's a long story.

921
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:29,396
Sebastian?

922
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:39,737
Did you walk all the way?

923
01:15:39,849 --> 01:15:43,148
A visitor?

924
01:15:43,686 --> 01:15:45,381
<i>Who is it?</i>

925
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,365
You must be Julia.

926
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,736
Hi.

927
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:03,735
My name is...

928
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,108
...Jonas.

929
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:13,776
Jonas?

930
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:16,875
I just had a dream about you.

931
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:20,887
You did?

932
01:16:21,056 --> 01:16:22,387
Did you come by whale?

933
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:29,030
No, by car.
On my way to the mainland.

934
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:32,589
Sebastian told me you were here,
so I dropped in.

935
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:37,832
He's talked so much about you.

936
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:39,872
Are you in a rush?

937
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,437
No, not really.

938
01:16:43,545 --> 01:16:45,035
Stay for supper, then.

939
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:47,741
- I don't want to bother you.
- Of course you must.

940
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,082
Sebastian? Right?

941
01:16:55,624 --> 01:17:00,220
How can I refuse?
I've got some treats in the car.

942
01:17:03,532 --> 01:17:04,794
How lovely!

943
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:07,967
Is there a car?

944
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:10,101
Yes.

945
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:16,977
So there was a Jonas.

946
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:21,280
Yes.

947
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,621
Swallow!

948
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:32,989
Did you feel it?

949
01:17:33,095 --> 01:17:34,494
Disgusting!

950
01:17:35,998 --> 01:17:37,761
Do you always carry them
round in your trunk?

951
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:41,563
To be quite honest,
I actually had them in my trunk

952
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,035
to seduce an old girlfriend with.

953
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:46,835
And now we're eating her oysters
and drinking her champagne.

954
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:49,274
Aren't we lucky?

955
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:54,543
Oh, I bet you eat them every day.
Sebastian says your family is rich.

956
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:59,519
Does he? Hm?

957
01:17:59,621 --> 01:18:01,020
Are you completely blind?

958
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,887
I can sometimes make out shadows.

959
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,562
A penny for them, Sebastian?

960
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:18,162
<i>This is sick.
What's your game?</i>

961
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:19,900
<i>What do you mean?</i>

962
01:18:20,776 --> 01:18:23,574
Spit it out.

963
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:24,873
<i>What?</i>

964
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:28,716
The truth.

965
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,848
I am disappointed...

966
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:35,584
...that you haven't told Julia
about us.

967
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:37,522
Told me what?

968
01:18:39,028 --> 01:18:41,519
<i>We were lovers.</i>

969
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:43,764
Come off it...

970
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:45,026
Scout's honor.

971
01:18:45,134 --> 01:18:49,730
Sebastian and I were together
for three years.

972
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:53,604
Oh, we weren't gay gays,
we also loved women.

973
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:59,238
Really close friends, shall we say?

974
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:01,111
<i>Who cuddled.</i>

975
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:05,149
Jesus, Sebastian!

976
01:19:05,921 --> 01:19:09,049
Oh, Sebastian shagged
anything that moved.

977
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:10,989
Isn't that so, Sebastian?

978
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:14,358
<i>What a pig!</i>

979
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:16,124
I don't know a thing about you.

980
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,763
Exactly what do you want?

981
01:19:18,867 --> 01:19:22,928
Hey, I'm sorry, I just thought
you seemed so good together.

982
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:25,768
I didn't think you'd have secrets.

983
01:19:25,874 --> 01:19:27,899
<i>What is it that I don't know?</i>

984
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,137
I'm so sorry.

985
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:31,473
I do apologize.

986
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,048
You don't have to say sorry.

987
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:42,419
No, I know.

988
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:45,993
I'm to blame.

989
01:19:49,765 --> 01:19:51,130
Sorry.

990
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:57,195
Sorry, Jonas.

991
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:02,409
It's just so long
since we last saw each other.

992
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,241
<i>With good reason, of course.</i>

993
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:11,315
But it's great that the six years
didn't wear you down completely.

994
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:13,115
Yes, I can tell.

995
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:18,356
Prison would be hard on anyone.

996
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,553
The violence.

997
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,527
No love.

998
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,531
And love from the other prisoners
is not real love, is it?

999
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:31,162
Just rape?

1000
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:34,573
<i>What did you go to prison for?</i>

1001
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:37,640
Drugs.

1002
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:39,577
Jonas was a drugs runner.

1003
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:44,243
Bumming about South East Asia
with casual jobs

1004
01:20:44,353 --> 01:20:46,321
from Beijing to Sydney.

1005
01:20:46,955 --> 01:20:50,755
Always with someone after him.
Always with a suitcase.

1006
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:53,157
Jonas was always on the run.

1007
01:20:53,262 --> 01:20:54,786
Dear God.

1008
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:55,955
<i>Where did you fuck up?</i>

1009
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:58,225
Eh?

1010
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,732
<i>What went wrong?</i>

1011
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,536
<i>Why are you telling her this?</i>

1012
01:21:09,778 --> 01:21:12,975
Have I insulted you?

1013
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:15,844
<i>Why are you telling her I did time?</i>

1014
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:18,549
Sebastian, what is this?

1015
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:24,217
I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn.

1016
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,627
I could tell immediately

1017
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:31,790
that I wasn't especially
welcome today.

1018
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:36,030
It was only because Julia insisted.

1019
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:42,473
I'd better go.

1020
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:44,011
Sebastian, what is going on?

1021
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:45,101
Just what do you want?

1022
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:48,308
Julia, I'm going.

1023
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:51,648
Sebastian and I have had
a few issues...

1024
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:53,846
Sit down.

1025
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:55,423
<i>What do you want?</i>

1026
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:58,118
Have you heard from Frank?

1027
01:21:58,227 --> 01:21:59,125
Frank?

1028
01:21:59,228 --> 01:22:01,560
Have you heard from Frank?

1029
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:04,597
I don't know who Frank is.

1030
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:08,295
<i>What happened in Hanoi?</i>

1031
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:09,802
I don't know...

1032
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:10,894
<i>What happened in Hanoi?</i>

1033
01:22:11,006 --> 01:22:12,200
You want to know?

1034
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:13,604
Yes, I'd very much like
to hear about it.

1035
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:17,611
I have no idea, and I have no idea
what we are talking about.

1036
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:19,578
Tell us what happened
in Hanoi, right!

1037
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:20,739
Stop it!

1038
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:24,276
Go for a walk.

1039
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:28,120
Buy some cigarettes, anything.

1040
01:22:29,258 --> 01:22:31,522
Yes.

1041
01:22:31,627 --> 01:22:34,289
Yes, a breath of air might be
a good idea

1042
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:37,024
when you're in such a state.

1043
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:39,225
To cool you down.

1044
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,001
Know what, if you drive,
you'd better take my car.

1045
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:49,407
It's blocking the driveway.

1046
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:51,877
If you can be bothered to drive
such an old wreck.

1047
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:00,548
<i>Will you be all right?</i>

1048
01:23:00,656 --> 01:23:02,419
I'll be fine.

1049
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:22,034
<i>Frank here.</i>

1050
01:23:22,144 --> 01:23:24,874
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

1051
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:29,747
Frank, it's me. He's here.
It's absolutely crazy.

1052
01:23:29,851 --> 01:23:32,911
I don't know what he wants.
I am by the phone.

1053
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:34,852
Call me.

1054
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,561
That was stupid of me.

1055
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:49,769
You told the truth.

1056
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:51,600
Me and my big mouth.

1057
01:23:51,707 --> 01:23:54,369
You know how he loses his temper.

1058
01:23:56,945 --> 01:23:59,880
But he's changed incredibly.

1059
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,683
Has he?

1060
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:10,649
Sebastian has so many emotions.

1061
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,862
I think he is the most
sensitive person I have ever met.

1062
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:20,696
But sometimes things
get too much for him.

1063
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:24,902
His love turns to...

1064
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,270
...madness.

1065
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:34,044
Do you know anything
about his exes?

1066
01:24:36,952 --> 01:24:39,648
To be perfectly honest with you,
I don't feel comfortable with this.

1067
01:24:39,755 --> 01:24:43,987
I don't like it,
but I'd rather tell the truth.

1068
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:49,291
Do you ever feel Sebastian
is concealing stuff?

1069
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:53,029
Yes.

1070
01:24:55,237 --> 01:24:57,535
You don't remember a thing?

1071
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:58,765
No.

1072
01:25:00,742 --> 01:25:03,370
He claims Asia was fantastic
when you were out there.

1073
01:25:03,478 --> 01:25:05,309
<i>Wasn't it?</i>

1074
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:09,441
Julia...

1075
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:14,881
...I was not on my way anywhere.

1076
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:20,591
I rushed up here the moment I heard
you were back with Sebastian.

1077
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:22,519
Go on.

1078
01:25:23,765 --> 01:25:26,928
He was off his head
when he called me from Hanoi.

1079
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:32,096
I don't know whether it was the acid,
but he was desperate.

1080
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:38,338
Julia, Sebastian was the one carrying
a suitcase round Southeast Asia.

1081
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:42,611
He worked for some
really vicious people.

1082
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:45,880
He was smuggling diamonds,
but it went wrong.

1083
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:50,150
And you only cheat the triads once.

1084
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:55,852
<i>This is Frank's
answering machine.</i>

1085
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:57,295
<i>Why didn't we escape?</i>

1086
01:25:57,399 --> 01:25:58,593
He was doomed.

1087
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:02,666
His only way out was as a corpse.

1088
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,534
<i>What happened?</i>

1089
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,938
You were going to die together.

1090
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:23,856
You've got to get us out of here.

1091
01:26:25,694 --> 01:26:26,820
Do you mean that?

1092
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,798
I am with the man I got away from!

1093
01:26:36,204 --> 01:26:37,831
Yes.

1094
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:40,430
You've got to help me.

1095
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:48,045
<i>Calling Frank</i>

1096
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:05,958
<i>This is Frank...</i>

1097
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:33,155
<i>This is Frank's answering machine.
Leave a message.</i>

1098
01:27:38,867 --> 01:27:43,167
I don't get it.
Did he tell you about Hanoi?

1099
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:44,260
You were at a hotel.

1100
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:48,299
You left him there.

1101
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:54,638
I keep seeing a door.

1102
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,278
I am walking towards it.

1103
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:02,521
- I mustn't go through it!
- You've got to go back.

1104
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:05,024
Through that door.

1105
01:28:06,428 --> 01:28:10,660
You've got to go into the room.

1106
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,818
They'll kill us!

1107
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:37,756
- Give them what they want.
- It's too late.

1108
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:39,850
It's too late, too late.

1109
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:42,759
Let me go!

1110
01:28:49,938 --> 01:28:52,133
At least we are together.

1111
01:29:08,256 --> 01:29:11,157
<i>No, no, no!
What are you doing?</i>

1112
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:14,695
Don't you love me?

1113
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:20,397
I want you to tell me you love me.

1114
01:29:22,737 --> 01:29:27,071
I want you to tell me you love me.

1115
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:32,238
I want you to tell me you love me.

1116
01:29:34,349 --> 01:29:36,840
I love you. I love you.

1117
01:29:40,889 --> 01:29:43,881
Orpheus loves you, Eurydice.

1118
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:49,586
<i>We'll get away from all this.</i>

1119
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:54,497
But I mustn't turn round.

1120
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:03,406
He just wants to see
it is her following him.

1121
01:30:04,412 --> 01:30:07,973
And so she ends up back
in the Kingdom of Death.

1122
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:14,183
And that's why they can only
be together in death.

1123
01:30:15,423 --> 01:30:17,015
Listen!

1124
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:24,658
Orpheus must die first.
If they're to be reunited.

1125
01:30:28,336 --> 01:30:31,328
Orpheus must die first.

1126
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:36,039
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

1127
01:30:36,711 --> 01:30:38,406
I love you, Orpheus.

1128
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:45,375
If you enter the Kingdom of Death,
I will follow you.

1129
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:46,385
I promise.

1130
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:48,653
I promise.

1131
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:50,448
I promise.

1132
01:30:51,993 --> 01:31:00,298
You know I love you.

1133
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:05,168
You promise you'll follow?
You promise you'll follow?

1134
01:31:05,273 --> 01:31:06,672
I promise.

1135
01:31:19,621 --> 01:31:24,456
Orpheus should never
have looked back.

1136
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:28,686
You didn't want him.

1137
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:31,789
Can you imagine how that felt?

1138
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:36,269
Orpheus fought like fury
to reach Eurydice,

1139
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,431
and when he finally made it,
there they all were, laughing.

1140
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:44,801
"Eurydice? No, she isn't here.
She has found someone else. "

1141
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:51,851
Come on.

1142
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:54,617
Let's go outside and finish this.

1143
01:32:27,055 --> 01:32:28,317
Sebastian!

1144
01:32:29,757 --> 01:32:31,281
Sebastian!

1145
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:35,057
Sebastian!

1146
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:52,877
<i>What are you playing at, Jonas?</i>

1147
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,840
You can see?

1148
01:34:32,046 --> 01:34:34,640
<i>Who are you?</i>

1149
01:35:41,349 --> 01:35:43,579
Have you started smoking again?

1150
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:48,319
<i>What about the children?</i>

1151
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:50,948
I only smoke under the hood.

1152
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:53,619
I'm very careful.

1153
01:35:57,498 --> 01:36:00,126
- May I have one?
- Yes.

1154
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:17,741
- How's the new car?
- Perfect.

1155
01:36:21,155 --> 01:36:24,147
I told you we'd need two cars.

1156
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:31,762
I am really sorry.

1157
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:38,130
I don't know how it got to be
such a mess.

1158
01:36:38,339 --> 01:36:41,775
It just happened.

1159
01:36:43,444 --> 01:36:46,436
The earth vanished
beneath my feet.

1160
01:36:50,585 --> 01:36:51,950
I'm not moaning.

1161
01:36:56,324 --> 01:36:58,986
But I landed very hard.

1162
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:05,766
You always did dream of flying.

1163
01:37:06,734 --> 01:37:07,928
Yes.

1164
01:37:08,035 --> 01:37:10,128
<i>Who doesn't?</i>

1165
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:21,444
I miss Frank.

1166
01:37:24,485 --> 01:37:31,914
Maybe he was mad,
but you could see his madness.

1167
01:37:34,595 --> 01:37:36,028
Yes.

1168
01:37:45,072 --> 01:37:46,972
Do you want to see the children?

1169
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,190
<i>Wait.</i>

1170
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,836
Take this damned suitcase
with you.

1171
01:38:22,944 --> 01:38:25,105
Bad karma.

1172
01:38:37,191 --> 01:38:39,182
<i>When will you be back?</i>

1173
01:38:40,094 --> 01:38:41,994
I'll call you.

1174
01:38:45,266 --> 01:38:49,032
<i>I was on my way away,
but nevertheless on my way home.</i>

1175
01:38:50,671 --> 01:38:52,798
<i>It was a good evening.</i>

1176
01:38:52,974 --> 01:38:56,876
<i>Not a Hollywood ending,
but it would do.</i>

1177
01:38:57,845 --> 01:38:59,972
<i>Like the place we live.</i>

1178
01:39:01,649 --> 01:39:03,708
<i>Not much goes on there.</i>

1179
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:09,283
<i>But what happens
happened yesterday,</i>

1180
01:39:09,924 --> 01:39:13,291
<i>and luckily
it will happen tomorrow too.</i>

1181
01:39:13,394 --> 01:39:14,554
Sebastian!

1182
01:39:17,064 --> 01:39:18,224
Sebastian!

1183
01:39:18,532 --> 01:39:19,590
<i>Cozy.</i>

1184
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,531
<i>And nice.</i>

1185
01:40:10,818 --> 01:40:12,979
<i>Here I lie.</i>

1186
01:40:15,423 --> 01:40:18,722
<i>The rain is falling on my face.</i>

1187
01:40:20,094 --> 01:40:22,358
<i>But I don't feel a thing.</i>

1188
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:28,031
<i>In a moment they'll bring white tape
to mark out my profile.</i>

1189
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:36,098
<i>A good shot:
The victim in the rain.</i>

1190
01:40:38,012 --> 01:40:40,412
<i>Direct flash.</i>

1191
01:40:42,249 --> 01:40:44,149
<i>Razor sharp.</i>

1192
01:40:46,354 --> 01:40:48,652
<i>The woman.</i>

1193
01:40:49,256 --> 01:40:54,125
<i>There always has to be a woman.</i>
