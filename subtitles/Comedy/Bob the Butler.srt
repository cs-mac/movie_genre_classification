1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,930
- I am the matriarch
of a great American family

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,925
taking on the ultimate challenge:

3
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,535
The perfect family meal.

4
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,527
- I understand, Mama Clara.
- Working in a small takeout franchise

5
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:14,672
is traditionally a gateway
to bigger and better things.

6
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,628
- In understand, Mama Clara.
- When you create synergies,

7
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:19,773
- you solve problems.
- I understand, Mama Clara.

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,037
- But that is what happens
when I go to the bathroom

9
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:24,683
and leave you in charge
of the french fries.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,715
Well, give me another chance.

11
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,132
- Ahhh!
- Give your Uncle Bob another chance.

12
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,318
Bob, you're no uncle
and I'm no mama.

13
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:34,195
Cute names are company policy,
that's all!

14
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:36,304
Just feel-good stuff
so they can pay you less.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,299
- But we're family!
- Look around!

16
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:39,833
- UH!
- Ohhhh!

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,983
- Dad!

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,940
- Ahhhhh!
- You okay?

19
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:44,205
- Dad!

20
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:47,734
- We're family!
- This is my real father, Bob!

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,077
There's a difference!

22
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:07,525
Time was drifted
This rock had got to roll

23
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,900
So I hit the road
and made my getaway

24
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:13,777
Restless feeling

25
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:17,113
- Really got a hold
- Sorry!

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,028
I started searching
for a better way

27
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:26,204
But I kept on looking for a sign
in the middle of the night

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,660
But I couldn't see the light

29
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:30,767
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

30
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:32,148
Ahhhhh!

31
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,677
To take me through the night

32
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:37,710
- I couldn't get it right
- Help!

33
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:40,087
Help!
I couldn't get it right

34
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:43,502
- Grab on to this rope here!

35
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:44,882
Pull it.

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,068
Ahhhh!
L.A. Fever

37
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,252
Made me feel alright
Ah!

38
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,934
But I must admit
it got the best of me

39
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:55,199
Hi, people.

40
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:58,344
Getting down so deep
I could have drowned

41
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,764
Oh, save the fishes!
Save the fishes!

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Now I can't get back
the way I used to be

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,739
But I kept on looking for a sign
in the middle of the night

44
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:13,494
But I couldn't see the light
no I couldn't see the light

45
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:18,826
To take me
through the night-ight-ight

46
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:22,124
Couldn't get it right
I'm an astronaut, I'm a ballerina!

47
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,195
I'm an astronaut, I'm a ballerina!

48
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,074
Shave, shave, shave...
- Ahhhh!

49
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:41,379
- Sorry.

50
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,372
New York City

51
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:46,786
Took me with the tide

52
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:50,046
And I nearly died
from hospitality

53
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,884
Left me stranded

54
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,531
Took away my pride

55
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:59,444
Just another no-account fatality

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,936
Ahhhh!
- Oh.

57
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,582
Looking for a sign
in the middle of the night

58
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,076
But I couldn't see the light

59
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:09,607
No I couldn't see the light

60
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,909
- Huh, I'm gonna need
a bigger board.

61
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:16,012
It's not a big deal, Rascal.

62
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:17,892
We're only on the Bs, remember.

63
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,538
Got all this to go.

64
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,453
Okay, so we did burger assistant.
Next up, we have...

65
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,179
business consulting.

66
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,557
Butcher?

67
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:30,357
Oh, whoa.
Hey, listen to this.

68
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:31,814
Listen.

69
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:35,266
"Cosmopolitan Butler School

70
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,759
Become part of a family
in 5 days"

71
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,294
Rascal,

72
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,285
We're going butling.

73
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,676
- Do you think
you canna be a Lassie?

74
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:12,931
Nine-thirty?

75
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,497
- Good morning, students.

76
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,722
Good morning, sir.

77
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,911
- Two lines, please.

78
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:22,557
Chop, chop!

79
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:23,899
My name is Butler.

80
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:27,274
I'm a born butler
in all senses of the phrase.

81
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,538
I come from a long line of butlers.

82
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,034
In only five days,

83
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,949
you will each receive
a certificate of competence

84
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,976
to wait on any family
on this side of the pond.

85
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:39,817
For those that are interested,

86
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:43,116
the full English course
lasts a further 17 years.

87
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,649
Standards are slightly higher.

88
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:47,564
So, what does a butler...

89
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,789
do? Hmm?

90
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,206
Answer: Everything.

91
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:55,044
He must cook, clean,
tend the garden,

92
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,920
groom the horses,
write letters, iron shirts.

93
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,719
Arrange appointments,
greet guests, run baths,

94
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:04,326
buy groceries, pack cases,
unpack cases,

95
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:06,780
make reservations,
cancel reservations

96
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:10,309
and still find time
to be a confidant.

97
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,801
Understood?
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:13,876
- Yes, sir!

99
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:17,826
- Grooming is crucial to the role.

100
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:24,499
Substantial facial hair
is quite unacceptable.

101
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,264
Rabbi,
how would you serve soup?

102
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,261
- But really...

103
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,793
- It goes, or you go.

104
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:30,905
- Oh.

105
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,623
- Butlers must be immaculately dressed.

106
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:39,918
So what's your excuse,
you miserable heap of mess?

107
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:42,871
- This is me tidy.
- Not in my book.

108
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:46,055
Do you possess
any offensively tasteless tattoos

109
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,318
perpetrated in a drunken haze?

110
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,309
- No.

111
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,726
- Any piercings of body parts?

112
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:55,989
- I do have a series
of small holes in my tongue

113
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:56,986
from when I was six.

114
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,057
My cousin, he gave me
a black-sea-urchin thing

115
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,706
and told me
it was a chocolate muffin.

116
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:04,311
I think they've...

117
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,501
grown over.

118
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,495
- Show me your nipples.

119
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:10,986
- My nipples?

120
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,481
- Yes, your nipples.

121
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:19,423
Hmm...

122
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,261
You can't blame a man for asking.

123
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,755
Frankly, you look the weird sort.

124
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,481
- I'm weird?

125
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,655
- Come on, come on!

126
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:50,721
Tess! Tess!

127
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,586
This elevator has already left.

128
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,539
Ssstop that!
You're causing a delay.

129
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,380
- I have an important meeting.
- If was so important,

130
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,298
you would've left earlier,
like I did.

131
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,909
- Mother, you're embarrassing us.

132
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,405
- Stop.

133
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,936
- Ow.

134
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,544
Witch!
- That's a rude person.

135
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,618
- Suck-up.

136
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,106
- Any news, Judith?
- Not yet.

137
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,410
- Okay.

138
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:21,749
Kate.

139
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:26,467
All right, go.
- Mr. Dickens called.

140
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:27,810
Urgent.
- Skip. Next.

141
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:30,494
Next, the investment
conference call. Urgent.

142
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:31,415
- Save. Next.

143
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,103
- Jacques called about dinner
on Monday.

144
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,058
- Confirm. Eight o'clock.

145
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,781
- It's them.

146
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,390
- Okay. Put 'em through.

147
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,425
- Good luck.

148
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:46,603
- A word or two about money.

149
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,096
Money makes the world go round,
doesn't it?

150
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,052
Yes, Mr. Butler.
- Balderdash.

151
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,356
Trust, not money.

152
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,463
That's what makes
the world go round.

153
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,995
If I haven't been able to produce

154
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:01,216
at least one trustworthy butler
out of this course,

155
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:03,748
then I've wasted my time.
- Ah-ah!

156
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,895
Sorry. Sorry!

157
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,008
- As I've made clear,

158
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:09,577
you will be in complete control
of the household.

159
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:12,953
However, you will be treated
by all other members of the household

160
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,947
as if you were slightly less significant

161
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:16,980
than a piece of used toilet paper.

162
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:21,428
To simulate this, I've devised
a rather amusing little exercise.

163
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:29,253
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?

164
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,708
- I'm getting no pleasure from it
whatsoever!

165
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,702
- Yeah, right.

166
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,776
- Bull'seye!

167
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:36,809
- Now, look,

168
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,647
open wide for one teeny,

169
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:42,370
weeny little baked bean,

170
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,135
or I'll tell your mom.

171
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,590
- But I'll tell her you hit me.

172
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,548
- What?!

173
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,425
- I'll tell her you hit me
and pulled my hair.

174
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,720
Ahhhhh!
- Okay, leave the friggin' food.

175
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:56,178
- You swore!

176
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:59,515
You swore
in front of my little brother.

177
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:02,430
Can I watch MTV tonight?

178
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:05,537
- I will not be blackmailed
by you children.

179
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,415
- Mrs. Withington,
what happened?!

180
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,938
- Sorry, Miss Jamieson,
but they are the devil's seed!

181
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:29,432
- Oh, no,
they're just playing with you.

182
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,577
They're delightful children, really.
Undemeath all the horrible stuff.

183
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:36,527
Please, I promised Jacques
I would not let him down again.

184
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:37,831
- Ho-ho!
- Ah!

185
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:52,597
Babysitters...

186
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,608
- Hello?

187
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,142
- Bob the Babysitter?

188
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:06,098
- No, ma'am.
This is Bob the Butler.

189
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,479
- Now, look.

190
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:11,353
I definitely have this number down
for Bob the Babysitter.

191
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,884
- Well, that was
at least seven jobs back.

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,147
- But you were a babysitter once?

193
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,490
- Well, yes.

194
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:19,829
Ahem. Just once.
- Oh, please,

195
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:22,092
this is an emergency.
- One minute, please.

196
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,812
Rascal, damsel in distress.

197
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,497
May I have your leave?

198
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,453
Thank you, Master Rascal.

199
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:35,055
I'd be happy to.

200
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,154
- Oh... my.
Are you Bob?

201
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,918
- At your service.

202
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,180
- You-you have a piece of tomato
in your hair.

203
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,293
- Oh.

204
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,129
- Ew.

205
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,739
- Gone.

206
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,846
- Okay, well, um,
I want you to meet my children.

207
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,070
This is my daughter, Tess.

208
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:13,717
- Miss Tess. Hello.
Lovely name.

209
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,328
- My son, Bates.

210
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:16,977
- Mm. Master...

211
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,665
Bates.

212
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,314
Also lovely.

213
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,155
- Gross.
- What's gross?

214
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,267
- Okay.

215
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:27,794
Have to go,
so do me a favour and...

216
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,826
do not hurt him.

217
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:33,124
Bob, please don't sit on any
of the nice chairs unless you have to.

218
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:34,582
- Okay.

219
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,999
- What's gross?
- Never mind.

220
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,839
Good night, children.

221
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:41,447
- Good night, Mother.

222
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:43,174
Enjoy your romantic evening out.

223
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,554
Have fun!

224
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,219
- Don't forget the back ones, Master.

225
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,671
- Why do you call me Master?
- I'm studying to be a butler.

226
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:00,087
- I don't like it.

227
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:03,731
Master Bates.
It just feels wrong.

228
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,496
- Indeed.

229
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,107
How about I call you Bates?

230
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,901
- I like that.
- Yeah, just Bates.

231
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,704
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:17,424
- Miss Tess?
- Uh!

233
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:22,142
- Oh, no. Not again.

234
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,331
Water. Water!

235
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,662
Quick, quick, quick, quick...!

236
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,262
Oh, no.

237
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,307
Hmm. Mm...

238
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,828
Nice chair.

239
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,452
- Bates. You awake?

240
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,948
- When will Mom be back?

241
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,709
- I think Bob's a real find.
He's so stupid,

242
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,164
he didn't even tell me off
for smoking.

243
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,657
- Smoking kills. I read it.

244
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:12,999
- Sisters kill too,

245
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:15,262
so keep your mouth shut.

246
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,369
- He let me sleep
in my fireman costume.

247
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:19,788
- He's crazy.

248
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,361
- I like him
more than Mrs. Withington.

249
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,774
- Would you like
to have him back?

250
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,194
- Can we?

251
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,804
- Leave it to me.

252
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,842
- Thanks for a lovely evening.
- Ah, the pleasure was all mine.

253
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,831
- I'd invite you up—
- I know, the children will up

254
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:47,404
as usual.

255
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:48,938
- Omigod!
- What? What's wrong?

256
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:51,277
- The children's lights are all out!

257
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,249
What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

258
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:04,356
They've been good as gold.
- Oh, cut the BS.

259
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:06,811
What, are they bound and gagged
somewhere?

260
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,534
- You really should be congratulated,
ma'am,

261
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,836
on raising
such wondrous progeny.

262
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:13,944
Can I go now?

263
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,054
- Uh, normally, they're, uh...

264
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,008
a pain in the derriere.

265
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,654
I think here you say "brats. "

266
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:24,186
- Well, I never say "brats. "
- Well, I don't know

267
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:27,024
what you did,
but I'm impressed.

268
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:30,437
Jacques, will you pay Bob for me?

269
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:31,434
- Of course!

270
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,809
I'm, uh...

271
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:38,683
tipping you
very generously here.

272
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,406
I want you to know why.

273
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,976
Tonight, with the kids in bed,

274
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,587
all night,

275
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:49,269
I get to do
what Frenchmen love to do most...

276
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,571
- You gonna look in the mirror
for eight hours?

277
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,754
Thanks, Jack.

278
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,088
- This moming,
those of us that remain

279
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,194
will address the basic skills required
for a typical day,

280
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,266
starting with undressing the master.

281
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:07,104
Now, I shall need a volunteer.
Mr. Tree, if you please.

282
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,166
Jacket.

283
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:17,421
Tie.

284
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:22,024
Waistcoat. The vest, to you.

285
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:29,695
Shirt.

286
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,725
- Ah, come on,
haven't you got some kind of dummy?

287
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:35,179
- Dear boy, if you intend
to be a butler, you better get used

288
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:36,752
to naked old flesh.

289
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,823
- You sure this isn't a British thing?

290
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,546
I mean, most Americans
know how to dress themselves.

291
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:42,735
- On the contrary.

292
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,648
We are here to educate them
to do it better.

293
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:50,636
And to dress for the right occasion.
- Whoa!

294
00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:51,786
Yo, I'm outta here.

295
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,814
- Well, Bob,

296
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:57,233
you seem to be

297
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:59,726
the last one left.

298
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,376
- Mr. Butler,

299
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:02,910
I don't really know
if this is necessary.

300
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:07,091
I mean... I'll give 100 bucks
if you leave the rest on.

301
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,200
One-hundred and fifty.
A thousand!

302
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:10,811
Please stop there.

303
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:15,566
- Right.

304
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:17,024
Mr. Tree, let's get cracking, then.

305
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,016
Dress me.

306
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:23,660
- Bob, no! Nuh-uh.
- It's okay.

307
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:26,306
It's okay, Nico.
I don't wanna work here.

308
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:28,646
I can't stand the sight of blood.

309
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:29,988
All that screaming.

310
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:32,903
- You took the guy's earlobe off.
- Not on purpose.

311
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,166
Ah!
- You used to work here?

312
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:37,083
- Of course I used to work here.

313
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,270
"Barber" comes before "butler"
in the Yellow Pages.

314
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:40,919
- So how do you like it?

315
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,645
- Neat and tidy.

316
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,253
- As the man says.

317
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,938
- No beard.
- No beard?

318
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:49,703
- Butlers don't have beards.

319
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:51,466
- Butlers wear beards.

320
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:53,154
- No beard.
- Abit of beard.

321
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:54,765
- No beard at all.
- Itty-bit of beard?

322
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,108
- No beard whatever.

323
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:58,677
- Itsy-bit of beard?
- No.

324
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:01,515
Not even a little bitty-bitty-bitty-
weeny-bitty beard.

325
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,858
- Itty-bit of butler beard?
- Beardless.

326
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,200
- Itty-bit of butler beard?
- No beard!

327
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,770
- Itty-bit of butler beard,
itty-bit of butler beard,

328
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,113
itty-bit of butler bear.

329
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:11,181
Settled.
- So?

330
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:13,635
- Well, pretty much as it is.

331
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:19,925
- What do you expect to do, Bob,
if this doesn't work out?

332
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,878
- I'll probably move on
to the Cs. You know?

333
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,678
Camping guide,
carpet cleaner,

334
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,060
carwasher,

335
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,130
computer hacker.
- Extraordinary.

336
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:34,653
You seem to have such faith
in yourself...

337
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,492
where none is justified.

338
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,212
- Thanks, Mr. Butler.

339
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,473
- Well, well, well.

340
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,491
Agentleman's gentleman,

341
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:52,987
by George!

342
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:57,091
- Loving breaths...

343
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:58,970
of deep...

344
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,268
...acceptance.

345
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,518
- All right, can we speed it up,
please?

346
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:10,937
Look - ahem -

347
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:13,277
here's my needs analysis.
I think it'll save time.

348
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:14,810
- What are you saving time for?

349
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,230
Yourfamily?

350
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:20,027
But you don't even have time
to enjoy your kids. Or Jacques.

351
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:21,753
- Jack's not family.

352
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,824
- There's too much work.

353
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,933
I need more time.

354
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,890
- Remember your mantra.

355
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,805
- "I cannot organize the world...

356
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,530
blah-blah-blah. "

357
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:36,405
- Maybe you could work just as hard
and find someone

358
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:38,935
who brings the best
out of me and Bates.

359
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:41,313
- Tess, that is
a very sensible suggestion.

360
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,347
Do you have anyone in mind?

361
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,533
- Not really.

362
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,645
- Well...

363
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:50,710
I quite like the babysitter
we had last night.

364
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,395
- But Tess said he was freaky.

365
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,045
- He's too strict.

366
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:56,655
- He's way too strict.

367
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:59,187
- Definitely not him.
- Uh-uh.

368
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,290
- Well, it's not your call, children.

369
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,953
- What are we doing?

370
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,718
- Come on, come on, come on.

371
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:18,825
Up you get.

372
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,350
Standing still, Mr. Tree,

373
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,805
is highly prized in butler circles.

374
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:27,185
- Freak.

375
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,682
- Just get up.

376
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,514
- Tiny people down below...

377
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:42,680
- Good.

378
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,599
I want you to clear your mind

379
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:46,708
and relax.
- Relax?

380
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:49,777
You kidding me?
I'm standing inches

381
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,694
from certain death here.

382
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,570
- I'll tell you what,

383
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:58,560
think of the most beautiful thing
you've seen in the last 48 hours.

384
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:00,017
- Other than your ass?

385
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:02,664
- Now come on. You can do it.

386
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,118
I'm beginning
to have faith in you, Bob.

387
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,959
- Okay,

388
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,529
I've got it.
- What is it?

389
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:12,750
- It's a woman.
- Can you picture her?

390
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:17,622
- Yes.
- Excellent.

391
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,268
Hold that thought.

392
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:41,824
- Hey, kiddo, how was your day?

393
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,974
- Okay.
- Just okay?

394
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:46,925
Mine was pretty good.
Do you wanna hear about it?

395
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:49,571
- Does it have anything to do
with capital management?

396
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:51,067
- Yes.

397
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,524
- No.

398
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:03,379
It's polite to knock.

399
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:04,951
- It's bedtime, sweetheart.

400
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,485
- I haven't finished.

401
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:07,866
- Now. Please?

402
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:10,129
- No.

403
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:18,145
- Ah, that's just what I need.

404
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,290
Thank you.

405
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,707
Do you wanna hear about my day?

406
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:25,471
- Now?

407
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:30,534
Your mind is full of work and kids,
work and kids, work and kids.

408
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,950
That leaves little for me.

409
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,019
- I am trying to sell my business,
Jacques.

410
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,591
- For months, ma chérie.

411
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,355
But when?

412
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,119
- I'm thinking of hiring Bob.

413
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,999
- The babysitter?
- The butler.

414
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,637
- The children will live with him?
I'm joking.

415
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:51,130
- No, he'll live in the attic.

416
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:53,047
We'll have a babysitter
wheneverwe want.

417
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:55,809
- Perfect.

418
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,184
Can you hurry up in there?

419
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,256
You've been in there for hours.

420
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:03,250
- Almost finished.

421
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:11,841
- You'll tidy all this up?
- Yeah.

422
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:14,066
- Bates, stop that!
- Ah!

423
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:17,172
- It's a toilet bidet.
- What's a toilet bidet?

424
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:21,046
- It's like a fountain for your ass...
- Ask me later.

425
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,657
- Jack says he's here.

426
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:23,999
- The butler!

427
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,879
Now then, Robert—

428
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,221
- Actually, my name's Bob.

429
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,714
- Oh, well, Bob is short for Robert.

430
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,709
- Isn't Rob short for Robert?

431
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:33,474
- Yes.
- So then Bob

432
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,892
would be short for Bobert.

433
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,810
- Your name is Bobert?
- No.

434
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:37,922
Just Bob.
- Okay, then.

435
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:40,186
As long as we're satisfied
with first names,

436
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:41,604
can we continue?
- Of course.

437
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:43,331
Though I don't know your name.

438
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,747
Is it all right if I call you
Mistress Jamieson?

439
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:48,393
- No.

440
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,157
That sounds rather sordid,
doesn't it?

441
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:53,341
Perhaps you could
just call me Anne.

442
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:54,952
- Anne.

443
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,793
- Just Anne.

444
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:58,059
- Anne.

445
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,554
- Yes.

446
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:01,012
Anne.

447
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,584
- Et bien?
- Anne.

448
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:06,419
- Mr. Tree, how many children
do you have?

449
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,641
- Well, I don't have any children.

450
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:10,792
- But you said in the flyer

451
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,902
that you would take care
of the children like your own.

452
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:14,973
- Yeah, if I had some.

453
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:18,233
Ahem.
- But you did just recently attend

454
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,151
the Cosmopolitan Butler School?

455
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:21,646
- Is all tidy.

456
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:35,799
- Uh, how much do I owe you?

457
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,494
What did he say?

458
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:50,681
- Uh, he said
he'll drop the bill off next week.

459
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,936
- Um - ahem - Jacques

460
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:57,431
got me a wonderful present:

461
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:59,311
A state-of-the-art toilet.

462
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,381
- A toilet?

463
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,453
What a nice gift.

464
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:10,356
- My goodness, Bob,

465
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,118
I had no idea
that you were fluent in Japanese.

466
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:14,729
- I worked in the Asian market.

467
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:17,376
- Well, that's impressive.
- You sold stock?

468
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:18,603
- Stalks,

469
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,676
vegetables,

470
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:21,786
some strangely shaped fruits.

471
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:25,545
Horseshoe-shaped...

472
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:26,926
fruits.

473
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:30,876
- Uh, Bob, I would like
to go over a few specifics.

474
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:32,756
I colour-categorize my sponges.

475
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:34,673
- Hmm?
- Blue for bathroom, yellow for kitchen,

476
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:37,741
purple for general,
green for the outdoors, car included.

477
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,774
Please don't confuse them.
- Fine.

478
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,923
- No strange women in the house.
- Fine.

479
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:43,456
- No drugs. No pets.
- Fine.

480
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,451
- You allergic?

481
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:46,793
- They're unhygienic.

482
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,136
- Fine.

483
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,494
- So what do you think?
- He is very strange.

484
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,330
I don't understand
this Rob-Bob-Bobert business.

485
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:02,749
- Well, I suppose

486
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:04,398
we could always interview
other candidates.

487
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:07,466
- There are other candidates?
- No.

488
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:15,023
I hired an assistant once.
She seemed perfect,

489
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:17,477
she worked hard,
she did everything I told her to.

490
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,507
One lunchtime,
I saw her in the gym.

491
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,003
She had a shower

492
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,416
and then changed right back
into herworkout bra.

493
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,756
- I'm lost.

494
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,594
- I fired her on the spot,
of course.

495
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:31,668
- You fired her

496
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:33,663
because of her sweaty bra?

497
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,463
Do you think Bobert wears a bra?

498
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,533
- Oh, who knows.

499
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,451
But if it doesn't work out,
I'll change him.

500
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,448
- Okay.

501
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,516
- Ah... Bates!

502
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:01,776
- Sorry, Mom.

503
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:06,072
- I think you'll find
everything you need.

504
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:10,368
I'm sure it's not up
to your professional standards.

505
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,036
- It's...

506
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,762
white.

507
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:21,913
- Yeah.

508
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,250
Oh, I'm sorry it is such a mess.

509
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:32,306
I can indeed organize the world

510
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:48,300
- Hey, Rascal.

511
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:53,555
Home.

512
00:26:57,275 --> 00:26:58,541
We are robots!

513
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,267
We are monster robots!

514
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:02,031
I am Robot Man!

515
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:05,100
Get out of my way.
I am Computer Man...

516
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:08,168
- Aren't you a little old
to play with toys?

517
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:10,891
- Well, I don't usually
play with them, but...

518
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:13,615
I got these
when about your age and...

519
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:17,373
I figured I'd give them
to my own son one day.

520
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,790
- Didn't he want them?

521
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:31,948
- Ahem.

522
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,134
The children are in bed, ma'am.

523
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,052
- Oh, thank you, Bob.
Music to my ears.

524
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,200
- Is there anything else
I can do for you?

525
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:40,578
- No. Thank you.
I'll see you in the morning.

526
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:45,410
- I hope you don't mind,
but, um, I couldn't find any towels

527
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,868
for your bathroom.
- Mm, no.

528
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:48,402
I don't use them.

529
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:49,975
- Okay, then.

530
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:52,698
- They breed germs.
I have a body-dryer.

531
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:54,538
- A body-dryer?
- Yes.

532
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,226
- Like a hairdryer?

533
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:57,645
- Bigger.

534
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:59,793
Much more hygienic.

535
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,095
Did I mention the sponge system?

536
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:05,432
Blue for the bathroom...
- Purple, yellow, green.

537
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,540
- Oh. Well, good night, then.

538
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:12,373
- Good night.

539
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,502
- What's that smell?
- Cooking.

540
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:38,953
- Real food?
- Well, I guess Bob made us breakfast.

541
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,254
Where did you get that blouse?

542
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,015
- It's an old one.
- Yeah, like really old.

543
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:48,312
Like five years tool old.
It's way too small for you.

544
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:49,500
- Is not.
- Is.

545
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,840
- Is not.
- Let's have Bob decide.

546
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:52,990
Bob?

547
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,180
- Is not.
- Is.

548
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:56,558
- Yes, ma'am?
- Tess's blouse - indecently small,

549
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,245
or acceptable fashion?

550
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,432
- Sorry, Miss Tess.

551
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:09,905
- That's a lot of pancakes.

552
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,475
- It's more cost-effective
to prepare in bulk.

553
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:13,510
- They teach you

554
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,313
that bulk stuff at butler school?

555
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,924
- Actually, at the finest...

556
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:22,179
the finest cooking school
in the world.

557
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:23,405
- The Cordon Bleu.

558
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:25,247
- The U.S. Army.

559
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,896
- The army? Cool.

560
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,350
- Would you like some pancakes,
Miss Tess?

561
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:31,844
- Sure, make me out on 50 pounds.

562
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,378
That'll make me popular.
- Getting grounded

563
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:36,523
for being rude
will definitely make you popular.

564
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:44,347
- Miss Tess, I wanna prepare
a special dinner tonight.

565
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,997
Sort of an introduction.

566
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:48,106
What does your mother like?

567
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:52,364
- She likes anything she can eat quickly
so she can get back to work.

568
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,933
- You know what'd be good?
Aluau.

569
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:57,157
She loves the whole Hawaiian thing.

570
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:59,190
- A luau, huh?

571
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:02,105
- Pork?
- Okay, I'll look into that.

572
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:06,517
I knew a guy once,

573
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:09,662
he was kind of a nervous fellow.

574
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:10,812
Used to bite his nails.

575
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:12,922
One day,

576
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,992
he was so upset,
he ate his whole hand.

577
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:16,565
- He did not.
- By the time

578
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:19,557
we pulled him off, he'd chewed
all the way up to the elbows.

579
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:23,009
- That is stupid.
- That fellow has to wear a muzzle now.

580
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,351
A muzzle.

581
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:27,419
All because he couldn't talk
about his problems.

582
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:31,140
I don't know about that outfit,
Miss Tess.

583
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,807
Are you getting out?

584
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:42,722
- I've got basketball today.

585
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,637
- That's great.
I love basketball.

586
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:48,016
- You're not underfourfoot.

587
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:50,509
Ah...

588
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,465
- Hey.
- Hi.

589
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:58,141
Guess what.
- You joined the Britney Spears

590
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:00,519
fan club?
- My mom hired a butler.

591
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,092
- He looks

592
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:03,549
like he's from Transylvania.

593
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:05,084
- He's not the only one.

594
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:08,766
- They remind me
of the Addams Family.

595
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:12,907
- Sad, sad, sad.

596
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:59,202
- Helloooo.

597
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:04,226
Hellooooo.

598
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:05,531
Ahem.

599
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,634
Nice melons.

600
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:11,859
- Thank you.

601
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,083
Nice cucumber.

602
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,272
- Thanks.

603
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:18,647
- You.

604
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:21,562
You.

605
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,749
- You.
- You.

606
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:24,861
- You.

607
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,348
- You.

608
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:33,184
- You.

609
00:32:58,958 --> 00:32:59,994
- Ah!

610
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,486
Ladies you're damn right

611
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:04,213
Can't read a man's mind

612
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:07,664
We're living in two tribes
and heading for war

613
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:11,078
Whoo!
Nobody's perfect

614
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:13,494
We all gotta work it
but fellas we're worth it

615
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,448
So don't break the law
ah ah ah ah

616
00:33:16,524 --> 00:33:20,820
I'm just a love machine
feeding my fantasy

617
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,239
Give me a kiss or three

618
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:26,995
We just need a squeeze
instead of this negligee

619
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:31,138
What will the neighbours think

620
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:34,168
This time
come take my hand

621
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,200
Understand that you can

622
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:40,534
You're my man
and I need you tonight

623
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:44,523
Come make my dreams
honey hard as it seems

624
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,205
Loving me is as easy as pie

625
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,931
I'm just a love machine

626
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:54,994
Feeding my fantasy
give me a kiss or three

627
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,208
Ooh, yeah.

628
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:05,503
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

629
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,807
- Good.

630
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,873
- Where's your sister?
- I don't know.

631
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,213
Her cool friends
are very sensitive.

632
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,590
- She have a lot of friends?

633
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:18,658
- Compared to me,
or to normal people?

634
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,146
- Tess said she'd rather die
than be collected

635
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:25,064
by a man
who looks like a penguin.

636
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:29,283
- I only take random insults
from immediate friends and family.

637
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,663
- I'm Tess's best friend.

638
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,738
- Good enough.

639
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:33,348
Where is she?

640
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:36,148
- Waiting for you to leave
over cover of nightfall.

641
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,145
- Thank you.

642
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,904
Miss Tess!

643
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:42,016
Tess Jamieson!

644
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:45,430
Your butler is here and waiting!

645
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:47,846
Hurry up,

646
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:50,378
or I'll throw out
yourfavourite Bamey video!

647
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:51,873
And your stash of letters

648
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,213
to one J. Timberlake!

649
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:02,881
So how'd basketball go?
- I stunk.

650
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,569
What's you expect?

651
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,716
- I dunno.
What did you expect?

652
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:08,673
- Well, I thought I'd be lousy.

653
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,550
- Well, then it all worked out
the way you thought.

654
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:13,275
Miss Tess, how was your day?

655
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:15,960
- Do you gamble?
- What do you got in mind?

656
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:18,300
- I bet you'll be fired
within a week.

657
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,834
- What odds are you offering?

658
00:35:20,908 --> 00:35:25,127
Doesn't anyone want
to sit up front with the luau dinner?

659
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:42,655
Dinner is served!

660
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:50,326
- This is so perfect.
- You think she'll like it?

661
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,243
- She'll be breathless.

662
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,200
It's a napkin, moron.

663
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,843
- Why the hurry?
- He made us all dinner.

664
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,142
The least we can do
is show him a little gratitude.

665
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:06,320
Oh, my good God.

666
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,468
Aluau.

667
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:17,212
Who's idea was this?

668
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:18,861
- The butler.

669
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:36,543
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi, five Mississippi,

670
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,305
six Mississippi, seven Mississippi,
nine Mississippi, 10 Mississippi!

671
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,047
- Mm, rich, full-bodied...

672
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:53,112
Hmm, I smell a hint of mushroom.

673
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:54,838
- Shitake?

674
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,410
- Portobello. Burgundy region.

675
00:36:56,487 --> 00:37:00,054
I will take you there one day.

676
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,087
- Can I come to Verdungy?

677
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:04,848
- Oh, Bates, sweet,
but it's not for les enfants.

678
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:09,144
I think it will be a trip
just for your mother and me.

679
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,599
- Jacques is joking.
Heh-heh.

680
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:14,360
Of course we can all go together.
The children would love it.

681
00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:17,045
- Ah, the children. Of course.

682
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:18,848
- Can we go, Mom?

683
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,072
Just the three of us?

684
00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:22,913
Jackass doesn't have to come.

685
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,179
- Jackass?

686
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,979
Who is Jackass.

687
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:29,779
- I think that Bates
has an imaginary friend.

688
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:32,655
- Madam...

689
00:37:34,612 --> 00:37:36,184
kalua pu'a.

690
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:40,097
The custom is to prepare the food

691
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:41,937
in a an imu,

692
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:44,468
or underground oven.

693
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:47,192
- Sounds... wonderful.

694
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:49,263
Doesn't it, children?

695
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:53,290
Gross.

696
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:58,047
- It is normally served

697
00:37:58,123 --> 00:37:59,695
with a mashed taro root,

698
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:01,805
or poi.

699
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,490
- God!

700
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:10,090
- Plug it! Plug it up!

701
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,347
Ah! Ahh!

702
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:15,804
- Hot piggy! Hot piggy!

703
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,223
Oh, Lord.

704
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,872
Stay with me! Stay with me!

705
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:30,379
- I cannot organize the world,
I cannot organize the world...

706
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,675
Oh...

707
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,858
- I think you'll find
that I just won the bet.

708
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,364
- Moi. I'm the Jackass.
Jacques-ass.

709
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:51,167
I'm not stupid, Anne.

710
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:54,312
Is he not Bob-ass, this butler?

711
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,729
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Here, let me help you.

712
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,219
- Imbecile!

713
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:03,019
But no, you do not want
to check his references!

714
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:08,503
- I just wanted
to make a nice dinner.

715
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,152
Sort of a thank-you?

716
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:12,990
- Well, maybe if I talk to Mom.
Would that help?

717
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,448
- Nah. I'm the screw-up.

718
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:16,327
I've done this before.

719
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,820
- You blew up another pig?

720
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:20,163
- Bedtime, Bates.

721
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,229
- Good luck.
- Can you give me one good reason

722
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:26,031
why I shouldn't fire you right now?

723
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,949
- Yes.
- Okay.

724
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:29,330
I'm listening.

725
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:32,629
- Can I have till tomorrow morning?

726
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:35,735
- This is a complete disaster area!

727
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,806
My pristine dining room

728
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:40,452
is covered in pig shrapnel!

729
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,677
- I'll clean it up.
- You better.

730
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:44,403
- Every...

731
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,129
shred.

732
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:48,699
- Oh, and, Bob,

733
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:52,304
I think it's best if you never, ever...

734
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:54,567
ever cook anything again.

735
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:56,984
- Yes, ma'am.

736
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,419
Thought you should know—

737
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:08,259
- Closed door, big hint.

738
00:40:08,297 --> 00:40:09,410
...I'm staying.

739
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,134
- I thought servants were meant
to be seen and not heard.

740
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:19,612
- Hey, these are great.
- Hey! Gimme that!

741
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:22,681
It's private!
- Don't get your knickers in a knot.

742
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,034
- Look, look, look, look, look,
look, look. Look.

743
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,214
- Okay.

744
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:44,312
Take your time today

745
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:46,806
There's no hurry
you can wait a while

746
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:50,641
If only for a smile

747
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:54,246
Take your time today

748
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:55,282
There's no hurry

749
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,046
- All right!
- There you go!

750
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:59,616
You can wait a while
Oh!

751
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,687
If only for a smile
Oh! Jeez! Ahhh!

752
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:03,029
- Sorry!

753
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:15,687
So have you decided
Hmm? Uh-huh.

754
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,911
To change your worn-out mind

755
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:20,481
Then take your time today

756
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,054
There's no hurry

757
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:24,201
You can wait a while

758
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:27,576
Hello?

759
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:28,919
Hi, Mom.

760
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:30,261
I'm in a tree.

761
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:34,672
- Miss Tess.
- There you go.

762
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:39,044
- Bates, there you are.
- Thanks!

763
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,502
- Nice hat.

764
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:45,373
Take your time today

765
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:49,669
- Five in a row. Right back.

766
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:04,436
- Shoot some balls with me?
- Sure.

767
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:10,265
- What's that?
- What?

768
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:13,449
- Have you got
a remote-control ball?

769
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:15,788
- Rascal?

770
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:18,051
- Who's Rascal?
- Rascal!

771
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:20,583
Rascal!

772
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:26,489
Rascal!

773
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:28,982
Rascal!

774
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:33,354
Rascal!

775
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:40,526
Rascal!
- Bob!

776
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:42,943
Bob!

777
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:44,861
Bob!

778
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:47,891
Bob, stop!

779
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:49,616
- Rascal!

780
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,548
- Poor thing.

781
00:43:00,624 --> 00:43:02,121
Someone's been
a very naughty butler.

782
00:43:09,906 --> 00:43:11,211
- Oh...

783
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,626
Oh... Oh, Rascal.

784
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:15,046
Rascal.

785
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:18,306
"He licked the jar right out
of Newton's hand, sliming his palm

786
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:20,799
"with a streak of black gob,

787
00:43:20,876 --> 00:43:24,136
"perhaps the most disgusting thing
Newton had experienced

788
00:43:24,213 --> 00:43:25,785
"since the time
he mistakenly ate a maggot.

789
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:26,974
- Hi, guys.

790
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:28,853
How was your day?

791
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,273
Anything interesting happen?

792
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,418
- The usual.

793
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:35,796
- Oh.

794
00:43:39,439 --> 00:43:41,626
- Why aren't you a dad?

795
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:43,390
- Just didn't happen yet.

796
00:43:43,466 --> 00:43:45,653
- I don't have a dad.

797
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:47,416
- Everybody has a dad.

798
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:49,756
- Mom got me and Bates
from a bank.

799
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,483
- Tess.

800
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:53,668
- Special bank
where men make deposits.

801
00:43:53,745 --> 00:43:56,506
- Tess...
- And women make withdrawals.

802
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:59,268
- If they can't find Mr. Right.

803
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:17,371
- Bob.

804
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:18,523
Bob!

805
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:24,468
- Too loud?
- Uh, no.

806
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:27,459
No. Just, uh... just really...

807
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:28,725
really horrible.

808
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:29,837
Heh-heh.

809
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,218
- I love the trumpet.

810
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:33,020
- Then you should practice.

811
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:34,670
- Yeah.

812
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,280
- Um...

813
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:41,343
Bob, you must... think
I'm a really horrible mother.

814
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,220
- No.
- Well, it wasn't an easy decision.

815
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:46,176
- Sure.

816
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:49,360
- I just...
I didn't wanna miss out, you know?

817
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:52,351
It's not like time
was exactly on my side,

818
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,038
so I thought I'd...
- Anne...

819
00:44:56,148 --> 00:44:58,526
You're... you're blessed.

820
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,786
Sorry. I, uh...

821
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:04,088
spoke out of turn.

822
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:06,811
Zip!
- That's all right.

823
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:08,536
Thank you.

824
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:10,570
- Can I ask you a question?

825
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:12,180
- Yeah...

826
00:45:12,257 --> 00:45:14,366
- What's capital management?

827
00:45:18,738 --> 00:45:20,848
- Bye! Thanks for the lift!

828
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:22,268
- See you later!

829
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:23,725
Bye-bye!

830
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:31,396
Hello, Judith.

831
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:33,620
I'll be about an hour or so.

832
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,385
It can wait.

833
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:38,261
Yeah. I'll be on my cellphone
if you need me.

834
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:39,565
Okay. Bye.

835
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,902
Oh!

836
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:47,045
Ah! Oh...

837
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:50,918
Well, I can't come to a meeting
with stains on my blouse,

838
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,337
now can I?

839
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:54,408
I'm back, Bob!
I'm just gonna take a quick bath!

840
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,096
I'll be there as soon as I can.

841
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:08,983
I'll be over at 10
They tell me time and again

842
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,440
I can't wait...

843
00:46:23,597 --> 00:46:27,240
Why do you build me up
Build me up

844
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,582
Buttercup baby
- Ahhhhhh!

845
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,960
...let me down...

846
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:36,062
- Can I get you some towels,
ma'am?

847
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:37,557
- Mm-hmm!

848
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,552
But I love you still
I need you

849
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:41,393
I need you
more than anyone darling

850
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,157
You know that I have

851
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:44,576
From the start

852
00:46:44,653 --> 00:46:46,570
So build me up

853
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:49,179
Buttercup

854
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,170
Don't break my heart

855
00:46:52,247 --> 00:46:54,280
- You don't get that flipping burgers.

856
00:46:58,154 --> 00:47:02,180
- Then I dribbled right, cut left
and slam-dunked it.

857
00:47:02,257 --> 00:47:06,017
- Who traded in my geek brother
for a jock geek brother?

858
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,550
- Hey, where are you all going

859
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:10,120
on a Sunday?
- Basketball tryouts.

860
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,923
- Well, I'll drive you.
Let me get my purse.

861
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,185
- I wanna go with Bob.

862
00:47:15,413 --> 00:47:17,292
- Okay. Uh...

863
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,399
what about you, Tess?
- I arranged to meet Sophie.

864
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,742
Don't you have work to do?

865
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,813
- Nope. Amazingly.

866
00:47:25,615 --> 00:47:27,648
All right, well...
see you later.

867
00:47:33,593 --> 00:47:34,974
- Ah, oui, allô?

868
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,160
Anne! What's wrong?

869
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:40,765
- I got the whole day free
and I'm lonely!

870
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:49,664
It's so nice to do something
for myself for a change.

871
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,234
- We go out
and find a nice, quiet place.

872
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,729
- Oh, this is lovely!

873
00:47:55,187 --> 00:47:57,105
This is nice!

874
00:47:57,182 --> 00:47:58,945
Now this is relaxing.

875
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:01,324
This...

876
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,274
Take me home.
- What?!

877
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,614
- I... I... I can't be here
without them.

878
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,953
I just can't enjoy... myself
without the kids.

879
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,062
I mean, you know, I just can't!

880
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,440
- Let's go!
- Look, Jacques, I have children.

881
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:16,665
I love them.
They're not just going to disappear.

882
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:18,161
- You would prefer
that I disappear?

883
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:22,840
Examine the situation.
One: You are a single woman.

884
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:23,876
Very beautiful,

885
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:26,369
true, but, uh, very, very...

886
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,827
anal.

887
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:31,164
- Anal. I'm anal.

888
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,196
- Two: Your children.

889
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,837
They are not beautiful.
Just annoying.

890
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,714
Three: If I go...

891
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,092
- I'll take three. You go. Now.

892
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:44,971
Take a cab.
- Anne!

893
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,305
You are a single woman
of a certain age.

894
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:51,107
You will not find another man.

895
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:52,834
Statistically,

896
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,017
you have a better chance
of being hit by a truck.

897
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:58,817
One driven by Bob.

898
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:07,754
- So?

899
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:08,981
- So what?

900
00:49:09,057 --> 00:49:11,359
- How'd it go? The tryouts.

901
00:49:11,397 --> 00:49:13,084
- There was no tryouts.

902
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:17,380
The coach had already decided
who was on the team.

903
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:18,454
- What?

904
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:19,989
That's not fair.

905
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:22,750
Wait here.

906
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:25,243
- You're not going to embarrass me?

907
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,697
- You bet I am.

908
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:31,188
Hey! You the coach?

909
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:32,876
- Who's asking?

910
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:34,870
- My name's Tree.

911
00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:38,974
- Bob?

912
00:49:39,051 --> 00:49:41,275
Bob the mascot?

913
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:43,001
- Jerry?

914
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:44,497
- Yeah!

915
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:45,916
Rrrrrrr!

916
00:49:47,911 --> 00:49:49,061
- Yeah.

917
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:51,094
What happened
to the Bismark Barbarians?

918
00:49:51,171 --> 00:49:54,546
- Ah, I left not long
after the owner fired you.

919
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:56,540
He was a real a-hole.

920
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,458
- I know. I know. I know.

921
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:00,146
- Still got your helmet, though.

922
00:50:00,184 --> 00:50:02,102
You wanna see it?

923
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:03,559
- You bet.

924
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:05,400
It's about Bates.

925
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,627
Bates Jamieson?

926
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:07,816
- Pull up a chair.

927
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:14,452
- Uh-ooh.
- Put it on.

928
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:20,972
- Yeah. Still fits like a glove.

929
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:22,966
Areally...

930
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:24,616
weird glove.

931
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:27,186
- It took them two hours
to remove that from his buttocks.

932
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:28,988
- I probably shouldn't have
left it on his chair.

933
00:50:29,064 --> 00:50:31,596
Ahem.
- So what about the Jamieson kid?

934
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:34,894
- He wants to try out for the team.

935
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:37,771
- He's kind of small.

936
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,604
Why is it impossible
to say no to you?

937
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:44,291
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

938
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:46,133
- Yeah! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

939
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:50,159
All right.

940
00:50:50,198 --> 00:50:51,847
Go ahead.

941
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,211
Come on, Bates!

942
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:02,126
He's a little nervous.

943
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:05,271
Put one in the net there, Bates!
Put one in the net there!

944
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:18,159
How ya doin'?

945
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:19,578
- Coach hates me.

946
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:21,457
- Forget about him, okay?

947
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:23,298
It's just you and me.

948
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:24,756
Just like at home.

949
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,213
Come on.

950
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,284
Come on, let's go!
- Ah...

951
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:29,549
- Come on!

952
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:30,854
Like we practiced!

953
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:32,196
Come on!

954
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:34,881
- Hey.
- Oh, you got it, you got it.

955
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:37,566
Take it around me,
take it around me,

956
00:51:37,604 --> 00:51:38,985
take it around me, put it in,

957
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:40,404
put it in the net. Come on.

958
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:43,243
No fancy stuff.
Just put it in the net.

959
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:47,461
All right! Huh?! Huh?!
- Yeah! I got one!

960
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:48,727
- Two points!

961
00:51:49,379 --> 00:51:50,798
Two points!

962
00:51:53,406 --> 00:51:54,634
Hey, Tess.

963
00:51:56,589 --> 00:51:58,124
Been shopping?

964
00:51:58,201 --> 00:52:00,387
Oh, what is that, a wristband?

965
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,688
Pair of socks?

966
00:52:02,765 --> 00:52:04,644
Mom!
- Is it a bib?

967
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,099
- Hey, how were the tryouts?
- Great!

968
00:52:07,176 --> 00:52:09,592
- Good. I made salmon skewers.
- Salmon?

969
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:11,241
- I'll tell Tess.

970
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:12,776
- What?

971
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:16,649
- Hey, Tess.
- Don't come in.

972
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:19,143
- Your mother made a barbecue.

973
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,715
- I'll be down in five.

974
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:33,026
- Would you like
to join us, Bob?

975
00:52:34,523 --> 00:52:36,286
Please.

976
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,434
We'd like you to.

977
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:41,081
- Thank you.

978
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,153
It's real nice of you
to have made

979
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:45,031
these salmon skewers.
Isn't it, kids?

980
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:48,790
And a green salad.
Eh...

981
00:52:50,746 --> 00:52:53,584
- That was delicious.
- I should've made hot dogs.

982
00:52:53,623 --> 00:52:55,733
- No, no. It was really good.

983
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:57,573
- Oh, you missed a spot.

984
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,338
- Where?
- Right there.

985
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:00,948
- Hmm.

986
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:04,823
You know, Tess has drawn
some amazing dress designs.

987
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:07,584
You should see her schoolbooks.
- Schoolbooks?

988
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:10,384
- Yeah, she draws
in her schoolbooks.

989
00:53:10,423 --> 00:53:12,761
- You're such a liar!

990
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:14,334
You're such a stupid liar!

991
00:53:14,411 --> 00:53:16,981
- Tess!
- It's not true!

992
00:53:17,058 --> 00:53:19,013
I hate you, Bob!
- Tess!

993
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,200
Tess!

994
00:53:21,276 --> 00:53:24,460
- I guess that's what it's like
having family, Rascal.

995
00:53:24,498 --> 00:53:27,183
Ups and downs.

996
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,098
Just a second.

997
00:53:35,544 --> 00:53:36,656
Come in.

998
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,226
- Hi.

999
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:42,026
I've spoken to Tess
and she's shown me her drawings.

1000
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:44,673
You're right.
They're amazing.

1001
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,013
So thank you for that.

1002
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:52,305
- Something wrong?

1003
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:56,103
- Don't take this
the wrong way, Bob.

1004
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,248
You're the butler.

1005
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:01,433
You're not herfather.

1006
00:54:04,272 --> 00:54:06,880
- I understand completely.

1007
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:10,830
- Thanks.

1008
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:13,975
Good night, then.

1009
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:15,280
- Good night.

1010
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:25,213
- Why are we eating in here?

1011
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,515
- More coffee, ma'am?
- Oh, I'll get it.

1012
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:29,509
- Please, ma'am.
Leave it to me.

1013
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:37,180
- It's cool.

1014
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:42,013
- New skirt?
- Yeah. Like it?

1015
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:44,160
- No. It's like theirs.

1016
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:46,116
- That's the point, stupid.

1017
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,415
- So you coming to watch me
get my nose pierced?

1018
00:54:49,492 --> 00:54:51,333
- Not on this planet.

1019
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,442
Tomorrow after school, okay?

1020
00:54:55,973 --> 00:54:57,125
- Bye.

1021
00:54:59,387 --> 00:55:02,187
- You're hanging
with the Clone Barbies now?

1022
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:03,185
- Maybe when I'm in tighter,

1023
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:05,830
I'll put in a good word for you
and you can hang with.

1024
00:55:05,908 --> 00:55:08,630
- I liked you because I thought
you were an individual.

1025
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:10,050
Like me.

1026
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,690
Now you're just more like pathetic.

1027
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:27,040
- Stop!

1028
00:55:27,885 --> 00:55:29,303
Excuse me.

1029
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:32,142
Kate, is the fruit washed?

1030
00:55:32,218 --> 00:55:33,715
Judith, did you wash the fruit?

1031
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,402
- It's pre-washed.

1032
00:55:35,478 --> 00:55:37,588
- Pre-washed? Pre-washed?!

1033
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:39,314
- Pre-washed.
- Ah!

1034
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:44,760
I do not wanna to lose this deal

1035
00:55:44,837 --> 00:55:46,793
because one of my investors
has the runs!

1036
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,327
- The runs?

1037
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,428
- Done.

1038
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:54,540
Done.

1039
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:56,804
Done!

1040
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,630
Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

1041
00:56:10,612 --> 00:56:12,644
Arodent!

1042
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,293
Oh! Rodent!

1043
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,981
Huge rodent!

1044
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,553
- Where is he?
- Oh! Oh!

1045
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,472
Huge!

1046
00:56:19,548 --> 00:56:20,430
- Rascal?
- Rat! Ratty!

1047
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:22,348
- Rascal, don't do this to me.

1048
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:23,920
- Furry thing on the table!

1049
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,071
He was there on the table!

1050
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,334
- Hold it!
- Ah! What are you doing, Bob?

1051
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,715
- Don't move.

1052
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,210
- Ah... What are you doing, Bob?

1053
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:34,622
Ah... ah... ah...

1054
00:56:34,698 --> 00:56:35,657
Ahhhh!

1055
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,105
- Rascal...

1056
00:56:43,788 --> 00:56:45,207
- Oh, Jesus.

1057
00:56:46,857 --> 00:56:48,237
I guess this is urgent?

1058
00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:49,887
- Of course it's urgent!

1059
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:52,110
- Stay calm, Anne.
Do not explode.

1060
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:54,029
- Too late!
I've already exploded!

1061
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:55,908
I've dumped Jacques
and kicked out the hamster.

1062
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:57,289
- What hamster?
- Oh, keep up!

1063
00:56:57,365 --> 00:57:00,204
Bob's taken over.
He spends more time with my kids—-

1064
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:03,617
- Than you do?
- Than butling. It's exasperating!

1065
00:57:03,694 --> 00:57:04,960
- Have you fired him?

1066
00:57:05,037 --> 00:57:06,992
- I told him the hamster
has to leave immediately

1067
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:08,603
and I want
this whole house disinfected

1068
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,945
from top to bottom!

1069
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:12,362
- Oh, sounds like
someone has a crush.

1070
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,274
- Huh! I'm paying you for this?
I'm not paying you for this!

1071
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:18,920
Don't you dare bill me
for this call!

1072
00:57:18,997 --> 00:57:20,915
Ridiculous!

1073
00:57:26,285 --> 00:57:28,125
Oh, Rascal.

1074
00:57:28,164 --> 00:57:30,657
Who let you out?

1075
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:41,857
You know what, Tess?
That was out of order.

1076
00:57:41,895 --> 00:57:45,270
And if I was your father,
you would be in so much trouble.

1077
00:57:45,347 --> 00:57:47,034
Ya dig?
- It wasn't me.

1078
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:48,492
- Yeah, whatever.

1079
00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:51,062
- Whatever.

1080
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,987
- Bates...

1081
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,483
was it you?

1082
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:09,625
C'mon, Bates, why? C'mon.

1083
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:11,697
Talk to me, buddy.

1084
00:58:14,765 --> 00:58:16,337
- I didn't make the team.

1085
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:19,866
- You didn't. Okay.

1086
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:21,324
That's a shame.

1087
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,622
- I didn't make the team!
You said I would!

1088
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:27,805
- Well, I never said that.
I said I would help.

1089
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:29,454
I said I would try.

1090
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:32,637
- I wasn't good enough.

1091
00:58:32,714 --> 00:58:34,939
- Not being good enough is...

1092
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:36,857
life.

1093
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:39,427
But you'll find
you're good at something.

1094
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:41,382
Everybody's good at something.

1095
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:43,607
- What are you good at?

1096
00:58:46,714 --> 00:58:48,364
- I can catch grapes
in my mouth.

1097
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,141
- Mom?

1098
00:59:02,056 --> 00:59:03,935
I put Rascal in your room.

1099
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:07,387
I didn't make the team.

1100
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:10,149
- Okay.

1101
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:14,022
- It doesn't matter, though.
I'll find something to be good at.

1102
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:41,139
- Hello, Mr. Butler?

1103
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:42,443
Bob here.

1104
00:59:57,516 --> 00:59:59,396
You'll look after him?

1105
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:00,623
- Of course.

1106
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:02,387
- Can I make you a cup of tea?

1107
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:06,568
- Oh, we have a regular little butler.

1108
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,831
What's your name,

1109
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:09,789
Master?

1110
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:11,746
- It's Bates.

1111
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:13,626
Just Bates.

1112
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:16,656
- Hmm...

1113
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,707
- You're gonna be just fine.

1114
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:28,276
- It's like an initiation thing.

1115
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:34,682
- I'll start your room.

1116
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,196
How's everything going?

1117
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:45,536
- Fine, thanks!

1118
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,209
Let's go.
- You got the stuff?

1119
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:07,436
- No problem.

1120
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:10,466
- Security!

1121
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:12,231
- Ah!

1122
01:01:12,308 --> 01:01:13,841
No! Let me go!

1123
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:15,069
You guys, wait!

1124
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:21,321
- Purple. Purple for general.

1125
01:01:21,398 --> 01:01:23,507
- What?
- Purple for general,

1126
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:25,194
yellow for kitchen,

1127
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:26,883
blue for bathroom.

1128
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:28,531
Purple for general.

1129
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:29,951
Right.

1130
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:35,512
- Hello?

1131
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:36,931
Hey, Bob!

1132
01:01:37,008 --> 01:01:39,079
It's for you.

1133
01:01:39,156 --> 01:01:41,265
- Hello.

1134
01:01:41,342 --> 01:01:43,566
Jamieson family butler speaking.

1135
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:47,056
I'll be right there.

1136
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:50,778
I have to go.

1137
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:52,618
Will you be okay with Mr. Butler

1138
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:53,654
for a while?
- Sure.

1139
01:01:56,223 --> 01:01:58,601
- Come on, Bates.
When we're finished here,

1140
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,436
I'll teach you how to polish silver
by spitting on it.

1141
01:02:02,513 --> 01:02:03,588
- Cool!

1142
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:05,659
- Yeah!

1143
01:02:09,034 --> 01:02:11,758
- Hey! I'm looking
for Tess Jamieson.

1144
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:14,480
- Tough love.
We give kids a dose of reality,

1145
01:02:14,556 --> 01:02:16,590
scare 'em straight
before it's too late.

1146
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,163
- This one's not like that.

1147
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,083
- You're one of those

1148
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:20,963
always-looking-for-the-best
- in-people guys?

1149
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,340
Hmm! We'll keep her
for an hour or two,

1150
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:25,986
then you can take her.
- Listen, if I may be so bold,

1151
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:28,786
you'll let her out this second.
Or I'll call my friend Judge Sharma

1152
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,011
and I'll have your ass kicked
from here to Texas.

1153
01:02:46,084 --> 01:02:48,923
Don't worry about it.
This'll be our little secret.

1154
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,106
- Bob, I'm sorry.

1155
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:54,484
About everything.

1156
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:56,900
I lied.

1157
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:58,243
About the luau.

1158
01:02:58,281 --> 01:03:00,544
My mom's practically a vegetarian.

1159
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,231
- I guess she is now.

1160
01:03:02,308 --> 01:03:03,651
Come on, let's go.

1161
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:21,332
- Omigod.

1162
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:23,020
Bates!

1163
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:24,668
- I'm standing still, Mom!

1164
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,740
I can be a butler!

1165
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,611
- Good evening, Miss Jamieson.

1166
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:43,310
- Tess, where have you been?!

1167
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,763
- I got hung up at Sophie's.

1168
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,027
Bob came and got me.

1169
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:48,985
- In that?!

1170
01:03:49,023 --> 01:03:50,942
Both of you, inside now!

1171
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:57,308
Bob, I have known
for quite some time

1172
01:03:57,385 --> 01:03:59,610
that you're not the world's
greatest butler,

1173
01:03:59,648 --> 01:04:02,870
but you at least seemed
to care for my kids.

1174
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:04,405
What kind of a man

1175
01:04:04,481 --> 01:04:07,281
leaves an eight-year-old
with a total stranger?

1176
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:09,658
A stranger...
What am I saying?

1177
01:04:09,697 --> 01:04:10,848
A psycho!

1178
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:13,148
Who thinks that standing
on the roof of a house

1179
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:15,028
is good training?

1180
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,831
- I'm sorry, Anne.

1181
01:04:16,908 --> 01:04:18,212
- Miss Jamieson!

1182
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:22,546
- I'm truly sorry, Miss Jamieson.

1183
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:26,957
- I have to let you go, Bob.

1184
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:30,638
I'll pay you
to the end of the month, but...

1185
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,745
I want you to leave in the morning.

1186
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:44,547
- Let's not get ourselves down,

1187
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:45,852
Rascal.

1188
01:05:45,928 --> 01:05:47,615
You keep going...

1189
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:50,032
and I'll keep going.

1190
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:56,860
- To the end
of ATBJ Capital Management!

1191
01:05:56,937 --> 01:05:58,355
Finally!

1192
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,150
Okay...

1193
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,790
- I don't feel like celebrating.

1194
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,752
- Come in.

1195
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:23,669
Why aren't you in school?
- Lunch.

1196
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:24,973
What are you doing?

1197
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,660
- Lunch.

1198
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:29,460
Welcome to my home.

1199
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:30,880
- Nice.

1200
01:06:30,957 --> 01:06:33,565
- Well, my natural state is messy.

1201
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:36,287
- I'm sorry you got fired.
I just wanted

1202
01:06:36,365 --> 01:06:37,784
the cool kids to like me.

1203
01:06:39,932 --> 01:06:43,230
- You know, when I was a kid,
I used to like building model cars.

1204
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:46,260
But...

1205
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:47,679
there was always once piece

1206
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:49,942
I could neverfigure out
where it was supposed to go.

1207
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:52,359
I always felt like that piece.

1208
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:56,692
I've spent my whole life
trying to figure out where I fit.

1209
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,377
So when you figure it out...

1210
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:00,604
well...

1211
01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:02,100
that's good.

1212
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:05,782
- So you're saying
it's good to shoplift

1213
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,777
if it helps you fit in?

1214
01:07:10,155 --> 01:07:12,456
- I worked
for a New York designer once.

1215
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:15,026
- You?
- I was just sewing,

1216
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,557
but it was better
than a lot of jobs I've done.

1217
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,360
Here.

1218
01:07:19,437 --> 01:07:21,431
Severance pay
from the sweatshop.

1219
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,535
- Bob...

1220
01:07:25,612 --> 01:07:28,028
can you teach me how to sew?

1221
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:42,526
- Sorry for skipping out on you.
- Yeah, we were, like,

1222
01:07:42,602 --> 01:07:43,945
so cowardly.

1223
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:45,326
- This is ace.

1224
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:47,129
D'you steal it?

1225
01:07:47,205 --> 01:07:49,430
- I made it.
- Shut up!

1226
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:51,769
I want one.
- Me too!

1227
01:07:51,846 --> 01:07:54,186
- Than wouldn't we be wearing
the same top?

1228
01:07:54,224 --> 01:07:56,794
- Yeah. Like a club.

1229
01:08:02,547 --> 01:08:03,966
- Hey, Soph.

1230
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:14,169
- I had the best day.

1231
01:08:14,245 --> 01:08:15,242
- Great.

1232
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:17,966
- He followed me.

1233
01:08:18,004 --> 01:08:20,420
- I want to be good at something.
- Well, of course you do.

1234
01:08:24,562 --> 01:08:26,442
You ever seen
one of these before?

1235
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,861
Check, check, check, check.

1236
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,897
- Check, check.

1237
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:30,891
Check, check.
- Does it look all right?

1238
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:32,119
- Wicked.

1239
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:35,187
- I hope you're ready.
- Oh, God.

1240
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:36,759
- It's show time.

1241
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:38,639
Thank you for coming,
ladies and...

1242
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:39,674
just lady.

1243
01:08:39,751 --> 01:08:42,244
I am pleased to present

1244
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:45,312
original creations by Tess!

1245
01:08:47,806 --> 01:08:51,526
Be a cool girl
Like you were meant to be

1246
01:08:51,564 --> 01:08:54,402
In a stunning outfit
of skirt and top retro-"chick. "

1247
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:56,934
That's our Sophie!

1248
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,851
- Chic, not chick.

1249
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:00,194
- Whatever.

1250
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:01,651
And next up,

1251
01:09:01,728 --> 01:09:03,646
the twin evil girls.

1252
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,064
Oh!

1253
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,289
Whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1254
01:09:08,171 --> 01:09:09,552
- And finally,

1255
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:12,007
the heroine of the hour,

1256
01:09:12,084 --> 01:09:14,001
the one and only...

1257
01:09:14,078 --> 01:09:15,344
Miss Tess!

1258
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:47,714
- Miss Jamieson.

1259
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:50,054
- Yeah,
I was just in the neighbourhood.

1260
01:09:52,816 --> 01:09:54,657
I wasn't, obviously.

1261
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,153
I came to see you.

1262
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,566
- Come on in.
- Ahem...

1263
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,429
- Here we are.

1264
01:10:11,456 --> 01:10:12,876
She's very talented.

1265
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:15,369
- You've been so good with them.

1266
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,669
But I know the truth.

1267
01:10:18,821 --> 01:10:21,351
- I just helped her
make a few dresses.

1268
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:25,648
- You got my little girl out of jail.

1269
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:28,217
I got a phone call this morning
from a Detective Alvarez.

1270
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:32,820
He said that he wished
that half the fathers that he met

1271
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,661
were as loyal
and determined as you.

1272
01:10:34,738 --> 01:10:37,192
- Don't be too hard on her.

1273
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:39,455
- I think you know me
better than that.

1274
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,373
- I do.

1275
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,709
- So what's next for you?
- Well, I got a job.

1276
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:47,241
One of those butler cruises.

1277
01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:50,348
Around the world in 365 days.

1278
01:10:52,573 --> 01:10:53,991
- That's good for you.

1279
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,488
When do you leave?

1280
01:10:55,564 --> 01:10:57,405
- First thing Saturday.

1281
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:01,049
- Oh, um... these...

1282
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,350
are... for tomorrow.

1283
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,763
- Oh, wow.

1284
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,953
I love the trumpet.

1285
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:10,293
- Yeah. Jacques and I
were supposed to go,

1286
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:12,938
but, uh, I thought
maybe you had someone special.

1287
01:11:14,473 --> 01:11:15,968
- No.

1288
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:23,716
- Well, I guess we, uh...
we each could take one.

1289
01:11:23,754 --> 01:11:25,096
- Sure.

1290
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:30,658
- Okay, then.

1291
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:31,809
- Okay.

1292
01:11:32,499 --> 01:11:34,379
- Okay, well,
I'll see you there, then.

1293
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:37,255
Eight o'clock tomorrow.
- Okay.

1294
01:11:44,351 --> 01:11:46,191
It's not a date.

1295
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:48,071
- It's a date.
- Is not.

1296
01:11:48,148 --> 01:11:50,334
- Is.
- Oh... it's not a date.

1297
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:53,633
A date, huh!
Just two people.

1298
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,896
Two individual people who...

1299
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:58,773
happen to be going to the same place
at the same time.

1300
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:01,956
All I did was give Bob
my extra ticket.

1301
01:12:02,033 --> 01:12:03,413
- It's so a date.

1302
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,903
- Who's going on a date?
- Mom. With Bob.

1303
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,246
- Awesome!

1304
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,377
- Hello.

1305
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,793
What are you doing
at this moment?

1306
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:27,385
Oh...

1307
01:12:27,461 --> 01:12:29,494
- I'm taking care of my family.

1308
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:32,754
I'm a single woman
of a certain age, remember?

1309
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:35,055
- Ah, tonight, we have those, uh...

1310
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:36,628
tickets to the concert.

1311
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:39,390
- Bye, Jacques.
- You will not use them.

1312
01:12:39,466 --> 01:12:41,883
You would not go alone.

1313
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,953
Are you going alone?

1314
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,677
- Are you jealous,
my little Jacques... ass?

1315
01:12:46,715 --> 01:12:47,828
- Who is he?

1316
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,208
Who is he?!

1317
01:12:49,246 --> 01:12:51,510
Robert.

1318
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:53,005
- Robert...

1319
01:12:55,076 --> 01:12:56,342
Bobert...

1320
01:12:57,953 --> 01:12:59,448
Bob?

1321
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:04,627
- It's just a night out
with a beautiful woman...

1322
01:13:04,665 --> 01:13:06,353
who's stolen my heart.

1323
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:15,826
I've got a doorbell, you know.

1324
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:21,656
- We're here to help.
Let's see what you've got.

1325
01:13:21,733 --> 01:13:24,188
- Could you have knocked
a little more, maybe?

1326
01:13:24,265 --> 01:13:26,028
- Ugly...

1327
01:13:26,105 --> 01:13:27,985
ew... no...

1328
01:13:28,023 --> 01:13:29,403
tragic...

1329
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,670
ew...

1330
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:32,625
gross... no.

1331
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:35,847
What's wrong with this?

1332
01:13:35,924 --> 01:13:38,225
- Kind of bored of suits, you know?

1333
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:39,645
- It's perfect.

1334
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:41,255
What time is the concert?

1335
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:43,480
- Doesn't take me long
to get ready.

1336
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:44,975
- Maybe it should.

1337
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:55,638
- Oh, hello, sir.
Can I help you?

1338
01:13:55,715 --> 01:13:58,285
- This is the Cosmopolitan
Butler School?

1339
01:13:58,362 --> 01:14:00,087
- It is no more.

1340
01:14:01,392 --> 01:14:02,810
- It is closing?

1341
01:14:02,887 --> 01:14:04,652
- I'm afraid so.

1342
01:14:04,728 --> 01:14:07,337
Not enough filthy lucre
to keep it alive.

1343
01:14:07,413 --> 01:14:09,024
- So...

1344
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,747
you trained the great Bob.

1345
01:14:12,936 --> 01:14:14,508
- What about Bob?

1346
01:14:14,585 --> 01:14:17,193
- Five-day course.

1347
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,152
Mon Dieu!

1348
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:20,453
You are not a professional!

1349
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,793
Just a sad British man

1350
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:26,475
with his sad little tradition.

1351
01:14:26,552 --> 01:14:28,355
So...

1352
01:14:28,432 --> 01:14:30,925
now we have Bob the liar, too.

1353
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:32,803
- If I may say so...

1354
01:14:32,842 --> 01:14:34,300
sir...

1355
01:14:34,377 --> 01:14:37,176
Bob Tree
is a finer man than most.

1356
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:40,437
And it has been an honour
to know him.

1357
01:14:40,513 --> 01:14:42,584
- Bob!

1358
01:14:47,148 --> 01:14:48,260
- Wow.

1359
01:14:48,337 --> 01:14:49,642
- Mom, is that you?

1360
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:52,902
- I'll take that as a compliment,
I think.

1361
01:14:52,978 --> 01:14:55,395
Now don't stay up too late.

1362
01:14:55,472 --> 01:14:57,849
You sure it's not too much?
- You're a hottie.

1363
01:14:57,925 --> 01:15:00,342
- That's a good thing, right?
It's not too risqué?

1364
01:15:00,419 --> 01:15:03,334
- If you've got it, flaunt it.
That's what I always say.

1365
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:04,715
- You better not say that.

1366
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,358
Good night.

1367
01:15:33,519 --> 01:15:34,938
- You're early.

1368
01:15:38,045 --> 01:15:39,425
- Yes, I am.

1369
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,640
- Hi.

1370
01:16:14,097 --> 01:16:16,629
- You look... radiant.

1371
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:18,854
- Huh...

1372
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,922
you said it yourself.
I have a very talented daughter.

1373
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:42,595
- Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
- Whoa. Ticket, please, sir.

1374
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:44,974
- Oh, I have my... my...
my ticket, it's in there.

1375
01:16:45,012 --> 01:16:46,124
Bob has it.
- Bob who?

1376
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,885
- Uh-uh-uh, Bob has my ticket.
Bob. Bob.

1377
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:52,376
Oh...

1378
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:53,679
Ah...

1379
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,282
- Forget it.
- Oh, come on.

1380
01:17:29,387 --> 01:17:30,960
- It's like a dream, isn't it?

1381
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:46,110
- You wanna go backstage?

1382
01:17:46,187 --> 01:17:48,296
- I don't think we're allowed.

1383
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:50,099
- All right, follow me.

1384
01:17:52,516 --> 01:17:54,702
- Bob! Yeah!

1385
01:17:54,779 --> 01:17:56,006
- Euh...
- Hi, Bob.

1386
01:17:56,082 --> 01:17:58,230
- How ya doin'?
- Bob? Bob!

1387
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,800
- Mama Clara!
She fired me.

1388
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:03,331
- You sure we can do this?

1389
01:18:03,408 --> 01:18:04,444
Ooh.

1390
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:06,399
- Bob, is that you?
- Vince.

1391
01:18:07,244 --> 01:18:08,624
Come on, Anne.
- Ah...

1392
01:18:08,701 --> 01:18:10,427
- How ya doin'?
- Good. How are you?

1393
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:11,692
- Ahem.
- Good to see you.

1394
01:18:11,769 --> 01:18:14,032
- I want you to meet
a friend of mine,

1395
01:18:14,109 --> 01:18:15,374
Anne Jamieson.
- Charmed.

1396
01:18:15,451 --> 01:18:16,756
- The pleasure's mine.

1397
01:18:16,794 --> 01:18:19,671
- You know, a few of us
are going out for something to eat.

1398
01:18:19,747 --> 01:18:22,202
Would you and your date
like to, uh, go with us?

1399
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:25,040
- Well, she's not a date.
- Uh, we'd love to.

1400
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,306
- Fantastic.
- We'd love to...

1401
01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:29,029
- I... I saw them go back there.

1402
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:30,563
- Who?
- Oh, Bob. Bob.

1403
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,903
Are you... are you deaf?
- Huh!

1404
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:34,476
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1405
01:18:34,552 --> 01:18:37,237
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1406
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:46,442
Oh!

1407
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:48,053
Oh!
- Whoa.

1408
01:18:48,129 --> 01:18:51,428
- You seem like you know
everyone in the whole city.

1409
01:18:51,504 --> 01:18:53,844
- Yeah. Well, I've been fired a lot.

1410
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:59,406
- It was a wonderful evening.
- Oh, Anne, your dress.

1411
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:00,364
- Oh!
- Your dress.

1412
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:02,896
Oh, your dress.
- Ah! Oh!

1413
01:19:02,973 --> 01:19:04,468
Aha...
- Oh, jeez.

1414
01:19:04,546 --> 01:19:07,959
- Did you and Tess plan this?
- Yeah, I...

1415
01:19:08,036 --> 01:19:10,606
I did teach her to sew.

1416
01:19:10,644 --> 01:19:12,868
- Laugh! But not for long.

1417
01:19:12,944 --> 01:19:14,786
If I weren't a gentleman,

1418
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:16,051
I would kill you right now.

1419
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:18,429
- Oh, Jacques!
This isn't any of your business!

1420
01:19:18,506 --> 01:19:20,731
- It is my business.

1421
01:19:20,807 --> 01:19:24,681
Put some clothes on!
- Don't you tell me what to do.

1422
01:19:24,758 --> 01:19:27,979
I'll... run around stark naked
if I want to.

1423
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:31,508
- Anne, you have been fooled.
He is not a proper butler.

1424
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:35,114
- Maybe I should just go.
- Oh, you think you can just sneak away?

1425
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:36,456
Afterwhat you did?

1426
01:19:36,494 --> 01:19:39,524
You cannot take advantage
of a middle-aged woman!

1427
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:42,516
- Oh! I am not middle-aged!

1428
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:44,166
Am I?

1429
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:45,508
- You're beautiful.

1430
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,768
- And I'm going to hire Bob.

1431
01:19:48,844 --> 01:19:53,217
- To do what?!
He trained for five days! Five!

1432
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:55,096
Cinq!
- You were gonna hire me?

1433
01:19:55,173 --> 01:19:57,283
- I... I... I...
Well, you really care

1434
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,814
for my children
and they adore you.

1435
01:19:59,891 --> 01:20:02,000
- Ah, Anne!
This situation is intolerable!

1436
01:20:02,076 --> 01:20:04,455
- No, this situation is fine.

1437
01:20:04,493 --> 01:20:05,951
You are intolerable.

1438
01:20:08,367 --> 01:20:09,786
- C'est fini?

1439
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:10,936
Au revoir!

1440
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:12,509
- Au revoir!

1441
01:20:12,548 --> 01:20:14,964
Good riddance!
- Talk to my hand!

1442
01:20:18,186 --> 01:20:20,218
- So would you...
come back to work?

1443
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:23,632
The... children miss you
and... well, we all miss you.

1444
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:25,166
- I can't.

1445
01:20:25,243 --> 01:20:27,506
- I don't understand.

1446
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:28,925
- It wouldn't be appropriate.

1447
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:43,768
- Aren't you going after him?

1448
01:20:45,111 --> 01:20:47,296
- He's leaving
first thing in the morning.

1449
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,016
Get up, Mom.

1450
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,008
- Tess, what are you doing?
- Why did you work this hard, Mom?

1451
01:21:09,504 --> 01:21:11,191
You're all alone.

1452
01:21:11,268 --> 01:21:12,726
- Mom,

1453
01:21:12,803 --> 01:21:15,411
he's part of our family.

1454
01:21:23,656 --> 01:21:24,884
- Stay here.

1455
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:25,996
- Go, Mom!

1456
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:27,531
Go, Mom!

1457
01:21:27,608 --> 01:21:29,180
- Go, Mom! Go, Mom!

1458
01:21:29,256 --> 01:21:32,095
Go, Mom! Go, Mom!

1459
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:37,426
Go, Mom! Go, Mom!

1460
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:39,881
Go, Mom! Go, Mom!
Go, Mom!

1461
01:21:46,018 --> 01:21:48,510
Go, Mom! Go, Mom!

1462
01:21:51,771 --> 01:21:53,151
- What happened?

1463
01:21:57,025 --> 01:21:58,636
- That happened.

1464
01:22:00,822 --> 01:22:03,085
That's the butler cruise.

1465
01:22:04,543 --> 01:22:06,268
- You mean Bob left?

1466
01:22:14,323 --> 01:22:15,627
- What a mess!

1467
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:17,008
A real mess!

1468
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,763
It's a real mess.

1469
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,293
- Maybe he'll come back.

1470
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:27,363
- Get tidy, Anne.

1471
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,745
Get tidy.

1472
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,858
I'm sorry, kids. We lost Bob
and it's all my fault.

1473
01:22:43,665 --> 01:22:45,122
But I wanna thank you -

1474
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,502
both.

1475
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,650
I love you so much.

1476
01:22:48,727 --> 01:22:50,108
Both of you.

1477
01:22:52,025 --> 01:22:53,866
Please don't look at me like that.

1478
01:23:00,617 --> 01:23:02,726
They say kids bounce back,
but...

1479
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,348
Bob!

1480
01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:19,755
Bob!
- Hi.

1481
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:21,520
- What about the butler cruise?

1482
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,246
- I couldn't leave.

1483
01:23:23,323 --> 01:23:25,048
Thought I'd stay.

1484
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,618
- Car-washing?
- Well, it's early on

1485
01:23:27,695 --> 01:23:28,999
in the Cs.

1486
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:53,009
Hey!

1487
01:23:54,007 --> 01:23:55,847
This is a song

1488
01:23:55,924 --> 01:23:59,030
About my desire to find work

1489
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:02,405
My desire to find a family

1490
01:24:02,482 --> 01:24:04,630
- For the food
we are about to receive

1491
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:07,123
and for my new dad, Bob,

1492
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,312
we thank you, God.
- Amen.

1493
01:24:08,389 --> 01:24:09,540
Amen.

1494
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:12,647
- Oh, honey, why don't I carve?

1495
01:24:12,723 --> 01:24:13,797
- Ahem-hem.

1496
01:24:13,874 --> 01:24:16,444
That's a gentleman's job. Ma'am.

1497
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,005
Check it

1498
01:24:25,073 --> 01:24:26,876
- Not again!

1499
01:24:26,953 --> 01:24:28,640
Oh. Nooooo!

1500
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,167
- Dinner is served.

1501
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:37,615
My name is Bob
I'm looking for a job

1502
01:24:37,654 --> 01:24:39,993
When I'm not getting fired
I'm living like a slob

1503
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:42,410
Go through the phonebook
looking for work

1504
01:24:42,487 --> 01:24:45,287
I want to be an astronaut
like Captain Kirk

1505
01:24:45,363 --> 01:24:47,204
Flip burgers
to make me a buck

1506
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,429
Burn down the restaurant
is just bad luck

1507
01:24:49,505 --> 01:24:52,152
I got another occupation
under my belt

1508
01:24:52,228 --> 01:24:54,415
Keeping a job for two weeks
I'm doing well

1509
01:24:54,453 --> 01:24:56,179
Like the time
at the barbershop

1510
01:24:56,255 --> 01:24:58,864
Gave it all I got
chopped up an earlobe

1511
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:01,127
He bled a lot
He never said a lot

1512
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:04,464
He just screamed and got blood
on my brand new blue jeans

1513
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,880
Oh golly gee did it again

1514
01:25:06,957 --> 01:25:09,450
I talked to my hamster
my only friend

1515
01:25:09,488 --> 01:25:11,520
Go through the phonebook again
like a fool

1516
01:25:11,597 --> 01:25:14,397
And I see something
it's butler school

1517
01:25:14,474 --> 01:25:16,622
My name is Bob
and I'm looking like a slob Bob

1518
01:25:16,699 --> 01:25:19,192
My name is Bob
and I need to get a job Bob

1519
01:25:19,268 --> 01:25:21,685
My name is Bob
not Robert just Bob

1520
01:25:21,762 --> 01:25:24,101
My name is Bob
and I need to get a job Bob

1521
01:25:24,139 --> 01:25:26,479
My name is Bob
and I'm looking like a slob Bob

1522
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:28,895
My name is Bob
and I need to get a job Bob

1523
01:25:28,972 --> 01:25:31,427
My name is Bob

1524
01:25:31,504 --> 01:25:33,843
My name is Bob
and I need to get a job

1525
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,067
So I jumped on my motorbike
gonna be a butler

1526
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:38,484
When to the school
it was like no other

1527
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,900
They made me balance
plates on my head yeah

1528
01:25:40,939 --> 01:25:43,278
They made me make a naked dude
get dressed

1529
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:45,694
He dressed me up in a suit
and a vest

1530
01:25:45,732 --> 01:25:48,072
Took me to the rooftop
for a test

1531
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:50,489
Made me climb to the edge
real slow

1532
01:25:50,565 --> 01:25:52,867
Looked at the ground
and I got vertigo

1533
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:55,130
I thought about a woman
that I met the other day

1534
01:25:55,207 --> 01:25:57,507
And the vertigo stopped
spinning it went away

1535
01:25:57,584 --> 01:25:59,924
It felt real good
what can I say

1536
01:26:00,001 --> 01:26:02,340
I think I'm gonna be a butler
I'm on my way

1537
01:26:02,379 --> 01:26:05,217
'Cause my name is Bob
and I'm looking like a slob Bob

1538
01:26:05,255 --> 01:26:07,749
My name is Bob
and I need to get a job Bob

1539
01:26:07,825 --> 01:26:10,164

1540
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:12,657

1541

1545
01:26:22,322 --> 01:26:24,816
Went to the place
and I got a job on the spot

1546
01:26:24,892 --> 01:26:27,041
Living in the attic
I didn't need a lot

1547
01:26:27,117 --> 01:26:29,304
Take the dust to dust
I attack this

1548
01:26:29,342 --> 01:26:31,835
Brought the kids
to basketball practice

1549
01:26:31,912 --> 01:26:34,251
I make dinner
some kind of luau

1550
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:36,322
I want to make the lady
say wow

1551
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,892
But the lady comes home
and the pig explodes

1552
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:41,462
Messed up again
that's all she wrote

1553
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,686
Pretty soon
I'll be back on the street

1554
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:46,256
Looking for a job
with nothing to eat

1555
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:48,787
Maybe I could be a rapper
rapping on the beat

1556
01:26:48,864 --> 01:26:51,204
Get you on the dance floor
