1
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,552
Happiness...
is it enough?

2
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,021
Is it possible to find happiness

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,358
and just be happy about it?

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,595
Alice and I had been happy
for a long time.

5
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,897
Long enough that we were
getting married,

6
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,199
and we were both very...

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,867
...well, we were happy
about it.

8
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,639
We did nice things
for each other.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,008
Things some couples might
not consider romantic,

10
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,746
but we considered the little things
we did for each other truly romantic.

11
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,450
For example, we always did
the dishes together.

12
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,252
It was more fun that way.

13
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,586
And no one got screwed.

14
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,656
Alice was very into good smells.

15
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,858
She was always on the hunt
for the shampoo

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,261
that would make us feel alive
and clean and fresh.

17
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:05,698
Ed made fun of my desire to
find morning sunshine in a bottle.

18
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,100
But he liked it.

19
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,536
He smelled great and so did I.

20
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,538
Whenever I was at
the post office,

21
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,440
I would look for the stamp that
would make Alice happy

22
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,642
to send her letters.

23
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:20,147
It's not a gift on the level of
red roses or diamond earrings.

24
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:23,216
But we were beyond
red roses and diamond earrings.

25
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,884
We had reached stamps.

26
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,887
We were simpatico.

27
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,158
Did I have friends who
were having more fun than me?

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,160
The masseuse just gave me
a hand job.

29
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,828
- Get out!
- Yep!

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,899
- Did you guy discuss it beforehand?
- Nope.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,301
And she give you a hand job
just like that?

32
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,303
Just like that, buddy.

33
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,938
Wow!
I've gotten massages before,

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,440
never once did anyone
ever give me a hand job.

35
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,443
- Roll over.
- I got to go.

36
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,945
Sure, yeah.

37
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,014
I had friends who were
having more fun than me, but,

38
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,186
Alice and I, we had
a different kind of fun.

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,323
Oh, good add-on.

40
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,091
The kind of fun you have

41
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,959
when you've been with someone
you love for five years.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,729
That's why
we were getting married.

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,867
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,805
We could've just been killed

45
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,073
on the way to our own
engagement party.

46
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,877
Whoo, at least we wouldn't have had
to sit through any of the toasts.

47
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,449
Wow! Wow!

48
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,185
My lawyer says I'll be lucky
if I get two Sundays a month.

49
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,953
Rebecca gets Buster?

50
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,323
- That's not fair. That's your dog.
- You believe that shit?

51
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,990
- You trained that dog.
- Exactly.

52
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,093
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Yeah, that's rough.

53
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,096
Yeah, I'm OK.

54
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,865
I'm OK.

55
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,668
I still got Herman.

56
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,871
Thinking about some cats.

57
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,107
- Crab puff with lemon aioli?
- No, thank you.

58
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,743
Good call, they're terrible.

59
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,945
- Oh.
- Wait for the duck beets.

60
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,214
What? Is there anything else
I should look out for?

61
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,183
Just the clumsy waiters.

62
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,387
- I'm Tim.
- I'm Alice.

63
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,323
- Hmm.
- And...

64
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,624
this is my engagement party

65
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,261
Oh, another one lost
to the void.

66
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,401
I gotta, um...

67
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,706
He was my number one, you know?

68
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,777
I won't say nothing to Herman
about it, that's cool.

69
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,579
Why are we even at
this thing anyway? Huh?

70
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,549
Oh, Claire and Peter insisted.

71
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,318
You know, I can't even believe

72
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,287
that Claire and Alice
are sisters.

73
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,788
Claire...

74
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,756
...is so nasty.

75
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,593
Her husband laughed at
something that I said earlier...

76
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,696
So then the stall door opens
and it's Frank Gorshin.

77
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,832
Oh, God.

78
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,168
Honey, please, your breath
is like a sewer.

79
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,804
Please, honey.

80
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,506
She just said his breath
smelled horrible

81
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,007
in front of everybody.

82
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,775
It's called marriage, Carl,
get over it.

83
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,177
And you get used to it.

84
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,913
Oh, no. It's different
with him and Alice.

85
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,848
I mean, they really
got something.

86
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,418
- I mean, Peter and Claire...
- There's Peter right now.

87
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,620
- Peter, what's up, buddy?
- Ed! Eddie!

88
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,121
- Eddie!
- Edward!

89
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,689
That's right!

90
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,425
What should I call you now
that we're about to be related?

91
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,027
- Ed. - May I call you Eddie?
- Sure.

92
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,730
- I never really enjoyed saying
the name "Ed." -

93
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,365
Why the devil are you hiding
out over here,

94
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,099
you should be out celebrating,
shouldn't you?

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,001
I mean, after all,

96
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,837
you got the good sister.

97
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:35,107
I wouldn't say that.
Come on, Claire.

98
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,009
Claire is... you know.

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,311
Claire is...

100
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:43,015
- Yes, Claire is Claire.
- Claire.

101
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,917
- But Alice...
- Alice.

102
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,152
Alice is...

103
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,988
She's Alice, isn't she?

104
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,492
- Alice is Alice.
- You lucky fucker, you are.

105
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,928
Oh, Terry!
Excuse... Terry!

106
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,798
- His breath is pretty bad.
- No shit.

107
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,900
- British.
- Good God.

108
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,771
Hey! Carl, you wore your
fancy shirt for us.

109
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,906
You guys are my favorite couple.

110
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:07,907
Thank you very much.

111
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,009
Speaking of couples,
where's Amanda?

112
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,310
- Ooh.
- What?

113
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,580
She ditched me
for a guy with a job.

114
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,782
- I'm sorry...
- That hurts.

115
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,485
- Yeah. Ed didn't tell me that.
- I'm sorry.

116
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,252
- Uh...
- I'm sorry.

117
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,788
Claire wants to make
a toast for us.

118
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,656
No! No, not Claire!
Anybody but Claire!

119
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,157
Your sister's toasts are clunky.

120
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,759
They make people uncomfortable.

121
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,061
- It's her house, her toast.
- She cannot.

122
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,198
Hello, everyone.
I'm Claire. I'm the sister.

123
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,766
Hi.

124
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:37,269
Um, I just wanted to say
a few words about Alice and Ed.

125
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,674
Um, one of the things you
should know about Alice and Ed

126
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,745
is that they luckily
have the same taste in music.

127
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,647
Just one of the many advantages

128
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,549
they have as a couple.

129
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,085
Having the same taste
in music is very, um,

130
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,987
is a wonderful thing,

131
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:58,024
because the sounds of irritable
bowel syndrome can be deafening.

132
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,429
Or it is spastic colon...
honey?

133
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,699
It's hard to say.
There's so many problems.

134
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,704
But, you know, if I could
crank my Led Zeppelin,

135
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,573
perhaps I wouldn't
have this problem.

136
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,942
But it's just Chopin,
Chopin, Chopin.

137
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,744
I'm telling you,
Chopin's nocturnes

138
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,145
just ain't loud enough, sweetie.

139
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,313
OK?

140
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,016
So, I just wanted to say,

141
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,152
thank you all for coming today.

142
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,987
Here's to Ed and Alice.

143
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,657
They are the happiest
couple I know.

144
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,993
And um... thank God,
I have more money than they do,

145
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,628
or I would really
fucking hate them.

146
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,296
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

147
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,432
Cheers.

148
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,114
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

149
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,885
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Claire.

150
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:02,855
This? This?

151
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,591
Do you have anything
a woman might wear?

152
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,027
Hilarious.

153
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,199
I never had the balls to wear
this. Give it a shot.

154
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,739
Can I pull this off?

155
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,842
I've got a boner.

156
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,512
Eww.

157
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,425
Here, I want to fuck you.

158
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,901
I don't think they
know each other.

159
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:53,105
- You're kidding me.
- Mm-mm.

160
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:57,677
I had a feeling my life sucked,
now I know it does. God!

161
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,924
Wow. Wow.

162
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,561
Wow! Right there
on Claire's bed, huh?

163
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,328
Mm-hmm.

164
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,131
Geez, that's the most action
that bed's seen in a long time.

165
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,867
Wow.

166
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,002
Do you think that we
have a hot sex life?

167
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,138
- Our sex life is very hot.
- Yeah?

168
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,040
Very, very hot.

169
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,742
I don't know what was
in those tamales.

170
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,912
I feel like a garlic clove
took a dump in my mouth.

171
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,346
Why don't we ever
do anything like that?

172
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,949
Just, you know, sneak off
into some empty room

173
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,920
or a bathroom at a party
and just do it?

174
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,690
Alice, before we have sex,

175
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,124
you have to double lock
the front door

176
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,192
and set the alarm.

177
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,030
No, I don't.

178
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,766
Just one lock.

179
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,838
Do you feel good about being
with me the rest of your life?

180
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,274
Yeah, I wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

181
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,410
I just feel so boring.

182
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,978
I wish I had slept
with more people.

183
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, it's not as much fun
as you think.

184
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,117
You're not missing anything,
believe me.

185
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,754
Having sex with a bunch
of different people isn't fun?

186
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,423
It starts out as fun,

187
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:21,861
but it winds up being
a giant pain in the ass.

188
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,096
Casual sex, one-night stands.

189
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,965
You don't think I'd be
a more exciting person

190
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,668
if I'd had some of that?

191
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,538
What's going on?

192
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,374
I don't know, I just wish that
I'd had a little more history.

193
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,377
A few more experiences
so I wouldn't feel like

194
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,313
- I was missing out on anything.
- Missing out on anything?

195
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,050
Wait, everyone always feels
like they want more.

196
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,052
It's normal to feel that way.

197
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,622
Especially right before
you get married, of course.

198
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,627
But I've only been with...
three guys.

199
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:59,265
- You said I was your fifth.
- Yeah, I know, but I lied.

200
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,700
What?

201
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,203
Yeah, Doug wasn't what he said.

202
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,372
Hey, hey!

203
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,040
You don't have a penis.

204
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,342
My name is not Doug, either.

205
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,245
Oh, my God. What was that?

206
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:17,416
A lesbian senior who liked
to prey on innocent freshmen.

207
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,719
Oh, that's so weird.

208
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,620
- I know.
- All right, all right.

209
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,156
What about that...

210
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,892
There's that guy in college

211
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,226
you said you had
a one-night stand with.

212
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,929
Yeah, it didn't really last
a whole night.

213
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,107
Oh.
Why did you lie to me?

214
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,642
Because I just feel like
three guys is pathetic.

215
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,714
- I think that you're very sexy.
- Really?

216
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:50,783
Really, and...

217
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,186
I think you're really slutty.

218
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,890
Mm.

219
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,060
I would like to have sex
right now.

220
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,061
Mm.

221
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,930
But I'm kind of tired.

222
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,432
Good, something I ate
disagreed with me.

223
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,936
So I'm gonna go to bed.

224
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,012
Last night when I was
changing my dress,

225
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,182
I saw you with that waiter.

226
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,417
You saw us?

227
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,687
Yes, on the bed having sex. My
sister and I were in the closet.

228
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,157
- Watching?
- Yes.

229
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,126
What a turn-on.

230
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,431
What's it like to do that
with a stranger?

231
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,967
Oh, it's fun.

232
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,869
But don't take my word for it,
you should try it.

233
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,905
I can't, I'm engaged.

234
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,639
You can still love Ed
and get a wet pussy

235
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,144
because you like the way some
guy's cock bulges in his pants.

236
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,080
OK, everyone.

237
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:57,316
Come to a comfortable
sitting position,

238
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:01,821
close your eyes, and begin
your Ujjayi Pranayama.

239
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,537
We're still over.

240
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,473
Your cousins from Vermont,
can you guarantee me

241
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,309
if we invite them,
they won't show up?

242
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,614
I need to sleep
with other people.

243
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,818
Excuse me?

244
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,856
It wouldn't just be me
sleeping with other people,

245
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,590
you would get to, too.

246
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,760
I don't want to.
I don't think I do...

247
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,495
You're honestly saying you
wouldn't want to sleep

248
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,931
- with anyone else?
- I like sleeping with you.

249
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,899
Well, and I like
sleeping with you,

250
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,568
but, come on, don't
you see other women

251
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,403
out there during the day

252
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,039
and think about what it would
be like to have sex with them?

253
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,573
I don't wanna talk...

254
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,876
Just answer. Wouldn't you
like a little fresh pussy?

255
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,210
What? What are you doing?

256
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,712
Yeah. Yes, is that
what you wanna hear?

257
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,549
- Yeah, well, I mean...
- I wanna have sex with half the magazine covers here.

258
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,017
So then let's try it.

259
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,154
Just for a little while
and we can stop anytime.

260
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,588
How about we stop now?

261
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,390
How long are we going
to talk about this?

262
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,892
I don't want to!

263
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,861
I can't handle that,
and I know...

264
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:18,131
I know you can't
handle it. Yeah!

265
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,939
Ed. It can work. Ed!

266
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,042
If we can be mature
and honest and open,

267
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,711
- it can work.
- Are you...

268
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,181
It can work?

269
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,084
This may sound irrational
to you, Alice,

270
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,319
but I don't want you
sleeping with other men.

271
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,554
Ed, it's just sex. It doesn't
have to mean anything.

272
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,057
In fact the whole point
is that it's meaningless.

273
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,825
And it's not about love at all.

274
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,494
I know that I love you.

275
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,562
It's just something that
I need to get out of my system

276
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,300
and then, once we get married,
then that's it. It's forever.

277
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:58,237
You're not gonna be jealous when I
go and have sex with another woman?

278
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,838
- Mm-mm.
- You're not?

279
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,041
No, 'cause I know you love me,
so I can handle it.

280
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,176
You can handle it?
What about me?

281
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,413
I can't handle it. The mental picture
of you having sex with some guy,

282
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,015
- I can't handle that, Alice.
- Yes, you can, Ed.

283
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,216
- I just told you I can't.
- Yes, you can.

284
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,583
- I can't.
- You can.

285
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,885
I can!

286
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,753
Listen...

287
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:18,090
We can't stop each other
from experiencing life.

288
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:22,161
And the thing is, sweetie,
we're in a rut.

289
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,796
How are we in a rut?

290
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,665
Because we haven't had sex
in almost three weeks,

291
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,003
and we haven't had sex in the
daytime in almost three years.

292
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,472
I see that, we're in
a little bit of a rut,

293
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,408
but that doesn't make us any
different from anybody else.

294
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,110
Well...

295
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,347
We don't have to be like
everyone else.

296
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,917
All right, so we always
use condoms,

297
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,519
and never in this house. We don't
bring anyone into this house.

298
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,155
What about videos?
Can I make videos?

299
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:53,059
And we have to be completely
honest with each other

300
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,593
because we don't want
anyone coming between us.

301
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,063
Except the people we're
going to be having sex with?

302
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,464
Come on, it'll be an adventure.

303
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,799
An adventure?
Well, let's go skydiving.

304
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,168
Let's rob a bank.

305
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,536
OK, here's my list
of who's off limits.

306
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,174
- You made a list?
- Uh-huh.

307
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,378
You put your mother
on this list.

308
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,812
Yeah, I just wanted
to cover all the bases.

309
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,481
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

310
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,184
- Salma Hayek? This is insane.
- You could meet her.

311
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,818
Claire saw her at Whole Foods
last week.

312
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,453
What are you talk...

313
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,489
This list is the work
of someone that cannot deal

314
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,192
with me having sex
with other people.

315
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,727
Look at all these.

316
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,097
Look at this.

317
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,167
You're right.
You're right.

318
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,904
- Uh, no lists.
- No lists?

319
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,441
No lists. No jealousy. You know, I'd be
impressed if you had sex with Salma Hayek.

320
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,110
Oh, I'd be impressed if you
had sex with Salma Hayek.

321
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,544
I bet you would.

322
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,646
Now I'm just free to go out
into the world

323
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,482
and have sex with whoever
catches my eye?

324
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,321
- Yes, and so am I.
- I got that part.

325
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,225
OK. All right.

326
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,995
- I'm late for work, Alice.
- OK.

327
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,630
- OK?
- So...

328
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,765
Good, I think this is gonna be
really good for us.

329
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,501
I'm glad you think so.

330
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,672
Salma Hayek?

331
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,411
Are you really gonna let
him sleep with anyone he wants?

332
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,080
Mm-hmm.
I need to have some slut days.

333
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,082
How can I commit
to a life of monogamy

334
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,484
without ever having slut days?

335
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,754
Slut days are so unimportant
compared to what you and Ed have.

336
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,324
And take it from someone who's
had lots of meaningless sex,

337
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,527
you just wind up feeling spent
and all fucked out.

338
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,363
Really?

339
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,999
Alice, you can't let your fiancé sleep
with other women. You'll be jealous.

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,070
I don't think after five years,
I'm gonna feel jealous.

341
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,004
Just don't tell
anyone though, OK?

342
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,806
I won't tell anyone,

343
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,310
but this is the whitest
thing that I've ever heard.

344
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,280
You wanna know a secret?
It kind of turns me on.

345
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,182
That's because it doesn't
have a face

346
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,849
and a pair of double-Ds.

347
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,451
I'm not gonna feel threatened.

348
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,986
I doubt he's even
thinking of it.

349
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,422
I'm sure he's just going
through his day like always.

350
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,425
Mm-hmm.

351
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,460
Oh, my God, this script blows.

352
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,129
It's flat as a fucking pancake.

353
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,531
We're not throwing out
the whole script. This is funny.

354
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,433
- It's not funny for a second.
- It's very funny.

355
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,901
- Can we order dinner?
- No.

356
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,571
- It's freakin' hysterical.
- Stop. Ed. Ed!

357
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,640
What?

358
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,576
You gonna pitch some jokes,
or what's going on?

359
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:28,381
He's drawing big titty
naked girls.

360
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,383
Let me see.

361
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,952
Wow.

362
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,388
Yeah.

363
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,690
So, why don't you just
have an affair?

364
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,459
No, that's what my parents did.

365
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,895
Sneaking around, lying...
Who wants that?

366
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,565
Knock-knock.

367
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,669
- Who's that?
- That's Donald.

368
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,106
It's the contractor
that Tasha recommended.

369
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,208
He's cute.

370
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,743
Well, there's your guy.

371
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,011
- Go for it.
- What did you mean?

372
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,414
Yeah.

373
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,316
I don't have to worry about you,

374
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,220
because you don't have the guts
to go through with it.

375
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,292
We're doing zoysia here.

376
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,161
Three flats,
you think that's enough?

377
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,763
Oh, make it five. There's a
spot on the side of the house

378
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,431
- I wanna use it for also.
- All right, five it is.

379
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,001
Uh... Hold on, this pen is done.
I'll get a new one.

380
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,837
Mm-hmm.

381
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,015
What was...

382
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,850
What...

383
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,220
Are you trying to kiss me?

384
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:45,123
Yeah, it was sort of
an experiment.

385
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,059
OK, I'm open to an experiment.

386
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,731
Now that I have a heads up,
I think we can do much better.

387
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,714
Oh, honey, that looks gorgeous.

388
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,748
Thank you.

389
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,783
Home grown,
except for the mushrooms.

390
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,685
Oh, you know what? They're
shooting my script this week,

391
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,256
and I wanted to tell you
because Marty wanted me...

392
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,758
- You look really pretty.
- I do?

393
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,861
- Yeah, you do.
- Thank you.

394
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:23,796
You have a glow.

395
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,798
Well, I made out
with someone today.

396
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:32,571
- What?
- I made out someone.

397
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,573
You made out with someone,
like you made out...

398
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,210
- Made out.
- Made out, made out.

399
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,980
Well, you don't waste
any time, Alice, did you?

400
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,616
The opportunity just
sort of presented itself.

401
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,184
You had someone lined up.

402
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,919
- Oh, my...
- No. No, I didn't.

403
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,790
You didn't? You...
Oh, my God! I'm so stupid!

404
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,359
What?

405
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,660
You trick me into this
bullshit arrangement

406
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,961
because you had some
guy lined up.

407
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,763
No, Ed, I didn't.
I met this guy today.

408
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,365
- For the first time.
- Today?

409
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,300
- Yes.
- Who?

410
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,769
The contractor from
the Kelner job.

411
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,337
Would you like to hear
about what happened?

412
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,672
What?

413
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,240
Do you wanna hear
about what happened?

414
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,309
I don't know.
I don't know!

415
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,044
This is so fucking weird, Alice.

416
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,480
Sure.

417
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,214
OK, well, I did something
that I always wanted to do.

418
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,649
I was aggressive.

419
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,387
And before I knew it,
I was totally kissing this guy.

420
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,355
And I felt really sexy.

421
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:27,226
It was... It was hot.

422
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,932
You liked it?

423
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:38,705
Mm-mm.
I did.

424
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,285
I told you this would work.

425
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,822
Remember, you're allowed
to do it, too.

426
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:01,027
I accept.

427
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,063
I don't wanna give you
too many details,

428
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,832
but let me just say last night
was ridiculous.

429
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,601
I haven't had sex like that,
ever, ever in my life!

430
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,603
- Ever!
- I love it!

431
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,104
I got a fucking hard on
right now.

432
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,940
Stop. Ew!

433
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,776
- I think it's crazy.
- Carl, give it a rest.

434
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,578
He's obviously not giving
Alice what she wants,

435
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,714
and if he gets to benefit
from that, then let him.

436
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,484
What did you mean I'm not
giving Alice what she wants?

437
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,353
I'm on your side, all right.

438
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:28,820
All I'm saying is the reality
of the situation is

439
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,656
you're making a ton of dough,

440
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,724
you're surrounded by all these
actresses with huge, fake tits,

441
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:37,963
I say enjoy the river of snatch
that flows to your cock.

442
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,766
This is the advice that
you give to your friend

443
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,769
when he's about to marry
the woman that he loves?

444
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,607
You are doomed.
Enjoy your lonely death, man.

445
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,444
I don't see anybody
sucking your cock, Carl.

446
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,547
You think maybe I'm inadequate?

447
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,417
So you're inadequate,
who cares? Use it.

448
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,686
Don't listen to him, Ed,
he doesn't have human feelings.

449
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,287
It's just Alice never
said anything

450
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,722
about me being inadequate.

451
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,557
Yeah, your mate usually doesn't
bring that up.

452
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,393
They come up with shit
like seeing other people

453
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,994
to make your sex life better.

454
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,729
You don't have to see
other people

455
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,764
to make your sex life better.

456
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,767
Rent a porno. Buy some
new sheets. Something.

457
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,869
Non-monogamy is man's
natural state.

458
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,972
God created us
to want to fuck around.

459
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,642
I say go with God.

460
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,678
What does she want?
Yeah, hello?

461
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,215
You know where that is? Because he needs
to be walked more than once a fucking day.

462
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,950
OK, he's a dog not a toy.

463
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,553
Soon he's gonna have a fatter
ass than you.

464
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,154
Yep. You know what...

465
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,390
Right back...

466
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,727
Yeah, I'm still here. I'm in the
fucking studio, OK? I'm working.

467
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,895
Look at the rack on that.

468
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,398
The fact of the matter is
B's depressed,

469
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,733
and I blame you for that.

470
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,735
The dog needs structure.
He needs structure.

471
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,336
He can't just go to
a fucking shrink like you

472
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,371
and pay $200 a week to get
some little fucking green pill

473
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,074
to make him happy. All right?

474
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,811
I don't know how they can make
postal worker outfits in hot.

475
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,312
Did I just say that?

476
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,749
That was so lame, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

477
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,684
- Aren't you engaged?
- Correct.

478
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,786
And yet you're flirting with me.

479
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,521
That's so unusual in Hollywood,
I know.

480
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,058
Yeah, but I've been
on the show three times now,

481
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,126
and you've never flirted
with me before,

482
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,895
or even talked to me.

483
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,465
Well, I'm busy.
I'm really busy.

484
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,699
Because you know,
I write the show

485
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,300
and then I'm writing
this movie now.

486
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,703
- Oh.
- I should talk to you about it.

487
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,707
But, you know, my fiancée
came up with this idea

488
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,742
that we should see other
people until we get married,

489
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,544
and she already made out
with this guy.

490
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,612
Ouch.

491
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,214
Yeah, it's completely like...

492
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,816
bananas but...

493
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,851
my agent, Lou...
Did you ever meet Lou?

494
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,887
- Mm-mm.
- I should introduce you to Lou.

495
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,922
He's producing this movie, too.

496
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,858
He said that maybe she
came up with this idea

497
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,394
because I'm inadequate,
and I don't please her.

498
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,263
Which is, trust me,
completely ridiculous.

499
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:57,469
But ever since he said that maybe I'm
inadequate, I can't get that out of my head.

500
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,337
- Mm.
- You know?

501
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,173
Strange.

502
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:08,480
This is horrible.
This has never happened before.

503
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,416
I always get a hard on.
Always.

504
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:15,453
I guess I'm... I haven't had sex with
anyone except my fiancé in so long,

505
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,888
I'm probably just nervous.

506
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,389
This is...

507
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,391
I'm just nervous.

508
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,393
I think I know why your fiancée

509
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,995
thinks you're inadequate.

510
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:27,032
I just said this has
never happened before.

511
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,735
Oh, I know, I know.

512
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,504
I just don't believe you.

513
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,574
Maybe you're gay.

514
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,078
- Hey.
- Hey, how was the...

515
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,616
...taping?
I guess it was good, huh?

516
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,852
I'm just glad to be home
with you.

517
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:50,221
Feel these sheets. I got them
today, 250-thread count.

518
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,191
I think I like them better
than the 353 count.

519
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,593
Oh, they're great sheets.

520
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,295
Oh! Um...

521
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,835
Donald,
this is a really nice place.

522
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,971
Do you rent or own?

523
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,974
Listen, if you don't want
to do this, it's totally fine.

524
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,042
Do I seem like I don't want
to do this? I do.

525
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,979
- You just seem a little tense.
- No, I'm not tense, OK?

526
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,616
Where's the bathroom?
Great.

527
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,789
You can do it.
You just have to be wild, OK?

528
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,993
Just be wild.
Please be wild.

529
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,362
Just going to be totally wild.

530
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:36,235
Wild. Uh-huh. Wild.

531
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,306
Hey, Alice, wait.

532
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,644
You forgot these.

533
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,679
- Thank you.
- Oh...

534
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,415
I really wish I hadn't
worn those.

535
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,417
- I need to see you again.
- OK, I'll call you.

536
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,885
- Can I cook you dinner?
- Sure.

537
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,486
Awesome.

538
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,388
Great.

539
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,558
Bye!

540
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:09,067
Uh, I can't believe
you had a nooner.

541
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,068
Believe it.

542
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,903
And he wants to make dinner
for me.

543
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,172
Ugh, what a cheeseball.

544
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,341
You should see his arms.

545
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:20,947
And I don't even
know his last name.

546
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:23,982
OK, great, Alice.

547
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,450
But I don't know why
I'm busting my ass

548
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,018
picking out
bridesmaids' dresses for you.

549
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,654
It sounds like
the wedding is off.

550
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,455
For your information,

551
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:33,159
Ed and I have been having the
best sex we've had in years.

552
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:35,695
Really?

553
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,400
Alice told Ed that she
wants to fuck other people

554
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,636
before they get married.

555
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,137
- No.
- Yeah.

556
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,173
No, Alice?
This was Alice's idea?

557
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,041
- I know.
- It can't be.

558
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,510
She's too good and sweet and...

559
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,912
Yeah, I guess good,
sweet little Alice

560
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,815
wants to be dirty,
bad little Alice.

561
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,217
My God, I can't believe that.

562
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,687
Why does it bother you?
What do you care?

563
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,622
Of course I care.
Of course I care.

564
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,658
I mean, my God,
what is she thinking?

565
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,226
People can't have everything.

566
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,129
I mean, what, is she just
going to sleep with whoever?

567
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,999
- Whoever comes down the pike?
- I guess.

568
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,702
Goddamn, that's ridiculous.

569
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,905
It's fucking ridiculous!

570
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,075
Jesus Christ!

571
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,113
I made this for you, Peter.
It's all organic.

572
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,949
I grew it in my garden
just for you.

573
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,952
I want you to eat it off
my tits and then do me.

574
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:37,289
Alice, oh, Alice.

575
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:43,830
Alice, Alice, Alice.

576
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,666
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi. Traffic.

577
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,202
Jeez!

578
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:55,573
- You're in a good mood.
- I am, I am.

579
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,742
I had a really interesting
day today.

580
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,576
What happened?

581
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,479
Well, I had lunch with Donald.

582
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,048
You know, the contractor?

583
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,019
And we...
had meaningless sex.

584
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,724
Ed, I did it.
I finally did it.

585
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,794
Are you OK?

586
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:19,799
Yeah... yeah.

587
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,702
Because this is what
we were doing, right?

588
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,405
Right. I just...

589
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,743
I don't think I thought
it would really happen.

590
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,849
Well...
you know I love you.

591
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,452
Yeah, I'm really feeling it.

592
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,801
You know, Alice is
all sexed up and turned on,

593
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,168
and that's great, you know?

594
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,137
It's really,
really loosened her up.

595
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,206
But I'm not going to sit at home

596
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,874
while she's out getting
loosened up!

597
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,776
I'm going to get
loosened up too!

598
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,312
I'm getting loosened up.

599
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,280
I couldn't get
an erection, Carl.

600
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,783
Do you know what that means?
I could not get an erection.

601
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:14,019
I'm not going out that way.

602
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,521
Are you sure you're
in the mood for a party?

603
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,025
I'm in the mood.

604
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,762
It's really great
to see you tonight.

605
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,364
Where's Alice?

606
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,266
You look fantastic.

607
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,267
Did you and Alice
come separately?

608
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,403
What do you say later we go
someplace quiet alone.

609
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,372
Are we meeting Alice?

610
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,142
You goth types,
I didn't know you drank beer.

611
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,277
I thought it was more like
bat's milk and blood.

612
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,382
Oh, that was lame.

613
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,251
You're gonna walk away,
aren't ya?

614
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,855
Hey, I work in television.

615
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,795
Are you sure Larry's OK
with us being in his bedroom?

616
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,931
No, no. He's fine with it.

617
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,806
So that's it? We're only
staying 20 minutes?

618
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,609
I used to get women, Carl.
You remember?

619
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,810
I got women all the time.

620
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,046
But now, nothing.

621
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,814
Who cares about these
other women?

622
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,949
You've got Alice.

623
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,151
I care.
I really care

624
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,320
I care because I can't get them.

625
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,156
I'm a hunter, I want to know
that if I go out on the hunt

626
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,559
that I can, you know, return
with some fucking meat!

627
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,064
I want meat.
Meat for the whole village.

628
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:38,937
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,771
Oh, God.

630
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,573
I'm sorry.

631
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,841
I'm sorry, too.

632
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,276
No, I've been thinking about it.

633
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,312
Maybe we should just
forget this whole plan.

634
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:50,815
No, no, no!
No, no, no...

635
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,417
What did you mean?

636
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,919
You... you're right,
this is not good for us.

637
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,820
You've been gone
for almost two hours.

638
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:59,024
Well, I've been driving around.
You know, thinking... a lot.

639
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,225
Why should I have
a problem with this?

640
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,759
Because I know you love me.

641
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,361
But you're not into it.

642
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,163
I mean, you haven't even tried
to sleep with anyone.

643
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:07,065
I know.
I've been really busy.

644
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,267
So preoccupied with work.

645
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,868
I can try to get into it.

646
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,903
For us, for you...

647
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,138
No, no, no...

648
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,539
You were right,
I've been stupid.

649
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,574
No one said it
was gonna be easy on us.

650
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,709
Let's try it.

651
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,478
Until when?

652
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:24,715
I don't know, until...
until you think you're ready.

653
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,120
Until you've had the
experience that you need.

654
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,291
OK?

655
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,229
- You're getting it this time.
- Bring it on.

656
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,999
- Oh, bring it on, huh?
- Yeah, bring it on!

657
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,802
So you had sex with the actress
who plays the postal worker.

658
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,538
- You're hurt?
- No, I don't know if I'm hurt,

659
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,942
I'm... intrigued.

660
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,211
So, how did it happen?

661
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,047
- The sex?
- The whole thing.

662
00:31:56,048 --> 00:32:00,251
The sex to... talking
to her into the sex.

663
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,155
Yeah. I want to know what
the dynamic was like.

664
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,324
Did you know you were
gonna have sex with her

665
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,626
from the second you saw her?

666
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,161
I don't know.

667
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,397
- Come on, Ed, tell me.
- I don't know.

668
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,232
- Come on, just tell me.
- I don't know.

669
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,600
I feel like we're turning
into weird perverts.

670
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,736
No, it's not perverted,
it's interesting.

671
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,205
I'm curious.

672
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:24,042
You know, five days ago,
I felt like I hadn't

673
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,276
had any life experiences,

674
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,078
and if I had been diagnosed
with cancer,

675
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,480
I would've felt like
I hadn't lived.

676
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,782
Did you just compare marrying me
to being diagnosed with cancer?

677
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,720
No, I'm just saying that we
need to get rid of our hang-ups.

678
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:38,257
So I want to know the details.

679
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,227
But, first...

680
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,397
I want to have sex.

681
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,631
Claire wanted to go
shopping today.

682
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:56,734
Is that all right? I know we
talked about going to LACMA.

683
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:57,968
No, it's fine, actually.

684
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,637
I'm... I'm gonna help Carl
with some lyrics.

685
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,206
- He's got a new song.
- Mm.

686
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,642
- I'm going to his house.
- OK.

687
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,162
...writers on the staff
who won't laugh

688
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,097
unless it's their name
on the script.

689
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,267
But we can talk
about this later.

690
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:44,915
I'm losing you a little bit.
Uh-huh.

691
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,417
Lou, Venita.
You know Claire.

692
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,420
- Yes, we've met.
- Strong grip there, honey.

693
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,822
Let me call you back.

694
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,024
OK, so, Carl,
what's this all about?

695
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,993
Yeah, what's the huge emergency?

696
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:59,864
We think that we should have an
intervention for Ed and Alice.

697
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,802
An intervention?

698
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,272
Why? Because they're
having too much fun? Stop!

699
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,873
They think they're having fun.

700
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,041
They don't really
see what's happening.

701
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,543
And they're drifting apart.

702
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,313
Yeah, they spend all their
time with other people.

703
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,114
Carl, you know,
you really need to relax.

704
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,849
Ed says it's working.

705
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,152
Ed is becoming a sex addict.

706
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:23,521
And Alice,
she spends all her time

707
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,823
with the contractor
from the Kelner job.

708
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,158
I feel for them. I do.

709
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,795
Boo-hoo. My contractor has
a big dick and he uses it.

710
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,803
Nice laugh.
Really.

711
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,971
We are not going to stand by
and watch

712
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,041
as two people that we care
about destroy something great.

713
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,310
That's right.

714
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,911
Their relationship
is meant to last.

715
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,880
It's... it's a rock.

716
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,516
That's right.

717
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,251
Sweetie, I don't mean
to be an asshole,

718
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,721
but really, aren't they doing
what we all wish we could do?

719
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,256
Yes!

720
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,325
- No!
- No!

721
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,059
I say yes.

722
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,761
I don't know about you, they're
having a fuck-a-thon over there.

723
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,363
Sounds like it beats
couples' therapy.

724
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,397
Sure as hell is cheaper.

725
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,735
Nice laugh, really.

726
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,604
Can I go now, Carl?

727
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,353
What kind of music you like?

728
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,654
Do you like Mariah Carey?

729
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:32,490
Country? Reba McEntire?
That kind of thing?

730
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:36,894
I peg you as a Reba
McEntire fan, am I wrong?

731
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,596
OK, let's not even
worry about that.

732
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:41,266
This is a good stereo,
but that's all.

733
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:44,502
Now, I think I'd like
to move you up in something

734
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:45,936
which is a little bit
more expensive,

735
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,105
but gives you
a much fuller dynamic,

736
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,275
you know, highs and lows.

737
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:53,077
How much is the next step up?

738
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,712
Listen to me, for $150,

739
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,347
Mariah Carey's gonna sound...

740
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,449
You're not gonna believe it.

741
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,719
If you really wanna hear Mariah blasting
those things, that thing that she does,

742
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,421
you gotta go up here.
You're gonna get...

743
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:06,692
You'll get a bunch of useless
knobs you'll never use.

744
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,727
What kind of room do you see
this being played in?

745
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,897
In a dining room, or living room
or bedroom, bathroom, kitchen...

746
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,499
What do you see?

747
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,334
What does that have to do
with anything?

748
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,135
You know, I just, I...

749
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:22,773
I don't think I need
such an expensive stereo.

750
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,042
- I'm just...
- Of course you don't.

751
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,243
You want something simple.

752
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,213
You turn it on,
you press play, right?

753
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,850
Exactly.

754
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,558
OK, what do you want to hear?

755
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,430
Oh. Jake, what
do you want to hear?

756
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,468
Um, something pretty?

757
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,411
Oh, my.
That sounds so beautiful.

758
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,813
Isn't that great, Jake?

759
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,583
Yeah, buddy, now you
can crank your Ludacris,

760
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,353
drive your mom crazy, huh?

761
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:17,261
That's not the way you're
supposed to behave

762
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,498
in front of guests!

763
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,907
Do you want something to drink?

764
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,677
Milk.

765
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,613
I have that.

766
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,794
Oh, he's...

767
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:53,197
He's having a hard time
with the divorce.

768
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,066
Of course, he blames me.

769
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,936
Well, do you have to
hang these pictures up?

770
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:04,376
Don't you think they kind of...
bring morale down a bit?

771
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:09,179
Yes.

772
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,785
But I'm trying to be accepting
of his feelings.

773
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:23,461
You seem like a real good mom.

774
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:26,598
Oh, thanks.

775
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,066
- Mr. Ed.
- Johnny.

776
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,334
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?

777
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:31,769
Very well.

778
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,370
- They know you.
- I come here all the time.

779
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,020
You know what,
this isn't going to work.

780
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,322
You don't want
to sit by your wife?

781
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,292
- I, uh...
- No, it's fine.

782
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,695
Stay at this table, it's fine.

783
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,631
- Really?
- Yeah, we're adults.

784
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,735
Ed, Donald.
Donald, Ed.

785
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,837
How's it going?

786
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,839
- I'll just go ahead...
- No, no, no, no...

787
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,941
It's OK, John.
Thank you.

788
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,643
It's two. It's nice...

789
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,914
- Just, can I have a...
- Yeah...

790
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:29,159
Ah, Lauren, Alice, Donald.

791
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,761
Hi, Lauren.

792
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,063
You're his fiancée?

793
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:37,768
- This is too weird.
- It's crazy.

794
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,838
You know, you should try
the lobster risotto.

795
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:43,474
- I don't want it.
- If I get it, will you try it?

796
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,042
- No.
- Not even one bite?

797
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,712
She doesn't like
shellfish, Donald.

798
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:50,748
I just think she could
be a little more adventurous.

799
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:54,251
Not that she isn't
extremely adventurous.

800
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,786
What's that suppose to mean?

801
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,222
- This is too weird.
- I know, it's OK.

802
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,490
I promise you, it's OK.

803
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,858
What's that supposed to mean?

804
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,392
It just means the
lobster risotto's fantastic.

805
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,029
She doesn't like it.

806
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,132
Are you sure?

807
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,936
Excuse me. I got to go
to the bathroom.

808
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,872
Be right back.

809
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:18,776
This is so weird.

810
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,077
It's fine.
Can we get some bread?

811
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,579
You want some bread?
Bread's good.

812
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,080
What's he mean?
She's adventurous?

813
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,282
- It was a stupid comment.
- I agree.

814
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,818
What the hell are you two doing that
he knows you're adventurous now?

815
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,253
Nothing, it was
a stupid comment.

816
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,288
How many nights a week do
you see this guy, Alice?

817
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,523
You brought her.

818
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,924
But this doesn't mean anything.

819
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,259
Excuse me?

820
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,462
You know, I told you my
entire situation before.

821
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,864
Please, this is my fiancée.

822
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:44,870
I'm not playing
your weird games!

823
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,471
Bye!

824
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,306
And I'm not going to seat here
and be humiliated

825
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,275
in my favorite restaurant
where they know my name.

826
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:54,144
Your favorite restaurant?
It's my favorite restaurant!

827
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,614
I found it in the Zagat
and you had to bring him!

828
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,215
You brought her!

829
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,051
Because I didn't think
you'd bring him!

830
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,695
Thank you, sir.

831
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,100
Donald, excuse me. I just need
to go ask Ed something.

832
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,036
Gotcha.

833
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,471
How many women
have you slept with?

834
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,140
- Five.
- Five?

835
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,442
You're mad at me and you're
talking five women.

836
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,211
I'm doing what we're
suppose be doing, Alice.

837
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,913
You said we should see
other people.

838
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,280
You're seeing other person.

839
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,982
You're having a
goddamn relationship.

840
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,951
Don't you think I wanna
be sleeping with other people?

841
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,686
Instead, you are sleeping
with other people,

842
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,221
and you've already slept
with enough people.

843
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,024
I don't even know
what that means.

844
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,192
- It's not my fault!
- Yeah, it is, kinda.

845
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,229
Because it's really impossible to sleep with
other people when we're living together.

846
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,864
You know, it makes things
really difficult.

847
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,466
Oh, my God! I'm really
sorry about that, Alice!

848
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:52,236
Is there anything else I can do to
make your life more accommodable?

849
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,404
Maybe I can blow my
fucking brains out!

850
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,207
Where is my car?

851
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,543
You're being ridiculous.

852
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,112
Hmm.

853
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,683
Just for a little while,
sweetie,

854
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,286
and it will make our wedding
night that much more exciting.

855
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:13,190
How'd we get there, Alice, OK?

856
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,559
Because although I may not
be in direct touch

857
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,427
with the feeling right now,

858
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,330
I know that I love you.

859
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,233
And I love you, too.

860
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,209
I'll call you later!

861
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,381
It's gonna be
a lot easier to get laid

862
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:39,516
without Alice looking over
my shoulder all the time.

863
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:42,052
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on, step in, step in.

864
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,154
Poppy's got an eye infection,
and I don't want her to get out.

865
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,925
Whoa! It's OK, girl. It's OK.

866
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,962
- It's 37 inches.
- OK.

867
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,731
So now Donald calls me
15 times a day,

868
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,165
and anytime I'm on the computer,

869
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,867
he sends me an instant message.

870
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,435
I thought the whole point

871
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,270
was for you to have sex
with several different people,

872
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,639
- not just Donald.
- Yes, it was. It was.

873
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,508
I don't know.

874
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,310
I don't think you can have sex
with lots of people at once.

875
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,113
Maybe you could only
have sex with one person.

876
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:12,249
It was Ed, now it's Donald.

877
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,151
But I have to make it
into the double digits.

878
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,453
This is my last chance
to be a slut.

879
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,822
Knock-knock.

880
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:21,491
- Hi, Donald.
- Hi, Donald.

881
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,961
What are you doing here?

882
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:26,898
I just wanted to stop by
and say hi.

883
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:32,402
Nice. OK, I'll go away.

884
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,572
Donald, it's really not
a good time right now.

885
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,909
So you don't want to hang out?

886
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,344
Not really.

887
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,279
Well, I was just in
the neighborhood,

888
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,315
so I thought I'd
come by and say hi.

889
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,853
- Hi.
- Hi.

890
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,289
You know, I've got this great
bottle of cab at home,

891
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,327
and some salmon steaks,
maybe go grill them up?

892
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,898
No, no...

893
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,834
You look really cute today.

894
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:05,937
Donald, please.

895
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:09,273
Are you sure?
I can make a great...

896
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,942
- Yeah. No, I'm pretty sure.
- ...guacamole?

897
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,144
- Fresh avocados.
- Donald.

898
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,213
You get those jeans at the Gap?

899
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,949
Donald!

900
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,992
You OK, Lou?

901
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:31,695
Yeah, just my allergies
are killing me.

902
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,563
What are you allergic to,
pollen?

903
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,865
No, cats.

904
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,268
Cats?

905
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:42,739
Yeah. It's OK. It's OK.

906
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,674
- You're allergic to cats?
- Yep.

907
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,543
Maybe you're not the type of guy

908
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:48,612
that shoulda went out
and bought all these cats.

909
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,116
I love these cats!

910
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:53,617
It's not their fault.

911
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,786
It's not their fault
I'm allergic to them.

912
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,221
What's the matter with you?

913
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,123
Take it easy,
don't go crazy on me.

914
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,390
Oh, crazy.

915
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,026
These cats didn't kick me
out of the house

916
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:04,128
so they could have sex
with other cats, did they?

917
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,897
She did not kick me
out of the house, Lou.

918
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:09,867
Fine, whatever.
She politely asked you to leave

919
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,668
so she could go get banged
by some strangers.

920
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,880
Ed, what are you doing
here? You scared me.

921
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,015
- I knew it!
- What are you doing?

922
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:26,851
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.

923
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:28,318
I get the granny panties,

924
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,087
the ones with the period stains
and the broken elastic,

925
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,521
- but not Donald!
- Stop it!

926
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,357
Donald gets lace!

927
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:35,692
You never bought
this stuff for me, Alice!

928
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,294
You can't come here
and do this, please.

929
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,429
You know what?
Give me the ones you're wearing!

930
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,965
What?

931
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,366
Give me the ones
you're wearing right now!

932
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:46,437
- Give them to me.
- I'm not wearing any.

933
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,841
What?

934
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,246
Why wouldn't you wear
any underpants?

935
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,249
I wanted to see if it felt sexy.

936
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,086
Yeah? Does it?

937
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,454
Yeah, it does.

938
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,224
Sexy.

939
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,069
I miss you, Alice.

940
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,238
I miss you, too.

941
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,741
- Really?
- Yeah, I miss you.

942
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,247
Can we invite Donald
to our wedding?

943
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,950
That's not funny, of course not!

944
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,052
It's funny!

945
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:38,288
Can we stop this?
This is stupid!

946
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:41,125
I've been living at Lou's
house for three weeks.

947
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:43,593
Three weeks! Everyone we
know thinks we're crazy!

948
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:47,497
You wanna know why? Because
we're fucking crazy doing this!

949
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:53,904
Hey, Alice,
you weren't answering yourself.

950
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:55,872
It's Donald.

951
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,376
Sitting here feeling kinda low,
got a glass of white zin.

952
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,411
Thinking about you.

953
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,580
He's listening to
girl music, this guy.

954
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,682
This guy... This is how
you sow your wild oats?

955
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:07,284
Ed.

956
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,886
- Ed, don't...
- It's OK. It's all right.

957
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:14,024
Hey, Donald, buddy,
I'm here for you. It's Ed.

958
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:16,193
Ed, Alice's fiancé.

959
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:20,397
The guy she just got done
having hot sex with.

960
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,433
He doesn't wanna talk to me?

961
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:26,203
Donald, it's not really
a good time, OK?

962
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:28,372
See, Ed, this is exactly
why we can't stop right now,

963
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,374
because I've only slept
with Donald,

964
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,775
and I can't only sleep
with Donald.

965
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:35,579
I need to get away from Donald
so that I can be wild.

966
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,881
If you can just...
a little bit, Ed.

967
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,049
Come on, it's easy for you,

968
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,917
you've had lots of
meaningless sex.

969
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,586
Yeah, that's the whole point.

970
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,554
It's meaningless.

971
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,092
I can't stand it,
it's so meaningless.

972
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,135
Donald?

973
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,372
Are you crying, Donald?

974
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,448
- Hey.
- Hey.

975
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,171
Whiskers! Get out!

976
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,108
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

977
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:14,144
I just found this under the bed.

978
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:15,979
Rebecca's favorite pair
of shoes.

979
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:21,818
She said she liked the
way it made her ass look.

980
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,554
I'll never forget
the look on her face

981
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:27,023
when Buster chewed these up
and then she hit the roof.

982
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:37,434
I really thought
we had something, Ed.

983
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,603
I thought she was the one, man.

984
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,878
Hey... Come on, man.

985
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,081
Lou.

986
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,649
Lou, come on, buddy.

987
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,485
You dumped
hundreds of girls, man.

988
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:59,556
Lou! You've dumped so many
girls, it's unbelievable.

989
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:03,127
So one dumped you,
what's the big deal, right?

990
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:07,265
Come on, man.
What's the big deal?

991
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:13,170
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Who gives a shit?

992
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,406
Let's go get some
fucking breakfast.

993
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,708
Pigs in a blanket
and hash browns for me.

994
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,845
Isn't this a great way
to start the day?

995
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,748
Here you go.
Are you guys ready to order?

996
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,616
That was not squeezed
on the small machine,

997
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:30,086
I specifically asked for juice
squeezed on the small machine.

998
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,188
- It was...
- Hey!

999
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,356
I need juice to start my day,

1000
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:34,358
and I need it squeezed fresh.

1001
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:35,959
That means right now
on the small machine.

1002
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,294
It doesn't come from a bottle,

1003
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:38,528
it doesn't come from a can,

1004
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:39,696
it doesn't come from
a container.

1005
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,097
It comes from fucking fruit,

1006
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,666
the little orange thing
in the kitchen?

1007
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,001
- Lou, what's the big deal?
- It is a big deal!

1008
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,670
All right. The sour one's
gonna fuck up my stomach.

1009
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,104
In fact, can you get it out of
my sight please,

1010
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,640
and give me what I asked for?

1011
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:53,311
I'm gonna keep mine.
It's excellent.

1012
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:05,355
I'm really sorry he
yelled at you like that.

1013
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:10,527
It's OK. We get a lot of
Hollywood assholes in here.

1014
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,763
I hate when I let them
get to me.

1015
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,666
Right.

1016
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,868
You seem sad.

1017
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,906
I seem sad? You're the
one that's crying.

1018
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,676
No, I mean really sad.

1019
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:37,120
- I'm Sandy.
- Hi, Sandy, I'm Ed.

1020
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,590
Hi.

1021
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,530
Mom, I want more pancakes!

1022
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:50,033
Are you sure you want
more pancakes? You've had ten.

1023
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,668
I'm hungry.

1024
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,804
I'm not making you more
unless you're gonna eat more.

1025
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:56,774
I'm still hungry.

1026
00:52:57,942 --> 00:52:59,477
Fine.

1027
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:07,183
Actually, I'm full.

1028
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,787
- I cracked the egg!
- I'm full!

1029
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,322
Do you think
that I'm your slave,

1030
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:15,559
that I exist
to waste food on you!

1031
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,726
Hey, I'll eat the egg.

1032
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,728
You know what?
No more seconds.

1033
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,964
No more seconds anymore
for the rest of your life

1034
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:22,732
for the rest of the time
that you live in this house!

1035
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,835
Do you un... Oh, I'm so sorry,
honey. Come here.

1036
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,672
I'm sorry. Oh, man! I'm sorry.

1037
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:30,440
I don't mean to lose my temper.

1038
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:33,878
Jake, Carl, do you please
accept my apology?

1039
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:43,653
Your mom's having a tough time.

1040
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:46,857
Maybe that's because
you wrestle her every night.

1041
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:52,763
I'm gonna go make that egg.

1042
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,434
I can't believe
she wants to get rid of

1043
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:58,635
these mature plantings.

1044
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,169
I mean they're so beautiful.

1045
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,107
She wants to devalue the house
for the divorce settlement.

1046
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,810
Yeah, but then the plants
are caught in the middle.

1047
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,878
I know.

1048
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,347
It's Donald.
I don't believe this.

1049
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:13,851
He is so needy.
It's suffocating.

1050
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,222
- Donald.
- Alice.

1051
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:22,359
Hi, are you...

1052
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,560
I didn't know you
were working here.

1053
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,795
So I guess this
is just a coincidence?

1054
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:27,464
It's, uh...

1055
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,999
Donny, right on time!

1056
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,970
I have something for you,
and I know you're gonna like it.

1057
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,378
We'll talk later.

1058
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:46,883
Guess he's a little needier
than you thought.

1059
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,218
You're seeing three
other women besides me?

1060
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,921
Look, I love women,

1061
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:54,524
and Elise is going through
a very difficult time right now.

1062
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:58,027
She's... a very sexy woman,
but she's feeling undesirable.

1063
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,598
- I can't believe this.
- Hey, you're engaged.

1064
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,367
Yes, and you know I'm engaged.

1065
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:05,569
I didn't know that you're
seeing other people.

1066
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,438
I didn't think you'd care. You
never even stay over my house.

1067
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,274
Can't you get one of these other
women to stay over your house?

1068
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:12,642
Sometimes, but...

1069
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,611
I don't like sleeping
alone at night.

1070
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:17,547
Oh, my God.
You are so needy!

1071
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,583
And for some reason,
I'm feeling jealous.

1072
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:22,452
I mean this is absolutely crazy. I don't
even like you, and I'm feeling jealous.

1073
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:23,853
Really? You're jealous?

1074
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:25,722
I'm suppose to be out
having adventures,

1075
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:27,824
but now I'm stuck
with this guy who bugs me

1076
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,693
and is sneaking around
behind my back.

1077
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:31,895
Look, if you're asking
for a commitment...

1078
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:33,763
- What?
- I don't know if I'm ready.

1079
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,532
I'm not asking
for commitment, Donald,

1080
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,100
I am breaking up with you, OK?

1081
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:40,571
I'm breaking up with
whatever this is that we have.

1082
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:48,177
Don't do this to me!

1083
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:51,781
Yes. Oh.

1084
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:54,217
Can I ask you something without
you taking it the wrong way?

1085
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:55,652
I hope so.

1086
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,654
Isn't it kind of strange

1087
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,288
what you and your fiancée
are doing?

1088
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,191
Come on, anything else.
I don't wanna talk about that.

1089
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,627
- Come on.
- Shoot.

1090
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:05,962
But you are getting married.

1091
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,064
November third.

1092
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,535
Does that bother you?

1093
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:13,202
No.

1094
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,406
Yay!

1095
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,875
Yes!

1096
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:22,145
I'm sorry, but somebody had to
take you out of your misery.

1097
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:24,047
Oh.

1098
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,515
You're doing it.

1099
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:27,551
OK, let's go again.

1100
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,556
Hey.

1101
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:33,990
I gotta start making this cake

1102
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,759
if we're gonna have it
by dessert.

1103
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,861
Some old lady said
it was really cute

1104
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,664
that I was buying cake flour.

1105
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,705
It's from Jake.

1106
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,842
"Dear Penelope,

1107
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:55,044
I am sorry to say I cannot
spend Jake's birthday with you.

1108
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:58,515
I've met someone else and am head
over heels in love with her.

1109
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,484
Sincerely, Carl."

1110
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:02,587
That's hilarious.

1111
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,993
It would be if it
weren't so sad.

1112
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:12,428
I just...

1113
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,930
I think it's a bad idea for us

1114
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,634
to be seeing each other
every night.

1115
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:21,205
But I love you.

1116
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:24,508
You do?

1117
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:28,879
I love you, too.

1118
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:34,218
Jake, can I talk to you?

1119
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,356
I saw that note that you wrote.

1120
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:42,059
My mom showed it to you?

1121
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:49,633
Your mom is sad
because you don't like me.

1122
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,768
I understand
why you don't like me.

1123
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,738
I was a little older than you
when my parents got divorced.

1124
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:58,875
- For good?
- For good?

1125
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,511
Yeah, they got divorced
for good.

1126
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,782
Because people sometimes
get back together.

1127
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:10,187
Not usually.
Pretty much never.

1128
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,296
When my parents split up,
I went into my room,

1129
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:23,733
and I tried to learn everything
I could about baseball.

1130
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:26,770
I memorized
the baseball encyclopedia.

1131
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:29,806
- No way.
- Yes way.

1132
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:33,943
How many consecutive games
did Cal Ripken, Jr. play?

1133
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:37,180
- 2,632.
- That's easy.

1134
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,849
Who hit the most home runs
in the Federal League?

1135
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,920
Uh, Dutch Zwilling, 33.

1136
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,123
You know about
the Federal League?

1137
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,258
He knows everything.

1138
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:53,163
Who has the longest hit
streak over two seasons?

1139
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,602
Let's see,
that would be George Sisler,

1140
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:04,641
September 3, 1924
to April 28, 1925.

1141
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:07,110
Thirty-five games.

1142
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:08,713
Wrong.

1143
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,748
What?

1144
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:15,318
- Come on, let me...
- OK, OK. It was right.

1145
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:18,554
You almost got me there.

1146
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,990
'Cause I thought it could've
been Albert Drewsher.

1147
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:25,162
- Who's that?
- He's another guy.

1148
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,933
You know, Ed and I barely
talked for the last six weeks,

1149
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:32,769
and it's weird, I'm kind
of scared to call him now.

1150
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,271
- I'm having an affair.
- What?

1151
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:38,441
- What? You're one to talk.
- A secret affair?

1152
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,209
Right. The usual kind.

1153
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,111
- With who?
- No one you know.

1154
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,013
- It's fabulous.
- What's fabulous?

1155
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:47,784
These tomatoes that
Alice grew in her garden.

1156
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:51,420
They're called sweet 100s,
you should try one.

1157
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,090
Mm.

1158
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:57,060
Oh.

1159
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:01,765
Mm, mm.
My God, you're right.

1160
01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:04,835
Jesus, it's just a tomato.

1161
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,573
Do you know the water's perfect.
I recommend a swim.

1162
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,541
Mm, that is just what I need.

1163
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,277
- Can I borrow a suit?
- Yeah.

1164
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,313
OK.

1165
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,318
No, thank you.

1166
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,070
Peter.
What...

1167
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:42,706
- Please, please.
- What?

1168
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44,507
I want you so badly.

1169
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:47,844
I can't do this to Claire.
No, Peter! Peter!

1170
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:50,513
Claire doesn't care!

1171
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:53,249
Oh, Alice, be the bad girl.

1172
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,321
- Be the bad gal with me.
- No, Peter. No.

1173
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,693
Shit.

1174
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:07,831
Sandy's got a friend
from college,

1175
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,365
they wanna have
a three-way with me.

1176
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:12,201
- You're kidding, when?
- This weekend.

1177
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:14,704
She's totally hot, too.
I saw a picture of her.

1178
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,740
She's an erotic artist
or something.

1179
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:20,309
Buddy, nice! Your life just gets
better and better, doesn't it?

1180
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:25,249
Hello? Alice.

1181
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,852
What are you doing?

1182
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:31,188
I'm at Lou's.
Are you OK?

1183
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,523
I'm on my way, yeah.

1184
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,192
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1185
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:40,063
Don't let the cats out.

1186
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:42,365
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1187
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:45,334
I always knew Peter
had a thing for you.

1188
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:46,502
I knew it.

1189
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:49,405
I'm so creeped out.
I didn't lead him on.

1190
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,608
I know you didn't.
You're just being yourself.

1191
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:55,144
He's... Ugh, what a creep.

1192
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:58,381
You know what, Ed?
I wanna stop this now.

1193
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:01,417
I want you to come home.

1194
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,652
- Now?
- Yeah.

1195
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,388
I thought the deal was

1196
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,824
we see other people
until we get married?

1197
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:10,126
I know, and...

1198
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:14,463
I guess I thought we could
have sex with other people

1199
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,965
and maintain our relationship,

1200
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:18,401
but I mean, there just isn't
enough time in the day,

1201
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,870
there's not enough
emotional space.

1202
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:23,073
It's ridiculous.

1203
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:28,445
I think we should stick to
the original agreement, sweetie.

1204
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:35,151
Well, I'm really worried
about what's happening with us.

1205
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:37,420
What's happening with us?
We're fine.

1206
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:41,826
How often do we sit on the
couch together, this is nice.

1207
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,828
You're seeing someone.

1208
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:46,562
I'm seeing other people,
that's what you wanted to do.

1209
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:48,364
It was your idea
that we see other people.

1210
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,533
- That's what I'm doing.
- Right, now I wanna stop.

1211
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:53,102
Well, I don't think
it's fair that you

1212
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:57,006
tell me to stop just because things
didn't work out with you and Donald.

1213
01:02:57,007 --> 01:03:00,844
- So what's her name, Ed?
- Who?

1214
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:05,414
- Your girlfriend.
- My girlfriend?

1215
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:06,682
What's her name?

1216
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:10,553
Sandy, and she's not
my girlfriend at all.

1217
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,288
That's what I
like about it, Alice.

1218
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,457
Well, I'm telling you that
we need to stop this now!

1219
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,259
I don't think it's fair at all,

1220
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,360
that you get to stop
and start everything

1221
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:19,028
whenever you want to.
Do you?

1222
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:20,563
- So leave!
- Leave?

1223
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:21,865
Yes, get out!

1224
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:24,033
No! I'm not leaving.

1225
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:25,368
Why are you still sitting here

1226
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,404
when you could be having fun
with Sandy?

1227
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:32,175
I don't... I don't know
why I'm here either,

1228
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:33,809
because I'd rather be
with Sandy.

1229
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,180
Great.

1230
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,903
Ow!

1231
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,564
Do you wanna go spy on Ed
and his new girlfriend with me?

1232
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,135
Hell, yeah.

1233
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,011
I just want
an objective opinion.

1234
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:48,451
Did it come out yet?

1235
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:49,954
No!

1236
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,924
That is one ugly shirt.

1237
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,927
Oh, yeah.
The kid made it for me.

1238
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:00,263
I washed it,
but it still bleeds.

1239
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,800
Hey, I got some good news.

1240
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:08,071
Penelope's pregnant.
We're getting married.

1241
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:11,107
- Oh, my God! Wow! Nice!
- Thanks.

1242
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:16,045
- Wow! How pregnant is she?
- Eighteen days.

1243
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,680
It's still not coming.

1244
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:20,249
Eighteen days,
that's not very pregnant.

1245
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,851
Well, it's pregnant
enough for us.

1246
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:25,921
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1247
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,625
I can't believe you're gonna
have a kid before I am.

1248
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:32,261
Well, get on the band wagon.

1249
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,998
You know, Sandy's nice,
but she's no Alice.

1250
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:38,734
What you and Alice had
was really good.

1251
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:41,238
I think you're getting greedy.

1252
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:48,511
Sandy's got a friend
from college.

1253
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:50,947
Tonight, we're gonna
have a three-way.

1254
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:55,452
- Really?
- Yeah.

1255
01:05:56,853 --> 01:06:00,124
Oh, look at this!
Get in the clown's mouth!

1256
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,760
Oh, man, you can't
compete with that.

1257
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:06,562
He's back in college.

1258
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:09,632
She doesn't want promises,
she doesn't want answers.

1259
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:12,236
She just wants to eat,
sleep and fuck.

1260
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,604
You are stoned.

1261
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:18,208
Yes, but I have stoner clarity.

1262
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:24,747
Let's get out of here.

1263
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:28,018
I'll get the car,
you return the clubs.

1264
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,539
Alice, what are you doing here?

1265
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,075
- You still love me, right?
- Of course he does.

1266
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:53,576
I'm talking to Ed!

1267
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:56,479
Or do you just wanna eat,
sleep and fuck?

1268
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,580
She said "fuck."

1269
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,215
Come on, sweetie,
let's go play...

1270
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:01,517
- One second, Mom.
- Alice, you gotta settle down.

1271
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,152
Don't... Don't tell me
to settle down.

1272
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,654
Don't touch me, you asshole!

1273
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,490
Wow! Looks like somebody
couldn't handle

1274
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,525
seeing other people after all!

1275
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,628
- Don't push me, Ed, OK?
- Don't push you? - No, Ed! Don't!

1276
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:14,263
You're gonna hit me with
a golf club, that's so un-Alice.

1277
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:15,498
- Stop it, Ed!
- What're you gonna do, hit me?

1278
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:18,834
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Ow! Fuck!

1279
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:20,403
They both said "fuck."

1280
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:22,705
Come on, let's get
some ice cream, I'll buy.

1281
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,107
Can I have cappuccino?

1282
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:25,408
You can have whatever you want.

1283
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,145
It was nice seeing you, Alice.

1284
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,580
I can't take this anymore.

1285
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:35,218
If you don't stop now,
it's over.

1286
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:37,586
Honestly, Alice,

1287
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:42,057
I don't even know
how I feel anymore.

1288
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,693
I don't know.

1289
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:52,168
You don't wanna
be with me anymore?

1290
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:54,304
I don't... I don't...

1291
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,342
What?

1292
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:01,444
Are we... Do you not...

1293
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,512
- I don't know.
- Do you not want to be with me?

1294
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,215
I don't know. I think...

1295
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:11,487
Are we... Are we breaking up?

1296
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,823
I think we already had.

1297
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:24,167
God, it's so ironic!

1298
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,502
You and Ed were so happy,

1299
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:28,971
and you completely destroyed it.

1300
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:32,341
You know, Peter and I can
barely stand each other,

1301
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:35,811
and our thing just keeps
dragging on and on.

1302
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,646
It's so ironic.

1303
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,516
You never even
got to be a bad girl.

1304
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,319
You never even got to
number five.

1305
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,789
Oh, sweetie, honey...

1306
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,357
I'll take you home.

1307
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:51,328
First I have to stop
at the bank.

1308
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,799
Five years I was with her!

1309
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,867
Five years! I was gonna
marry that loon!

1310
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,136
And then she attacks me
with a golf club in the arm

1311
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,573
in front of freaking children,
no less!

1312
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,242
You know, maybe tonight
isn't a good night

1313
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:08,377
for the three-way
with Miranda.

1314
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:11,180
Oh, I disagree. I think
it'll be OK, I really do.

1315
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:12,615
- Are you sure?
- Was I shouting?

1316
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:15,050
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

1317
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,760
So how do you guys
know each other from?

1318
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,397
We went to Harvard together.

1319
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,733
You went to Harvard?

1320
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:32,568
Yeah.

1321
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:36,872
- You're a writer?
- Sort of... television.

1322
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,509
You know David Gelman?

1323
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,516
Yeah, I know David.

1324
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,703
Hi.

1325
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:11,741
I rented this car
so no one would see us.

1326
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,457
Oh!

1327
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,363
- Let's fuck.
- Yeah, let's.

1328
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:38,967
- What's that?
- What do you think?

1329
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,303
I mean, I know what it is.

1330
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:42,137
But what do you plan on
doing with it? Jack off?

1331
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:45,908
No, while you're fucking Sandy,
I'll be fucking you.

1332
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,077
No, no, no!

1333
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,481
No, no, no!
No, no!

1334
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:53,982
You're not sticking that
in my ass, no way! No!

1335
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,651
But it's OK if you
stick your dick up my ass?

1336
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,320
What are you talking about?

1337
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,254
That's five times the size of
any cock I've ever seen.

1338
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,023
I thought you said
he had an open mind.

1339
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,558
He does, come on.

1340
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:04,360
Open enough to screw
around on his fiancée,

1341
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:07,530
but not open enough for a true
exploration of sexuality.

1342
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:09,698
I don't see how you
putting a dildo in my ass

1343
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,368
is a true exploration
of my sexuality.

1344
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,370
You're so goddam suburban.

1345
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,372
As soon as sex stops looking
like a porn video,

1346
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:19,842
you recoil and hide behind centuries
of missionary position dogma.

1347
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,311
What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

1348
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:26,649
I'm trying to redefine
the psycho-sexual dynamic

1349
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:29,552
that exists only to shore up
a crumbling gender identity.

1350
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:32,821
If you just wanna fuck,
then get someone else.

1351
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,758
We're gonna get someone else.

1352
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,929
Fucking asshole!

1353
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,600
Wow! That was a boner killer.

1354
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:47,470
Yeah, she was like that
at school, too.

1355
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:51,273
Really? Now what?

1356
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:53,943
Let's get a burger.

1357
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:58,246
Do you know...
Do you know any other girls?

1358
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:02,385
There was a salad you once made.
I don't know what was in it,

1359
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:04,653
I think it was an herb mix.

1360
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,423
Let's go home.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1361
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,559
Oh.

1362
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:14,397
Have you ever smoked crack?

1363
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:17,400
No... no.

1364
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:21,104
I think tonight would be a good
night to smoke some crack.

1365
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:26,041
- Together?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1366
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,643
How do you open
the pen on this thing?

1367
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:29,412
Here, I'll do it, OK?

1368
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:31,847
Please. Do you know
where you're going?

1369
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,582
Yeah.

1370
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:35,584
How often you smoke crack?

1371
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,722
Not that often.
Not every day.

1372
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,824
You know what?
I changed my mind.

1373
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,225
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1374
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:45,127
Come on, Ed, it's no big deal.
It'll be fun.

1375
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,762
How often do you smoke crack?

1376
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:49,164
Miranda was right about you.
You're a fucking square!

1377
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,266
I'm a fucking square?

1378
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:53,235
I'm starting to think
you're a fucking crackhead!

1379
01:12:53,236 --> 01:12:57,940
What's the big deal?
Drugs should be legal anyway!

1380
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:08,484
I thought you were different.
I thought you would understand.

1381
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:10,318
Understand what? What?

1382
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:16,091
- What's to understand?
- I'm sick of it!

1383
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,561
I am sick of all these
bullshit expectations

1384
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:20,863
people put on me!

1385
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:24,399
My sister is such a cunt!

1386
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,835
Get your bitch
under control, dude.

1387
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,303
Hey!

1388
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:31,040
Hey, let's go home, please.

1389
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:36,779
I wanna have some fun.

1390
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,620
Do you want to put on a condom?

1391
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:46,855
I think it would be hot.

1392
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:50,827
- If that's what you want.
- Yes.

1393
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,404
Damn it, hold...

1394
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:05,509
- That's OK, I'll...
- No, it's OK. I got it.

1395
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,143
It's just...

1396
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,179
- Really, forget about it.
- Peter! I'm opening it!

1397
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,650
- OK. OK.
- Yeah, I've got it.

1398
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:18,253
Just...

1399
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,155
Oh, shit!

1400
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,390
You know what...

1401
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:25,227
As hard as I try to be a used-up
watery piece of meat,

1402
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:29,465
it just doesn't work.
I'm a relationship person.

1403
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:45,248
How about a blow job?

1404
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,824
Oh, crap.

1405
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,661
- Claire's here. You gotta go!
- What?

1406
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,963
Claire's here, right outside.
Go! Go!

1407
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:03,566
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!

1408
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:05,167
Oh, Lord!

1409
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,469
She's gonna divorce me
and take all the money!

1410
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,705
No. No, no.

1411
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:12,908
Oh, goddamn. Shit!

1412
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,010
Go!

1413
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,888
Don't let my hard on scare you.

1414
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:28,592
He's your friend.

1415
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:33,162
There he is.

1416
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:37,265
- Where the fuck you've been?
- Relax, Ricky.

1417
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,234
- Who the fuck is this?
- You have any rock?

1418
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:41,069
You're real piece of work,
you know that?

1419
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,337
I've been fucking trying
to call you all week.

1420
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:43,806
I've been busy.

1421
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:45,841
You ever heard of
this thing called a phone?

1422
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:47,042
That's why I bought
the fucking thing for you.

1423
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,677
Your crack dealer bought
you a phone?

1424
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:50,245
I'm not a crack dealer, asshole.

1425
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:52,014
- I'm her fucking boyfriend.
- Shut up, Ricky!

1426
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:53,582
At least I am when you want
to get fucking high!

1427
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,218
Do you have any rock, yes or no?

1428
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,787
I got rock, yeah.

1429
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:01,323
But you ain't getting
a fucking crumb.

1430
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:03,258
Fucking crazy bitch!

1431
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,493
Hey, look,
I'll pay for the crack.

1432
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:06,795
Oh, I'm gonna beat your ass,
you little bitch.

1433
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:09,264
- Come on!
- Oh!

1434
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:10,933
Goddamn golf club!

1435
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,474
Get in!

1436
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:21,644
Goddamn it!

1437
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,413
Jesus!

1438
01:16:28,652 --> 01:16:30,418
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

1439
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,688
Look at all this crack.
This is so much rock!

1440
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,725
I don't want any fucking rock!

1441
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,998
Let's go to the bedroom
and fuck. Come on.

1442
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,933
- You wanna go to bed?
- Yeah.

1443
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,635
Why don't you fuck me
on that table right there?

1444
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:48,270
Tables are good.

1445
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,305
Ooh, you dirty little thing.

1446
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:53,375
Come on. I'll fuck you
on that table.

1447
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:55,543
You ready for it?

1448
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,245
Give it to me on the table.

1449
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:58,580
Get them out.

1450
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:01,249
Stop it!

1451
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,019
Jesus fucking Christ!

1452
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,621
What are you doing here?

1453
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,556
I live here.

1454
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,993
Right, but I thought you were
going to Santa Barbara...

1455
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,061
Well, I changed my mind, OK?

1456
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:16,999
And his is who you're
having an affair with? Lou?

1457
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,600
Yeah.

1458
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:20,502
Why don't you just
go to his house?

1459
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:22,437
We're both allergic to my cats.

1460
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:23,706
I don't care, you guys gotta go.

1461
01:17:23,707 --> 01:17:25,107
Bollocks!

1462
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:28,177
- What the hell was that?
- What is that...

1463
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,113
Alice?

1464
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:33,949
Please leave!
Just get out of here!

1465
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,389
No shirt and no bottoms.

1466
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:43,159
Is there a worse look for a man?

1467
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,628
You threw out the wrong clothes.

1468
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:51,701
Santa Barbara, interesting.

1469
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:59,474
You just ran another red light,
no one's even chasing us!

1470
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:00,976
Don't go pussy on me, Ed!

1471
01:18:00,977 --> 01:18:02,745
Pull over, right now!

1472
01:18:02,746 --> 01:18:05,613
I'm driving! It's my car,
I'm driving! Pull over!

1473
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:13,455
Hey! Hey!

1474
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:15,724
Oh, shit!

1475
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:19,062
I... ah,
the fucking three-way!

1476
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,365
I mean, I'm really not shocked.

1477
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:25,500
It's always been obvious
that he has a thing for you

1478
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,737
but what surprises me is that either of
you had the balls to go through with it!

1479
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:31,573
I'm so bloody sick of you
always talking about balls!

1480
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,375
Congratulations, Claire!

1481
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,477
You've got bigger balls
than all of us!

1482
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:38,814
- Nothing happened tonight.
- Obviously, Alice.

1483
01:18:38,815 --> 01:18:42,250
I mean you're... You're Alice. Alice
doesn't fuck her sister's husband...

1484
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:45,120
Look, I'm not trying
to make excuses, OK?

1485
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:47,655
But you were really
insensitive in the car today,

1486
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,892
and I just felt like, fuck it!

1487
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,193
Fuck what?

1488
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:52,294
Fuck you!

1489
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:55,630
Fuck you, fuck me,
fuck everything!

1490
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:56,932
I just wanted to feel...

1491
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,134
I just wanted to feel worthless

1492
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:02,237
and degraded and repulsive.

1493
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,572
And Peter called.

1494
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:08,111
What?

1495
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:12,114
Ow! It hurts!

1496
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:18,054
I'll sue your asses!

1497
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:19,922
Fuck!

1498
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,193
She went to Harvard.

1499
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,965
Which way's west?

1500
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:33,902
Don't touch my ass,
I will sue your ass.

1501
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:37,106
Ow, that hurts!

1502
01:19:39,142 --> 01:19:40,543
Fuckers!

1503
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:47,549
I still think you're gay.

1504
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:53,755
Trying oral sex once when
I was 15 does not make me gay!

1505
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,290
I'm British.

1506
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:58,360
I know, you're so
damn proud of it.

1507
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,708
Donald, what are you doing here?

1508
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:17,645
You left this magazine
at my house.

1509
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,348
And you had to bring it
back at 5:30 in the morning?

1510
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:24,119
You know, every time I
see it, it makes me sad.

1511
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,354
Well, throw it in the
recycling bin, Donald!

1512
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:29,491
Well, you know, since I'm here,

1513
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:31,593
I just wanted to say that in
defense of myself...

1514
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:32,961
I can't! No, Donald!

1515
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:34,863
I can't...

1516
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:38,300
You know, when you knocked on
the door, I thought it was Ed.

1517
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,368
And I don't even know what would
I would've done if it was Ed,

1518
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:43,538
because I screwed
everything up so badly.

1519
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,974
Oh.

1520
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:49,744
I didn't realize you had all
these people in your house.

1521
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:53,581
You know, I'll IM you later.

1522
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,919
Here's your magazine.

1523
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,354
Bye.

1524
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:06,194
You know, I just...

1525
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,730
I just wanted a little bit
of sex, you know?

1526
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:10,765
Is that...
Is that so terrible?

1527
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:13,936
I just... I didn't mean
to screw everything up.

1528
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:15,904
I didn't mean
to ruin everything.

1529
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:19,141
You know, when Ed
and I were together,

1530
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:20,642
sometimes on Saturday nights,

1531
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:25,080
we would just stay in and watch
movies and do our laundry,

1532
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:30,718
and it sounds boring, and it
was boring, but it was fun.

1533
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,854
And it was nice,
and it was good!

1534
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:34,322
That's why you two

1535
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:35,958
have to really think
about what you're doing

1536
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:39,461
before you just throw everything
away, you know?

1537
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:45,300
Because it's really hard to find
a safe place in this world.

1538
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:47,970
A place where you can just
stay in on a Saturday night

1539
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:51,474
and do your laundry.

1540
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:57,513
We don't do our own laundry.

1541
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:02,285
Right.

1542
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:23,005
That's what you rented
to have an affair?

1543
01:22:23,006 --> 01:22:24,639
They didn't have any sedans.

1544
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,975
You should try bumping it up
to the full size.

1545
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:29,979
Piss off! You, too!

1546
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:40,189
Hi, Claire. What's up, Lou?

1547
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:27,235
I've been carrying these
around for three weeks.

1548
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:30,872
I had to use a couple.

1549
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:33,008
Three actually.
