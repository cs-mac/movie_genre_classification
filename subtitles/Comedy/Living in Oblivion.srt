1
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,479
Camera truck's comin' in.
We're about two blocks away.

2
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,326
Where do we park?

3
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,205
Excuse me, where do we park?

4
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,638
Anybody know where
the camera truck can park?

5
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,523
No.

6
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:21,198
What time is it?
4:00. Why?

7
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:23,837
This milk's bad.

8
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:30,557
When did you buy it?
Tuesday.

9
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,915
I don't know. What's today?
Monday.

10
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,316
Copy.

11
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:39,195
There's a deli
on broadway.

12
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,521
Anything closer?
Nothing that's open.

13
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:45,434
Where are we supposed to park?
Is it that bad?

14
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:48,314
I don't know. You're the one
who said it was bad.

15
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,681
excuse me,
where are we supposed to park?

16
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:52,599
Does anyone know
where the camera truck parks?

17
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:56,953
Listen, camera truck, I want...

18
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:58,839
camera truck?

19
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:01,273
Camera truck?
Did you hear that?

20
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:06,071
This is the worse fuckin' cup of coffee
I've had in my life.

21
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:08,728
Then don't drink it.
What are we doing today?

22
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:11,317
"Interior. Living room.
Ellen talks to mom. "

23
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,710
Any nudity?
Yeah, you have to take your fuckin' pants off.

24
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,846
I'll do it. I like ellen.
Yeah, she's a babe.

25
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,615
She was the nurse in that
richard gere movie.

26
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,958
I worked on that film.
The shower scene.

27
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,236
Start with the 5k
through the window...

28
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,668
and run stingers for three
blondes into the living room.

29
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:31,507
So, two people.
Sitting? Standing? What?

30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,427
Who fuckin' knows?

31
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:38,707
"Ellen talks to mom. "

32
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,393
Tired?

33
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:48,751
Uh, no.
I've been up since 4:00.

34
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:52,625
I got a big scene today.
I'm kind of nervous about it.

35
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:56,465
"Ellen talks to mom"?
Oh, have you read the script?

36
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,864
Uh, no,
it's on the call sheet.

37
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:00,784
Oh.

38
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,665
Yeah, well,
it's pretty emotional.

39
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,942
I tell my mother that I never
felt she really, um, loved me.

40
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:12,749
You're gonna yell at each
other? Oh, I don't know.

41
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:16,142
I'm just gonna go with how I feel,
which is the scary part.

42
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:19,022
I'm pretty close to this character.

43
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:21,901
Problems with your own mom?

44
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,266
Yeah.

45
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,179
But she, uh, died before i...

46
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:30,026
well, before we could reconcile.

47
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:34,379
You were really great
in that richard gere movie.

48
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:36,778
Thanks.

49
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:43,017
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

50
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:45,416
L...

51
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:50,664
ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

52
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:54,536
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

53
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,261
Hi, mom.

54
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,181
Good morning.

55
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,615
Did you sleep well?

56
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:06,535
Not a wink.

57
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:28,578
Okay, look,
I'm not blaming anybody, wanda.

58
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,972
All I'm saying is that we left last night
and I knew we didn't get that scene.

59
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:34,817
I'm sorry, I thought
it was a great scene, Nick.

60
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:38,209
It was okay and I can use it.
It's gonna be all right.

61
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:40,095
But today I'm not gonna
settle for okay.

62
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:42,049
This is a big scene,
and I'm not leaving 'til we get it.

63
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,895
Whatever it takes, Nick.
We're here for you.

64
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,768
All right, wolf, here's what I want to do.
I want to get the whole scene in one shot.

65
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,648
It's been done.
I know, but let's try it anyway.

66
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,535
Hand-held?
No, dolly.

67
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:58,367
We go from close-up, pull back to a wide shot,
back to a close-up.

68
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,768
I'll use the 35.
It'll minimize the distortion.

69
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,166
We can light the whole thing from the ceiling.
It actually could be great.

70
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,047
It sounds incredible.
How long, wolf?

71
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,412
I gotta see a couple
run-throughs.

72
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:11,326
Not too many, all right?
It's a big scene for the actors.

73
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,245
I don't want to wear them out
before we get started.

74
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,124
We've got all day, Nick.
Whatever it takes.

75
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,491
How long, wolf?
Forty-five? An hour?

76
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,411
I don't know how you drink
that shit black, Nick.

77
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:23,324
I gotta dump in the milk.
It's the only way I can cut the taste.

78
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:26,650
Jesus!
Flame on, asshole!

79
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:28,603
All right, kill that one.

80
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,921
Okay, picture's up.

81
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:47,287
Quiet!

82
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:50,165
Now hold the work
over there.

83
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,600
We're going for picture.
Lock it up.

84
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,485
Cora, you're doing fine.

85
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,399
I just want you to really listen
to her and really answer her.

86
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,319
Okay.
Okay.

87
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:01,685
I've got nothing to say to you.

88
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,638
It's all there.
Just let it happen.

89
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:05,558
Ready, Nick.

90
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:07,478
One second.

91
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:10,356
Nick, you gotta take a look at this.

92
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:15,156
I pushed in a foot. She's incredible.
She's coming right through the lens.

93
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:17,557
That's beautiful, man.
That's great. Ready, Nick?

94
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,476
Call it, wanda.
All right, roll sound.

95
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,801
- Speed.
- Roll camera.

96
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:27,155
- Rolling.
- Scene six, take one.

97
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:35,313
Everybody settle.
And... action.

98
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:39,119
Dad hit me first and knocked me down.

99
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:44,433
It didn't hurt that much,
but I started crying anyway,

100
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:47,279
hoping he would
leave me alone.

101
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:50,671
Then he went over
and started hitting danny.

102
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:53,997
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

103
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:57,838
You were just standing there
looking at me, mom.

104
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:02,671
Then you... then you pulled me up
and said, "you're not hurt. "

105
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,516
Like I was disgusting
for faking,

106
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:09,868
for doing the only thing I could think of
to keep him from hitting me again.

107
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:13,674
I was worried about danny.

108
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,995
You remember.
He was smaller than you.

109
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:21,353
You were so worried about danny,
mom. What about... cut.

110
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:25,707
- That's a cut!
- Sorry, I had to cut. Les, your boom's all over my frame.

111
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,105
Yo, I asked for a frame line.

112
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:31,433
Okay, can we get a frame line, please?

113
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:34,825
Les, do you have a frame line?
I think so.

114
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,152
Now lock it up. We're going for picture.
That was beautiful, both of you.

115
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,543
Just like that, stay focused. Keep with
it. No big deal. All right, call it, wanda.

116
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,463
All right, and roll sound.
speed.

117
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,344
Roll camera.
Rolling. Scene six, take two.

118
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,624
Everybody settle.

119
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,023
And action.

120
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,861
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

121
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:01,188
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

122
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:06,501
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would just leave me alone.

123
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:09,397
Then he went over and started hitting danny.

124
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,227
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

125
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,620
Cut. I'm sorry.
I was completely off on the focus.

126
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,506
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,899
Thank you for the apology,
but you'll never work in this town again.

128
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:22,819
All right, I've got it now.
All right.

129
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,705
And roll sound.
Speed.

130
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,617
Roll camera.
Rolling. Scene six, take three.

131
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:32,383
Action.

132
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:37,183
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

133
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:40,096
It didn't hurt that much,
but I started crying anyway,

134
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,942
hoping he would
just leave me alone.

135
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:46,336
Then he went over and started hitting danny.
¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü

136
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:48,735
Ellen, I have no memory...
¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü

137
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:52,541
- ¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü
- Street noise.

138
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:54,460
What the fuck
is going on down there?

139
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,820
You call that a lockup? Get
that car out of here! yep.

140
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:02,653
Jesus christ! Why doesn't the guy just get
a flatbed trailer...

141
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,972
with about 600 speakers on it
and tow it behind his car?

142
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,812
¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü

143
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:17,018
¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü

144
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:19,417
And... clear.

145
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,290
Okay, do I have a lockup?
Yes.

146
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:27,129
Is that a real lockup?
Yes.

147
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,050
Okay, here we go right away.

148
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,449
First positions, please.
okay.

149
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:34,295
All right, and roll sound.
Speed.

150
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,729
Roll camera.
Rolling. Scene six, take four.

151
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:41,494
Set? Yeah.

152
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,894
Are we set?
All right.

153
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,327
Call it again, wanda.
All right, and roll sound.

154
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,262
Speed.
Roll camera. Roll...

155
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,132
second sticks.
Oh, shit.

156
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:52,325
Scene six...
everybody just settle!

157
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,486
Bert, get the hell
outta there!

158
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:57,811
Action.

159
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:01,205
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

160
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:04,052
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

161
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:09,363
I started crying anyway,
just hoping he would leave me alone.

162
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:12,500
Then he went over
and started hitting danny.

163
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,569
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

164
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:18,482
You were just standing there
looking at me, mom.

165
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,402
Then you came over and...
Boom's in.

166
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:22,322
That's a cut.
Jesus christ!

167
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,687
where at?
The whole left side of the frame, les.

168
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,081
All right, all right.
Can we get a motherfucking frame line, please?

169
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,928
Yo, the frame line keep changing.

170
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:34,320
That's the idea, les.
May I make a suggestion?

171
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:37,647
Would it be possible
to maybe break the shot down?

172
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,079
Maybe we could make it two shots instead?
It might be easier for les.

173
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:44,398
No. Then I'm gonna need ten minutes
to switch to radio mics.

174
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,758
It's your call, Nick.
Will there be any more sound problems?

175
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,638
No more boom problems.

176
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,524
Switch to radios.

177
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:56,397
All right, that's a ten minute break.
Everybody please stand by.

178
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,814
Get me a coffee.

179
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,195
Half milk.
Here.

180
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,195
Oh, Nicole, I'm really sorry about all this.

181
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,834
Oh, no, no, no. It's not your fault,
Nick. No.

182
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:12,202
Um, listen,
I was wondering,

183
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:15,354
Is there any way to use some of those
earlier takes?

184
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:18,474
Not unless I change the shot
and do a cutaway of cora...

185
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,359
and then find a way
to intercut the takes.

186
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:22,793
But I don't want to do that.
This is a really nice shot. No?

187
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:25,192
What you're doing is incredible.
Really?

188
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:27,112
Really incredible.
Okay.

189
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:29,032
All right?
Yeah.

190
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:30,952
Once we get the radio mics on,
it's gonna go smoother.

191
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:35,272
So you just... whatever. Take a moment.
Let all this shit go. Yeah.

192
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,159
Do whatever you, you know...
all right.

193
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:39,590
We're not gonna roll until you're ready, okay?
Yeah, thanks.

194
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,510
Okay.
Okay.

195
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:45,350
How was she in that
richard gere movie?

196
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,109
Eh... so-so.
Her career really took off, didn't it?

197
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:53,989
I saw her in a michael bolton video.
Oh, yeah?

198
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:57,349
Yeah, too bad.
She is... nice.

199
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:01,907
Yeah. I could have done
a better job though.

200
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:05,988
No, you still boom, les,
but keep it wide! Wide!

201
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:14,146
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's that scrim going?

202
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,992
It's a flag.

203
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:19,665
Wolf? No, no, no. No more tweaking. No.
Two seconds, wanda.

204
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,272
Lock it up. Picture's up.
Closer to the light, bob.

205
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:26,145
Can we get Nick in here?
Nick? Nick? Nick! Bring it up against the bulb.

206
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,544
Call it, wanda.
All right. And roll sound.

207
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:29,985
- Speed.
- Roll camera.

208
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,864
- Rolling.
- Scene six, take five.

209
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,743
Shake it off.

210
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:41,949
Action.

211
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:46,301
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

212
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:49,628
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

213
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,467
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would leave me alone.

214
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,339
Then he went over and started hitting danny.
Ellen, I have no memory...

215
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,747
Damn it!

216
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,626
The light! The light!
You blew the bulb!

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,060
Jesus fucking christ!
Kill it! Kill it! Pull the plug!

218
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,946
By your foot!
That's a cut! All right!

219
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,818
Is everybody hurt? Is anybody okay?
Okay, cora, are you all right?

220
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,178
Props. Props! Props, can we get
a broom in here, please?

221
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,313
All right,
clear the set... please.

222
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,383
Are you rolling? Props!

223
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:22,777
Props, get a broom in here right away!
Clear the set!

224
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,535
Cora.

225
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,414
Cora.
What's gonna happen next?

226
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:33,781
I'm gonna have
a heart attack!

227
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:37,654
No, no, no, you're not.
If you do, save it for the end of the scene, okay?

228
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,540
No, I'm kidding.

229
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,975
We're gonna go in there in two minutes,
and we are gonna nail this scene.

230
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:44,854
Then we're gonna be outta here. I swear.
Okay? Nicole...

231
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,740
Nick.

232
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:49,653
One second.

233
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:52,979
Nick.
Uh, okay.

234
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,898
I'll tell you one thing right now.

235
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:59,252
I am never, ever going to do another
fuckin' low-budget movie!

236
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:02,611
What's up?

237
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:04,977
Wolf and I were talking.

238
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:07,890
Ellen's...
losing it a little bit.

239
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:12,690
We have got three-quarters
of the scene really, really incredible.

240
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,610
All you need to do
is a quick cutaway,

241
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,489
and then we pick up
the last part of the scene.

242
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,814
Wolf?

243
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:23,694
Well, you know
how I feel.

244
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:27,533
I- I love the shot.
Hell, I designed it.

245
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,966
Okay, then can we just stick
with the game plan, please?

246
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,367
It's a simple shot.
I swear to god, we're gonna get it.

247
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:34,253
All right? I can feel it.
Okay.

248
00:15:34,286 --> 00:15:37,646
Yeah, whatever it takes.
We're here for you.

249
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,964
Thanks.

250
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,804
Okay, and roll sound.
Speed.

251
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,205
- Roll camera.
- Rolling!

252
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,084
Scene six, take six.

253
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:57,083
Let's stay focused.
And... action.

254
00:15:57,117 --> 00:16:01,642
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

255
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,008
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

256
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:08,362
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would leave me alone.

257
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:13,641
Then he started hitting danny.
Ellen, I... I...

258
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,400
cut!

259
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:24,199
Okay. That's okay.
Uh, cora, just give me the line.

260
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,559
No acting, just, just...
what's your line?

261
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:31,879
Ellen...

262
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,997
I have no memory
of this line whatsoever.

263
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,637
All right, all right.

264
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:40,037
Can we get the line please?
Script. Script. Script.

265
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:44,357
"Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever. " Okay?

266
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,724
Thank you. All right,
picture up, people.

267
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,637
Back to one, camera.
Come on, guys, let's not lose the energy.

268
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,522
Right away!
Let's go. Whoa, whoa.

269
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,443
And keep the lockup.
Nicole, you all right?

270
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:55,874
Let's get what we had before.
Are we ready? All right.

271
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,811
And roll sound.
Speed.

272
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,680
Roll camera.
Rolling!

273
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:03,554
Scene six, take seven.

274
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,794
Action.

275
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:14,593
Dad hit me first
and, uh, knocked me down.

276
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:16,958
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

277
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:22,272
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would leave me alone.

278
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,688
Then he started hitting danny.

279
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:27,071
I was worried
about danny!

280
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:32,830
I'm sorry, I...
I'm lost.

281
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:34,717
Cut.
That's a cut.

282
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,596
All right,
uh, everyone just relax.

283
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,515
We're gonna run the lines,
okay? No acting.

284
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,469
We'll do a run-through
for the lines. That's it.

285
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:43,389
Then we're gonna shoot
the fucking scene.

286
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:55,867
I'm sorry I'm fucking
this up for you.

287
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:57,787
Cora, please,
don't even say that.

288
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,425
I'm the one who's
totally fucking this up.

289
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,585
I swear to god,
if I get through this,

290
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:06,426
I am never acting again.

291
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,861
Action on the run-through.

292
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,381
Dad hit me...
hit me first...

293
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,265
and knocked me down.

294
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,178
It didn't hurt
that much, but...

295
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,978
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would just leave me alone.

296
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,898
Roll camera.

297
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:57,778
Then he went over
and started hitting danny.

298
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:00,146
Shouldn't we wait
for wolf?

299
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:05,216
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

300
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,256
Ma, you were just
standing there looking at me.

301
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,151
Then you pulled me up
and said,

302
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,016
"you're not hurt. "

303
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:17,936
Like I was disgusting
for faking,

304
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:21,773
for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him
from hitting me again.

305
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,134
I was worried about danny.

306
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,860
You do remember.

307
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:34,220
Well, he was
smaller than you.

308
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:38,573
You were so worried
about danny, ma.

309
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:43,339
What about me,
you know?

310
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:45,771
Why weren't you
worried about me?

311
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:01,129
Where the fuck is wolf?

312
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:04,008
One second.

313
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,452
Okay, listen up.

314
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:20,326
Nobody drink the milk.
It appears to be bad.

315
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:25,573
Okay, I've had to...
I'm changing the shot.

316
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:29,412
I'm a little pressed for time,
so we start with a close-up of ellen...

317
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,805
for the last part of the scene, starting
with your line, "I was worried about danny. "

318
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:36,644
Mm-hmm. Then i'll find a way to cut
that into the fourth take.

319
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:40,450
We almost had that.

320
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:42,404
Almost. That was beautiful.
Both of you.

321
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:45,249
That was just, uh...

322
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:50,562
can't think about that, right? That moment's
gone and, uh, we'll get another one, right?

323
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,961
Right? Okay.
Here we go.

324
00:20:57,282 --> 00:21:00,128
I'm ready, Nick.

325
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:03,041
Call it, wanda.
And roll sound. Speed.

326
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,399
Roll camera. Rolling!
Scene six apple, pickup, take one.

327
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,727
Action.

328
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,158
I was worried
about danny.

329
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,045
You do remember.

330
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,998
He's smaller
than you.

331
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:20,765
You were s...

332
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:24,603
you were so worried about danny.
What about me?

333
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:28,477
Why weren't you worried
about me? Jesus christ!

334
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,356
Cut! What the fuck is that, sound?

335
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:33,242
- It's not me!
- It's the camera.

336
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:36,121
Fuck it is! It's off!
It wasn't even running, dick les!

337
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:39,035
What is going on down there?
Do I have a lockup?

338
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:44,314
You don't hear a beeping sound?
The street's quiet.

339
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,073
What the fuck is it?

340
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,833
It's somebody's watch.

341
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:02,073
- It's not mine. - It's
not mine. - It's not mine.

342
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:04,472
Okay, where is it?

343
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:08,311
Cock-sucking, motherfucking
bastard! Where are you?

344
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,550
Take a walk, les. Go get coffee
and don't come back, all right?

345
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,790
I said no food on set!

346
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:25,109
Where are you?

347
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:31,794
Could somebody help me, please?

348
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:36,115
Huh? Do I have to do everything myself here?

349
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,994
Huh, cora? Why don't you go learn
your lines, cora!

350
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:42,833
Hey, script, how about paying
attention a little bit, okay?

351
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,753
Hey, focus puller,
I got some good thaI stick.

352
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:47,152
You wanna go fuckin' smoke one
or you wanna pay attention?

353
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:51,025
What are you laughing at, wolf?
You fuckin' pretentious, beret-wearin' motherfucker!

354
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:52,910
Hey, I saw your reel, man.
It sucked!

355
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:55,791
Who the fuck would hire you?
Hey, bob! Hey, bob!

356
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:58,705
Can you make a little noise
on the fucking dolly? Huh?

357
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:00,589
You creaky motherfucker!

358
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:04,463
Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's
a little more distracting to my actors?

359
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:08,269
What is your name anyway? What
do you fucking do around here?

360
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,149
Hey, speedo! You can't find
a little fucking beep?

361
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,062
Huh? You see what I have to fucking
deal with here, Nicole?

362
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:16,908
Maybe do some of that magic on camera!

363
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:21,261
No, no, wait 'til fuckin' wolf
is pukin' his guts out! "Oh, now, i'll be good. "

364
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,058
Oh, god.

365
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:04,902
So when did he ask you?

366
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:08,262
Yesterday when I was helping him
check into his hotel.

367
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:12,134
What? The guy can't even check into his hotel room
by himself?

368
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,020
Listen, wolf...

369
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:18,612
having chad palomino in this movie
will be a benefit to us all.

370
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:23,172
If being there when he checks into his hotel
makes him feel better,

371
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:25,572
then I'm more than happy to do it.

372
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:27,939
Well, how did it come up?

373
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:31,298
He asked me if I liked jazz,
I said yes,

374
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:35,650
and he suggested we meet at a jazz
club tonight.

375
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,977
I like jazz.
He did not invite you.

376
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:43,295
Why are you wearing
perfume to work?

377
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:45,730
Because I feel like it.
You didn't wear it yesterday.

378
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:49,089
Oh, god, stop acting
like such a child.

379
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:51,933
Ow! My eye!
Oh!

380
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,367
Oh, god, sweetheart, are you all right?

381
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,768
Do I look all right?
Oh, well, let me see.

382
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,607
I don't see anything.

383
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,527
Well, it hurts.

384
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:05,407
Christ,
we're gonna be late.

385
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,165
Should we call up
to the room again?

386
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:13,565
He said he'd be
right down.

387
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:19,771
Tired?
Oh, I'm exhausted.

388
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:22,684
I dreamt I was on set
all night.

389
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:27,483
I was just trying to get one shot,
and everything kept going wrong.

390
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:30,362
That's an anxiety dream.
Are you anxious about something?

391
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,248
I don't know.

392
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:35,643
Sometimes I wonder what the hell
I'm doing in this business.

393
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:39,001
It's all just one compromise
and disappointment after another.

394
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,402
I don't know if I have
the personality for it.

395
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:44,282
Sounds kind of like
an identity crisis.

396
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:47,127
Yeah, maybe you're right.

397
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:50,486
Who am i?
What am I capable of?

398
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Maybe I should find a job teaching spanish
at a women's college somewhere.

399
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,719
How'd you get
into cinematography?

400
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,039
I'm not the cinematographer.

401
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,925
You're not?

402
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:06,838
No, I'm directing this movie.

403
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:09,717
How'd you get into directing?

404
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:17,205
Your car is still waiting
for you, mr. Palomino.

405
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:19,124
Five minutes.
Okay, i'll tell him.

406
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:21,010
Bye.

407
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:25,364
They're downstairs. You go ahead.
I'm gonna take a taxi.

408
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:27,283
Okay.

409
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:31,123
Uh, listen...

410
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:36,402
I had a lot of fun last night,
really, but I gotta tell you,

411
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:41,200
where I'm at right now
in my life, a relationship...

412
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:43,601
chad, hold on a second.

413
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,447
Uh, this was just
a one-time deal.

414
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,321
You know it, I know it.
You can cut the melodrama.

415
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,206
I just thought
you might want...

416
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,599
all I ask is that you don't
mention it to anyone.

417
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:59,438
That's not my style.
Good. That's good.

418
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,558
So, i'll see you
on the set.

419
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:10,478
Right.

420
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:17,675
Goddamn it.

421
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:33,994
Hey, so what do you got
coming up after this?

422
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:37,319
Nick, I got two movies
right after yours.

423
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:41,673
One, I play a rapist that michelle pfeiffer
falls in love with.

424
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:45,959
The other one,
I play kind of a sexy...

425
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,872
serial killer that shacks up
with winona ryder.

426
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:51,718
That's great, man.

427
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:57,030
Yeah, I'm not into that hostess twinkie shit.
"Hostess twinkie"?

428
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,910
Hollywood shit, man.
You know, it's all fluff.

429
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:02,310
These are the kind of films
I wanna be doin'.

430
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:04,710
Hey, thanks, man.
Hey.

431
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,589
I gotta say, I'm really
glad you feel that way,

432
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,990
and I'm excited to be
working with you.

433
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,908
Yeah, me too.
You're a great director, man.

434
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,754
Your films
are totally whacked!

435
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:18,146
You know, I'm gonna be watching you, buddy,
like a hawk.

436
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,563
I wanna learn
from you, Nick.

437
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:22,913
I'm gonna pick your brain.

438
00:28:22,947 --> 00:28:25,347
Good. Then you could
pick my nose.

439
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:30,626
See what I mean?
You're whacked!

440
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:32,992
Yeah.
What are we waitin' here for?

441
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:36,385
Oh, waitin' on Nicole.
Nicole? She's tak...

442
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:38,304
what?

443
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:42,625
Probably takin' a shower
or something.

444
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:46,464
Hey, did anybody see that richard gere movie?
How was her shower scene in it?

445
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:48,862
- It was good.
- Really great.

446
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:59,389
How boring.

447
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:02,268
I think we got nudity today.

448
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:04,701
It just says,
"ellen and damian kiss. "

449
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,100
Well, it could be
a kiss with nudity.

450
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,500
I like ellen.

451
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,340
She's my type.
Now, why is that?

452
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:16,186
She's, uh...
she's pretty.

453
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,539
She's smart.
She's kind of kooky.

454
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:23,384
Maybe i'll give her a part.

455
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:26,778
Yeah, I'm making my own movie pretty soon.

456
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:29,658
A feature.
Oh, yeah?

457
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:31,577
Brought the script.

458
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:34,903
Palomino is perfect for the lead.

459
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:37,337
I'm gonna give it to him right during lunch.

460
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,702
Maybe right after.
All right.

461
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,616
Yeah, I gotta be aggressive.

462
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,981
Wanna shoot it?

463
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,381
Come and get it.
Sure.

464
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:50,294
Yeah? You ever shot anything before?

465
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,661
No.

466
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:54,581
All right.

467
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:56,501
You gotta start somewhere.

468
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,455
Good morning!

469
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:01,300
Good morning.
Good morning.

470
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:03,733
Look at these bags
under my eyes.

471
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:07,093
I can take care of that.

472
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,458
Does that work?

473
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:12,337
With skin? It's gonna be
great. You just take it easy.

474
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:16,692
Jesus, what are you doing?
Shrinking tissue. That's what this stuff is for.

475
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:21,010
Let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin.
I'll be right back.

476
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:25,296
How'd you get here?
Oh, I took a taxi.

477
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,209
Oh, because we've been waiting in front
of your apartment for half an hour.

478
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,096
Oh, god!
I'm sorry, Nick. I'm sorry.

479
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:34,448
I just... uh, something came up
and I forgot to call.

480
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,335
I feel like such an asshole.

481
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:39,727
You're just saying that because
you have preparation h on your face.

482
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:45,007
Man, I never should have
gone out last night. I hate jazz.

483
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,853
God, I look terrible.

484
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:51,247
No, you don't.
Don't bullshit me, Nick.

485
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,646
I'm not.
You look beautiful.

486
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:57,451
Hey!

487
00:30:57,484 --> 00:31:00,845
How did you get here,
Nicole?

488
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,210
I took a cab.

489
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:07,565
Oh, because we were wondering
how you got here.

490
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:13,323
Good, everybody's here. We'll have a
run-through as soon as you guys are ready.

491
00:31:13,357 --> 00:31:15,243
You got it, chief.

492
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:18,602
Lorde, what are you doing?
Chad's ready for his makeup.

493
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:22,888
Okay, we're back in.
We are back. We are in.

494
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:28,201
Hold it down, people.
Hold it down! Actors working.

495
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:31,561
- Great shirt, wanda.
- Why, thank you, chad.

496
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,959
Okay, let's finish working
out this blocking. Wolf!

497
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,839
- Hmm?
- What happened to your eye?

498
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:38,725
A little accident.

499
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,126
You gonna be all right?
I think so.

500
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,999
Looks great, man. Okay, Nicole
is here standing by the bed.

501
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:47,398
Chad, you're over there
by the chair. Okay.

502
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,278
And camera's close on ellen.
first line.

503
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,157
I've always admired you
from afar.

504
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:56,277
Admired? That sounds...
rather professional.

505
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,883
Good. Okay, "professional,"
that's the cue.

506
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,317
Dolly comes in.
Damian, you come over to the bed. Right?

507
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:05,635
Scene continues. Well, then,
loved. How does that sound?

508
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,515
Sounds like champagne talking.

509
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,394
I've loved you from the moment we met.

510
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:13,280
Why didn't you tell me?

511
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,234
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere.

512
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:19,074
God, and all this time
I thought...

513
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,994
then you kiss.

514
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,873
Don't do it now.
Okay, how's that feel?

515
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:27,200
Great. Nicole?
Good.

516
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,672
Wolf, any thoughts?
Nope.

517
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:30,558
I have a thought.

518
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:34,192
What if damian had
an eye patch like wolf?

519
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:37,792
Hmm, let me think
about that one, chad.

520
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:39,711
All right.
You're the genius.

521
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:44,031
Nick reve, living in oblivion,
scene six, take one! Let's shoot it!

522
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,398
One second, chad.
Wolf, you ready to shoot one?

523
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,829
I've been ready. Move aside.
All right, wolfman!

524
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,709
Good. Okay, call it, wanda.

525
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,069
Camera, please.
All right, going for picture.

526
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:58,446
And lock it up!
And roll sound. Speed.

527
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:01,788
Roll camera.
Rolling. Scene six, take one.

528
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,675
And... action.

529
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:07,066
I've always admired you
from afar.

530
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,913
Admired?

531
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:12,792
That sounds rather professional.

532
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,665
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

533
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,586
Sounds like champagne talking.

534
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:22,906
Well, I've loved you
from the moment we met.

535
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:26,231
Then why didn't you
tell me?

536
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:31,545
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere.

537
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:36,343
God...
and all this time...

538
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:38,743
I thought...

539
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:43,989
cut.

540
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,942
That's a cut.

541
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:49,782
Very good. Not for camera.
Chad's completely out of my frame.

542
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,661
Yeah, what happened, buddy? Did
you forget your cue? No, man.

543
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:56,501
I held back. I really feel it's something
that damian would do:

544
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,677
Hold back until
the last moment, you know?

545
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,819
Oh... I see.
Uh, how's that for you, wolf?

546
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,699
I don't care when he moves.
Just give me the fuckin' cue.

547
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:06,545
- Lone wolf!
- What line did he move on?

548
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,418
"Why didn't you tell me?"
Okay, "me. " That'll be your new cue.

549
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:12,818
How's that feel for you, Nicole?
Oh, that's good.

550
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:14,739
Yeah, if that's
what chad wants.

551
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:17,395
Me, me, me.
That's the cue.

552
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:20,017
Shoot it!
One second, chad.

553
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,936
Come here, chad.

554
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,336
Okay, um...

555
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,222
chad...

556
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:30,096
how would you describe
this scene in one word?

557
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,982
It's great.
It's a great scene.

558
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:35,855
Okay. No, but I mean...
it's a love scene, right?

559
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,254
Definitely.
Right. Okay.

560
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:41,614
And these two people, they really love each other,
and we wanna see that.

561
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,460
Especially in the kiss.

562
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:47,852
I got it, chief.
All right. Nicole?

563
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,772
I understand, chief.
Good.

564
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,612
Call it, wanda. All right, going for picture.
Lock it up.

565
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:55,497
And roll sound.
Speed.

566
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:58,411
Roll camera. Rolling.
Scene six, take two.

567
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:02,250
Ellen, just push your...

568
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,578
and... action.

569
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:09,450
I've always admired you
from afar.

570
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,337
Admired?

571
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,696
That sounds...
rather professional.

572
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:18,568
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

573
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,935
Sounds like champagne talking.

574
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:25,768
I've loved you from the moment we met.

575
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:28,615
Then why didn't you tell me?

576
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:32,965
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere.

577
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:35,846
God...

578
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:37,766
and all this time...

579
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:39,686
hmm.

580
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:47,331
And cut!

581
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:49,765
that's a cut.
Very good. Wolf?

582
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:53,364
Chad missed his cue again.
The whole dolly's unusable.

583
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:56,449
Yeah, what happened there,
pal-o-mine-o-mino?

584
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:58,882
I thought this time you were
gonna hold back until "me. "

585
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,283
The more I thought about that,
it just didn't seem right.

586
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,170
You know,
and I'm thinkin'...

587
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:07,521
instead of comin' all
the way around the bed,

588
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:11,361
what if I just slip in here like this,

589
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:13,728
do the whole scene lying down?

590
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:17,568
I don't know.
That seems a little...

591
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:20,960
I'm just tryin' to throw out ideas,
get the creative juices flowing.

592
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,880
Nicole, how does that feel?

593
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,520
Well... yeah,
I could turn to look at him,

594
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:27,644
but won't you be shooting
the back of my head?

595
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:30,558
Plus chad's completely
out of the light down there.

596
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,438
Hey, wolf, I don't care
about my face, man. All right?

597
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:35,374
What I care about here
is the acting.

598
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:37,278
That's all I care about!

599
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:40,638
It's your call, Nick.
His acting or his face?

600
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,517
For some reason,
I thought we can get both.

601
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:45,916
I thought that's what
we were trying to do here.

602
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:47,836
I'll have to set another light.

603
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:50,202
We're ahead of schedule, Nick.

604
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:54,075
I think we have a few moments
to set a light for mr. Palomino.

605
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:55,995
Good, let's do it.

606
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,841
Ellen, damian,
let's talk for a second.

607
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,721
We are going to pause
to set a little light,

608
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:05,113
and then we are going
to rush again right away.

609
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:07,032
How long, wolf?

610
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,953
Wolf?

611
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,199
Okay.

612
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:18,072
Let's just take a moment
and make sure we know what's going on here, right?

613
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,912
These two people, they've loved each other
for years, right?

614
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,791
Each of them not knowing
the other was in love with them, right?

615
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:28,630
And tonight, in this little room,
it all comes out.

616
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,511
It's like...
it's like a dam bursting.

617
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:34,836
Does that make sense?
Nicole?

618
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,237
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
It makes perfect sense.

619
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,149
I just, you know...
I haven't found it yet. I'll get it though.

620
00:37:40,182 --> 00:37:42,035
Okay. What about you, chad?
I'm there, man.

621
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:45,428
I got the dam bursting,
the river, everything. You watch.

622
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:48,788
Changing the blocking's really
gonna open things up for me.

623
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:51,635
We're ready, Nick.
Okay, good.

624
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,067
Let's go.
What are you talking about?

625
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,434
Okay, here we go.
Number one.

626
00:37:56,468 --> 00:38:00,273
Okay, we're gonna go very soon.
Have we done last looks?

627
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:03,186
Mr. Palomino is being checked
ready? Don't lose the energy.

628
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,552
Stay in the scene.
Good.

629
00:38:05,585 --> 00:38:07,985
Call it, wanda.
Lock it up. And roll sound.

630
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,351
- Speed.
- Roll camera.

631
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:14,191
Rolling. Scene six,
take three.

632
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:18,063
Okay, dam bursting.
And... action.

633
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,903
I've always admired you from afar.

634
00:38:21,937 --> 00:38:23,789
Admired?

635
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:27,663
That sounds...
rather... professional.

636
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:31,501
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

637
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:34,348
It sounds like champagne talking.

638
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:38,701
I've loved you from the moment we met.

639
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,066
Why didn't you tell me?

640
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,940
We were working together.
I didn't... I didn't want anything to interfere.

641
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:47,307
Nick, um... you know, this...

642
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:50,700
I'm turned all the way around. I didn't...
is that what you... what's the problem?

643
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:53,578
sorry, can we cut?
Cut. That's a cut.

644
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,945
Damn it!

645
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:58,824
That was a good one.
I know. L...

646
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:01,738
I'm sorry, but this feels
really... awkward,

647
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,584
me turning all the way
around like this.

648
00:39:04,618 --> 00:39:07,977
Yeah. You know, chad, I don't think the lying
on the bed is quite working.

649
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,897
Let's try one with
the original blocking.

650
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:13,735
What is that? Been so many changes.
Could somebody help me?

651
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:17,575
Cue for the original
blocking is "professional. "

652
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,942
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

653
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:22,135
Right away, back to one.
Call it, wanda.

654
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:24,261
And picture's up.
Lock it up. Roll sound.

655
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,175
You know, actually, Nick...
could I have a moment? Just...

656
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:30,053
is that all right?
Of course, Nicole. Are you kidding me?

657
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,933
Hold the roll, wanda.
Holding the roll.

658
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:44,899
What's the cue?
It's right there.

659
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:48,771
Okay, and did he print anything yet?
No.

660
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,929
Mmm. Someone smells
very, very good here.

661
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,216
Okay.

662
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,330
Listen, you do your job,
and i'll do mine, okay?

663
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:09,407
Ready, Nick.

664
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:11,294
Okay.

665
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,728
Call it, wanda.
All right, going for picture.

666
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,648
Lock it up.
And roll sound.

667
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,494
Speed. Roll camera.

668
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:20,447
Rolling. Scene six,
take four.

669
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,732
And...
Nick!

670
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:27,132
I just had a great idea.
Hold the roll.

671
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:31,005
Hold the roll. Nobody move. What is
it, chad? Stop me if I'm out of line.

672
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:34,330
She says, "admired from afar. "

673
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:39,644
So doesn't it make sense to see
damian up close, her "afar"?

674
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:41,531
Now watch me.

675
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,682
We start on a close-up of me, right?

676
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:47,802
She declares her love,
she comes to me,

677
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,442
and she steps into this
beautiful two-shot...

678
00:40:50,476 --> 00:40:52,568
that you and the wolfmeister
have set up here.

679
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:55,928
What do you think, wolf?
I don't like it. It's ellen's scene.

680
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:58,842
it sort of makes sense.
You did it, man. It's in the writing.

681
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:04,600
I'd have to relight. We are ahead of
schedule, Nick, if that means anything to you.

682
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,926
Let's do it.

683
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,326
Get me a tweenie over here,
with diffusion. Okay, everyone.

684
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,718
Please stand by.
We are pausing briefly to set one little light.

685
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:16,086
And then we are going again
right away.

686
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,478
Stand-in, please, for mr. Palomino.
Oh, i'll do it.

687
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:21,844
Get the fuckin' light!

688
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:25,717
He's a bit of a prima donna,
but Nick is working...

689
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:29,076
That's cool.

690
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:31,922
Okay, thursday.
That's good.

691
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,842
I'm going to the ballet
next week.

692
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:38,196
Your hair could use some work.
Why don't you finish me on the set?

693
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,075
All right, I will.
Sugar? Just a bit.

694
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:44,915
He doesn't give a shit about me.

695
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:49,200
You like jazz?
Very much.

696
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:53,554
We should go hear some tonight.
That'd be nice.

697
00:41:54,994 --> 00:41:58,832
It's going well, I think.
Don't you think?

698
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,718
Very well.

699
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,152
What time do you think we'll be finished?
Early, I hope.

700
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:06,031
I'm going to a jazz club tonight.
Really?

701
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:11,311
So am i.
He's wonderful, isn't he?

702
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:13,711
So natural,
just like air.

703
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:16,076
Chad?

704
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,949
I wonder what his sign is.
Do you know, Nicole?

705
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,315
No, I don't know his sign, but...

706
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:28,075
I think his moon is in uranus.

707
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:30,989
You don't have to be nasty.
Oh, I'm sorry.

708
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:35,307
Yo, wolfman, is this my new mark?

709
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:38,154
Until you fuckin' change it.

710
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:41,067
Where's my fuckin' eye patch?
Hey, lester!

711
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,952
Anybody seen my eye patch?

712
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:45,387
Admired? That sounds rather professional.
Hey, chad.

713
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,712
Hey. Hey. I'm bob.
I'm lighting the show.

714
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:52,105
Chad palomino, actor.
where's my goddamn eye patch?

715
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:55,464
Yeah, I know.
Uh... hey, what's your name?

716
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:59,270
Maurice. Maurice!
Hey, maurice chevalier!

717
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:02,183
Any relation? Probably not, huh?
Hey, chad, I'm...

718
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:05,030
smokin' crew, guys.
Thanks. Hey, thanks.

719
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:09,383
I wrote a script,
and I thought you might want to take a...

720
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,741
hey, bill, you see the top
of that light there?

721
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:15,109
Uh... yeah.

722
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:18,468
Bring that down about three feet.

723
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:22,821
Anybody seen my eye patch?

724
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,621
The dailies from last night
looked really...

725
00:43:27,654 --> 00:43:29,986
You look incredible, Nicole.

726
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:31,906
Hey, do you want to...

727
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,779
Nicole, would you care to have a drink with me,
you know, tonight?

728
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:40,099
I just wanted to... we could talk about...
oh!

729
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:42,464
I'm sorry, Nick.
Oh, that's okay, Nicole.

730
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:46,337
I was just splashing a
little water on my face. Oh.

731
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:50,177
Uh, listen, i...
it's going pretty well, right?

732
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,537
Is it? I don't know.
Something feels off.

733
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,416
Yeah, you seem a little tense.
Do I?

734
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,303
Don't worry about it.

735
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,695
Take the attention off yourself and put it on chad.
Work off him a little more.

736
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:04,541
Okay, i'll try that.
Good.

737
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:07,901
I know he's no olivier
or anything, but...

738
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:11,293
he's got something though. Don't you
think he's got like a natural presence?

739
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:14,173
Yeah.
He's very natural.

740
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,093
Like air.

741
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:21,373
So... Is there anything else
I could help you with?

742
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:24,252
Uh... actually, there is.

743
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:27,132
Could you maybe ask him
to brush his teeth?

744
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,218
Sure.
Nicole? Nicole?

745
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:32,891
Please get Nicole
to wardrobe.

746
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,812
Yeah?

747
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:37,211
My eye's killing me.

748
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:39,131
Put your eye patch on.

749
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:41,050
I lost it.

750
00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:44,410
Is that little light set yet?

751
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:47,289
The light was set about ten minutes ago.

752
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,089
Uh, get the a-team in here right away:
Nick, Nicole and mr. Palomino.

753
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,008
Why didn't you tell me?

754
00:44:54,488 --> 00:44:58,328
Hey, you're not worried about the time,
I'm not worried about the time.

755
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:01,687
Oh, I am very worried about the time.
Oh, I know you are.

756
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,086
What is that supposed to mean?
What do you think?

757
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:05,973
I don't know what it means!
Yes, you do.

758
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,372
No, I don't! I haven't done
anything! The hell you don't.

759
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,566
Wanda, please, you have to
understand... why are you accusing me?

760
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,725
You don't understand me! You don't
even care! I don't understand you?

761
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,605
All I do is take care of you constantly!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

762
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:18,451
Hey! What the fuck, wanda? Huh?

763
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:22,324
I'm trying to shoot an intimate scene here. I
don't need a lot of tension on set, all right?

764
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:24,244
Damian,
you on your new mark?

765
00:45:24,276 --> 00:45:26,130
Good.
All right.

766
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,049
Close-up of damian,
ellen in the back...

767
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:31,444
chad, what are you doing?
Hey, that's my fuckin' eye patch!

768
00:45:31,477 --> 00:45:34,579
Can I borrow it, wolf?
Nick, it just feels right.

769
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,347
I've got this guy now!
No, chad, it doesn't work.

770
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,049
You're wrong, man.
I'm gonna fight you on this one.

771
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:42,962
Hey, that's my eye patch, and I don't want
anyone else wearing it. It's insanitary!

772
00:45:42,995 --> 00:45:45,808
Fine! I'll get my own eye patch!

773
00:45:45,842 --> 00:45:50,160
Nick, send someone out, get me an eye patch.
I'll pay for it myself.

774
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:52,047
Get an eye patch for mr. Palomino.

775
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,967
Chad, let me talk
to you for a second.

776
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,399
Look, I didn't want to say this
in front of wolf, but, uh,

777
00:45:56,434 --> 00:46:00,240
it makes you look a little... gay.

778
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:02,638
Really?
A little bit.

779
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,558
Jesus.

780
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:10,798
Oh... you're right.

781
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,123
Good call. Thanks, buddy.
Sure.

782
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:17,036
We're ready, Nick.
Uh, wolf, you need a rehearsal?

783
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,955
Let's just fucking shoot it.

784
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:21,322
El lobo!

785
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:23,756
Call it, wanda.
Lock it up.

786
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:26,122
And roll sound.
Speed.

787
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:29,961
Roll camera. Rolling.
Scene six, take four.

788
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:33,353
Everybody, keep the energy up.
And... action.

789
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:35,754
I've always admired you
from afar.

790
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:39,113
Admired?
Sounds rather professional.

791
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:42,953
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

792
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:45,320
Sounds like champagne talking.

793
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:49,671
I've loved you from the moment we met.

794
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:52,518
Why didn't you tell me?

795
00:46:52,551 --> 00:46:58,310
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere. God!

796
00:46:58,343 --> 00:47:00,711
Cut. That's a cut.
Sorry, Nick.

797
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:05,031
Sorry. I don't know why
I did that. I'm sorry.

798
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:08,869
Nick, can I talk to you for a second?

799
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:11,715
What?

800
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,116
Two seconds, wanda.
Everybody stand by.

801
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:17,029
All right, momentary delay.
Everyone stand by.

802
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:18,914
We're gonna go again right away.

803
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:21,827
Uh, excuse me, ellen.
You were a tad low on that.

804
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:24,193
Okay, i'll bring it up.

805
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:26,627
Actually, could I listen to the take before?

806
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,547
Sure.

807
00:47:29,986 --> 00:47:33,826
Here it is.
It's coming up right now.

808
00:47:34,306 --> 00:47:36,944
I've loved you from the moment we met.
Why didn't you tell...

809
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,585
chad, just one second, okay?
Talk to me. What's going on?

810
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,951
I cannot act with that woman!
Shh.

811
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,383
I know that she's a friend of yours,
but she cannot act worth a shit!

812
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:48,224
I'm giving her everything! Did you see
that whole thing I just did with the hair?

813
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:52,543
That was great. I came up with that
on my own! I thought it would help her!

814
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:54,463
Cut.
Thanks.

815
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:56,383
She's giving me nothing! Just a second.

816
00:47:56,863 --> 00:48:01,183
I'm outta here! Why the hell did you cast her?
She sucked in that richard gere movie!

817
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:05,981
you're right. She's not the best actress
in the world. I can see that.

818
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:07,902
But you've gotta help me out here, chad.
All right?

819
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:11,741
I'm asking you, please.
Work with me, all right?

820
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,628
Let me tell you something, man.

821
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:16,507
Do you know why she took
a cab this morning?

822
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:20,380
Something came up.
No, she was in my hotel room,

823
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:23,275
and she didn't want you
to know about it, okay?

824
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:26,105
Now, I'm sorry it had
to come out like this,

825
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:29,018
but I told her this morning,
I said, "thanks a lot.

826
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:31,865
"I had a lot of fun
last night.

827
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:33,818
"But let's get something
straight here, baby.

828
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:37,144
This is a one-time deal. "

829
00:48:37,177 --> 00:48:41,015
She didn't want to hear that.
She wanted more.

830
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:44,393
You see what I'm saying?
It's rejection.

831
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:47,736
Okay.
Hey, i'll talk to her, all right?

832
00:48:48,215 --> 00:48:51,575
I'm here for you, man.
I appreciate that, man, because, you know,

833
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:54,455
you're one of the best actors
I've ever worked with.

834
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:58,259
All right? So, let's just...
we can do this, all right?

835
00:48:58,293 --> 00:49:02,613
okay, here we go. Director and actor
are on set. First positions please.

836
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:06,932
Nicole, listen...
Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working.

837
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:11,253
I- I-I apologize.
Chad, I apologize to you too.

838
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:14,578
I just... I'm completely
unfocused here.

839
00:49:14,612 --> 00:49:18,931
I think what we need to do
is to just loosen up the scene somehow.

840
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,257
What would you
like to do?

841
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:27,089
I was wondering... maybe could we try improvising
the scene a little bit?

842
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:29,457
More along the lines
of what chad's been doing.

843
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:33,330
Maybe that will help me find something.
That's a fantastic idea.

844
00:49:33,363 --> 00:49:36,225
What do you think?
That's the only way I can work.

845
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:39,088
Let's take it apart. Let's cut it loose.
Good.

846
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:41,935
And we'll shoot it,
all right?

847
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:44,848
Hell, why not?
Roll that motherfuckin' camera, wolfie.

848
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,734
Kiss my ass!
Yeah!

849
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:48,687
All right!
Now we're making a fuckin' movie!

850
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:50,813
Call it, wanda.
Okay, lock it up.

851
00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:53,006
Going for picture.
And roll sound. Look alive.

852
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:54,925
Speed.
Roll camera. Rolling!

853
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:57,325
Scene six, take five.

854
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,725
Action!

855
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,085
I've always admired you
from afar.

856
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,451
Have you?

857
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:07,644
That's...
wow.

858
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:09,805
That's incredible.

859
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:12,169
Admired?

860
00:50:12,203 --> 00:50:16,043
Sounds kind of professional though, doesn't it?
Admired?

861
00:50:16,523 --> 00:50:21,323
You're right.
How does, um... despised sound?

862
00:50:21,357 --> 00:50:25,129
Great.
What does it mean?

863
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:30,920
Well, it's sort of like I think that you are
a slimy piece of shit.

864
00:50:30,954 --> 00:50:33,801
That sounds like champagne talking.
Oh, no, no, no, it's not.

865
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:37,640
It's not.
I really do think you are a piece of shit.

866
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:40,519
No, you don't.
You love me.

867
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:43,366
Oh, no.
The fuck I do.

868
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,246
I can't stand looking at you.

869
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:50,119
Then I guess I have nothing to say.

870
00:50:50,152 --> 00:50:52,484
No, no, no, no. no.

871
00:50:52,518 --> 00:50:57,283
I think you have a lot
more to say, damian.

872
00:50:57,317 --> 00:51:00,677
Well, I'm a little surprised
that you feel this way, ellen,

873
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:02,597
because i'd always thought
you had admired me.

874
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:05,475
No, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

875
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:07,875
I think that you should tell everyone...

876
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,681
what you just told Nick behind the set.

877
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:14,355
Hey, wait a second.
This isn't part of the scene.

878
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:16,651
No, say it anyway.
Say it anyway, damian.

879
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:18,915
The reason that this scene isn't working...

880
00:51:19,395 --> 00:51:23,233
is because you and I slept together
last night, right?

881
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:26,112
Did everyone hear that?

882
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:28,480
I fucked chad last night!

883
00:51:28,513 --> 00:51:30,912
This is exactly what I was trying to tell you.
It's about rejection!

884
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:33,792
Oh, you fucking asshole.

885
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:36,638
You think I give a fuck about you?

886
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:40,031
I was there to get laid.
And even that was a joke.

887
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:41,952
You're really starting
to fuckin' piss me off!

888
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:45,310
Oh, I am? Does that mean
you're not gonna wiggle around on the bed anymore...

889
00:51:45,343 --> 00:51:48,636
or stroke my hair all
soft and concerned...

890
00:51:48,669 --> 00:51:51,996
or kiss me like a soap-opera-acting
piece of shit? Fuck!

891
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:54,909
- Hey, hey, hey! All right!
- Come on! I'll kick the fuckin' shit outta you!

892
00:51:54,943 --> 00:51:56,965
hey, cut that... cut, cut, cut!
fucking loser!

893
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,955
I think we can
hold it right there.

894
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:02,588
Yeah, you bet we can hold it right there!
Wanda, call me a cab!

895
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,508
Hold on, chad. Just try and calm down.
Fuck you, man!

896
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,393
Hey, calm down.
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

897
00:52:06,428 --> 00:52:08,793
First of all, I'm outta here!
This movie's bullshit!

898
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:11,707
Hey, one second there, chad.
No reason for hostility, okay?

899
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,594
Why don't you shut up,
you fuckin' loser.

900
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:16,026
The only reason
I took a part in this movie...

901
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:20,345
is because someone said that you were tight
with Quentin Tarantino!

902
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:24,664
You're nowhere, man!
Do you want to go?

903
00:52:24,698 --> 00:52:26,551
Go! All right?

904
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,944
I am so sick of your shit,
you hostess twinkie motherfucker.

905
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:31,864
What did you say?

906
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:34,230
You heard me.
Say it again!

907
00:52:34,263 --> 00:52:39,062
You hostess twinkie motherfucker.

908
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,862
Ow!

909
00:52:47,702 --> 00:52:51,062
Goddamn it.
Everyone, just stop it! Get off...

910
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:53,428
Nicole, get off!
Nicole, get off of him!

911
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:58,260
Come on! Get off of him!
Ow! God! Oh!

912
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:00,179
I'm gonna kick your ass, chad.

913
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,020
Wolf! Oh, god! Oh, god.

914
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:07,346
Oh!

915
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,219
Oh, god. Wolf.

916
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,423
Come here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

917
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:20,817
Hey, hey, hey!
You wanna pick my brain, huh?

918
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:24,623
This is how I direct
twinkie motherfuckers like you!

919
00:53:24,657 --> 00:53:27,057
You scumbag!
Come on, i'll kick your ass!

920
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,376
You wanna pick my brain? Hold it,
tiger! Get off! Let go! Easy now!

921
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:34,255
Chad.

922
00:53:34,735 --> 00:53:36,894
Have a nice flight home, buddy!
fucking killed him!

923
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:39,054
The only reason I cast you
is because of your name!

924
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:42,413
Yeah, get him outta here! Take
him back to his hotel! shit!

925
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:45,260
Asshole.

926
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:49,134
Nicole, are you okay?
Don't touch me.

927
00:53:51,213 --> 00:53:55,052
Can I help, guys?
Oh, shit, my back. I pulled my back, bob.

928
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:02,698
It's calledtsunami.
A japanese tidal wave hits new york.

929
00:54:02,732 --> 00:54:05,611
You're an ex-navy seal frogman.
You're working undercover. You save the city.

930
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,458
You'd be perfect for the lead.
My number's there.

931
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:11,370
You call me, I call you.
Either way, it's been great working with you!

932
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:15,656
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

933
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,496
You were great in that richard gere movie.
Shut up.

934
00:54:19,529 --> 00:54:22,410
You are no different than he is. You
lie! You're deceitful! I'm not lying!

935
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:27,175
Christ, I tell everybody
how great you are.

936
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:30,567
I've got nothing but respect
and admiration for you.

937
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,927
Christ, Nick, now you're doing
your own fucking script.

938
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:41,606
Why do you think I wrote it?
I have no idea.

939
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,006
It's about you.

940
00:54:44,486 --> 00:54:47,365
It's how I feel about you.

941
00:54:48,804 --> 00:54:51,685
Did you get a bump on your head,
Nicky, 'cause you're talking like an idiot!

942
00:54:51,717 --> 00:54:55,011
No.

943
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:59,844
Nicole, I've loved you
since the day we met.

944
00:55:04,162 --> 00:55:07,008
Why didn't you tell me?

945
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:11,362
Because I didn't want anything
to interfere with us working together.

946
00:55:13,283 --> 00:55:15,680
Oh, god.

947
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:20,961
And all this time
I thought...

948
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:32,479
Oh, god.

949
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:46,396
Don't go out that door!
Why not?

950
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,276
Because it's part of the set, goddamn it!
Now go around.

951
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,603
Next time.
This is an emergency!

952
00:55:52,636 --> 00:55:54,556
Has ellen arrived yet?

953
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:57,915
check.
Well, get her into wardrobe right away!

954
00:55:57,949 --> 00:55:59,835
Scene five?
No, scene six.

955
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,195
Scene five has been postponed.
I'm not gonna tell you again!

956
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:06,553
Mr. Palomino isnotworking today.

957
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:09,913
What are you talking about?
Where's my goddamn smoke machine?

958
00:56:12,794 --> 00:56:15,913
Oh, god.

959
00:56:15,946 --> 00:56:18,998
Oh!

960
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:22,871
What do you want?
I gotta use the bathroom, man.

961
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:26,711
- It's really an emergency.
- Fuckin' knock!

962
00:56:26,744 --> 00:56:29,078
You're right.

963
00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:33,397
One of these days, I'm going
to punch somebody in the balls!

964
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,796
straighten up.
you're not gonna believe this, Nicole.

965
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,710
Just as we pull up in front of your apartment,
palomino tells me...

966
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:42,308
he is suddenly so sick he can't
possibly work today.

967
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:45,429
God. Was it something he ate?
Straighten up, please.

968
00:56:45,462 --> 00:56:47,795
I don't know.
Can he work tomorrow?

969
00:56:47,828 --> 00:56:49,714
Turn to your right.
Don't know that either.

970
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:52,148
But you know what?
I'm not going to worry about it.

971
00:56:52,182 --> 00:56:54,513
I had this dream last night,
I was on set.

972
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:58,867
You were in it, and another woman,
somebody older.

973
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,232
Anyway, everything was going wrong...

974
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:03,186
and no matter how hard
I tried to keep things together...

975
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,073
the more they just fell apart.

976
00:57:05,106 --> 00:57:07,026
You know what that dream
was telling me, Nicole?

977
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,912
That I just have
to roll with it.

978
00:57:08,945 --> 00:57:11,346
That's what I'm going to do today.
I am rolling with it.

979
00:57:11,379 --> 00:57:14,191
So we shoot the dream sequence.

980
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:17,104
Hey, tito, man, you look great!
I feel like shit!

981
00:57:17,138 --> 00:57:18,991
No, no, no, you look good,
really.

982
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:21,904
Hey, thank you so much
for coming in on such short notice.

983
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:26,223
This is, ah, Nicole. She's playing ellen.
Hi. Toto, is it?

984
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:28,109
Tito.

985
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:31,468
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, so listen.

986
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:34,381
If there's anything I can do for you to...
you just let me know.

987
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:38,668
Put a stool in the bathroom.

988
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:40,587
Don't move, I'll be right back.
Okay.

989
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,500
Tito, tito, your costume length...
did I just offend him?

990
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:46,347
Why, what'd you say?
"Short notice. "

991
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,739
Please, that was nothing. My god,
I'm the one who called him "toto. "

992
00:57:49,773 --> 00:57:53,099
You know, I am so out of it, I dreamt
I was on the set last night too.

993
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:54,985
Yeah?
Yep.

994
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:58,379
You were in the dream.
Was I freaking out?

995
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,225
Actually you were.

996
00:58:01,258 --> 00:58:03,178
Great. I freak out in your
dream. I freak out in my dream.

997
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:06,058
No wonder
I'm fucking exhausted.

998
00:58:08,456 --> 00:58:11,783
Nick?
Yeah?

999
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:15,142
Nothing.

1000
00:58:15,176 --> 00:58:18,055
All right, guys.
Special effects today. Could be kind of fun.

1001
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,975
Who knows how
to work this baby?

1002
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,854
It's the old t160.
I used it once in '85.

1003
00:58:22,888 --> 00:58:25,222
Damn. '85.
What's this?

1004
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:27,654
That's where the gas go.
Nah, that's where the oil go.

1005
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:29,540
Is it?
I'm pretty sure.

1006
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:31,733
How do you know?
No, he's right. It's coming back now.

1007
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:33,893
I'm gonna let you handle this, bob.
This is your baby.

1008
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:36,773
Les, if he needs any help,
give him a hand. Word.

1009
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:39,172
Okay, guys, we're all workin'
together today.

1010
00:58:40,613 --> 00:58:43,972
Yeah, it's comin' back now.
It's like ridin' a bike.

1011
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:48,068
T160, 1985.
Anybody seen wanda?

1012
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:52,130
1985, t160.
Wanda? Way to go, bob!

1013
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,931
How we doin', wanda?
Not good.

1014
00:58:56,964 --> 00:58:58,818
Not bad, but not good.

1015
00:58:58,851 --> 00:59:02,209
We have to finish this scene
today and do scene 31.

1016
00:59:02,243 --> 00:59:04,575
Scene 31? Today?
Yeah.

1017
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:06,769
I don't even have my notes.
I left my notebook at home.

1018
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:08,928
Nobody told me we were doing scene 31.
I'll send someone...

1019
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:10,814
to your apartment
and they'll pick up the notes.

1020
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:12,768
Send someone to my apartment to get my
red notebook. It's underneath the bed.

1021
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,614
Oh, fine. All right.
Okay. It's taken care of. Thank you.

1022
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:19,487
Hey, bob, get that smoke machine cranked up, buddy.
I want a lot of smoke today.

1023
00:59:19,521 --> 00:59:22,846
We're smokin'. All right.
We're lit. The smoke machine's under control.

1024
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,171
We're ready to go.
Yeah, but what about the dolly?

1025
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:29,085
Hey, just need to see a little run-through
and we're all set.

1026
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,446
I'm gonna make your job
easy today, wanda. Hmm.

1027
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,771
Wandaful, wandaful,
wandaful.

1028
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:40,124
Mmm. I sure am glad
you wore that perfume.

1029
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:43,931
Hey, don't worry
about palomino.

1030
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:48,763
I'll take you to that jazz club tonight, yes.
Oh, I can't tonight.

1031
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:52,603
I promised i'd visit chad.
He's extremely ill. Oh.

1032
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:56,443
By the way, my eye's much better.

1033
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:58,807
Yeah?
Yeah.

1034
00:59:58,841 --> 01:00:00,761
Listen, wolf, come here.

1035
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:08,440
I know this may not be the
best time to tell you this,

1036
01:00:08,473 --> 01:00:13,206
but our relationship is going nowhere.
What do you mean?

1037
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:18,518
Please don't take this personally,
because I care for you, wolf. I really do.

1038
01:00:18,998 --> 01:00:21,365
But I've been feeling
this way for quite awhile,

1039
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:26,678
and I really just think
that it's best if we just end it.

1040
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:29,524
Okay?

1041
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:32,438
Okay.
I think it's better.

1042
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:35,282
So do i.
Well, good.

1043
01:00:35,316 --> 01:00:38,642
Yeah. Sure.
So we're still friends?

1044
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,556
Oh, well, great. Because, I mean,
we have to work together,

1045
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:44,436
and I don't think that
it has to be unpleasant.

1046
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:46,356
No, no.

1047
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:49,715
Well, give me a hug.

1048
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:55,473
You are a real special guy, wolf.

1049
01:00:55,954 --> 01:00:57,840
Thanks.

1050
01:00:57,874 --> 01:00:59,792
you're gonna have to put the microphone forward.
Don't you hear that?

1051
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:04,559
Oh. Okay.
Can you hear me?

1052
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:06,992
I'd like to get the a-team
in here, please:

1053
01:01:07,025 --> 01:01:09,838
Um, ellen and Nick
and mr. Tito.

1054
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:13,231
Everyone pay attention.
We are rehearsing scene six.

1055
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:18,030
I want it absolutely quiet.
Director working with actors.

1056
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:20,397
Okay, listen up,
here's the shot.

1057
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:24,750
We start wide with ellen absolutely still
in the middle of the frame.

1058
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:27,149
Okay? You with me, wolf?
Yeah.

1059
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,028
What happened to your eye?
Nothing. It's just sensitive today.

1060
01:01:30,508 --> 01:01:31,949
Can you see?
Of course I can see!

1061
01:01:32,428 --> 01:01:37,228
Okay. Ellen is standing
still and the smoke is flowing in.

1062
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:40,588
And your first line?
"I am so hungry. "

1063
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:42,473
Good. That's
your cue, tito.

1064
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:45,353
All right,
then you come in, and you circle her once.

1065
01:01:45,386 --> 01:01:48,266
You hold that apple out, just beyond
her reach. You're reaching for it.

1066
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,665
Good, and you're
staring at her hard. Harder.

1067
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:54,985
Good. Stop right there.
All right. Can we get a mark, please?

1068
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:58,345
All right, then we dolly in
with a medium shot.

1069
01:01:58,379 --> 01:02:01,001
What do you think?
It should be hand-held.

1070
01:02:01,035 --> 01:02:03,591
No, I think
it's better on the dolly.

1071
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:05,991
Nick, do I see him?
no. You just see the apple.

1072
01:02:06,024 --> 01:02:09,864
Tito, after that dolly in, give
me a little laugh there at the end.

1073
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:12,743
A little laugh?
Big, little, whatever you feel like doing.

1074
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:14,663
Okay?
All right?

1075
01:02:15,143 --> 01:02:17,509
Good. Let's shoot one.
Call it, wanda.

1076
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,901
Okay, here we go.
The dream sequence is up.

1077
01:02:21,382 --> 01:02:23,302
Action
on the smoke machine.

1078
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,660
Okay, lock it up.
Here we go. Roll sound. Speed.

1079
01:02:26,694 --> 01:02:29,507
Roll camera. Hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

1080
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,940
Bob, could we get a little more smoke?
Is that possible?

1081
01:02:31,974 --> 01:02:34,357
Oh, sure. all right,
good. Call it, wanda.

1082
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:36,740
and roll sound. Speed. Roll camera.

1083
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:39,139
Rolling.
Scene six, take one.

1084
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:43,218
And... action!

1085
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:45,858
I am so hungry.

1086
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,656
Cut! That's a cut.
Nick, comments?

1087
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:05,055
Yeah, just a couple.

1088
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,422
Okay, that was, uh...
that was good.

1089
01:03:07,455 --> 01:03:10,814
Tito, that was good, man,really.
You didn't feel like laughing?

1090
01:03:10,848 --> 01:03:12,734
I laughed.
Oh. Okay, I guess I missed it.

1091
01:03:13,214 --> 01:03:15,102
You can make it bigger.
All right?

1092
01:03:15,134 --> 01:03:19,692
And, ellen, uh... maybe a little
more tension when you see him.

1093
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:24,252
I thought I didn't see him.
Right. Maybe you see him a little bit.

1094
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:26,619
All right, wait,
do I see him or not?

1095
01:03:26,653 --> 01:03:29,532
You see him.
Okay. Okay. Then what is the tension?

1096
01:03:29,565 --> 01:03:32,858
I mean, who is toto?
It's tito.

1097
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,218
What did I say?
Oh, my god, I'm sorry. "Toto. "

1098
01:03:36,252 --> 01:03:41,530
Tito, I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm
doing that. Ellen, let's concentrate.

1099
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:43,930
Remember, tomorrow
you're marrying damian.

1100
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:46,296
You're a little anxious,
and you have this dream.

1101
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:51,129
Let's call it an anxiety dream. And
tito represents the anxiety. Okay?

1102
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:53,785
Sounds pretty simple,
right? All right. Let's just try it.

1103
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:56,408
And, uh, bob, let's really
have some smoke on this one.

1104
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,295
All right?
Okay, more smoke.

1105
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:00,727
Good! Let's everybody
just relax. This is the one right here.

1106
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:03,574
I still think
it should be hand-held.

1107
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:06,007
Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-held.
I want it on the dolly.

1108
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,893
Where's my notebook, wanda?
It's on its way.

1109
01:04:07,926 --> 01:04:10,326
All right. Call it, wanda.
All right, and roll sound.

1110
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,213
Speed.
Roll camera.

1111
01:04:12,246 --> 01:04:14,166
Rolling.
Scene six, take two.

1112
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:17,526
Action!

1113
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:20,884
I am so hungry.

1114
01:04:34,803 --> 01:04:37,202
Cut!
That's a cut.

1115
01:04:37,236 --> 01:04:39,570
Nick, again?
Yes.

1116
01:04:39,603 --> 01:04:41,489
All right, we're
going again right away.

1117
01:04:41,522 --> 01:04:44,641
Okay, ellen, good. I think
you're on to something here. Good?

1118
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:47,761
I'm sorry, something's not
right. This all feels fake to me.

1119
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:50,606
It's not fake!
It's real!

1120
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:53,006
Just remember, you really
want that apple, okay?

1121
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,440
Tito, I still think we could
see more of a laugh at the end.

1122
01:04:55,473 --> 01:04:57,856
What kind of laugh?

1123
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:00,206
Just a laugh.
Show me.

1124
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,045
Oh. Okay, uh...

1125
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,919
I'm thinking maybe something like this.

1126
01:05:07,953 --> 01:05:10,284
Something like that.

1127
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,197
All right?
Now remember, tito, ellen, this is a dream.

1128
01:05:13,232 --> 01:05:15,084
It doesn't have
to make sense.

1129
01:05:15,117 --> 01:05:17,997
A laugh right there could
heighten our sense of, uh...

1130
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,363
anxiety.

1131
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:22,555
Exactly. Wolf,
how was that for you?

1132
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:24,716
I still think
it should be hand-held.

1133
01:05:25,196 --> 01:05:26,637
Goddamn it!
It's not going to be!

1134
01:05:27,114 --> 01:05:29,515
I want it on the dolly!
So why don't you just forget about it?

1135
01:05:29,549 --> 01:05:31,435
And, bob, what the fuck
is with that smoke, man?

1136
01:05:31,915 --> 01:05:34,761
You got a couple of hamsters in there
blowing smoke rings for christ's sake?

1137
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:38,634
The left septic valve wasn't open. I got
it now. You're gonna see some smoke now.

1138
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:42,954
Okay, good. All right.
Call it, wanda. Uh, and, lock it up.

1139
01:05:42,987 --> 01:05:44,874
Nick, I need to talk to you for a minute.
What?

1140
01:05:45,352 --> 01:05:47,238
In private.

1141
01:05:47,272 --> 01:05:49,158
Okay,
release the lockup,

1142
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:52,759
and everyone stand by.
Yo, bob, you still ain't getting no smoke, man.

1143
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:56,392
I really don't like being spoken to like
this, Nick. I don't like your attitude.

1144
01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:58,757
I don't have an attitude.
The hell you don't!

1145
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:02,152
Every time I ask you to do something, it's
"no, no, no, hand-held. " I'm sick of it!

1146
01:06:02,185 --> 01:06:05,510
I hired you to do a job. If you're not
going to do it, let me know right now.

1147
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:08,389
Nick...

1148
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:12,195
I'm...
I'm sorry, Nick.

1149
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:17,509
I'm just going through some
really heavy shit right now.

1150
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:20,389
What do you mean?
I can't really talk about it,

1151
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:25,188
but it's pretty heavy.
Personal?

1152
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,827
Personal, professional
and emotional.

1153
01:06:35,265 --> 01:06:37,632
It's really doing
a number on me, man.

1154
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,512
Now you're telling me that you're
gonna fire me. I can't handle it.

1155
01:06:40,545 --> 01:06:44,864
I never said that. Wolf, I'm not gonna
fire you. You're doing a great job.

1156
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:47,711
Am i?
Yeah, man.

1157
01:06:47,745 --> 01:06:50,863
I don't know what i'd do without you.
You've got a great eye.

1158
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:53,984
I just hope it's not the one
under that eye patch.

1159
01:06:56,384 --> 01:06:59,743
Hey, listen, wolf.
Let me tell you something I've learned. All right?

1160
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:03,102
Sometimes you just have
to roll with things, you know?

1161
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:08,861
You're right.
Yeah, so just, just, just roll with it, man.

1162
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:10,781
It'll be okay.

1163
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:14,587
Thanks, bro.

1164
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:17,980
That's where the oil goes.
No, it's where the gas goes.

1165
01:07:18,013 --> 01:07:20,346
I'm tellin' you, bob,
that's where the oil go.

1166
01:07:20,379 --> 01:07:22,779
Lester, don't you think bob knows
where the oil goes?

1167
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:27,098
I don't remember
using oil in '85.

1168
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:28,985
That's a hard one.

1169
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:32,378
Maybe that's where both the oil
and the gas go.

1170
01:07:36,696 --> 01:07:40,536
I- I think he's right.
I think he is too.

1171
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:43,896
Three parts gas,
one part oil.

1172
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:46,776
we're all set now. Okay, everybody,
come on, let's look alive here.

1173
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:49,175
Okay.

1174
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:51,095
Is my notebook here yet?
Any minute, Nick.

1175
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:53,015
Good.
Call it, wanda.

1176
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:57,334
action on the smoke
machine, and roll sound. Speed.

1177
01:07:57,368 --> 01:08:01,654
Roll camera.
Rollin'. Scene six, take three.

1178
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:04,020
Action.

1179
01:08:04,053 --> 01:08:06,453
I am so hungry.

1180
01:08:15,572 --> 01:08:18,898
Oh... shit.
Uh... whoa! Jesus!

1181
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:22,258
All right, cut, cut, cut!

1182
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:25,650
bob, are you okay?

1183
01:08:26,131 --> 01:08:27,057
Pull the plug!

1184
01:08:27,091 --> 01:08:29,490
You all right?
I can't find the switch.

1185
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:31,856
All right, okay, all right!
Clear the set!

1186
01:08:31,889 --> 01:08:35,215
Ellen, tito, please step off the set!

1187
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:37,169
what did you do?
I'm off the set.

1188
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:39,055
So am i.
Well, who's that?

1189
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:41,456
Nick, wanda...
who is that? Get off the set!

1190
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:44,815
I'm back with Nick's notebook.

1191
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:47,248
Please get us
some water in here!

1192
01:08:47,282 --> 01:08:51,087
- Hi, Nicky.
- Mom?

1193
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:54,925
Her name is cora reve. R-e-v-e.

1194
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:58,286
Blue housecoat,
blue slippers.

1195
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:02,125
How do I know that?
She's sitting 20 feet away from me.

1196
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:05,005
Yeah, well, sweetheart, that's gonna be a real
fuckin' problem...

1197
01:09:05,485 --> 01:09:07,884
because I don't have
available people to go...

1198
01:09:08,365 --> 01:09:10,764
she was waiting outside Nick's place when I went
to get his notebook.

1199
01:09:11,244 --> 01:09:14,123
She said she was looking for him, so I figured
I should bring her here.

1200
01:09:14,603 --> 01:09:16,523
You look pretty in that dress.

1201
01:09:17,004 --> 01:09:18,890
How did you get here?
I took a bus here.

1202
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:21,323
Went right to your apartment.
How did you get out of your room?

1203
01:09:21,356 --> 01:09:24,459
Oh, I just went
right through the door.

1204
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,562
It was unlocked?
Oh, no, it was locked!

1205
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,928
I just went right through it.

1206
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:32,327
It's something
I've learned to do, Nick.

1207
01:09:32,362 --> 01:09:35,960
I can walk through
just about anything, like air.

1208
01:09:35,994 --> 01:09:39,526
Mom, you've got to stop this.
I'm serious, okay?

1209
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,880
I'm a little upset with you. You
could have gotten lost or hurt.

1210
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:47,686
But I wanted to see you, Nick.
I miss you.

1211
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:52,998
Mom, I miss you too,
but this is not really a good time.

1212
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,957
Nick, they're sending a car.
It'll be here in a couple of hours

1213
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:03,556
they didn't even know she was gone.
Jesus, I don't believe this.

1214
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,923
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

1215
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:10,756
If I knew there was gonna
be a wedding, I would have worn my fuckin' hat.

1216
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,676
Ho, ho, ho.

1217
01:10:14,595 --> 01:10:16,516
Ha, ha, ha.

1218
01:10:18,436 --> 01:10:20,799
Ha, ha, ha.

1219
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:23,680
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.

1220
01:10:23,714 --> 01:10:25,600
Over here,
in this blue chair.

1221
01:10:25,633 --> 01:10:28,993
All right, you just sit here.
Can you see? ha, ha, ha.

1222
01:10:29,028 --> 01:10:30,913
Is the little fellow
going to do gymnastics? Shh!

1223
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,280
No, mom!
Come on now.

1224
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,232
You've got to be quiet,
all right? Absolutely quiet.

1225
01:10:35,713 --> 01:10:38,113
Okay.

1226
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:41,951
Okay, where the hell are we?
What's going on? How's the smoke machine?

1227
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:44,797
It's dead.
I've got calls to every effects house in the city.

1228
01:10:44,831 --> 01:10:47,710
I can't locate one here, but in los angeles...
okay, forget it, forget it!

1229
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,111
We'll shoot without it.
But, Nick, it is a dream sequence.

1230
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,991
I know, wanda. It's okay.
We still have tito.

1231
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,390
All right?
We'll just gonna have to roll with it.

1232
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:57,755
Right, wolf?

1233
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:01,148
Yeah. All right.
Good, here we go.

1234
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:03,549
Ellen... all right, listen to me.
Nick, I... okay...

1235
01:11:04,028 --> 01:11:06,908
you've got to reach for that apple.
Keep reaching for it.

1236
01:11:06,942 --> 01:11:08,794
I don't feel like
you really want it.

1237
01:11:08,827 --> 01:11:12,188
You're looking at it like, oh, it's an apple, yeah,
but you gotta want it.

1238
01:11:12,222 --> 01:11:14,587
I don't know what you have to do,
how many times I have to tell you.

1239
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:19,386
But you've got to want that apple, all right?
Nicole, what...

1240
01:11:20,345 --> 01:11:22,265
two seconds, wanda.
Then we shoot, goddamn it!

1241
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:27,032
Nicole, what's the matter?

1242
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:29,432
You tell me.
You're the one with the bug up your ass.

1243
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:33,064
- Hey, wait just one second!
- You know, you've been picking on me all day, Nick!

1244
01:11:33,099 --> 01:11:36,663
I can't do anything right! Well, I'm
sorry if I've been short with you, Nicole,

1245
01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:38,583
but I think you can see
I'm under a little pressure.

1246
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:41,463
I'm shooting a dream sequence
without a smoke machine,

1247
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,863
I've got my mother thinking
she's at a circus wedding...

1248
01:11:43,897 --> 01:11:45,749
and then you tell me
the whole movie seems fake!

1249
01:11:45,782 --> 01:11:48,663
I never said that.
You did too! You said, "everything feels fake"!

1250
01:11:48,697 --> 01:11:51,988
I meant me!
I feel fake!

1251
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:53,941
Everything I'm doing
feels fake!

1252
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,820
I can't act!
I should just do shower scenes...

1253
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,221
in richard gere movies
for the rest of my life!

1254
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:03,507
Nicole, that's ridiculous.
You're a fantastic actress.

1255
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:08,339
All you have to do is show me you want that
apple more than anything else in the world.

1256
01:12:08,821 --> 01:12:11,699
Don't give up.
Understand?

1257
01:12:13,138 --> 01:12:14,579
Okay.

1258
01:12:15,058 --> 01:12:18,418
You ready, Nick? One second. You ready?

1259
01:12:18,452 --> 01:12:21,298
Yeah.
Come on.

1260
01:12:24,657 --> 01:12:26,577
Look out.

1261
01:12:28,017 --> 01:12:30,895
Sorry, Nick.
How's your dress?

1262
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:37,101
Here we go.
Everybody concentrate and focus.

1263
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,534
Tito, we're still looking
for a little laugh, pal.

1264
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:41,901
Heard you the first time.
Call it, wanda.

1265
01:12:41,934 --> 01:12:46,733
Okay, picture's up. There will be
no smoke, in this scene, all right?

1266
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:49,869
No smoke. No smoke
in the dream sequence.

1267
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:52,940
And lock it up.

1268
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:55,612
Roll sound. Roll camera.
Speed.

1269
01:12:55,646 --> 01:12:58,252
Rolling.
Scene six, take four.

1270
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:00,138
Action.

1271
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:02,572
I am so hungry.

1272
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:19,335
Mom!

1273
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:22,215
That was great.
What is the matter?

1274
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:25,127
Cut! Please stand by, people.
It's only a momentary delay.

1275
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,495
We're gonna be going again
right away.

1276
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:32,328
Listen to me, mom. Do not move from this chair.
Do you understand me?

1277
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:36,647
Jesus, you sound just like your father.
Mom, I'm serious!

1278
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,967
Okay.
Okay, I won't move.

1279
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,852
Thank you.

1280
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,805
I won't move.
Okay, good.

1281
01:13:45,285 --> 01:13:46,725
Very good.

1282
01:13:48,164 --> 01:13:50,051
Tito...

1283
01:13:50,084 --> 01:13:52,965
I think we're having
a little communication problem here.

1284
01:13:52,998 --> 01:13:57,301
All I want you to do is laugh. Okay?
Why?

1285
01:13:57,334 --> 01:14:01,569
I told you why.
Tell me again.

1286
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,963
look, tito, you're overanalyzing this
whole thing. All right?

1287
01:14:05,443 --> 01:14:07,329
I wanna be specific.

1288
01:14:07,362 --> 01:14:11,649
Good.
Where'd you study?

1289
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:13,568
That's irrelevant,
where I studied.

1290
01:14:13,602 --> 01:14:16,961
I just want you to know...
I'm just trying to get a feel...

1291
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:22,720
In order to laugh, you don't need a technique.
You just laugh.

1292
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:24,606
I want you to show me
how to laugh.

1293
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,446
I showed you.
I don't want you to copy my laugh.

1294
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,365
You just do whatever laugh.
Think of the funniest thing...

1295
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,758
what if I don't think anything's funny?
Think of something funny.

1296
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:37,374
Maybe you could give me something funny.
I don't know your life,

1297
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:40,957
so you're gonna have to help me
out here. It's not a very fun life.

1298
01:14:44,797 --> 01:14:46,683
Okay?
Why?

1299
01:14:46,717 --> 01:14:50,043
Look, tito, it's not
that big of a deal.

1300
01:14:50,077 --> 01:14:53,402
It's a dream.
Strange things happen in a dream.

1301
01:14:53,436 --> 01:14:56,796
All I want you to do is laugh.
Why is that such a problem for you?

1302
01:14:56,829 --> 01:15:00,155
Why does it have to be a dwarf?
What?

1303
01:15:00,635 --> 01:15:03,994
Why does my character
have to be a dwarf?

1304
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:07,321
It doesn't have
to be a dwarf. Then why is he?

1305
01:15:07,355 --> 01:15:11,194
Is that the only way you can make this a dream?
Put a dwarf in it?

1306
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:15,992
No, tito, i... haveyouever
had a dream with a dwarf in it?

1307
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:20,312
Do you know anyone who's had
a dream with a dwarf in it? No!

1308
01:15:20,345 --> 01:15:23,639
I don't even have dreams
with dwarves in them.

1309
01:15:23,672 --> 01:15:27,511
The only place I've seen dwarves in
dreams is in stupid movies like this!

1310
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:29,448
Oh, make it weird.
Put a dwarf in it.

1311
01:15:29,481 --> 01:15:31,317
Everyone will go,
"whoa, whoa, whoa!

1312
01:15:31,351 --> 01:15:33,716
It must be a fuckin' dream!
There's a fuckin' dwarf in it!"

1313
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,549
Well, I'm sick of it! You can take this
dream sequence and shove it up your ass!

1314
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:12,111
Nick, I can get right
on the phone.

1315
01:16:12,145 --> 01:16:15,505
We can try to get another
small person here...

1316
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:18,351
as soon as possible.

1317
01:16:18,384 --> 01:16:21,710
No.
He's absolutely right.

1318
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,104
Do you wanna just shoot with ellen, Nick?
She could be in the dream by herself.

1319
01:16:25,138 --> 01:16:27,983
No.

1320
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:31,342
We're not gonna
shoot anything.

1321
01:16:31,376 --> 01:16:33,228
I'm sorry.

1322
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:36,622
Thanks for all your help,
but... it's over.

1323
01:16:36,656 --> 01:16:40,237
I can't take it anymore.

1324
01:16:40,272 --> 01:16:43,787
I tried to roll with it...

1325
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:47,180
but it's time
to face the music.

1326
01:16:47,213 --> 01:16:49,356
I can't do this.

1327
01:16:49,389 --> 01:16:51,466
The shoot is over.

1328
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,379
I give up.

1329
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:56,746
Shit.

1330
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,699
Take the camera
off the dolly, start putting it away.

1331
01:16:58,733 --> 01:17:02,539
He can't be serious.

1332
01:17:09,737 --> 01:17:11,657
Give me that apple.

1333
01:17:19,816 --> 01:17:22,182
I'm ready, Nick.

1334
01:17:22,215 --> 01:17:24,581
What does that mean?

1335
01:17:24,615 --> 01:17:28,454
Roll sound.
Roll camera, wolf. Roll camera.

1336
01:17:28,488 --> 01:17:32,310
Give me the camera. Shh, shh, shh.

1337
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:36,134
Action.
I am so hungry.

1338
01:17:46,692 --> 01:17:49,091
I'm so hungry.

1339
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:11,169
Cut! Whoa, whoa, wolf, talk to me, man.
Did you get that?

1340
01:18:11,203 --> 01:18:13,569
Got it! Nick,
I'm tellin' ya, everything!

1341
01:18:13,602 --> 01:18:15,935
The laugh?
Yeah, see? Perfect!

1342
01:18:15,968 --> 01:18:18,847
Now that's what I meant about goin' hand-held.
You're a genius!

1343
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,247
What about the focus?
nailed it!

1344
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:23,646
Yes! Okay! All right!

1345
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,453
Going again, Nick?
How was the sound?

1346
01:18:27,487 --> 01:18:29,886
I could use another,
but definitely acceptable.

1347
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,212
Mom, you kook!
That was incredible!

1348
01:18:33,246 --> 01:18:35,645
Did you know we were filming?
Of course I knew you were filming.

1349
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,011
You're a natural!

1350
01:18:38,044 --> 01:18:40,444
Nicole, that was beautiful!
That was it! Come here.

1351
01:18:40,477 --> 01:18:43,804
Oh, don't you dare tell me
that felt fake.

1352
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:49,562
Going again, Nick?
Uh, all right, let me just think.

1353
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:55,803
Can I really use this for the dream sequence?
That's the question.

1354
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:59,642
Does it work
for the dream sequence?

1355
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:14,006
We're gonna go with it, wanda!
All right, everybody, listen up!

1356
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,919
That was a wrap on scene six!
Put it there, pal! We're gonna roll with it!

1357
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:22,679
Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

1358
01:19:22,712 --> 01:19:24,565
Hold it, hold it!

1359
01:19:24,599 --> 01:19:28,438
what?
I still have to record room tone.

1360
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,283
I'll need 30 seconds
of silence.

1361
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:34,676
Okay, okay, everybody,
30 seconds of silence. I want to talk to you.

1362
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,562
What's room tone?
You just have to be quiet, mom.

1363
01:19:36,596 --> 01:19:38,483
shut up!
It's for the sound guy.

1364
01:19:38,516 --> 01:19:41,397
The sooner we do this, the
sooner it's finished with. Shh.

1365
01:19:41,429 --> 01:19:44,052
Quiet! Quiet!

1366
01:19:44,085 --> 01:19:46,676
Now, nobody move!

1367
01:19:47,155 --> 01:19:49,554
Roll sound.
Speed.

1368
01:19:50,515 --> 01:19:52,434
Mic's in position.

1369
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:57,713
Scene six, room tone,
rolling.

1370
01:20:21,231 --> 01:20:23,150
We have a new category
this year:

1371
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:27,949
"Best film ever made
by a human being. "

1372
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:32,269
And the winner is...
¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü¢Ü

1373
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:34,668
None other than my best bud,
Nick reve!

1374
01:20:47,147 --> 01:20:49,513
Had any experience?

1375
01:20:49,547 --> 01:20:54,345
Um, well, I was,
I was an actress for awhile.

1376
01:20:56,746 --> 01:20:59,145
Yeah, but can you
cook a hamburger?

1377
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,064
Probably.

1378
01:21:13,064 --> 01:21:14,984
Oh!

1379
01:21:15,463 --> 01:21:18,309
I'm sorry, wolf.
Please, please forgive me!

1380
01:21:18,343 --> 01:21:22,661
I love you, wolf! I love you!
Give me another chance.

1381
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:27,940
Oh!

1382
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:38,499
You know what I love
about you...

1383
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:41,635
is you're not afraid
of my power.

1384
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:44,705
Oh, god, wanda,
I love your power.

1385
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:47,619
It's like an aphrodisiac to me!

1386
01:21:59,616 --> 01:22:03,456
That's my big beef special.
I'm gonna take it right over.

1387
01:22:10,656 --> 01:22:12,576
Hey, mo, how's your baby?

1388
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:14,494
Mmm.

1389
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:28,173
Dr. Zamansky, dr. Zamansky,

1390
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:31,292
please call extension 2906.

1391
01:22:32,732 --> 01:22:36,571
Dr. Hubert, dr. Hubert, please
call the administrator's office.

1392
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:41,817
In closing, I would...

1393
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:43,770
I would like to say
to all the people out there...

1394
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:47,576
who told me
not to make this movie...

1395
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:50,010
who, who said no to me
when I asked them for money...

1396
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:55,288
who, who wouldn't even read the script
or return a simple phone call.

1397
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:59,094
To my favorite teacher
at film school who,

1398
01:22:59,128 --> 01:23:02,967
whose parting advice to me was to, uh, try
and find a job somewhere...

1399
01:23:03,002 --> 01:23:05,367
teaching spanish
at a women's college.

1400
01:23:09,207 --> 01:23:11,572
And to, uh...

1401
01:23:11,606 --> 01:23:14,966
delores del sorto,
the girl I loved...

1402
01:23:15,446 --> 01:23:18,325
I mean, I really loved
in high school...

1403
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:20,245
who, who left me for...

1404
01:23:20,726 --> 01:23:24,085
a- a-a junior varsity football player.

1405
01:23:24,118 --> 01:23:27,411
To all these people
and many more,

1406
01:23:27,445 --> 01:23:32,723
I- I would love to say thank you,

1407
01:23:32,756 --> 01:23:35,569
but I can't...

1408
01:23:35,603 --> 01:23:38,003
because what I really
feel like saying is...

1409
01:23:38,036 --> 01:23:39,922
"go fu... "

1410
01:23:48,513 --> 01:23:52,799
And... that's a cut
on room tone.

1411
01:23:52,832 --> 01:23:55,199
Okay, strike the set! Oh! Sorry, mom.

1412
01:23:55,233 --> 01:23:59,552
Props, art department, we're moving on to scene 31.
Sit down over there.

1413
01:23:59,585 --> 01:24:02,431
Okay, let's go, people!
Come on! Where's my notebook?

1414
01:24:02,465 --> 01:24:04,350
Nick? Nick!
Has anyone seen Nick?

1415
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:09,869
can Nicole
get out of her wardrobe?

1416
01:24:09,903 --> 01:24:13,366
All right,
camera off the dolly!

1417
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,829
Nick!
I want a twenty on Nick.
