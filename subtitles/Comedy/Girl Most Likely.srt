1
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,982
There's no place like home.

2
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:24,182
There's no place like home.

3
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:28,495
There's no place like home.

4
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,136
I'm sorry, I just...

5
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:33,655
This isn't working for me.

6
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:37,496
What is it now, Imogene?

7
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:39,222
Okay.

8
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:41,659
I don't know about you, Ms. Rossi,

9
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,658
but there's not a chance in
hell that I'd go back

10
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:45,225
to some crap-farm in Kansas.

11
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,582
After seeing all that Oz has to offer.

12
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,135
I mean, it makes zero sense.

13
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,821
- You guys are with me on this, right?
- Mmm-mmm.

14
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,136
That is the way this story ends.

15
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,546
It's a classic!

16
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,266
It's also a little
provincial, if you ask me.

17
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,416
I didn't.

18
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,942
Can I at least
suggest a more appropriate line?

19
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,177
No! You will do the lines as written

20
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:07,620
or I am giving the lead to Stacy!

21
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:17,940
There's no place like home.

22
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,382
Home is really fabulous!

23
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,025
Home is where the heart is!

24
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:26,057
Blah... Blah... Blah.

25
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,741
Joe, I need a taxi.

26
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:41,941
No problem.

27
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,344
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

28
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,019
Hi, it's me again.

29
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:49,099
You never came home,
so I assume we're meeting there?

30
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:51,064
Uh, I hope you're okay.

31
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:52,136
Call me.

32
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,898
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

33
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,420
Hey, it's me.

34
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:05,941
If you get there first,
would you wait outside?

35
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,706
I'd really like to walk in together.

36
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,618
Oh, by the way, I just passed the place

37
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:12,459
where you held my hand
for the first time.

38
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,660
Call me, please.

39
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,021
Call me.

40
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:18,142
Shit.

41
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,504
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

42
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,576
Okay, I just got here,

43
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,816
and I'm walking in. Are you here?

44
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,659
I'm here.
I'm putting my phone on vibrate.

45
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:35,696
So just text me so I can find you.
I'm here. Bye.

46
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,299
- Hi. Imogene Duncan.
- Mmm-hmm.

47
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:20,259
<i>2 years ago, a young man from Newark</i>

48
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:25,057
broke into the Whitney Museum
by smashing a window with a brick.

49
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,536
He wanted to look at the pictures.

50
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:31,825
The crime committed that night had
nothing to do with breaking windows,

51
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,499
or living in New Jersey.

52
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:37,022
It had to do with denying a child.

53
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,260
Hey, where were you?

54
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:41,099
I was stuck on a call.

55
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,862
And that's why the Where The
Art ls Foundation was created,

56
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:50,782
so that no child
ever has to break a window again.

57
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,424
You know, the idea just
sort of came to me,

58
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:02,099
when James and I were on our honeymoon.

59
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:07,386
And I realized that
I want to be more than just a wife,

60
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:11,064
and an author, and an interior designer.

61
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,456
I know, I've been
thinking the same thing.

62
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:14,980
You know, it's been weighing on me.

63
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,580
But are you even married?

64
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,298
Oh. Mostly. Basically.

65
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,981
We live together, and
we've talked about it.

66
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,945
Peter's family is Dutch.

67
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:27,062
Yeah, and they're a very
progressive people.

68
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:31,220
You know, they believe in a spiritual
union, where your souls are bound.

69
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:34,378
That's what he said to me,
which is very romantic.

70
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,255
It's like how gay people
used to get married.

71
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:39,504
Oh, Austen and I are
starting a charity for that.

72
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:40,815
For gay people?

73
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,385
His younger sister is a lesbian,

74
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:45,265
and we just really
wanted to get involved.

75
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,496
- Wonderful!
- Wow!

76
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,179
I didn't realize she was a lesbian.

77
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:49,666
I knew she was a lesbian.

78
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,464
I mean, I went to Spence.

79
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,546
Oh, I heard Andover had
a lot of them, too.

80
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:55,696
Yeah, I know.

81
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,300
Isn't that where you
went to school, Imogene?

82
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,025
Andover? No, that was Peter.

83
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:00,855
So, where did you...

84
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,061
She's from New Jersey.

85
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,216
Oh.

86
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:08,337
I love that sculpture

87
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,179
of Abe Lincoln.

88
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,496
That is phenomenal...

89
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,663
He's got a little smirk.

90
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:16,985
What's he thinking?

91
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:22,786
I'm stuffed.

92
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:26,379
They really went all out tonight.
It was so fun.

93
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:31,417
You know, tonight really made me
contemplate how lucky we are.

94
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:33,415
And all the beauty
that we just take for granted.

95
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:36,140
You know, all the museums, the park.

96
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:39,342
The 100-year-old buildings.

97
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:41,865
- The trees...
- Imogene,

98
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,626
I should move out.

99
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,136
What?

100
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,739
I've already started
looking at apartments.

101
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:49,896
- What are you talking about?
- Look,

102
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,545
I can help you with rent
for a couple months

103
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,464
until you figure out what to do.

104
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,384
You're serious? Peter!

105
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:58,376
You said our souls were bound.
You said that.

106
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,065
I told people that you said that!

107
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:03,662
This isn't about souls, all right?

108
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:07,740
This is about
whether two people really go together.

109
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:58,856
Imogene?
Libby wants to see you in her office.

110
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,059
Right away.

111
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:05,976
Is that your family?

112
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,296
Oh! Yeah. That's the gang.

113
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,537
- The Vineyard?
- Every summer since I was born.

114
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,696
What about your family?

115
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,897
Um... I grew up in the Atlantic
City area, near the beach, so...

116
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,739
Then every day was like summer, right?

117
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:19,704
No, every day was not like summer.

118
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,506
Every day was like being impaled
with a blunt, wooden object,

119
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:24,577
over and over again.

120
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,344
Anyway, I called you in here

121
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,817
because I had a chance
to read over your blurbs.

122
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:36,219
And, um, yeah, see,
I can't turn these in to Dan.

123
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:37,706
- Why not?
- Well...

124
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:41,496
First off, because you
called Dames At Sea,

125
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:44,226
"An insignificant, if not irritating,

126
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:48,186
"amalgam of lackluster
performances and sitcom one-liners."

127
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:50,861
Have you seen it?
Because that's putting it very nicely.

128
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:52,175
It won the Tony.

129
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:56,863
And, you know, frankly, we don't care
whether you think it's good or bad.

130
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:57,936
You're not a reviewer.

131
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:01,019
No, see, your job is just to describe

132
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:02,938
the play in 5 sentences or less

133
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,858
and make it sound interesting.

134
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:06,096
Perhaps you weren't aware

135
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,906
that I won the Hollingsworth
fellowship for playwriting

136
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,340
or that New York Magazine put me

137
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,935
on their list of playwrights to watch?

138
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:16,220
I was not aware. Thank you for
bringing that to my attention.

139
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:17,342
You're welcome.

140
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:18,822
Okay.

141
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,343
Well, we certainly
don't want to stand in

142
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,304
the way of your burgeoning
writing career.

143
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:24,776
So, uh...

144
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:27,496
Yeah.

145
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:29,616
What does "yeah" mean?

146
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,376
Yeah.

147
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:35,896
You can go.

148
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:45,262
This is Peter.

149
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,258
I know I'm not
supposed to call you during work hours,

150
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:50,817
but I lost my job at the magazine.

151
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,020
And I'm just...

152
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:55,097
<i>I'm having a really
tough time right now.</i>

153
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:58,059
And I know it's not your problem, but...

154
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,745
I was just thinking maybe

155
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,897
you could come over
and just lay with me for a little bit?

156
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,739
Imogene, I...

157
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,465
- I'm working.
<i>- I know, I just...</i>

158
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:08,698
I don't really
trust myself to be alone right now.

159
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,255
What? What do you mean?

160
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:15,784
I mean I'm afraid
if you don't come over I might

161
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:18,777
do something to myself.

162
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:19,936
<i>Imogene.</i>

163
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,779
<i>Or maybe I already have.</i>

164
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:22,856
What did you do?

165
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:24,141
Just, Peter...

166
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,263
If you love me just say
you'll come over. Please?

167
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,700
All right.

168
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,016
<i>Farewell, world.</i>

169
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:39,579
<i>My life is but
a brief flickering in the darkness.</i>

170
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:41,299
<i>Too faint to light a room.</i>

171
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,981
<i>And much too soon does
the flame burn out.</i>

172
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,178
<i>As the winds of suffering
have extinguished my light,</i>

173
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:50,702
<i>heaven welcomes me
with her open embrace.</i>

174
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,780
Imogene?

175
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,506
Hello?

176
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:25,984
Are you in here?

177
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:29,415
Imogene, you left your door open.

178
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,577
There's also a sign on it.
I think your landlord is upset with you.

179
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:38,304
Imogene, I just stopped by to pick up

180
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,946
those Cartier earrings that I lent you.

181
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,624
Imogene.

182
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,620
Oh, my God.

183
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,538
Hello? Imogene?

184
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,617
Imogene, can you hear me?

185
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,464
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

186
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,221
Oh, my God!

187
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,546
Oh, my God!

188
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,735
Oh, my God, Imogene.

189
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,537
Hello. Dad?

190
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,064
Daddy, it's Dara.

191
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,466
Oh, my God, Dad.

192
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:18,184
Imogene is dead!

193
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:22,457
No, no. She's just dead.

194
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,297
I don't know how to check!

195
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,986
Imogene.

196
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,660
Imogene.

197
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:42,340
Oh, my gosh!

198
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:54,826
Cheers.

199
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:10,177
And the Tony Award for
Best Play goes to...

200
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,744
Imogene Duncan!

201
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:18,661
I'm such a fan!

202
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:19,941
No. I'm such a fan.

203
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:21,380
Thank you.

204
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:25,622
Oh, thank you so much. Oh, my gosh!

205
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,175
There's so many people
that I want to thank.

206
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:33,182
But most importantly,
my wonderful, Dutch husband, Peter.

207
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:36,418
I will love you forever.
Or should I say...

208
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,262
For the 10 millionth time,

209
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:46,575
I wasn't really trying to kill myself.

210
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:49,983
So, you're saying you
didn't really want to be reunited

211
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,466
with your dead father for eternity?

212
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,384
I didn't want to die, okay?

213
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,020
Well, I think the problem
you're facing here

214
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,666
is that you wrote a pretty
authentic sounding letter.

215
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,100
Really?

216
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,182
You thought it was that good?

217
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:04,145
Now in your letter,
you refer to your dead father.

218
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,064
How old were you when he passed away?

219
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:08,342
9. Seriously, there
is no point to this.

220
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,576
Can you tell me about him?

221
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,896
He was just the best.

222
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,744
The smartest man I ever met.

223
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,464
He was like the George
Clooney of fathers.

224
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:19,776
And what about the rest of your family?

225
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,502
Uh... My mom
lives in New Jersey with my brother.

226
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,577
She has an impulse control problem,

227
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,736
and I haven't seen them in years.

228
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,501
Can you describe the symptoms
of your mother's impulse problem?

229
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:31,855
Uh, let's see.

230
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,222
Buying 52 pairs of jelly
shoes in one year.

231
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:37,185
Gambling every day.
Picking up hitchhikers.

232
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:40,384
Showing up to a parent-teacher
conference wearing a turban.

233
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,696
My brother and I,
our birthdays are 84 days apart,

234
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:43,936
and because of her gambling

235
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,904
she couldn't afford to give us
individual birthday parties,

236
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:48,103
so we had to have a
combined birthday party.

237
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:49,865
Do you have any idea
how it feels to have a birthday party

238
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,744
84 days after
your actual birthday,

239
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:53,738
because your mom has an impulse problem?

240
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,146
Okay, well, it doesn't feel very good.

241
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:57,536
No, it's very sad.

242
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:58,776
Yeah.

243
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,141
I'm doing okay.

244
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:01,944
I mean, it's been
upsetting for me, but...

245
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:04,222
Have you ever received
a telephone call

246
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:05,899
of an urgent nature when you're naked?

247
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,057
- I haven't.
- I had just gotten out of the shower.

248
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:09,739
And suddenly this call comes.

249
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:12,056
Well, we tracked down your information

250
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:15,059
from old DMV records, Mrs. Duncan.

251
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:18,218
Are you familiar with a 5150 hold?

252
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:22,580
Uh... Yes, but I'm sure I
paid those tickets. Okay?

253
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,341
And the judge ruled that the
second one wasn't even my fault.

254
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:29,066
This has nothing to do
with your driving record, Mrs. Duncan.

255
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:32,582
A 5150 means that
it is our duty to hold anyone

256
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,420
who poses a threat to themselves
for at least 72 hours.

257
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:38,066
However, we have
a bit of an overcrowding problem,

258
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:41,184
which limits us to holding
only critical patients

259
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,940
and releasing the others,
like your daughter,

260
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,380
into the care of a loved one.

261
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,019
- She said she loved me?
- No.

262
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,416
But we have more
critical patients that need her bed.

263
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:55,057
You mean people that, like,
jump out of buildings and cut parts off?

264
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,095
That kind of stuff?

265
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:58,779
Sometimes.

266
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:01,859
Can I ask you a question?
Does that make you really sad?

267
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,818
Uh, Mrs. Duncan, would you be
willing to assume responsibility

268
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:10,378
<i>for the safety and well-being
of your daughter for the next 72 hours?</i>

269
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:13,621
Well, I have to be somewhere later.

270
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:16,175
But, yes. Of course.

271
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,939
Did I tell you that Gwyneth Paltrow

272
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,136
might come to my book launch party?

273
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:21,695
- Wow! What a coup.
- I know!

274
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,426
It's like my dad's PR
guy knows everyone.

275
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,376
Oh.

276
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:32,739
I will be back in one second,
I have to take this.

277
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:35,061
Hi.

278
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,261
It's an upsetting night.

279
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,416
Hello.

280
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,738
Imogene, listen,
I know you're expecting your boyfriend,

281
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,977
and we've made several
attempts to try and...

282
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:45,501
Peter is coming for me, okay?

283
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:47,896
Yes, I'm sure Peter cares
for you very deeply,

284
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:50,745
but both your mother
and I feel that the best thing

285
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:51,816
for you right now...

286
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:53,175
Wait. Did you just say "mother"?

287
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:56,742
...would be for you to be
in the comfort and safety

288
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,421
of those who love you unconditionally.

289
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:01,736
So your mother is
going to take you home with her.

290
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,376
Hi, honey.

291
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,945
You cannot do this.

292
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:08,303
Dara! Dara!
Tell them you love me unconditionally.

293
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:09,936
What?

294
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,335
I can't go with her!
Please! Please!

295
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:16,018
Dara! Tell them I can stay
with you until Peter comes for me!

296
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,096
Oh, my gosh, I wish that I could help,

297
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:19,496
but I don't think that we can
accommodate house-guests right now.

298
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,582
What?

299
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,384
- You can't do this to me!
- Hold her!

300
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:23,940
Dara! Call the police!

301
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,696
Imogene, this is going
to make your trip home

302
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,096
just a little bit more relaxing.

303
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:35,106
Honey...

304
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,139
Your panties are showing.

305
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,506
Mom?

306
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,345
Step right up, everybody!

307
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,186
Clear the path.

308
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,899
Bring me a joker.

309
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,186
- Feeling good!
- Hey!

310
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:49,544
- Oh!
- What the hell are you doing?

311
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:52,141
Jesus, don't sneak up on me like that.

312
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,377
You left me in the
back seat of your car!

313
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:58,426
Well, honey, they told me that you were
gonna be out for, like, you know, 6 hours.

314
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:00,543
You took me against my will!

315
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,219
You know, I could have you
arrested for kidnapping.

316
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:04,866
Imogene, they called
me from the hospital.

317
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,699
They said that you had
tried to kill yourself

318
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,777
and they were
gonna lock you up with schizophrenians.

319
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,062
I mean, you know, what was I supposed to do?
Leave you there?

320
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:14,662
Oh, and this is better?
Waking up alone in a casino parking lot?

321
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:16,305
I don't have my purse, no cell phone.

322
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,945
I have no wallet. No ID. Nothing.

323
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,505
Zelda, is this lady giving you grief?

324
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,816
Oh, no. Delancey, this is my daughter.

325
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,136
Do you know that she was
on the New York Times list

326
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:26,985
- of playwrights to watch...
- It was New York Magazine!

327
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,739
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

328
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:31,466
I've seen your mother here
get more royal flushes than anybody.

329
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:32,536
That's great.

330
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,016
Okay.

331
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,097
Round and round she goes!

332
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,815
You think I don't know why you did it?

333
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:15,664
I'm your mother, okay.
I know why you did it.

334
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:17,936
Some men are stayers.

335
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,506
Some men are leavers, and you know,
it's better to find out now.

336
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:23,577
Wow, where did you get
that pearl of wisdom?

337
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,544
It was on The Joy Behar Show.

338
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:30,780
You know, the doctor let me read your letter.
I thought it was really good.

339
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,021
Really.

340
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:35,338
Apparently, I should be a
professional suicide writer.

341
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:39,426
Oh, you're not writing
plays anymore, huh?

342
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,180
I am not talking about this.

343
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:54,456
Hey.

344
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,065
Where'd you go?

345
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,739
Imogene?

346
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:03,780
Ew! Hello? Hi!
Who are you?

347
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,621
Um... I'm Lee.

348
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:07,856
Who's she?

349
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,505
Lee, what are you doing in my room?

350
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:11,418
Actually, this is my room.

351
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:12,576
Since when?

352
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,340
Uh, since Zelda started
renting it to me.

353
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:16,746
- What?
- Imogene?

354
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,586
- Ralph!
- Imogene, you're back!

355
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,702
Oh, my God.

356
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:23,022
You're really back! You're here!

357
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:26,099
Wow, you look so different.

358
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:28,177
I've been eating a lot of spaghetti.

359
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:29,860
- Oh.
- So you're going to spend the night?

360
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,300
No, I'm not... No.

361
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,945
Why did Mom rent out my room?

362
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,460
Her settlement money ran out.

363
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:35,661
What settlement money?

364
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,100
An escalator ate her
jelly shoe at the Oasis

365
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:38,665
and screwed up her toe.

366
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:40,100
Can I have a second hug?

367
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,301
This is really weird.

368
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,536
Monica, wait a second.

369
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:44,379
It's fine, she's...

370
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,705
Mom!

371
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:52,621
Hello.

372
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:56,336
Okay, before you start getting
all creepy, let me explain.

373
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,897
How can you rationalize
renting my room out to some random guy?

374
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:01,818
Well, you haven't been
back in a long time!

375
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:03,021
Yeah. She does have a point.

376
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:05,097
Where is all my stuff?
What, did you throw out all my stuff?

377
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:07,098
Calm down. It's in the basement.

378
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,655
So what now? What, do
I sleep with you now?

379
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:12,341
Oh. Well, I don't think
that's going to work either.

380
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,338
- Why not?
- The Bousche sleeps in her bed.

381
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,541
The what?

382
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:18,698
Hey, I could make you a sheet
fort like when we were kids?

383
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:20,506
Can you come out here a second?

384
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:21,861
Yeah.

385
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:23,456
Yeah?

386
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:24,536
Okay.

387
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:28,497
Imogene, this is my boyfriend.
He lives with us.

388
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:30,577
He's in the CIA.

389
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,217
Hi. George Bousche.

390
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:37,662
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

391
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,385
George.

392
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:41,457
Your name is George Bousche?

393
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:45,982
Well, as a matter of
fact, it's not my name.

394
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,583
You see, my father was an assassin,

395
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:52,778
and he had to change
all of our birth names

396
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:57,497
because of that incident
I told you about, about the KGB.

397
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:02,743
So what is your real name then?

398
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,659
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.

399
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,146
- Even I don't know.
- No.

400
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:08,822
Okay.

401
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:12,217
- No one knows. Okay.
- Yeah.

402
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:14,865
Okay.

403
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,586
You gonna put on
something nice, honey?

404
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:38,580
So, did Mom tell you the good news?

405
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:41,065
Who's it good for?

406
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,740
I got my own kiosk,

407
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,419
one block from the boardwalk.

408
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:46,976
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

409
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,820
Right across from Angela's Pizza.

410
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:51,545
Well, where it used to be. Here.

411
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,741
Oh.

412
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:56,305
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

413
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:58,095
- Congratulations!
- Yep.

414
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,745
No, no. Please keep it.

415
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,260
Or, you know, give it to a friend.

416
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,815
Anyone you refer gets a free hermit hut.

417
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,226
That's a good deal.

418
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:07,784
Do you want to come and see it?

419
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,101
Oh.

420
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:12,864
I wish I could.
But, you know, I have to go back home.

421
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,300
Yeah, to the city.

422
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:17,059
You know, you really
should come visit me.

423
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:20,065
We could go to the Natural History
Museum and the Aquarium.

424
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,058
Yeah, it's far away.

425
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:24,217
Yeah. Well, maybe that's a good thing.

426
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:26,696
I like being in Ocean City.

427
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,106
You used to like it, too.

428
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:31,258
Yeah. I just think
that New York is a better place for me.

429
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:34,544
Mmm. Okay.

430
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:38,142
Well, this is your basic
sheet fort model.

431
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:39,416
Um...

432
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:44,661
If you would like any add-ons
or security features,

433
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:46,260
I mean, I can work on it tomorrow.

434
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:48,576
No, it looks very secure.

435
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:49,702
Yeah?

436
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:51,220
Yeah, you did a great job.

437
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:53,497
Um, all right, well.

438
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,337
Nighty-night, Imogene.

439
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:30,143
Breakfast, everybody!

440
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:37,025
- Oh, Jesus!
- Ow! God! Someone's in here!

441
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,381
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!

442
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:39,900
God!

443
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:42,941
Hey, I'm really sorry about that.

444
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:46,059
Your brother likes us to keep the door
closed because the toilet runs.

445
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:48,706
I didn't see anything, just so you know.

446
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:52,185
Okay. Well,
you should really knock as a precaution.

447
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:53,336
I guess we're even then.

448
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:55,099
Oh, so it's my fault that I walk in

449
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:56,665
on you doing it with your girlfriend?

450
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:58,777
Because, hello, this is my house.

451
00:26:58,855 --> 00:26:59,936
But you don't live here anymore.

452
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:02,700
I grew up in this house.
I think that takes precedence over

453
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:06,382
whatever temporary
whatever you're doing here.

454
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:07,781
What are you doing here?

455
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:09,141
Excuse me?

456
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:10,462
What...

457
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:11,661
Why did you come back?

458
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:13,976
I really don't see
how that is any of your concern, Lee.

459
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:17,264
Look, if you want to stay in the
room, it really is no trouble.

460
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,496
I'll be happy to stay somewhere else.

461
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:21,015
Oh, I'm sure you can.
But, see, I like to make a special point

462
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,864
to not sleep in the bed of boys

463
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,822
whose cleanliness of sheets
is questionable... at best.

464
00:27:28,775 --> 00:27:30,584
- This morning.
- What?

465
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:32,737
That's when I changed my sheets.

466
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,422
Hey.

467
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:46,744
Um, I don't really know how to
broach this subject tactfully,

468
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:48,856
so I'm just going to say it.

469
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:49,936
Ralph, cover your ears.

470
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,343
Were you getting spanked last night?

471
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,066
Why would you think that?

472
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,978
Because that's what it sounded like.

473
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:05,345
- Am I right?
- Oh, my God.

474
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,816
No. I'm right, aren't I? Ugh!

475
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,626
Imogene, it is so much fun.
Have you never tried it?

476
00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:13,380
Yeah, maybe, like, 2 or 3 times
in the heat of passion, I don't know.

477
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:15,059
But not in repetition
for, like, 2 hours.

478
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:17,820
Oh, my God.
If it was bothering you so much

479
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,181
you should have just closed your door.

480
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:20,586
Oh, my sheet door?

481
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,505
You know, you should be grateful I have

482
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,464
such an amazing sex life with George.

483
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:28,778
Or would you rather I turned
into one of those dried up women

484
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:32,257
like Mitzi Mordler who spends all
her time with her little rat dog.

485
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,815
Yeah. That.
Mitzi, that's what I want.

486
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:36,460
Oh, God.

487
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:37,616
Coffee ready?

488
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:39,584
Over there, Bubba.

489
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:41,945
I need it after last night.

490
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:47,941
You know, if Dad were alive

491
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:49,975
to see what you've become,
he would be disgraced.

492
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,536
He died?

493
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,262
When did that happen?

494
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:58,264
No, no, no. It's nothing.

495
00:28:58,335 --> 00:28:59,541
What?

496
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:02,778
I mean, yes. He died.

497
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:05,096
A long time ago. He's been dead.

498
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:07,943
- You know that.
- Right.

499
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,259
- Can I take them off now?
- Yeah.

500
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,501
Sorry.

501
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:25,626
Why would you say that?

502
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:26,821
I thought you told them.

503
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:28,222
No! You knew they didn't know.

504
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:29,416
No?

505
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:31,418
Something like that
could ruin their lives.

506
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,862
You can never, ever let them know
about their father really being...

507
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:35,306
Being what?

508
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:39,576
Cheap.

509
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:40,941
Dad was cheap?

510
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:43,583
Oh, God, yeah.

511
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,658
Don't you remember that ugly
couch we had in the living room?

512
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:49,100
He wouldn't let me buy the one I wanted,

513
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:52,065
so we had to get that
one from a garage sale.

514
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,984
You're lying. I can see it!
I can see it in your eyes.

515
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,784
Tell us the truth.

516
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,576
Was Dad not our father?

517
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:02,740
No, no, no. He was. He is your father.

518
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:04,624
- What do you mean "he is our father"?
- No.

519
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,018
- Oh, God.
- Mom?

520
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:12,060
I can't. You know, I can't.
I can't do this anymore.

521
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:13,944
- Breathe.
- Oh, God.

522
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:15,056
What?

523
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:19,736
All right.

524
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:22,501
We didn't get along, okay?

525
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,503
And he wanted to
go back to school for his PhD.

526
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,498
And we agreed that we didn't want
to put you through a divorce

527
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,543
and all of the custody hell,

528
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:31,862
and so we decided
that you guys would stay with me

529
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:32,982
and I would just tell you that...

530
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:34,784
What?

531
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:37,743
That he died.

532
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,422
I can't believe this.
What, Dad is alive?

533
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:45,781
Yeah.

534
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:49,416
What mother tells their
children that their father died

535
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:51,463
during a routine colonoscopy, to what?

536
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:54,345
To save them from inconvenience?

537
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:57,180
No, no, it was
a complicated situation, Imogene. Okay?

538
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,826
I was trying
to protect you guys.

539
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:02,745
I wanted you to
grow up feeling good about yourselves.

540
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:04,345
What happened to him?

541
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,304
Somebody told me that he wrote a book.

542
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:09,421
Oh, wait, Imogene.

543
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:11,941
Wait. Oh, come on.

544
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:16,504
What are you going to do?

545
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:17,781
Wait!

546
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:19,186
Imogene.

547
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:23,020
Immy, wait.

548
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:27,145
Ralph, was that boat
moored out there yesterday?

549
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,984
Imogene, please.

550
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,381
Imogene, honey. I need my car today.

551
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,822
I have a free spin on the Lucky Wheel!

552
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:37,296
Hey, wait. Honey, please.
Hey, unlock the door, okay?

553
00:31:38,455 --> 00:31:41,823
The jackpot is a cruise to Jamaica!
We could all go together!

554
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:43,456
Hey...

555
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:48,103
Honey, please don't kill
yourself over this.

556
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:50,460
I love you.

557
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:00,255
Oh, can I help you?

558
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,575
I hope so.

559
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,419
Um, do you have anything written
by Maxwell P. Duncan?

560
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:05,623
P. Duncan.
Let's look it up.

561
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:07,335
That's a "C", right?

562
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:08,462
That's a

563
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:09,582
And not a

564
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:10,736
- No, it's a
- Oh.

565
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:12,260
No, sorry. You just pressed

566
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:13,461
You're right. Sorry about that.

567
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:15,219
- Okay.
- D-U-N.

568
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:17,101
Oh, there's lots of Duncans.

569
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:18,700
P. Duncan. Maxwell P. Duncan.

570
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,584
Are you okay?

571
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:22,020
Yes. Thank you.

572
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:26,099
P. Duncan, there it is.
We have one book.

573
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:28,105
Uh, let's see.

574
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:30,541
Where is it?

575
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,901
In the non-fiction.

576
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,661
Hmm.

577
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:54,578
"Maxwell P. Duncan
is a world-renowned expert

578
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:57,499
"on the early colonial period
of American history.

579
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,942
"Mr. Duncan has spoken on PBS and NPR.

"He resides in...

00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:04,499
"New York City."

582
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,580
Oh, no, you don't.

583
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:42,224
Move it!

584
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:11,026
I saw you in my rearview mirror,

585
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,176
you weren't even paying attention!

586
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:13,376
You were putting on makeup!

587
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:16,026
I wasn't putting on makeup! Does it
look like I'm wearing makeup to you?

588
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,221
Well, you're going to
have to pay for this.

589
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,775
It's a couple of little scratches.
What is the big deal?

590
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:22,142
Excuse me, it's a Porsche!

591
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,865
Sir, it's a Boxster.

592
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:25,903
You folks okay? You're
holding up traffic.

593
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:28,461
No, sir. We're not okay,
actually, at all.

594
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:31,141
This woman rear-ends me
while she's putting on makeup.

595
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:32,740
My visor fell down!

596
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,584
Can you both please show me
your driver's license,

597
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,145
registration, and insurance cards?

598
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:37,785
Sure thing, Officer.

599
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:41,661
Is something wrong?

600
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,146
Okay. First of all, I
wasn't putting on makeup!

601
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,216
Ocean City?

602
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:46,104
Imogene?

603
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:47,665
Imogene Duncan?

604
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:48,861
Yeah.

605
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:52,380
It's me. It's Rex Rinaldi.

606
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,136
From high school.

607
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:55,660
T-Rex Rinaldi?

608
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:57,897
You were my TA in my
dumb-bell math class.

609
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:59,659
You said you couldn't go
to homecoming with me

610
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:02,904
because it fell on the anniversary
of your father's death?

611
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:04,741
- Yeah.
- Sure!

612
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:05,816
Okay, yeah.

613
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,101
Imogene Duncan!

614
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:08,256
Here I am.

615
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,501
Can we do this please?

616
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,145
- I have somewhere I'm supposed to be.
- Yeah. All right.

617
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:13,546
Great, thank you.

618
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:15,976
Do you have yours?

619
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:19,623
You know, I live in Manhattan now,

620
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,703
and I haven't really driven in years.

621
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:24,062
Dispatch, I got to run a plate.

622
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:26,021
Uh, New Jersey.

623
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:28,701
- Umbrella-zero-alpha-eight-niner.
- Hey, Rex?

624
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:34,939
I just want to say how brave and
selfless you are for what you do.

625
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:36,176
Just all the citizens...

626
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:37,456
Copy that.

627
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:42,576
Uh, well, uh, it seems this car
has been reported as stolen.

628
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:44,225
Oh, what is this?

629
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:45,785
- What is this?
- Sir, I'm going to have to ask you

630
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,778
to please keep your
comments to yourself.

631
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,664
No, no, no, there's been a mistake.

632
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:52,102
There's been a mistake.
This is my mother's car.

633
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:56,385
Okay? And she lent it to me
to go visit my father.

634
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:57,820
So it's not stolen.

635
00:35:57,895 --> 00:35:58,896
Right.

636
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:00,306
That's wrong.

637
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,425
I thought your father died?

638
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:06,385
No, he did.

639
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,537
I just found out today. I thought he...

640
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,381
He has not died.

641
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:12,497
Oh, I get it.

642
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:14,543
He's alive when you need him to be.

643
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:16,822
And then he's dead
when you have to blow someone off.

644
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:19,341
No, no, no, no!
My mother told me that he died.

645
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:22,180
And then, now I found
out that he's alive.

646
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,302
Crock of shit!

647
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,821
And I bet that if I asked
you out for a beer

648
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,818
he'd probably die again, right?

649
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,296
Well, obviously,
I hope that wouldn't be the case.

650
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,106
But, given the fact that I don't
know what kind of health he's in,

651
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:36,099
I mean that certainly
could be a possibility.

652
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,424
- Duncan.
- What?

653
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:43,576
You're out.

654
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:45,861
Your mom dropped the charges.

655
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:53,782
Oh, uh, good luck at Nationals.

656
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,179
<i>You hit someone in a Porsche?</i>

657
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,542
Quit changing the subject.
You had me arrested!

658
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:01,539
Come on, honey.
It was for your own good, okay?

659
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:04,016
I knew how upset you were, and when
you didn't come back for a while,

660
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:06,496
I was afraid you
were going to stop on the train tracks.

661
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,703
You know, George told me the
best way to find someone

662
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:10,220
is accuse them of a crime.

663
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,263
That's how they do it in the CIA.

664
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,337
How was jail, Imogene?

665
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:15,746
Disappointing.

666
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,265
I know you think I
screwed up your life,

667
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:25,702
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe having a dead father

668
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:27,903
was better for you than
having a dead-beat one?

669
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:29,340
Dead-beat?

670
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,985
The man lives in New York City.

671
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:32,659
He's a world-renowned expert

672
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:34,260
on the early colonial period
of American history.

673
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,906
- What?
- He's spoken in 29 countries.

674
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,864
He's been interviewed on NPR and PBS.

675
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:41,422
- Okay. Maybe he's found some success.
- Some success?

676
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,800
- But that doesn't change who he is as a person.
- Is that Dad's book?

677
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:44,374
Yes.

678
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:45,501
It's called <i>The Myth of Thanksgiving.</i>

679
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:47,623
- It's actually our father's second book.
- Thanksgiving is a myth?

680
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:48,856
- What?
- Yeah, amongst other things.

681
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,420
Oh, get out of here.
Your father wrote a book

682
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:52,065
on how Thanksgiving never happened?

683
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:54,786
Yeah. You know,
we embrace it as this national holiday,

684
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,778
but actually it was a
political spin job.

685
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:58,659
Did it say who invented pumpkin pie?

686
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,385
Don't laugh. No, it didn't say
who invented pumpkin pie.

687
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:02,378
You know, I'm sorry,
but I'm not surprised.

688
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:04,617
He always wanted
to ruin everything that was fun.

689
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:06,578
Oh, yeah, Dad tried to ruin everything.

690
00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:09,858
Dad's only, like,
a very brilliant, accomplished man,

691
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,380
who, you know what,
after we get reunited,

692
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,945
is going to help me get on my feet

693
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,426
and who is going to cherish me,

694
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:17,015
and make up for the years of humiliation

695
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,620
that I endured being your daughter.

696
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,777
Oh, my God. Well, do
you have his address?

697
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:22,584
No. I... What? No.

698
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:24,862
But I'm gonna get it. And then
when I get it I'm gonna go there.

699
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,096
And Ralph's going to come with me.

700
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:27,376
Oh, no, I don't go past the boardwalk.

701
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,822
You know, Imogene, a lot of people
had a worse mother than you.

702
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:30,896
Like me.

703
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,501
And one day when you're old,
you're gonna look back and realize that.

704
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:35,623
When I'm old. And
hopefully, I can also die

705
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:37,663
84 days around when Ralph dies,

706
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:39,658
so we can combine our funerals.

707
00:38:56,855 --> 00:38:59,540
Hey, honey. Honey, come here.

708
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:00,776
- Get over here.
- What?

709
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,505
I have to tell you something.

710
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:03,940
Are you guys coming?

711
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:05,983
Uh, you just go on in. Turn on the TV.

712
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:08,661
Okay, honey? We'll be there in a sec.

713
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:12,501
Look. I know you got mad when I made
you do your birthday with Ralph.

714
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:15,216
No. I actually loved combining birthday
parties with Ralph. Really.

715
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:16,535
It's one of my fondest memories.

716
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,304
Well, I had to do that, okay?

717
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,661
I had to put your parties together,

718
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,659
or else Ralph would
have had no one at his.

719
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,737
Your friends were humans.

720
00:39:24,855 --> 00:39:27,825
His friends were lizards
or crabs or whatever.

721
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,586
We all had to make sacrifices for Ralph.

722
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,386
Good night.

723
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:04,865
Ralph!

724
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,146
Uh, Eugenia.

725
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:11,865
You got a minute for the Bousche?

726
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,701
It's Imogene.

727
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:17,018
Listen, I've been meaning to
talk to you because I'm worried.

728
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,143
You shouldn't be mad at your mother.

729
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:22,105
Really? And what
exactly qualifies you to say that to me,

730
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:25,622
considering I've
known you for what, 40 hours?

731
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:29,538
Because she's been through
a very hard time.

732
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:31,617
- And she loves you.
- No. Of course she does.

733
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,585
That's why
she had me arrested for stealing her car

734
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,145
and lied to me about my father.

735
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:38,536
Sometimes information needs
to be kept classified.

736
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:41,858
Okay, look, no offense, but this is
really between me and my family.

737
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,706
I am part of your family now.

738
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:48,104
Now, I may look a little
young for the gig,

739
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:49,904
but in the samurai tradition,

740
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,420
when a man loves a woman,

741
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:55,261
he automatically becomes
a spiritual guardian for her offspring.

742
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:58,896
So, what, you're a samurai now, too?

743
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:02,661
Oh, I've been a samurai for 25 years.
You didn't know that?

744
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:05,898
No. I didn't. 25, wow.

745
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:08,023
- That's a long time.
- Yeah.

746
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:12,259
But thank you,
I think me and my spirit are just fine.

747
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,542
Are you sure about that?

748
00:41:14,615 --> 00:41:16,140
That's not what I'm getting.

749
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:18,297
I'm getting resistance.

750
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,501
Yeah. Little bit.

751
00:41:20,295 --> 00:41:21,865
That's accurate.

752
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:29,463
What's the password?

753
00:41:30,415 --> 00:41:32,258
Spuds McKenzie?

754
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:37,255
Spuds McKenzie.

755
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:39,781
You may enter.

756
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:45,585
Wow!

757
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:48,385
Oh, wow, your room...

758
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,096
Um...

759
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:57,858
Oh, this was so sweet of you,
but I think I should give this back.

760
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,016
Why don't you want her?

761
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,863
I kind of got a lot going on right now.

762
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:04,097
I don't really think I'd be
a very good crab mom.

763
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:08,176
Well, then maybe you could
be her crab buddy.

764
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:11,906
Um... Yeah. I don't think
I'd be a very good crab buddy either.

765
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:15,061
Plus I think she misses you. See.

766
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:19,381
Mmm-hmm.

767
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,060
Hey, Ralph.

768
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:28,539
Do you have any money
you think you can loan me?

769
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:29,821
What for?

770
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:33,377
So I can go back to New York.
And pay my landlord.

771
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:35,617
And try to find Dad.

772
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:39,386
You do want me to find Dad, don't you?

773
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,102
Don't you think it would be cool if

774
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,622
no matter where you were in the world,
you were already home?

775
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:52,136
Or precisely, that you were just as
safe as you are in your own home,

776
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:54,900
even when you're not there?

777
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:59,137
Uh, yeah. Sure, yeah. I guess so.

778
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,536
Um...

779
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:01,736
Here, sit down.

780
00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:03,146
- Huh? Oh.
- Sit down.

781
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:05,900
Since the dawn of time,

782
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:08,296
soft-bellied creatures have been jealous

783
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:11,823
of mollusks' ability to self-preserve.

784
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:15,704
But they don't have to be anymore.

785
00:43:29,455 --> 00:43:30,456
I made this.

786
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:33,221
- Really?
- Yeah.

787
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:36,981
It has all the amenities
of a typical mollusk's home,

788
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:39,945
but this one is made of top-grade,
bullet-proof fiberglass,

789
00:43:40,015 --> 00:43:42,985
and I've coated it with
Cyber-Flexx plastic.

790
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:46,218
It's comfortable enough
for extended use,

791
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:49,822
and it even has wireless
Internet capability.

792
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:50,942
What?

793
00:43:51,015 --> 00:43:52,176
I call it "The Human Shell."

794
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,106
Wow.

795
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:59,064
- May I?
- Yeah, you can touch.

796
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:01,302
What's it for?

797
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,503
You put it on your back.

798
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:06,055
And then if you ever need protection

799
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:08,536
or you want to hide or whatever,

800
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:11,858
you just pull it down on yourself.

801
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,776
Oh.

802
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:24,216
Ralph?

803
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:31,375
Hey, Lee! Hey, wait.

804
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:33,776
Hey.

805
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:36,745
Wait! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait!

806
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,505
Take me to New York.

807
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,016
No.

808
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:46,216
Why?

809
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:48,582
Because I have things to do.

810
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:52,224
Fine. Fine. Then I will stay
here and I will kill myself

811
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:53,456
and it'll be all your fault.

812
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:55,936
And I will specifically
mention your name in the letter,

813
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:57,346
which, apparently, I am
very good at writing.

814
00:44:57,415 --> 00:45:00,498
Wow. You're really
gonna show me, aren't you? Jeez.

815
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:11,140
All right, I'll tell you what.

816
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:13,702
Here.

817
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:16,779
- Why are you giving me a quarter?
- Just call it.

818
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:18,466
My sanity hangs in the balance,

819
00:45:18,535 --> 00:45:20,776
and this is how you're deciding if
you're gonna take me or not?

820
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:22,300
Yeah. Do you want me call it
or should you call it?

821
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:23,376
- What's it going to be?
- Tails.

822
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:24,866
Tails. All right.

823
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:26,776
Here's hoping.

824
00:45:27,415 --> 00:45:28,496
Oh.

825
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:29,742
You know what? Forget it.

826
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:33,615
Just forget it. I don't need this from
some, like, happy-go-lucky simpleton...

827
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:34,696
"Happy-go-lucky"?

828
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,903
...who thinks
it's really funny to taunt someone

829
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,137
who's on the brink of
a mental breakdown,

830
00:45:39,215 --> 00:45:40,899
who is literally reeling
from the shock of her life!

831
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,296
Will you relax? Just relax.

832
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,422
It's tails.

833
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:46,826
Okay?

834
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,065
You're going to New York.

835
00:46:07,255 --> 00:46:09,940
I'm sorry I called you
a simpleton before.

836
00:46:10,215 --> 00:46:12,104
What about happy-go-lucky?

837
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:14,541
Yeah. That, too, I guess.

838
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:16,585
And thanks for doing this for me.

839
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:18,783
I'm actually doing this for myself.

840
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:21,739
Because now I can ask you to do, like,
anything and you have to do it.

841
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,938
Okay, well, I'm not planning on
ever seeing you again after today

842
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,255
ever in my life, so, great.

843
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:28,935
Sounds like a plan.

844
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:36,345
Okay. So, what's your story?

845
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:38,298
My story? Um...

846
00:46:38,415 --> 00:46:42,704
Well, I grew up in Pennsylvania.
Went to college when I was 17.

847
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:44,379
Where?

848
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,059
Uh, Yale.

849
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:47,901
You did not go to Yale.

850
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,136
Okay.

851
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:50,899
I didn't go to Yale.

852
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,376
Um...

853
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:57,225
Then I moved to Philly
and sang in a shitty band.

854
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,297
Bussed tables for a while.

855
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:01,264
And then this guy I knew

856
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:04,578
had an audition
to be in a show at the Oasis Casino.

857
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,942
I went with him, and the
next thing you know,

858
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:08,380
I got the job.

859
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:09,976
Does he hate you?

860
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:12,137
No. I don't think he hates me.

861
00:47:12,215 --> 00:47:13,341
I would hate you.

862
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:16,498
Yeah, but you hate everybody.

863
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:23,143
So, what's your story?

864
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:26,303
Have you ever heard of
Douglas J. Hollingsworth?

865
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:30,266
Well, every year
he awards someone a $30,000 grant

866
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,258
to write a play that he will produce.

867
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:34,986
And in 2004 he picked me.

868
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:38,657
And my whole world opened up.

869
00:47:39,295 --> 00:47:41,024
I met Dara, who was on the board.

870
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,177
She introduced me to my boyfriend,

871
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:45,337
and it just felt like
everything was starting.

872
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:50,378
But when I actually sat down to write,
nothing good came out.

873
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:55,461
So I just went shopping with my friends
and went on vacations.

874
00:47:56,095 --> 00:47:59,542
And when the year was up,
I didn't have a play to produce.

875
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:01,902
So why don't you just
finish something now?

876
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:03,704
Because nobody cares now.

877
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:05,220
It's over.

878
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:19,585
You know, you're lucky
you're back in New York.

879
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:23,023
I was going to force you to come
see my show tomorrow as payback.

880
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:25,575
Sorry, but I am never
crossing the Hudson again.

881
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:29,102
Come on, do you really think New
York is that much better?

882
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:32,497
Yeah. You kidding?
Come on, New York has everything.

883
00:48:33,935 --> 00:48:35,858
Central Park, when it snows.

884
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:37,016
Okay, yeah.

885
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:38,779
Bergdorf's.

886
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:42,746
Everyone here dresses so beautifully,
and they're intelligent.

887
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,704
It's like they have
this swagger of, like,

888
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:46,976
"I finished the New York Times
crossword puzzle in pen."

889
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:49,661
Huh.

890
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:51,616
Wow, okay.

891
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,504
Not all of them, but...

892
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:57,382
Hey, Joe, can I get a spare key?

893
00:48:57,455 --> 00:48:58,695
I lost mine.

894
00:48:59,015 --> 00:49:00,585
Uh, Miss Duncan, I can't.

895
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:02,817
I'm afraid I can't let you up there.

896
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:04,296
What do you mean? What's going on?

897
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,106
You should talk to Mr. Bill.

898
00:49:06,335 --> 00:49:07,382
What?

899
00:49:07,455 --> 00:49:10,902
Joe, that's my apartment.
All my stuff is up there.

900
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:12,455
I need to get up there. I live there!

901
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:14,065
I can't. You should talk to him.

902
00:49:14,575 --> 00:49:15,701
Sorry.

903
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:18,742
They can't do that! That can't be legal.

904
00:49:18,815 --> 00:49:21,386
It's not fair!
You can't just randomly evict someone

905
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:26,057
and ban them from even entering
their place of residence

906
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,581
just because of a recent,
financial hardship.

907
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:30,666
Who are you texting?

908
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:31,861
Your mom.

909
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,699
Just to let her know you're okay.

910
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:39,817
Oh! Uh, listen, when we get into
Dara's, uh, don't introduce yourself.

911
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:41,659
I'll just do it.

912
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:43,544
How about I just stay outside?

913
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:46,221
Okay. Well, I'll be back, either way.

914
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:50,220
Hey, Dara, it's me.
I really need to talk to you.

915
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:51,821
It's Imogene.

916
00:49:51,895 --> 00:49:53,738
What should I do?

917
00:49:56,975 --> 00:49:58,625
- Hi.
- Oh, thank God you're home!

918
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,346
Imogene. I thought that
you were in New Jersey with your family?

919
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,464
Yes. Well, mercifully,
I've been given a reprieve.

920
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:07,982
Can I come in?

921
00:50:08,535 --> 00:50:10,378
Um... We're not dressed.

922
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:14,143
Oh, okay. Well, can't
you put something on?

923
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:17,657
Uh, you know what? Maybe it's
just better if we talk like this.

924
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:19,658
How have you been doing?

925
00:50:19,735 --> 00:50:23,342
I'm great. I just found out
that my father is still alive.

926
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:25,179
- Oh, my God.
- I know!

927
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,825
- Do you know where he is?
- Yes.

928
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:29,745
He is in New York.
And he is successful. He wrote this.

929
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,538
Um, anyway, the point is
I cannot go back to New Jersey.

930
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,980
And my landlord is not letting me

931
00:50:36,055 --> 00:50:37,341
into my apartment right now. So...

932
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:39,224
That's terrible. Where
are you going to stay?

933
00:50:39,295 --> 00:50:41,218
She is not staying here.

934
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:43,056
Um...

935
00:50:43,135 --> 00:50:46,059
I was hoping that
maybe I could stay with you,

936
00:50:46,135 --> 00:50:47,625
just until Peter and I patch things up,

937
00:50:47,695 --> 00:50:50,096
or until I locate my father,
whichever comes first.

938
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:51,665
Close the door!

939
00:50:52,855 --> 00:50:55,506
Honestly, I would be
absolutely fine with it,

940
00:50:55,575 --> 00:50:57,065
but James has a very weird thing

941
00:50:57,135 --> 00:50:59,217
about non-blood-related people
staying with us.

942
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:02,583
I would not be asking you this
unless it was an absolute emergency.

943
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,259
- I have nowhere else to go.
- I know.

944
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:06,702
And I really, really,
really wanna be there for you right now,

945
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:10,018
and if it was anything else
I would absolutely say yes, but I...

946
00:51:10,095 --> 00:51:13,019
I promise I won't be any trouble at all.
I won't even talk, I promise.

947
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:14,426
Dara!

948
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:17,905
Okay, I'm so sorry.
I have to close the door right now.

949
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,056
And I really understand

950
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:20,899
if you're not able
to come to the book launch party.

951
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:23,057
I just want you to focus
on getting better.

952
00:51:23,135 --> 00:51:25,137
- But that's...
- And I love you so much.

953
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,580
Please. Please.
Please. Dara!

954
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:41,339
Oh, man, it's really gonna pour.

955
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:51,501
On, my God.

956
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,499
Okay, just hold on, Bubba.

957
00:51:54,575 --> 00:51:57,021
Get the rubber suit on!

958
00:51:57,095 --> 00:51:59,177
We're almost there.

959
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:01,223
- Get your arm in!
- Are you guys okay?

960
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,259
The lights!
The lights went out from the storm.

961
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:08,339
Okay, if anyone
has any jewelry or silverware on them,

962
00:52:08,415 --> 00:52:10,144
- stay away from the windows.
- Why? Why?

963
00:52:10,215 --> 00:52:12,616
Well, we were eating
Chinese food with forks, and he sparked.

964
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:14,584
- Almost blew up the house!
- From Chinese food?

965
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:15,986
No, no, no. From the metal.

966
00:52:16,055 --> 00:52:17,341
I'm gonna get some candles.

967
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:19,099
See, he's been
struck by lightning 3 times,

968
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:21,616
which officially makes him a conduit.

969
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:23,026
Tell her what a conduit is.

970
00:52:23,135 --> 00:52:24,421
No, I know what a conduit is.

971
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:26,142
Okay. Okay.

972
00:52:27,255 --> 00:52:28,780
How do you feel?

973
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:36,303
I had the distinct
feeling that I was in movement.

974
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:40,460
Do you know blackness movement?

975
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:41,696
How long did it last?

976
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:45,302
Ralph, when you're moving
through other dimensions,

977
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,662
you can't measure time
in an earthly way.

978
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:49,305
Okay. Hi.

979
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,618
Is there any possibility
you can take your campfire tales

980
00:52:52,695 --> 00:52:53,981
to another more isolated
part of the house?

981
00:52:54,055 --> 00:52:56,262
No, Imogene. This is the center.

982
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:58,298
It's the only place George is safe.

983
00:52:58,535 --> 00:53:00,575
All right, now,
just go ahead and finish your story.

984
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:03,983
The electricity had vaporized
nearly every hair on my body.

985
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,899
It took me a year and a half
to grow my eyebrows back.

986
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,977
And the local villagers were able to

987
00:53:09,095 --> 00:53:11,336
hoist me up on top of the elephant,

988
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:12,462
and at the end,

989
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:14,458
I was pronounced dead.

990
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:43,979
Hi, yes. Is there an M. Duncan
available, please?

991
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,341
My briefcase?

992
00:53:45,415 --> 00:53:46,462
Where's my briefcase?

993
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:48,424
It's in the closet, honey, like always.

994
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,575
Oh, well, do you know
if he's a world-renowned author

995
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:52,026
and an expert on the
early colonial period?

996
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,381
Are you sure
you don't want something for the road?

997
00:53:53,455 --> 00:53:54,616
No, "colonial"?

998
00:53:54,695 --> 00:53:55,776
No.

999
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:57,021
Hello?

1000
00:53:57,095 --> 00:53:58,416
I don't want to get weighed down.

1001
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,142
No. I got to keep light on my toes.

1002
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,975
All right, don't forget
to be careful, Bubba.

1003
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:06,463
Somebody should tell
those Romanians that.

1004
00:54:12,255 --> 00:54:14,826
I'll make you something for later.
What do you want?

1005
00:54:14,895 --> 00:54:17,216
Turkey cheese? Huh?

1006
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,900
Extra mayo?

1007
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:21,864
- Yeah.
- Be careful, Bubba.

1008
00:54:23,815 --> 00:54:24,896
Where's he going?

1009
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:28,741
Ralph, you know you can't ask that, honey.
It's a secret mission.

1010
00:54:28,815 --> 00:54:31,136
- He's going to have sex with another woman.
- Oh!

1011
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:32,296
Don't start with me!

1012
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:35,265
Mom, the guy is a compulsive liar.

1013
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:37,099
You really believe all that CIA shit?

1014
00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:40,145
I mean, he told us
he's a time-traveling samurai.

1015
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:43,139
George doesn't lie. He's just lived a
life so exciting it sounds made up.

1016
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:44,262
That's because it is!

1017
00:54:44,335 --> 00:54:46,941
Imogene. Um, can I...

1018
00:54:47,015 --> 00:54:48,744
He doesn't lie. He never lied to me.

1019
00:54:48,815 --> 00:54:50,499
Are you doing anything today?

1020
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:52,777
Uh, I don't know. Why?

1021
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:56,655
I was just wondering if you could help me
with my ultimate... My ultimate plan.

1022
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:58,260
- What? Ultimate plan?
- Yeah, this.

1023
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:00,019
That's me, okay?

1024
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,506
- This is gonna be you.
- Uh-huh.

1025
00:55:01,575 --> 00:55:02,736
And you're gonna do it?

1026
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:05,261
You'll do it. Okay. Great, great. Okay.

1027
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,540
That's her.
That's her right there.

1028
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:16,821
That's her. Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

1029
00:55:16,895 --> 00:55:17,942
Back at me.

1030
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,255
We're a good pair, right?

1031
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:20,621
Are you sure this is going to work?

1032
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:22,135
What if she finds out we're related?

1033
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:23,816
How would that happen?

1034
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:25,101
What if she sees a photograph?

1035
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:26,941
I'll cut out your face.

1036
00:55:27,775 --> 00:55:29,140
Imogene! Look, I'll give you $20.

1037
00:55:29,215 --> 00:55:30,341
No, no, no, no.

1038
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:33,386
Just give it to me later.

1039
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:37,586
Are you going now?
You're going right now?

1040
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:39,020
Okay.

1041
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:45,016
Hi.

1042
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,301
Hey.

1043
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,422
Can I help you?

1044
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:50,698
Um, yeah, Ralph Duncan
referred me to you.

1045
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:52,379
- Oh, yeah?
- He said to check out

1046
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:53,866
your glitter expression.

1047
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:55,346
That's sweet of him.

1048
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:57,256
Hey.

1049
00:55:58,575 --> 00:56:00,100
Do you want a demonstration?

1050
00:56:00,175 --> 00:56:01,336
Oh, I don't...

1051
00:56:01,415 --> 00:56:02,541
Do you want to look around?

1052
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:05,095
Peruse. No pressure.

1053
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:08,616
So, do you want to
know how I know Ralph?

1054
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:10,783
What? Are you guys,
like, related or something?

1055
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:12,096
Ew! Ugh!

1056
00:56:12,295 --> 00:56:14,775
Gross. I'm so attracted to him.

1057
00:56:14,855 --> 00:56:16,935
That's why I'm saying that,
because that'd be creepy.

1058
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:19,057
Oh. So did you guys hook up?

1059
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:20,296
No.

1060
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:24,418
- Though I've prayed about it. Many times.
- Mmm-hmm.

1061
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,377
Had graphic fantasies.

1062
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:30,299
Real graphic stuff.

1063
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:32,540
You know, he gave me crabs.

1064
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,217
Oh, you trying to make me jealous?

1065
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:37,899
- No, not like those crabs.
- No, I know.

1066
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:39,016
Come see.

1067
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,620
Right. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1068
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:43,175
Oh, yeah. Cute.

1069
00:56:43,255 --> 00:56:45,223
So, do you know what you want
your glitter expression to be,

1070
00:56:45,295 --> 00:56:46,820
or do you want me to do an assessment?

1071
00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:48,135
Oh, um...

1072
00:56:48,215 --> 00:56:50,536
What is a glitter expression, exactly?

1073
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,379
You see, I like to think of glitter

1074
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,184
as your alter-ego shining through.

1075
00:56:54,775 --> 00:56:58,302
It's like a sparkly expression
of who you are on the inside.

1076
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,742
Oh. I never thought of it like that.

1077
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:02,624
Like, for instance, on my boyfriend,

1078
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:04,424
he's really into the Jets, right?

1079
00:57:04,495 --> 00:57:06,782
So he always has me
paint one on his face.

1080
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:07,856
You have a boyfriend?

1081
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:10,063
Yeah. Jason DelPino.

1082
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:13,059
- Why, you know him?
- No. No.

1083
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:16,459
Right, so since you don't know what

1084
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:18,185
you want your glitter expression to be,

1085
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:20,383
I'm just gonna
absorb your energy for a second,

1086
00:57:20,455 --> 00:57:22,742
and that way I
can paint something that best describes

1087
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:24,385
who you are on the inside.

1088
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:26,503
Oh, I can just get the cupcake.

1089
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,256
Imogene, that
doesn't make any sense.

1090
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,696
Allyson, she talks to
me when we're at work.

1091
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:51,585
And one time she even asked me
if I thought she looked hot.

1092
00:57:51,695 --> 00:57:53,697
I bet if she didn't have a
boyfriend she'd be into it.

1093
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:55,903
If she really liked me,
she would have an affair.

1094
00:57:55,975 --> 00:57:57,545
Maybe Allyson isn't the kind of person

1095
00:57:57,615 --> 00:58:00,095
who can recognize and appreciate

1096
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,542
how special and unique you are.

1097
00:58:03,295 --> 00:58:05,218
She's the only girl I know besides Mom.

1098
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:08,060
Well, maybe it's time you start thinking

1099
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:10,263
about going farther than the boardwalk.

1100
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:13,104
Having new experiences,

1101
00:58:13,175 --> 00:58:15,985
and meeting people
with whom you share things in common.

1102
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:18,296
What kind of people
would I share things in common with?

1103
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:22,536
Maybe Jacques Cousteau
has a granddaughter or something.

1104
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:25,858
I don't know off the top of my head,
but all I'm saying is

1105
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,586
there's a whole world
out there that you've never experienced.

1106
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:31,306
You really think it's
worth experiencing?

1107
00:58:32,935 --> 00:58:34,300
Sometimes.

1108
00:59:00,815 --> 00:59:04,661
So now, our next group
really got it goin' on!

1109
00:59:04,735 --> 00:59:07,500
The original American superstars.

1110
00:59:07,575 --> 00:59:10,181
The... The... The... The...

1111
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,098
Backstreet Boys!

1112
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:24,185
My homeboys. The Backstreet Boys.

1113
01:00:30,455 --> 01:00:31,661
Hey.

1114
01:00:31,735 --> 01:00:34,056
I can't believe you made it.
What did you think?

1115
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:35,661
Um...

1116
01:00:35,975 --> 01:00:38,137
it was fun. it was fun.

1117
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,019
You look so different with makeup on.

1118
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,301
Well, that's good, I think.

1119
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,786
I wouldn't want a face that looks like

1120
01:00:43,855 --> 01:00:46,222
I'm wearing makeup all the time, right?

1121
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:49,620
Um, listen, seriously,
thank you so much for coming.

1122
01:00:49,695 --> 01:00:51,379
I really appreciate it.

1123
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:54,379
I think you actually brought
the head-count up to like 19.

1124
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,139
Which is pretty cool.

1125
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,503
Yeah. No problem. I owed you one.
So now we're even forever.

1126
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:01,986
Forever.

1127
01:01:02,055 --> 01:01:04,103
Hey, Lee. Are you coming out with us?

1128
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:05,620
Maybe.

1129
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:07,106
I hope so.

1130
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:08,620
Hey.

1131
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:12,585
Okay, were Britney Spears
and Christina Aguilera the same person?

1132
01:01:12,655 --> 01:01:13,656
Yeah, they totally were.

1133
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:14,736
I knew it!

1134
01:01:14,815 --> 01:01:18,581
So, what do you, uh, feel like doing?

1135
01:01:19,695 --> 01:01:21,857
Um, well, I'm probably
just gonna head back

1136
01:01:21,935 --> 01:01:23,664
and try to find my dad some more...

1137
01:01:23,735 --> 01:01:26,818
It's like 11:00, you sure about that?

1138
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,420
You should come out with us.

1139
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:32,181
Oh, gosh, that sounds like fun.
But I really should head back.

1140
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,496
And I don't want my mom to worry.

1141
01:01:34,575 --> 01:01:35,736
Wow.

1142
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:37,415
That's really sad,

1143
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:40,942
because you're a writer and that's the
best excuse you can come up with.

1144
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:44,098
All right, look, to be honest,
I don't really feel like going out.

1145
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:46,337
And in addition to that, I don't drink,

1146
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:48,383
and you and I
don't really know each other well enough

1147
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:52,779
to determine whether we would even have
fun in a social setting together.

1148
01:01:52,855 --> 01:01:55,222
And, we're practically
from different generations.

1149
01:01:55,855 --> 01:01:58,222
You're right. No, you're
right, I agree with you there.

1150
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:01,782
I mean, God forbid we went out and I
said something that was really lame

1151
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:03,220
and you felt embarrassed for me,

1152
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:04,535
and we had nothing to talk about.

1153
01:02:04,615 --> 01:02:06,504
- It'd be messy.
- Yeah.

1154
01:02:06,615 --> 01:02:07,696
I mean, I'm not being negative,

1155
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,743
I'm just saying the
possibility certainly exists,

1156
01:02:09,815 --> 01:02:12,216
and for us not to
acknowledge that would be reckless.

1157
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,105
No, I agree. I think
it would be reckless.

1158
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:17,257
I think if we did that we'd probably

1159
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:19,383
be taking like a gigantic risk.

1160
01:02:19,455 --> 01:02:21,298
- For sure.
- I agree.

1161
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:23,821
Okay.

1162
01:02:23,895 --> 01:02:24,896
See you later.

1163
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:28,377
But the thing about that is,
um, I don't give a shit.

1164
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,345
I'm sorry this place is so loud,

1165
01:02:40,415 --> 01:02:42,417
but that's a good sign.
All my friends are here.

1166
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:43,856
Hey!

1167
01:02:43,935 --> 01:02:45,937
- You wanna dance?
- No, thank you!

1168
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,340
Hey

1169
01:02:51,655 --> 01:02:54,420
Well, well.
Look who finally made it.

1170
01:02:54,495 --> 01:02:56,577
All right, so this is Nick, that's Lucy,

1171
01:02:56,655 --> 01:02:59,545
Charlotte, Antonio, Sherry and Veronica.

1172
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:01,185
Guys, this is Imogene.

1173
01:03:02,095 --> 01:03:03,938
- Hello.
- Yo!

1174
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:07,337
Oh, my God.
I think my mom had that same vest!

1175
01:03:07,935 --> 01:03:08,936
Cool.

1176
01:03:09,015 --> 01:03:10,744
So, how do you guys know each other?

1177
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:12,260
Uh, through her family.

1178
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:13,905
Oh, is she, like, your aunt?

1179
01:03:13,975 --> 01:03:14,976
No.

1180
01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:16,136
Do you want a drink?

1181
01:03:16,215 --> 01:03:17,262
Charlotte, you guys want a drink?

1182
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,541
You want a water, soda, something?

1183
01:03:18,615 --> 01:03:19,855
Pellegrino.

1184
01:03:19,935 --> 01:03:22,700
Hey, Lee, I'll take another
Jack and Coke now,

1185
01:03:22,775 --> 01:03:24,664
and I'll get you back later.

1186
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,382
You know, I'm gonna have
a Long Island Iced Tea, too.

1187
01:03:28,455 --> 01:03:30,139
- A large.
- Oh.

1188
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:32,297
I thought that you didn't drink?

1189
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,298
Come on, man. You heard
what the lady said.

1190
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:35,376
Get her some alcohol.

1191
01:03:35,455 --> 01:03:38,823
Yeah, you heard what the lady said.
Get me some alcohol.

1192
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,062
Um... Okay, great.

1193
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:44,140
All right.

1194
01:03:52,975 --> 01:03:55,945
This place has crazy lights.

1195
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:05,580
I feel like I'm on fire,
but my thoughts are really slow.

1196
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:07,819
How do you make it stop?

1197
01:04:07,895 --> 01:04:09,260
Drink more.

1198
01:04:14,295 --> 01:04:15,626
Okay, let's go dance. Come on.

1199
01:04:16,495 --> 01:04:18,056
- I don't want to dance here.
- Come on.

1200
01:04:18,095 --> 01:04:19,460
I don't like this song.

1201
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:17,376
I should drink more.

1202
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,866
Everyone is so nice.

1203
01:05:18,935 --> 01:05:20,300
I know, right?

1204
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:23,663
And I forgot that
hanging out with regular people

1205
01:05:23,735 --> 01:05:27,262
could be such an enthralling experience.

1206
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:30,060
I feel like I want to
expand my social circle

1207
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,786
and get, like, acrylic
nails or something.

1208
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:34,380
No, no. No acrylic nails.

1209
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,386
Okay, seriously.

1210
01:05:37,655 --> 01:05:39,578
- Did you go to Yale?
- Yeah.

1211
01:05:39,655 --> 01:05:42,226
I really did. I went to Yale.

1212
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:43,456
Okay, what did you study?

1213
01:05:43,535 --> 01:05:47,859
I majored in music and French history.

1214
01:05:47,935 --> 01:05:50,176
And my senior year I
was a Whiffenpoof.

1215
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:52,144
- A what?
- You never heard of the Whiffenpoofs.

1216
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,183
That is not... You're making up groups.

1217
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:55,541
You never heard
of the Whiffenpoofs?

1218
01:05:55,655 --> 01:05:56,895
No, that's not a real thing!

1219
01:05:56,975 --> 01:05:59,023
That is absolute... All right.

1220
01:06:22,175 --> 01:06:23,859
Okay, I'm getting the parts wrong,
it doesn't matter.

1221
01:06:23,975 --> 01:06:26,342
It's better with the
gloves and the tuxedo.

1222
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,496
- I'm coming up.
- Oh!

1223
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,260
I get it. I get it.
That's very funny. Oh!

1224
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:32,700
Okay.

1225
01:06:32,815 --> 01:06:34,385
I'm gonna fall if I stand on that.

1226
01:06:34,455 --> 01:06:35,502
You're gonna sit.

1227
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:38,943
You're so good!

1228
01:06:39,015 --> 01:06:42,462
You are. You're such a great singer.

1229
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:45,385
Why are you working in that shithole?

1230
01:06:45,495 --> 01:06:47,816
Because that shithole pays me.

1231
01:06:48,575 --> 01:06:51,818
I think... I think you should be famous.

1232
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:54,819
I think you should be famous, too.

1233
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:56,941
I do.

1234
01:06:57,015 --> 01:06:59,017
I almost was.

1235
01:06:59,135 --> 01:07:00,500
Kind of.

1236
01:07:00,575 --> 01:07:02,737
Well, no one told you to stop writing.

1237
01:07:03,735 --> 01:07:06,181
I think you're
just as good now as you were then.

1238
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,826
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1239
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:11,579
Actually, I do.

1240
01:07:11,655 --> 01:07:13,339
I do know what I'm talking about,

1241
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:15,019
because I found your secret hole.

1242
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:17,457
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, your secret hole.

1243
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:21,017
Behind your bureau,
in your wall, in your room.

1244
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,096
I...

1245
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:25,577
I was moving stuff,
and I just found a bunch of your plays.

1246
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:28,465
What? You went into my secret hole
and you found my plays,

1247
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:29,946
and you read them
without even asking me?

1248
01:07:30,015 --> 01:07:31,744
- I was just trying to see what it was.
- That's private.

1249
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:33,863
- I'm sorry.
- You don't read other people's stuff

1250
01:07:33,935 --> 01:07:36,666
they keep in the wall. If it's in
the wall, it means don't read it.

1251
01:07:36,735 --> 01:07:37,816
Okay, listen, calm down, hear me out.

1252
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:39,863
I just went to go see what it was,

1253
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:41,858
and I ended up staying up all night

1254
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:46,259
reading this great play
about you becoming a woman.

1255
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:49,020
What was it called?

1256
01:07:49,095 --> 01:07:50,745
Imogene's Period.

1257
01:07:56,455 --> 01:07:58,059
Was it good?

1258
01:07:58,135 --> 01:07:59,466
Yeah.

1259
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,499
It really was.

1260
01:08:03,175 --> 01:08:05,177
I really liked it. I think...

1261
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:08,821
I think you were born to be a writer.

1262
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:25,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1263
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:27,226
Are your sheets clean?

1264
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:28,456
What do you mean?

1265
01:08:28,535 --> 01:08:30,617
Did you have sex in them?

1266
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:33,457
- Only with myself.
- Ew.

1267
01:08:38,175 --> 01:08:39,506
That feels good.

1268
01:08:43,295 --> 01:08:44,945
Where are you...

1269
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:04,381
I feel like I am dying.

1270
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:08,106
I think that's because you're hungover.

1271
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:10,223
How long does this last?

1272
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:12,821
I don't know.

1273
01:09:12,935 --> 01:09:16,018
Sometimes it helps if
you eat McDonald's.

1274
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:24,783
- Jesus.
- The Bousche never came home.

1275
01:09:24,855 --> 01:09:26,141
Uh... Wait. What?

1276
01:09:27,055 --> 01:09:29,183
He left yesterday morning.

1277
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:32,657
I made him a sandwich,
he never came back.

1278
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,100
- Did he say where he was going?
- What?

1279
01:09:34,175 --> 01:09:38,146
Oh, God. Your voice is like
burning knives through my skull.

1280
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:42,746
Imogene?

1281
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:46,656
Oh!

1282
01:09:49,855 --> 01:09:52,017
Did you guys have sex?

1283
01:09:55,295 --> 01:09:56,626
Thank you.

1284
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:17,300
Um, listen, uh...

1285
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:22,696
What day is it?

1286
01:10:22,775 --> 01:10:23,901
It's Thursday.

1287
01:10:23,975 --> 01:10:25,659
Shit! on, my God!

1288
01:10:25,775 --> 01:10:27,698
It's Dara's book party!

1289
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:29,857
Just to clarify, this is the girl that

1290
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,744
wouldn't let you into
her apartment, right?

1291
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,897
If I don't go to this thing tonight,
people are going to speculate

1292
01:10:34,015 --> 01:10:35,221
about my mental state and what happened.

1293
01:10:35,295 --> 01:10:38,378
And I need to go there,
and prove to them that I am sane

1294
01:10:39,295 --> 01:10:40,979
and that I am in control of my life.

1295
01:10:41,455 --> 01:10:43,219
- All right, let's go.
- What?

1296
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:45,059
Yeah, I'll take you.

1297
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,057
Just to clarify. You
mean, like, as my date?

1298
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:51,225
Uh, a date impersonator.

1299
01:10:56,975 --> 01:10:58,659
Look at you.

1300
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,665
After you.

1301
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:03,656
Wait! Wait!

1302
01:11:05,175 --> 01:11:06,256
I'm coming with you.

1303
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:07,336
What?

1304
01:11:08,175 --> 01:11:10,303
Mom said you're going to New York.

1305
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,546
You know that it's
past the boardwalk though, right?

1306
01:11:13,615 --> 01:11:15,504
I think I'm ready.

1307
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:48,696
You sure you know how to get back?

1308
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,976
Yes, that's why I have my GPS watch.

1309
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:56,300
I'll meet you right here,
45.2 degrees north by 79.3 degrees west.

1310
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:58,855
<i>At 7:30.</i>

1311
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:02,505
So you're sure you
want to bring this shell-thing with you?

1312
01:12:03,415 --> 01:12:05,543
What better place
to try it out than New York City?

1313
01:12:06,775 --> 01:12:09,619
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

1314
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:13,376
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

1315
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:17,022
Just watch where you're going.

1316
01:12:18,095 --> 01:12:19,381
He'll be fine.

1317
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:21,776
Yeah.

1318
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:22,982
Oh!

1319
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:41,976
Ow!

1320
01:12:52,255 --> 01:12:53,745
"I Found the One."

1321
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:55,896
Did you read it?

1322
01:12:55,975 --> 01:12:57,340
I helped write it.

1323
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,905
Then it's gotta be good.

1324
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:02,980
It doesn't really matter. Her uncle
owns the publishing company, so...

1325
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:05,057
Hmm. Good, old-fashioned nepotism.

1326
01:13:07,695 --> 01:13:09,106
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

1327
01:13:21,615 --> 01:13:23,697
Hey! I'm talking to you.

1328
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,425
What's inside of it?

1329
01:13:25,495 --> 01:13:27,463
- I'm the... I go inside of it.
- What?

1330
01:13:29,175 --> 01:13:30,336
- Oh, my God!
- Hey guys!

1331
01:13:30,415 --> 01:13:33,544
Imogene! What a surprise!

1332
01:13:33,615 --> 01:13:35,424
That's an interesting dress.

1333
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,099
I hardly know
why my presence would be a surprise,

1334
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:38,779
I confirmed over a month ago.

1335
01:13:38,855 --> 01:13:39,902
Of course, of course!

1336
01:13:39,975 --> 01:13:43,457
We just... We were concerned
that you might not be here tonight.

1337
01:13:43,535 --> 01:13:45,105
- But you are.
- Yay!

1338
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:46,222
It's wonderful.

1339
01:13:46,295 --> 01:13:48,263
I'm going to go to the bar.

1340
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,786
Long Island Iced Tea?

1341
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:51,095
Very funny.

1342
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,256
So, is everyone here?

1343
01:13:53,335 --> 01:13:54,382
Yes. Everyone.

1344
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:56,623
Anabelle and George are
talking to David Sedaris.

1345
01:13:56,695 --> 01:13:57,856
And I think I saw Peter.

1346
01:13:57,935 --> 01:13:58,982
Wait. What?

1347
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:01,618
- Oh.
- Peter's here?

1348
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:03,026
No, actually I just saw him...

1349
01:14:03,095 --> 01:14:04,096
No.

1350
01:14:04,175 --> 01:14:06,303
Oh, my God, it's him.
He is here.

1351
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:10,060
I forgot. I forgot!

1352
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:11,182
Peter?

1353
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:14,139
- Oh!
- Imogene.

1354
01:14:15,335 --> 01:14:17,542
They told me that
you weren't going to be here tonight.

1355
01:14:17,655 --> 01:14:20,306
So, what? I almost die and you just
aren't going to talk to me again?

1356
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,264
They won't let
you go to the garden to smoke,

1357
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,336
can you believe?

1358
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:24,826
I can't, that's...

1359
01:14:25,655 --> 01:14:27,578
- That's terrible.
- Hello.

1360
01:14:27,655 --> 01:14:29,100
This is club soda with bitters.

1361
01:14:29,175 --> 01:14:31,143
It'll be good for your stomach.

1362
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:33,021
Are you joking?

1363
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,619
How do you live with someone

1364
01:14:35,695 --> 01:14:39,780
and show up at
a friend's party with some random model!

1365
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,823
- What's random?
- Just give me a second here.

1366
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,540
She's not random, okay?

1367
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:48,380
Our parents summer together in Provence.

1368
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:53,141
You wouldn't have even cared
if I died, would you?

1369
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:56,616
Oh, my God. You would be happy.

1370
01:14:56,735 --> 01:14:59,181
I would not be happy if you died, okay?

1371
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:01,098
That's why I asked Dara
to go check on you.

1372
01:15:01,175 --> 01:15:02,222
Wait. What?

1373
01:15:09,895 --> 01:15:11,135
Hey!

1374
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,501
Hi. Wow.

1375
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,304
You knew Peter wasn't coming
and you didn't tell me?

1376
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:15,615
How could you do that?

1377
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:17,535
Are you Imogene Duncan?

1378
01:15:17,615 --> 01:15:18,821
Yeah.

1379
01:15:18,895 --> 01:15:20,545
Ralph, are you okay?
What happened?

1380
01:15:20,615 --> 01:15:21,821
How do you know this man?

1381
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:22,942
He's my brother.

1382
01:15:23,055 --> 01:15:24,295
Keep him off
the street, please.

1383
01:15:24,735 --> 01:15:26,180
He almost ended up in Gitmo.

1384
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,337
What is that junk
he just dragged into my party?

1385
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:31,656
That is a man-made replica
of an exoskeleton

1386
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:34,181
that he designed and constructed
by himself.

1387
01:15:34,255 --> 01:15:36,826
Which is more than I could
ever say for you!

1388
01:15:37,255 --> 01:15:38,586
Okay.

1389
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:40,860
No, don't walk away.

1390
01:15:40,935 --> 01:15:42,505
How could you not be
honest with me?

1391
01:15:42,615 --> 01:15:45,858
Because if I did that it would be a
full time job, all right, Imogene?

1392
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:47,903
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Imogene, let it go.

1393
01:15:47,975 --> 01:15:52,025
I think what Dara means is
sometimes you seem sad.

1394
01:15:52,095 --> 01:15:54,462
No, Hannah, that's not what I meant.

1395
01:15:54,535 --> 01:15:57,698
You need to be very careful about
who you speak to like that,

1396
01:15:57,775 --> 01:15:59,379
because the only reason
why you're here right now,

1397
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:01,822
and know all of these people,
is because of me.

1398
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:04,501
And you're living in a fantasy world
if you think you belong here.

1399
01:16:07,015 --> 01:16:08,221
And now she's gonna cry.

1400
01:16:08,295 --> 01:16:10,423
Hurry, Imogene. Get in here.

1401
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:11,735
- Get in the shell.
- No, it's okay, Ralph.

1402
01:16:11,815 --> 01:16:13,255
You didn't even write your own book.

1403
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:17,385
Like I care what you think?
I don't even know how you got in here.

1404
01:16:17,455 --> 01:16:18,502
I came here with Imogene.

1405
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:25,665
Imogene, wait.

1406
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:40,341
Picked that up in Chinatown.

1407
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:54,702
Imogene?

1408
01:16:56,855 --> 01:16:58,220
Are you okay?

1409
01:17:05,015 --> 01:17:06,505
It's just like...

1410
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:10,418
You spend so long staring at one thing.

1411
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:15,143
And then,
one day everything else comes into view

1412
01:17:16,135 --> 01:17:19,378
and there you are. I'm like a big joke.

1413
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:23,495
No, look, hey, they're assholes.

1414
01:17:24,495 --> 01:17:26,896
You think I've never
had to deal with people like that?

1415
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:30,980
I was inundated with all that
bullshit my entire time in college.

1416
01:17:31,055 --> 01:17:33,342
I couldn't wait to get out.

1417
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:38,099
Well, at least you had somewhere to go.

1418
01:17:42,055 --> 01:17:45,377
834 Sutton Place.
New York, New York, 10021.

1419
01:17:48,975 --> 01:17:50,101
Dad lives there.

1420
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,181
Thanks.

1421
01:18:10,255 --> 01:18:13,020
Ah, it's not a problem.
I don't mind the drive.

1422
01:18:13,095 --> 01:18:15,541
No. I just mean thank you.

1423
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:18,256
Oh.

1424
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,506
Of course.

1425
01:18:24,895 --> 01:18:26,420
Good luck.

1426
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:30,859
Hi. We're here
to see Maxwell P. Duncan.

1427
01:18:30,935 --> 01:18:33,142
And who should I say you are?

1428
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:35,786
His children.

1429
01:18:38,615 --> 01:18:40,617
Just a moment, please.

1430
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:02,095
How did you find
out I was still alive?

1431
01:19:13,255 --> 01:19:15,223
2 weeks after you died,

1432
01:19:15,295 --> 01:19:19,584
I saw you buying toothpaste at the A&P.

1433
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:21,661
And then, when I turned 21,

1434
01:19:21,735 --> 01:19:24,500
I hired a private investigator
with my birthday money.

1435
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:26,615
So you've known all this time?

1436
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:27,742
Yes, sir.

1437
01:19:27,815 --> 01:19:30,216
But you didn't try to contact me before.

1438
01:19:30,335 --> 01:19:33,179
I was waiting for my
sister to come home.

1439
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:38,303
Well, please come up.

1440
01:19:45,455 --> 01:19:48,265
Could you keep an eye
on that for me, please?

1441
01:20:01,975 --> 01:20:03,136
Do you think we should hug?

1442
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,819
Sure.

1443
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:21,063
- Does your mother know you're here?
- No.

1444
01:20:21,815 --> 01:20:24,466
She's mad at you.
She told us, you know, not to come.

1445
01:20:24,535 --> 01:20:25,980
Oh, how exquisite.

1446
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:27,978
Is this a Joseph Kato?

1447
01:20:28,055 --> 01:20:29,136
Oh, yes, it is.

1448
01:20:29,215 --> 01:20:31,343
It's been in my wife's family for years.

1449
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:36,426
Oh, yes, Virginia.
These are my children.

1450
01:20:36,535 --> 01:20:38,617
This is Imogene.

1451
01:20:38,695 --> 01:20:39,742
A pleasure.

1452
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:40,896
And this...

1453
01:20:40,975 --> 01:20:43,706
- This is Ralph.
- Ralph.

1454
01:20:43,775 --> 01:20:45,186
- Hello.
- Hello, Ralph.

1455
01:20:45,935 --> 01:20:47,425
Did you know that we were alive?

1456
01:20:48,295 --> 01:20:49,706
Actually, no.

1457
01:20:49,775 --> 01:20:51,061
Okay.

1458
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:57,857
I can get you one of
your own, if you'd like.

1459
01:20:57,935 --> 01:20:59,061
Yes, please.

1460
01:21:00,415 --> 01:21:03,180
Have you produced any
offspring together?

1461
01:21:03,255 --> 01:21:04,541
No. We can't.

1462
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:06,424
I have a condition.

1463
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:07,860
Which one?

1464
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:10,541
Virginia is on
the board of trustees at the Guggenheim.

1465
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:14,017
Oh, the Guggenheim is,
by far, my favorite.

1466
01:21:14,095 --> 01:21:16,055
I've seen
the Kandinsky exhibit there 3 times.

1467
01:21:21,255 --> 01:21:23,940
I started reading your book
on agrarian America,

1468
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:26,541
and I had no idea
that the Pilgrims were alcoholics.

1469
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,060
Oh, yes. Yes, it's true.

1470
01:21:28,135 --> 01:21:30,536
They preferred the taste
of beer to water,

1471
01:21:30,615 --> 01:21:32,504
thus contributing to their notorious

1472
01:21:32,575 --> 01:21:34,384
legacy of being drunk sodomists.

1473
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:36,503
Do you know who invented pumpkin pie?

1474
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:38,498
Oh, I believe it... It was the Pilgrims.

1475
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,584
So sodomists invented pumpkin pie?

1476
01:21:41,655 --> 01:21:42,736
Evidently.

1477
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:46,024
But it's got such a nice
image, pumpkin pie.

1478
01:21:46,095 --> 01:21:47,745
- Ralph.
- It's delicious.

1479
01:21:47,855 --> 01:21:50,381
Why don't you tell us about you?

1480
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:53,143
I'd be happy to.
My name is Ralph Duncan,

1481
01:21:53,215 --> 01:21:54,296
I'm an inventor.

1482
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:59,817
My main focus is the science
of physical self-preservation.

1483
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:03,741
- Yes, please.
- Based on the exoskeletons of mollusks.

1484
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:10,299
Imogene, why don't you tell us
something about yourself?

1485
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:13,345
Imogene Duncan doesn't
have anyone to marry.

1486
01:22:14,015 --> 01:22:16,017
She doesn't have anywhere
to live right now.

1487
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:17,182
And all of her stuff is gone,

1488
01:22:17,255 --> 01:22:20,862
except for this piece of shit.

1489
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:22,425
But she used to be a writer.

1490
01:22:22,495 --> 01:22:24,304
And what did she used to write?

1491
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,379
She could write the kind of
stuff that could trick people

1492
01:22:27,455 --> 01:22:29,617
into thinking she was the real deal.

1493
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:34,622
Until they realized
that I was just an impersonator.

1494
01:22:37,695 --> 01:22:41,177
There is a very, very
odd taste to this soup.

1495
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:44,225
And I can't catch it.

1496
01:22:44,295 --> 01:22:45,501
Cinnamon?

1497
01:22:45,575 --> 01:22:47,100
No. It's an herb.

1498
01:22:47,855 --> 01:22:51,382
I'm gonna go lay down for 2 minutes.
Excuse me.

1499
01:22:51,935 --> 01:22:53,937
Turmeric? Turmeric?

1500
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:57,542
It's so sad. How long has she
had her drinking problem?

1501
01:22:58,255 --> 01:22:59,461
Like 2 days.

1502
01:23:00,855 --> 01:23:05,861
<i>...36CXY, playing the sexiest
music from the '80s, '90s and today.</i>

1503
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:07,540
<i>Remember this one?</i>

1504
01:23:11,455 --> 01:23:13,059
You know, when I first met your mother,

1505
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:15,342
I thought she was
the sexiest thing I'd ever seen.

1506
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:19,306
Oh, she was up on stage,
dancing in her little costume.

1507
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:20,736
Are you saying Mom was a stripper?

1508
01:23:20,775 --> 01:23:22,982
Well, back then
they were called Go-Go dancers.

1509
01:23:23,615 --> 01:23:26,061
And I had never seen anything like her.

1510
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:28,342
I mean, she was 19, a college dropout.

1511
01:23:29,215 --> 01:23:31,821
I had just gotten out of the Army,
and, you know,

1512
01:23:31,895 --> 01:23:33,943
when we first got married,
she went and got pregnant

1513
01:23:34,015 --> 01:23:35,255
and never even asked me.

1514
01:23:35,895 --> 01:23:38,216
I was just beginning to wonder
if I even loved her or not.

1515
01:23:38,735 --> 01:23:40,658
I was 21!

1516
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:42,897
Can you even comprehend
how that must have felt?

1517
01:23:44,415 --> 01:23:46,179
Were you ever happy with her?

1518
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:49,099
Look, I tried. Okay?
There was simply nothing to be done.

1519
01:23:49,175 --> 01:23:52,258
She wanted Ocean City,
and I needed more than that.

1520
01:23:52,335 --> 01:23:54,497
Why didn't you just take us with you?

1521
01:23:54,575 --> 01:23:56,339
What about when I was traveling?

1522
01:23:56,975 --> 01:23:58,340
You would have grown to resent me.

1523
01:23:58,415 --> 01:24:01,385
And that wouldn't have
been fair for any of us.

1524
01:24:01,455 --> 01:24:04,299
So, you thought it was fair
to just pretend like we didn't exist?

1525
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:05,820
Didn't you love me more that way?

1526
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:08,216
Didn't you miss us?

1527
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:10,866
You were children, I barely knew you.

1528
01:24:10,935 --> 01:24:12,935
I mean, it's not like
you were fully-formed people.

1529
01:24:13,575 --> 01:24:14,986
I mean, honestly, can you actually say

1530
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,420
that you really knew who I was?

1531
01:24:16,495 --> 01:24:17,496
You were my father.

1532
01:24:18,055 --> 01:24:19,625
I knew that I loved you.

1533
01:24:19,695 --> 01:24:23,017
Yeah, well, you must admit,
your mother was pretty...

1534
01:24:25,295 --> 01:24:27,662
She has her eccentricities,

1535
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:31,376
but she didn't exactly have it
easy raising Ralph by herself.

1536
01:24:31,455 --> 01:24:32,935
Look, I want to say something to you.

1537
01:24:34,295 --> 01:24:36,582
Would you look at me?

1538
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,384
Obviously I wasn't much of a father.

1539
01:24:38,455 --> 01:24:40,822
And I can see how that has done
some collateral damage to you,

1540
01:24:40,895 --> 01:24:41,942
as a woman.

1541
01:24:42,655 --> 01:24:46,899
So let me help you now.
How much money do you need?

1542
01:24:54,415 --> 01:24:57,146
If you can believe it, you actually
remind me a little bit of myself.

1543
01:24:58,495 --> 01:25:03,137
So, I guess that me helping you
is like me helping me, right?

1544
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,537
Can you just tell me
where your nearest bathroom is?

1545
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:09,266
Yes, it's down the hall.
Second door on your right.

1546
01:25:09,335 --> 01:25:11,019
- Excuse me.
- Mmm-hmm.

1547
01:25:25,695 --> 01:25:29,302
I've hit this thing
with sticks, rocks.

1548
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,582
I've subjected it to wind tests.

1549
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:32,736
Come on, Ralph, let's go.

1550
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:34,939
- We're going home.
- What?

1551
01:25:35,015 --> 01:25:36,619
No, I want to do a
demonstration for Dad.

1552
01:25:36,695 --> 01:25:38,026
Well, you can show him another time.
Okay?

1553
01:25:38,095 --> 01:25:39,301
What? No, I want to do it right now.

1554
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:41,343
You can't do it right now
because we're leaving.

1555
01:25:41,415 --> 01:25:42,496
Why are we leaving?

1556
01:25:42,575 --> 01:25:43,781
Because it's
time to leave, Ralph.

1557
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:45,380
Doesn't he want to see it?

1558
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:49,385
No.

1559
01:25:49,455 --> 01:25:51,025
He doesn't want to see it.

1560
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:04,377
Do you want to talk about it?

1561
01:26:13,655 --> 01:26:15,066
Bubba?

1562
01:26:16,575 --> 01:26:18,384
Hey. It's just us.

1563
01:26:23,055 --> 01:26:24,659
What happened to you?

1564
01:26:24,735 --> 01:26:27,659
Dad's a piece of shit.

1565
01:26:27,735 --> 01:26:28,941
You saw him?

1566
01:26:31,455 --> 01:26:32,581
Wait.

1567
01:26:43,575 --> 01:26:47,216
You are a stupid shell!

1568
01:26:47,295 --> 01:26:49,775
You are a stupid, stupid shell!

1569
01:26:53,335 --> 01:26:54,416
Honey.

1570
01:26:54,615 --> 01:26:56,617
- Do you want something to eat?
- No!

1571
01:26:59,175 --> 01:27:00,461
Imogene?

1572
01:27:03,175 --> 01:27:04,506
Honey.

1573
01:27:06,135 --> 01:27:07,819
I get why you did it.

1574
01:27:08,815 --> 01:27:10,419
I get why you lied.

1575
01:27:17,135 --> 01:27:20,139
Honey. Tell me what happened.

1576
01:27:24,855 --> 01:27:26,584
Let's just say it was underwhelming.

1577
01:27:26,695 --> 01:27:27,696
As you predicted.

1578
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:36,057
You know, um, there's a saying
in the samurai tradition.

1579
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:38,297
The Bousche taught it to me.

1580
01:27:38,415 --> 01:27:39,905
It's something like,

1581
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:42,983
"Sometimes you need to see the snake

1582
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:45,661
"in the bush to know it's really there."

1583
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:48,942
You know, maybe I was wrong.

1584
01:27:49,015 --> 01:27:51,700
Maybe you needed to see the snake.

1585
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:55,736
Is that your version of an apology?

1586
01:27:56,415 --> 01:27:57,496
Well...

1587
01:27:59,135 --> 01:28:00,978
If I say I'm sorry,

1588
01:28:01,055 --> 01:28:03,661
then I'm worried that
you'll just get all mad

1589
01:28:03,735 --> 01:28:06,341
and yell at me for ruining your life.

1590
01:28:09,015 --> 01:28:11,666
And then I'll feel like shit. And I...

1591
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:14,978
I just can't win with you, Imogene.

1592
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:19,105
Well, maybe, just this once,
you can throw caution to the wind

1593
01:28:19,175 --> 01:28:22,896
and try saying it anyway,
and see what happens?

1594
01:28:24,535 --> 01:28:26,025
Well, okay.

1595
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,221
Um...

1596
01:28:28,855 --> 01:28:33,543
I guess I'm sorry, you
know, for lying to you.

1597
01:28:35,335 --> 01:28:37,736
Even though it was for your own good.

1598
01:28:37,815 --> 01:28:40,625
And now you can see I
was right to do it.

1599
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:44,379
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1600
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:48,824
That's my flipper.

1601
01:28:48,895 --> 01:28:52,581
Oh, my God. I've been
looking for this forever.

1602
01:28:53,735 --> 01:28:56,056
I hope the other one's
still in my trunk.

1603
01:28:57,895 --> 01:28:59,738
Hello!
Is anyone home?

1604
01:29:00,855 --> 01:29:03,096
Oh, my God. It's George! He's back!

1605
01:29:03,175 --> 01:29:05,416
I knew he would come back to me!

1606
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:09,736
Honey?

1607
01:29:17,575 --> 01:29:19,862
Oh, my God!

1608
01:29:19,975 --> 01:29:21,136
Oh, my God, honey.

1609
01:29:21,215 --> 01:29:24,742
I was so worried
that something had happened to you.

1610
01:29:29,295 --> 01:29:30,581
Is my sandwich ready?

1611
01:29:30,655 --> 01:29:32,305
Of course it is, sweetie.

1612
01:29:33,255 --> 01:29:35,098
I'll get it for you.

1613
01:29:36,255 --> 01:29:37,905
How's that apple, Lee?

1614
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:42,337
Do you want potato chips?

1615
01:29:42,455 --> 01:29:44,503
Are they sour cream and onion?

1616
01:29:46,495 --> 01:29:47,621
Oh, my God!

1617
01:29:48,815 --> 01:29:49,896
Honey!

1618
01:29:50,815 --> 01:29:51,941
Armando.

1619
01:29:52,015 --> 01:29:54,825
Don't even think about it.

1620
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:56,659
Don't shoot. We'll
co-operate, all right?

1621
01:29:57,495 --> 01:29:58,621
Here.

1622
01:29:58,695 --> 01:29:59,696
Don't shoot.

1623
01:30:03,335 --> 01:30:04,382
Everyone in there!

1624
01:30:04,455 --> 01:30:05,502
You have a gun?

1625
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:12,176
What the hell are you saying?

1626
01:30:12,255 --> 01:30:13,859
Mom?

1627
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,136
Come any closer, you die!

1628
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:16,660
No, honey!

1629
01:30:24,535 --> 01:30:25,661
How did you find me?

1630
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:28,495
We're being robbed, just
give him your purse.

1631
01:30:29,575 --> 01:30:30,736
The briefcase is in the
closet over there.

1632
01:30:30,815 --> 01:30:31,896
That's what you want, isn't it?

1633
01:30:31,975 --> 01:30:33,420
Who are you, man?

1634
01:30:35,095 --> 01:30:39,305
Lady, why don't you go
get me the briefcase.

1635
01:30:41,495 --> 01:30:43,657
You're still smarting
over Antwerp, aren't you?

1636
01:30:44,735 --> 01:30:47,306
You really think
there's a game to be won here?

1637
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:49,537
Don't try any heroics.

1638
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:13,265
Just let them go and kill me.
They don't know anything.

1639
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:14,382
Oh, you're right.

1640
01:31:15,535 --> 01:31:17,776
Except maybe what I look like.
What kind of a gun I have.

1641
01:31:17,855 --> 01:31:20,335
Maybe I should give them
my mailing address, too,

1642
01:31:20,415 --> 01:31:22,224
so after I kill them,

1643
01:31:22,295 --> 01:31:24,616
they can send me a postcard from hell!

1644
01:31:28,295 --> 01:31:30,457
What the fuck?

1645
01:31:36,135 --> 01:31:37,182
Somebody grab the gun!

1646
01:31:47,815 --> 01:31:49,499
<i>Shocking news in Ocean City tonight,</i>

1647
01:31:49,575 --> 01:31:52,181
<i>where police arrested
an international assassin</i>

1648
01:31:52,255 --> 01:31:56,055
<i>for holding a government
operative and his family at gunpoint.</i>

1649
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,342
<i>However, the attack was thwarted</i>

1650
01:31:58,415 --> 01:32:01,862
<i>when a family member used a device

1651
01:32:01,935 --> 01:32:03,539
- Yo.
<i>- ...to overcome their captor.</i>

1652
01:32:03,615 --> 01:32:04,855
Hey, shut up. Shut up!

1653
01:32:04,935 --> 01:32:06,346
<i>Michelle Connors is
live now at the scene.</i>

1654
01:32:06,415 --> 01:32:07,701
I know this guy.

1655
01:32:07,775 --> 01:32:10,585
Hi, Paul. I'm here with
one of the victims, Ralph Duncan,

1656
01:32:10,655 --> 01:32:12,623
who is also the inventor
of the Human Shell.

1657
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:13,821
Oh, shit.

1658
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:17,502
Well, I am the one
who created the Human Shell,

1659
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:20,943
which is the ultimate
protective barrier against bodily harm,

1660
01:32:23,295 --> 01:32:26,777
but really it was my sister
who saved our family.

1661
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:29,301
Hey, you guys
want to get a shot of us over here?

1662
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:30,945
Hello. Hey, honey.

1663
01:32:37,735 --> 01:32:39,624
So tell us about the shell.

1664
01:32:40,495 --> 01:32:42,736
Yes, Michelle, I will
tell you about the shell.

1665
01:32:45,455 --> 01:32:49,016
The shell is a creation of mine...

1666
01:33:36,335 --> 01:33:38,178
So he took me with him, right?

1667
01:33:38,255 --> 01:33:42,101
And they have this machine
where you can win a $20 gold piece.

1668
01:33:42,175 --> 01:33:44,416
And on my third try, it hit.

1669
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:48,420
So there I am, I'm talking about all the
things I'm gonna spend it on.

1670
01:33:48,535 --> 01:33:50,378
And my grandpa stops me and he says,

1671
01:33:50,495 --> 01:33:53,465
"Oh, no, I can't ever
spend it because..."

1672
01:33:54,615 --> 01:33:55,616
Um...

1673
01:33:56,855 --> 01:33:58,823
Oh, shit, What did he say?

1674
01:33:58,895 --> 01:34:00,021
Mom, come on.

1675
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,261
Right, right, right.

1676
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:02,666
He says,

1677
01:34:03,615 --> 01:34:08,018
"I can't ever spend it because as
long as I have it in my pocket,

1678
01:34:08,135 --> 01:34:10,456
"I will always be a winner."

1679
01:34:10,535 --> 01:34:12,742
So I kept it.

1680
01:34:18,535 --> 01:34:19,696
You're giving it to me?

1681
01:34:21,575 --> 01:34:23,703
We gotta keep it in the family.

1682
01:34:24,775 --> 01:34:26,106
Mom.

1683
01:34:32,135 --> 01:34:34,820
Life is a brief flickering.

1684
01:34:34,895 --> 01:34:38,695
Well, sometimes the
darkness is self-imposed.

1685
01:34:38,775 --> 01:34:41,585
And to accuse your daughter of a crime

1686
01:34:41,655 --> 01:34:44,056
may indeed be the best way to find her.

1687
01:35:38,095 --> 01:35:40,177
There's the poster. Here's everybody.

1688
01:35:40,255 --> 01:35:43,577
Everybody getting in their limo.
Rock stars after a great show.

1689
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,498
There's the Bousche!

1690
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:50,537
I'm going to have to confiscate this.

1691
01:35:50,655 --> 01:35:52,145
That's my phone.

1692
01:35:52,215 --> 01:35:54,900
There can be no
physical evidence of my existence.

1693
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:03,223
Look, if you give me your number,

1694
01:36:03,335 --> 01:36:05,736
I'll talk to The Times
about doing a feature article.

1695
01:36:05,815 --> 01:36:06,976
- Really?
- I'm so sorry.

1696
01:36:07,055 --> 01:36:10,218
By the way, this is Whit Stillman,
superb writer and filmmaker.

1697
01:36:10,295 --> 01:36:12,741
Delighted to meet you.
I liked the play so much.

1698
01:36:12,815 --> 01:36:14,465
I'd love to ask you some
questions about it.

1699
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:16,264
- Do you have any time?
- Imogene!

1700
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:20,663
Hurry up already.
We're paying by the hour here.

1701
01:36:24,135 --> 01:36:27,503
Um, you know what?
I'm sorry. I, uh... I have to go.

1702
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:31,500
My family is waiting for me.
I have to go.

1703
01:36:44,415 --> 01:36:45,621
Everybody! Three!

1704
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:48,016
Two, one!
