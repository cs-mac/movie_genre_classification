1
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,016
(female voice): Today
is a very special day.

2
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,389
It is your first step
on the road to serenity.

3
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,425
You are not alone.

4
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,928
You are doing great.

5
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,937
One step at a time.

6
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,406
Lesson one.

7
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,282
In this first lesson,

8
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,250
you'll have to visualize
different landscapes.

9
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,586
First landscape.

10
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,586
A beach.

11
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,124
Picture that beach.

12
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,930
Then, picture yourself
on the beach.

13
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,467
Close your eyes,

14
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,264
relax...

15
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,430
and open your mind.

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,310
You are calm.

17
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,645
- OK.

18
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,548
Come on.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,393
Picture on the beach.

20
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,565
The beach...

21
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,667
(waves washing ashore)

22
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,571
The beach...

23
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,407
Ah...

24
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,430
(female voice): Now
picture yourself on the beach.

25
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,431
- Now...

26
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,265
picture yourself on the beach.

27
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,643
Yourself on the beach...

28
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,871
- Isn't this a beautiful day?

29
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,781
Isn't this gonna be a beautiful day?

30
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,994
- Picture yourself on the beach.

31
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,926
(seagulls cawing)

32
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,895
Yourself on the beach...

33
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,967
Picture...

34
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,967
Picture yourself...

35
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,539
... yourself on the beach.

36
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,699
Picture...

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,224
"Be sure to complete lesson one

38
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,886
before attempting lesson two."

39
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,550
(female voice): You are calm.

40
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,244
You've made one step
toward serenity.

41
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,547
- Fuck!

42
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,772
Smile: Now. Ask your doctor.

43
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,546
- I call at 9, the agency's closed.

44
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,720
That's not OK, Max.

45
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,818
Especially not today.

46
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,260
Inexperience is no excuse,
it's been two weeks.

47
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,663
I've had it.
Do you want the job or not?

48
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,393
I'll be there in ten.

49
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,138
Fuck.

50
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,711
(seagulls cawing)

51
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,883
Picture yourself...

52
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,579
... on the beach.

53
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,996
Yourself on the beach...

54
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,608
... on the beach.

55
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,244
Picture yourself...

56
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,590
- I'd prefer you waited till I left.

57
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,461
I can't stand smoke.
Sorry, it makes me sick.

58
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,532
- No problem.

59
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,469
Anyway, the agency was right.

60
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,841
You have a beautiful energy.

61
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,334
- You enjoyed it?

62
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,372
- A lot.

63
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,910
- Picture yourself on the beach.

64
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,379
... the beach.

65
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,281
Picture...

66
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,684
yourself on the beach.

67
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,057
(smoke alarm beeping)

68
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,532
(footsteps)

69
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,385
- Picture yourself--
(female voice): We've completed--

70
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,184
- Fuck you, ostie.

71
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,227
- Are you sure we've never met?

72
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,161
- Positive.

73
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,371
- Jennifer...

74
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,104
That your real name?

75
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,912
- Why wouldn't it be?

76
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,948
Do I ask your real name?

77
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,747
- No.
- Alright.

78
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,287
- Max?

79
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,834
Max, you there?

80
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,439
Goddamn!

81
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,346
Fuck.

82
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,865
(phone ringing)

83
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,090
- Not answering?

84
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,791
- No, I'm running late.

85
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,497
- Want me to?
- No, don't bother.

86
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,666
- I'll leave too.

87
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,775
- No, stay. Go back to sleep.

88
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,342
(phone ringing)

89
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,306
- You think?
- Got the key?

90
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,840
- Yes.

91
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,484
- Stay long as you want.

92
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,283
- I dunno.

93
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,046
- I'd be glad if you did.

94
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,691
- Thanks.

95
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,318
- You can sleep in my bed.

96
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,860
- This is comfortable.

97
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,959
- I'll call.

98
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,395
- OK.

99
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,259
(phone ringing)

100
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,866
- You can unplug it.

101
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,772
(meowing)

102
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,975
(meowing)

103
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,397
I made coffee.

104
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,392
You alright?
- Yeah.

105
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,936
- Will today be a good or bad day?

106
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,673
- Today?
- Yeah.

107
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,410
- A good day.
Better than yesterday.

108
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,881
I think.

109
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,581
- Are you sure?

110
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,121
- No.

111
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,984
Did me good to sleep here.

112
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,164
- See you later.

113
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,595
- Yeah.

114
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,836
- I'm off.

115
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,064
- You were watching me sleep.

116
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,239
- What?

117
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,710
- You slept next to me, on the floor.

118
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,480
- See you later, Stéphanie.

119
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,054
- What's the idea?
Just another whim of yours?

120
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,226
You've changed ten times.
- I have not!

121
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,994
- Now it's Jenny, before it was Cindy.

122
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,104
Before that Candy.
There was Claudia--

123
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,637
I was never Claudia.

124
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,776
I was Julia, but never Claudia.

125
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,878
So many names
and what's it got you?

126
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,047
The guy at the motel this morning...
It's Jennifer

127
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,981
he wants in his bed. Period.

128
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,412
- Jennifer?

129
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,714
- Yup.

130
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,527
- You want to change to Jennifer?
- Yes.

131
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,694
- Jennifer...
- Yes.

132
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,670
- It's the same damn thing!
The same name!

133
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,065
- Jenny and Jennifer?

134
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,370
- It's the same name.

135
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:05,215
- I'm not going to negotiate, Ron.
Jenny's cheap. I don't like it.

136
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,942
- What happened here?

137
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,246
- Where were you?

138
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,412
I tried your cell, at home...

139
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,148
- They took the book.
- The book?

140
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,792
- The girls' pictures.

141
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,520
- Who'd want it?
- Tell me you have a copy.

142
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,424
- Not me.

143
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,463
- Christ!

144
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:24,927
- But...

145
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,465
Ron has a hunch.

146
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,575
- He does?
- Yes.

147
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:32,844
- Who?

148
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,013
- Cheech.

149
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,112
- Who?
- Cheech.

150
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,119
- Cheech?

151
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,918
- Never heard of Cheech?
- Should I have?

152
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,490
- Nah.
- Nah?

153
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,559
- Clean up, I'll be back in an hour.

154
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,030
Jenny, we'll talk.

155
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,295
- My name is Jennifer.

156
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,834
- Jesus!

157
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,210
I'm so sorry, Gaétan.
I had car trouble.

158
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,144
- We said 10.
I had breakfast, three coffees...

159
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,289
- My treat.

160
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,682
Sit down, have a seat.

161
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,861
So, how's it going, Gaétan?

162
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,532
- Want conference gigs?

163
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,498
- Do I want conference gigs?

164
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,400
- Because if you want conference gigs,
that's fine, but...

165
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,531
you have to learn the ropes.

166
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,142
- Come on, Gaétan.

167
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,177
- I need to work with professionals.

168
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,573
Anyone can do one-ons.
A four-year-old could do it.

169
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,183
But conferences
require organization,

170
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,116
professionalism.
Do you mind?

171
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,116
I've no time to waste.

172
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,824
- Neither do l, Gaétan.

173
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,658
- I called the guys.

174
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,730
- From Wisconsin?

175
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,064
- We're looking at 10 girls.
- Right.

176
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,562
- Very discreet.

177
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,832
- Wasn't it a dozen?

178
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,476
- What?
- Nothing, forget it.

179
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,074
- Vaginal, anal...

180
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,569
- Of course, of course.

181
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,206
- And they want to see the book first.
- Sure.

182
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,644
- They wonder why
you don't have a website.

183
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,358
If you ask me,
it makes you look like an amateur.

184
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,457
Do you have it?

185
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,531
- What?

186
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,732
- Your book.

187
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,801
Ron?

188
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,765
- Look, Gaétan.

189
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,929
Come to think,

190
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,734
don't take it wrong,

191
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,936
but I'd like to meet them myself.

192
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,136
- What?

193
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,973
- The guys from Wisconsin.

194
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,276
I mean,

195
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,620
I could go there with you.
We'd be a team.

196
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,050
It's at 8, right?

197
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,280
- What do you mean?

198
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,183
- I'd like to present the product,
since it's my first time.

199
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,894
I'd be super presentable.

200
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,395
In terms of dress code, 4 stars,

201
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,463
like the hotel.

202
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,467
- Did I wait half an hour
like a turkey for nothing?

203
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,333
- I'll be happy to pay
for your breakfast.

204
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,839
So, 8 o'clock?

205
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,773
- I want my commission tonight.

206
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,105
- Tonight? We said--

207
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,578
- That was then.
This is now.

208
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,408
I want my cut tonight.

209
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,415
- What if they don't pay me?

210
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,213
- There's other agencies.

211
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,623
Want me to call the Regency?

212
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,790
They never give me problems.

213
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,059
- See you tonight.

214
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,434
- My treat.

215
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,340
- Does that answer your question?

216
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,113
- Is that Cheech's agency?

217
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,911
- Yes.
- Wow.

218
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,251
- Why the castle?
- Well, Regency...

219
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,350
- So, like kings?

220
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,220
That's so random.

221
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,591
- Only because
you don't know the Regency.

222
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,066
- 150 girls.

223
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,541
- Professionalism.

224
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,779
- Discretion.

225
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,615
- Courtesy.

226
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,151
- Quality.

227
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,988
- Competitive rates.

228
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,386
- Loyalty points.

229
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,293
- Total satisfaction.

230
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,492
- Like a mega-mart, but X-rated.

231
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:48,755
- Really?

232
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,062
- On his desk, a gold plaque.
A motto:

233
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,330
"We fuck for less."

234
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,636
- But underneath, in smaller letters,
the motto continues...

235
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,837
"So don't fuck with us."

236
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,676
- Don't fuck with us...

237
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,784
- Ron wants to do conference gigs.

238
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,478
And at the Grand Hotel, too.

239
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,347
That's great. Fine.

240
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,513
Good luck.

241
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,252
When you elbow aside the big boys,

242
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,363
there's a good chance
they won't like it.

243
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,161
- I won't be intimidated!

244
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,802
- Been there long?
- We redo the book.

245
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,871
- What?
- I'm not letting this chance slip by.

246
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,874
Let's call the girls.

247
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,237
Where you going?
- I have a date.

248
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,606
- Cancel it.
- There's no time.

249
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,078
- To hell with you.
We take new pictures,

250
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,341
only dirtier.
- How, dirtier?

251
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,250
- Real dirty.

252
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,988
We won't be intimidated.

253
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,628
- Yes, hello.

254
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,529
Is this 1-800-555-0147?

255
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,226
(camera shutter clicking)

256
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,396
I got your number...

257
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,339
A friend warmly recommended
your service.

258
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,912
Yes, hello.
Is this 1-800-555-0147?

259
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,224
(whip lashing)

260
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,523
Yes, hello. I'd like
to engage your services.

261
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,525
Well, in fact,
I'm calling for someone else.

262
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,505
Since he feels
a bit awkward about this,

263
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm helping him out,
since he's a good friend.

264
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,872
A very good friend.

265
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,017
(camera shutter clicking)

266
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,085
(whip lashing)

267
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,914
(alarm beeping)

268
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,216
- Come on, fuck!

269
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,394
- What's up?

270
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,224
- Gimme a minute, OK?

271
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,433
Take a break.

272
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,832
(women grumbling)

273
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,653
- Taping yourself?

274
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,716
- I won't be long, so just...

275
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,092
- Sure.

276
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,931
- "Spirit moment.

277
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,798
Press record."

278
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,939
- In English?

279
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,401
- Max, Christ!

280
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,839
Please, Max! OK?

281
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,706
- Sorry.

282
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,740
- It's alright.

283
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,771
It's alright.

284
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,976
- Is it for your depression?

285
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,789
- What?

286
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,584
- This. Is it to help you?

287
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,060
- I dunno anymore.

288
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,866
I dunno what to do. I'm trying.

289
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,235
I'm trying stuff.
I dunno what to try.

290
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,707
- You can speak French.

291
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,342
- Two minutes, OK?

292
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,670
Two minutes.

293
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,470
- Cool.

294
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,119
- "Spirit moment.

295
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:37,428
"Press record and think

00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,138
OK.

Record.

301

Spirit... moment.

302
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,554
Ten positive things.

303
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,862
Number one...

304
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,166
The sun.

305
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,449

306
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,915

307
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,450
(phone ringing)
Jesus Christ!

308
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,959
- I can answer!

309
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,257
- Yes. Yes, that's right.

310
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,499
Just a second, please.

311
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,403
They took the pad!
- The pad...?

312
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,436
- The reservation pad.

313
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,801
Why would anyone steal
a fucking reservation pad?

314
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,844
Hello, yes...

315
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,376
Yes, I'm sorry.

316
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,681
Is it for today? OK.

317
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,549
What's the address?

318
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,013
Your name?

319
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,187
Give me his name then.

320
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,031
You can give me a borrowed name,
for discretion.

321
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,096
I don't know.

322
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,896
Let's say... Robert?

323
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,901
- Mike.

324
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,334
- There's Mike too.

325
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,874
Mike or Robert.
They're fine names.

326
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,212
Great, Mike. He'll be thrilled.

327
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,242
What does Mike like?

328
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,682
We have a special this month,
for the holidays.

329
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,122
We call it "the kit."

330
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,248
The girl has a kit of accessories
and different outfits.

331
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,486
There are over 50 possible combinations,

332
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:54,120
so you can personalize your product.
Interested?

333
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,237
OK, perfect. I have--

334
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,634
- Not Stef!
- The charming Stéphanie.

335
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:02,933
- Stef's not--

336
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,407
- The charming Stéphanie
is very well liked.

337
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,674
What time?
- I'll be back.

338
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,747
- Have you ever cancelled?

339
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,750
- Come in.

340
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,524
- Have you ever called back
to cancel?

341
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,058
- I don't understand.

342
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,960
- A girl's coming at 1.

343
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,464
I swear.
- You did it?

344
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,769
- Yes.

345
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,205
Well, no.

346
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,603
I thought I'd made up my mind,
but I'm not sure.

347
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,540
- Second thoughts?
- Yes.

348
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,609
Thinking it over, I'm not...

349
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,683
I wanted to...
I wanted to ask you...

350
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,547
y'know, what exactly happens?

351
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,187
What happened the times you called?

352
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,848
- What?
- The times you called?

353
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,920
- I've never called.

354
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,127
- You never called?
- No. You thought I had?

355
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,765
- You asked me the number.

356
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,560
- Yes, but...
- You asked me.

357
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,134
several times.
You said,

358
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,533
"Call them, it'll do you good."

359
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,535
You said, "It's a sign,
follow the sign."

360
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,303
The flyer I found under the sofa
was a sign.

361
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,308
- Yeah, so?

362
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,073
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You never asked.

363
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,609
To me it was clear.

364
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,910
I don't sleep with prostitutes.

365
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,265
- Who's she?

366
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,540
- She's a girl I met.

367
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,802
- Really?

368
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,237
- Mélanie.

369
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,473
- I didn't know.

370
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,283
Bravo.

371
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,053
- Thanks.

372
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,056
- You should introduce us.

373
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,458
- Yeah.
- We could all go out.

374
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,757
Us two and you two.
Sophie'd like that.

375
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:08,763
- Of course.

376
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,597
- Or are you still at the stage
when you like to be alone?

377
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,238
- Yes. I'm expecting her.
- Now?

378
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,532
- Tonight.

379
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,836
- We could drop by.

380
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,842
After our cocktail party.
It'd be fun. Around 9.

381
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,676
- Yes.

382
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,212
- What do you think?

383
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,614
- If you want.
- A quick visit.

384
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,752
- Perfect.

385
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,656
- You OK?

386
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,296
- What about the escort?

387
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,137
- I don't know.

388
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,340
- Stéphanie?

389
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,638
Stef?

390
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,482
Shit!

391
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,918
What's going on?

392
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,817
- Did you find my letter?
- What?

393
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,884
- I'm going.

394
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,552
- Where were you?
I called here, your cell.

395
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,993
- I didn't answer, sorry.
- Where you going?

396
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,530
- Home.
I'm working this afternoon.

397
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,327
- Ron called?
- Yeah.

398
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,827
- You answer for him, but not me?

399
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,371
- Please stop asking
so many questions.

400
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,982
- You shouldn't go to work today.

401
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,739
- None of your business.

402
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,750
- The agency's a mess.
- It's OK.

403
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,287
- You told me about a black hole.
- Stop it, Max. Stop it.

404
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,923
- You said yourself,
it could come back.

405
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,424
- Go away.

406
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,152
I don't know what you want.

407
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,361
I want you to leave me alone.

408
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,296
- I want to help you.
- Stop it!

409
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,936
- I think you're someone...
someone...

410
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,432
... who needs help.

411
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,008
- Screw you!

412
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,861
(singing softly in Chinese)

413
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,722
(singing)

414
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,826
- Hello. I'm a bit late.

415
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,428
I'm expected.

416
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,571
- The reservation's in what name?

417
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,432
- Goodness, I'm not sure.

418
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,237
Anything for Regency?

419
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,373
The Regency Agency?

420
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,976
- They haven't arrived yet.

421
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,186
(knocking)

422
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,972
- Hello.

423
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,631
Stéphanie?

424
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:20,969
- Yes.

425
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,171
- Stéphanie.

426
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,612
- Mike?

427
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,376
- Pardon?

428
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,986
- Are you Mike?

429
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,519
- No, Olivier.

430
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,782
- OK.

431
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,186
Is Mike here?
- No.

432
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,793
I mean, I'm Mike.

433
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,255
Actually, Mike doesn't exist.
It was me who called.

434
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,898
- OK. You're Mike.

435
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,232
- No. Well, yes, I guess, in a way.

436
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,938
- I understand.

437
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,306
- Are you OK? I mean, come in.

438
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,916
Sit down. It's alright, your being late.
What's an hour?

439
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,517
Here's your money.
I was told I should pay first.

440
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,417
Give me your coat.

441
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,921
- I'll go to the john.
- Sure.

442
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,019
If you could... It's down there.

443
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,392
If you could take off...

444
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,725
Your boots, maybe.

445
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,165
- How's it going?
- Fine.

446
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,736
It's just,
Marie brought along this oil.

447
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:33,316
They all want to put some on,
so it might stain the sofa a bit.

448
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:34,815
Careful with that.

449
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,448
- Call Stef.

450
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,055
I told her about the client,
but not the book.

451
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:43,284
So tell her to come by after.
I'm going home to get my suit.

452
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,452
I'll be back soon.

453
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,688
- OK.

454
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,930
Alright, girls, shall we start?

455
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,765
- Is everything OK, Stéphanie?

456
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,509
Can I get you
a glass of white wine?

457
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,775
- That's it...

458
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,351
I've been with my boyfriend 5 years.

459
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,422
I have a stable employment,
a normal job.

460
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,081
I don't know if it's you I told,

461
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,626
but I only work part-time.

462
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,263
I work in travel.

463
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,793
It was as a tourist guide

464
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,231
that I got into this line,

465
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,398
if you follow.

466
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,175
- Yes, it's me you spoke to.

467
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,772
- Yes, I remember your voice
very well.

468
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,343
I hesitated before calling you, but...

469
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:47,480
... finally I told myself
it was time to change.

470
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,220
- To get serious.

471
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,495
- Absolutely, yes.

472
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,058
To get serious.
- Mm...

473
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,463
- And I assume that...

474
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,531
... what I told you
about my current employer

475
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,436
was useful to you.

476
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,349
From what I saw earlier...

477
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,645
... it was useful, right?

478
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,221
- Yes, absolutely.

479
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,961
- About his address...

480
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,302
... his home address.

481
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,237
I hope you won't need to use it.

482
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,550
Do you think you'll need to use it?

483
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,447
- I wouldn't think so.

484
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,076
(door unlocking)

485
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,352
- I'll take that wine.

486
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,955
- Yes, sure, it's on the counter.

487
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,458
Excuse me. I thought
since it was taking so long,

488
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,224
I thought you were getting ready.

489
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,769
See, I asked for the kit.
They offered it to me.

490
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,529
I said yes. I thought

491
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,799
you were putting on
the kit in question.

492
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,771
So I thought that meant
I should go ahead

493
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,142
and get into my kit too, but...

494
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,610
Sorry, I'm not an expert
on prostitution.

495
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,550
- Prostitution?

496
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,988
- It's not a bad little wine.

497
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,688
Not bad at all.

498
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,086
- I don't do the kit.

499
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,951
- You don't?
- No.

500
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,228
- Plus I'm very versatile.

501
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,162
I do a bit of everything.
I have no taboos.

502
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,127
- Excellent.

503
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,001
That's really excellent.

504
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,408
- Do we wait for Cheech?
- Cheech?

505
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,441
No, Cheech isn't coming.

506
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:33,877
- He's not?

507
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,650
I thought the point was to meet me,
like an audition.

508
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,888
- The audition will be tonight.

509
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:44,886
- I see.

510
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,327
- Does the Grand suit you?

511
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,926
- The hotel?

512
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,363
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,303
We're regulars there.

514
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,667
The suite's already reserved.
You'll see,

515
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,009
it's discreet, private,

516
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,247
and comfortable.

517
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,707
- With Sophie,
it's not that I don't try.

518
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,352
I do try, but...

519
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:13,052
Desire is so mysterious.

520
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,691
It's a mystery.

521
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,354
Not so long ago, I was happy

522
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,996
just being with her.

523
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,425
Just that.

524
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,696
She says work drains her sexually,
but I don't buy it.

525
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,701
Like that négligé I told you about.

526
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,413
In the display it was
the most erotic thing I'd ever seen.

527
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,017
The salesgirl wrapping up
the bit of fabric...

528
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,549
Wow.

529
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,816
How could something so exciting
become so banal

530
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:51,223
once she put it on? It's a mystery.
The same sexy outfit!

531
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,695
A hot outfit should be even sexier
on a girl, no?

532
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,331
Shouldn't it?

533
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,842
- I'm not an expert on sexiness.

534
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:07,935
- You're not?

535
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,306
- No.

536
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,921
Maybe we should start.

537
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,288
- God, yes,
we'll even have to hurry up.

538
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,161
- I have to pee.

539
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,923
- Again?

540
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,395
Sure, fine.

541
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,090
Go ahead, no problem.

542
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,299
- You can undress.

543
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,634
- Fine. Thanks. But...

544
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,872
Thanks.

545
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,476
- You'll thank me after.

546
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,178
- No, thanks for just now.

547
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,614
It was nice that you--
- I wasn't listening.

548
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,752
Being here isn't listening.

549
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,286
And listening isn't being here.

550
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,488
I was thinking I can't wait to leave.

551
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,910
- I'm going to make it
through the day!

552
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,028
(female voice):
Ride with the Whale, Volume l.

553
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,629
It is time for a very special journey.

554
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,240
Take a deep breath.

555
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,441
Relax... join the sea.

556
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,480
And ride with the whale.

557
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,817
- Ride with the whale.

558
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,944
(whale song)

559
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,757
Ride with the whale.

560
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,884
Ride with the whale.

561
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,093
- Are you OK, Stéphanie?

562
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,367
Anyway, I'm ready now.

563
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,874
Ready as I'll ever be.

564
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,641
(water running)

565
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,447
I'm not so sure about a bath...

566
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,085
I'm not sure we even have time.

567
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,419
Sophie's coming to get me at 4.

568
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,093
We have a South American
cocktail party tonight.

569
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,531
So that doesn't leave
a whole lot of time.

570
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,798
Not much time at all.

571
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,269
In fact...

572
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,710
What the fuck?

573
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,383
- I won't be long.

574
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,792
- Oh... OK.

575
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,234
(water running)

576
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,909
Stéphanie!

577
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,084
Turn off the tap, it's flooding!

578
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,681
Stéphanie, open the door!

579
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,749
Open the door!
Open the door now!

580
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,983
I want you to leave!

581
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,890
Open the door!

582
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,421
I want you to leave! Open up!

583
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,341
- It's alright.

584
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,109
I think it's alright.

585
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,750
It's alright.

586
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,819
- Get out!

587
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,529
- Let's go, I'm ready now.
- Get out!

588
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,664
- I don't do the kit.

589
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,234
Can I have some more wine?
- You're bleeding!

590
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,874
- Think I'll sit down.

591
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,273
- No, don't sit down!

592
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,606
Don't! Not on the sofa!
- I'll sit down.

593
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,112
- Don't sit down. Just go.

594
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,443
Come on, it's time for you to go.

595
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,342
- Do you have a towel?

596
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,183
- I have Scott Towels,
but you have to go. Here...

597
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,688
Take these.

598
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,383
You can have these.
I'll give them to you.

599
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,960
Now leave.
Here, take your money too.

600
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,428
In an envelope, it won't get bloody.

601
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,362
Let's go. I added a good tip.

602
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,298
It was great.
(phone ringing)

603
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,304
Wipe yourself off.
That's Sophie, she's downstairs!

604
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,639
- Not answering?

605
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,115
- No, no, no!
Don't touch that! Leave it alone!

606
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:24,414
Come on, get your clothes
from the bathroom.

607
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,398
- I'll take your wine.

608
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,431
I don't do the kit.

609
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,898
I'm gonna sit down.

610
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,798
- Shit, my sofa!

611
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,495
Get up!

612
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,402
- Let's go, I'm ready.

613
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,900
(phone ringing)

614
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,878
I want you out of here
in two minutes, OK?!

615
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,288
Two minutes.
I'm counting on you.

616
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,355
Get dressed and leave!

617
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,456
OK?

618
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,992
I'm counting on you.
Get dressed and leave!

619
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,642
Sorry. Excuse me, sir.

620
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:26,942
- No problem.

621
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:36,885
- Sorry.

622
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:41,258
- I've been running all day
and I'm on time!

623
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,262
You lay around and you're late!

624
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,765
Can you explain the logic of that?!

625
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,062
- No.

626
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,764
- Are you alright?

627
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,102
- Yes.

628
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,438
- You're out of breath.
- Me? No.

629
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,102
- You're pale.
- No.

630
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,771
- Got your swimsuit?
- No.

631
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:02,578
- You don't swim, you don't dance.
What do you do?

632
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,350
- I need a drugstore.

633
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,616
- I dunno, it might be bad.

634
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,713
- My shoes!

635
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,052
- Pardon?

636
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,787
- I forgot to bring my shoes,
my dress shoes.

637
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,132
I'll have to go back for them, shit!

638
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,468
- I see.

639
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,565
- Mmm...

640
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,870
Delicious!

641
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,216
You understand...

642
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,113
... I hate doing this
to good customers.

643
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,019
- I understand.

644
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,315
- But it is my third visit.

645
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,818
- I understand.

646
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:53,190
- And today I need funds
to pay a colleague, so...

647
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,627
- Of course.

648
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,933
- Got any money?
- No.

649
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,294
- You sure?

650
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:04,765
- I can check.

651
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,467
- Yes, if you don't mind,
please check.

652
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,852
- You know,
I convinced a friend to call you.

653
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,721
- Very kind.

654
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,817
- It was good publicity.

655
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,192
- Thanks.

656
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,106
- That's all I have just now.

657
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,882
- One of my girls
said you were depressed.

658
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,186
- Pardon?

659
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,881
- If you like,
I can recommend a good book.

660
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,185
"Learn how to smile again."

661
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,260
It's one of the steps.

662
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,261
A key step.

663
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:06,994
- "Learn how..."

664
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,230
- "Learn how to smile again."

665
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,570
Learn how to smile again.

666
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,140
- That's all I have right now.

667
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,742
- When's the last time you smiled?

668
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,121
- The last time I smiled?
I dunno.

669
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,919
- Try to remember.

670
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,118
- I can't say.

671
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,558
- Would you be able
to smile right now?

672
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,561
- Now?
- Would you be able to smile?

673
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,263
- Right now?
- Would you?

674
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,232
- I dunno.

675
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,532
- Try.

676
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,032
Go on, try.

677
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,146
Not easy, huh?
- My jaw hurts.

678
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,853
- It's not easy.

679
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,853
It's not easy to smile.

680
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:07,124
"Learn how to smile again."

681
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,600
A key step.

682
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,609
The rest in a week.

683
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,746
Don't make me come back.

684
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,299
Max, it's me.

685
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,774
You were leaving?

686
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,413
Listen to me. Go to my desk.

687
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,311
Listen, in my desk, second drawer.

688
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,011
The cashbox, there's a gun inside.
Get it.

689
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,287
16 - 12 - 69.

690
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,692
- 16 - 12 - 69, OK!

691
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,386
(female voice): Relax.

692
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,279
Ride with the whale.

693
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,407
Are you enjoying your ride?

694
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,943
Are you relaxed by now?

695
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,743
- I am very relaxed.

696
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,498
- That a prescription?

697
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,401
- It's not for me.
- Is this the line?

698
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,734
- Uh, yes.

699
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,207
- I didn't see the photo counter.

700
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,108
- It must be up front.
- I didn't see it.

701
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,839
- I don't know.

702
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,086
- It's not for you?

703
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,384
- Pardon?
- The prescription?

704
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:24,652
- No.

705
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,222
- Someone you know?

706
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,358
- Yes.

707
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,801
Xanadril. Heard of it?
- No. Xana--

708
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,067
- Xanadril. It's a...

709
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,108
tricyclic antidepressant.

710
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,746
- Tricyclic?
- Yes.

711
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,345
- For depression?
- Yes.

712
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,285
- Does it work?

713
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,483
- I guess.

714
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,916
- Is the person better?

715
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,693
- Much better.

716
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,604
A letter?

717
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,339
- Yeah.
- Sir?

718
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,108
- Good news, I hope.

719
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,291
- Do you offer
one-hour film development?

720
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,691
Takes an hour?

721
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,059
- It's not here, it's in front.

722
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,860
- It is?
- Yes.

723
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,147
- Sir?

724
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,219
- I also need...

725
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,788
you know, something tricyclic.

726
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,395
I don't know the exact name.
It's called tricyclic.

727
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,794
The man ahead of me had a paper.

728
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,662
- A prescription?

729
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,598
- That's it, a prescription.

730
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,962
- May I see your prescription?

731
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:51,799
- Pardon?

732
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,107
- Your prescription?

733
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,740
- I don't have one.
The other man did.

734
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,973
- Then I can't help you, sir.

735
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,809
- You can't?
- No.

736
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,751
Photos are in front.

737
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,219
- But it's very important.
- In front.

738
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,381
Would you let the lady by?

739
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,990
I understand what you said.

740
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,528
- Look, I'll take them over.

741
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,362
But you need--
- I have a letter.

742
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,297
Not a prescription, but...

743
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,437
it's on paper
and it means something.

744
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,506
I mean, I know you need
a prescription. I understand.

745
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,574
But any doctor who saw this letter

746
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,611
would say it's like a prescription.

747
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,580
- Sir, other people are waiting.

748
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:38,687
- Maybe you should
expand your definition

749
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,083
of a prescription.

750
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,357
- Sir...

751
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,857
- "I'm not leaving now,

752
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,222
I left long ago."
- Sir, please.

753
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,281
- Look, I have no choice.

754
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,483
I'm not a bad person.

755
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,059
But I need you to give me
those tricyclics.

756
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,257
Give me all the tricyclics you have.

757
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,961
- What?
- Tricylics.

758
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,534
- I don't understand.

759
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,301
- We're here too.
- I won't be long, madame.

760
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,100
I don't know the name.

761
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,546
- It's my first day.

762
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,081
- What?
- Please go away.

763
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,283
- Is anything wrong, Colette?

764
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,453
- No, everything's fine.

765
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,559
- Are you satisfied, sir?

766
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,321
- Yes, absolutely.

767
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,263
- Alright.

768
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,798
- It's very good.

769
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:01,368
The service is very courteous.

770
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,332
- Do you have his prescription?

771
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,099
- Yes, sure.

772
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,571
- May I see it?

773
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,677
- No--
- Here.

774
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,557
- Is this a joke?

775
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,694
Is this some kind of joke?

776
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,696
- It's no joke.

777
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,267
- No, it's not a joke!
(gunshot)

778
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,704
- Whoa! Whoa!

779
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,673
Stay calm, please! Stay calm!

780
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,077
(female voice): You are calm.

781
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,718
You've made one step

782
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,877
toward serenity.

783
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,482
(alarm beeping)

784
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,285
- Don't tell me, shit!

785
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,136
Spirit moment.

786
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,734
I'm learning to be grateful...

787
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,235
... for all life's gifts.

788
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,171
The air that...

789
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,507
The air we breathe.

790
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,818
We forget it too often.

791
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,454
(phone ringing)
Goddammit!

792
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,215
Hello.

793
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,854
- Ron, have you heard from Stéphanie?!

794
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:35,156
You have to find her!
Stéphanie's very tired!

795
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,492
What?

796
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:39,562
The photos?

797
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,169
Yeah, I went.

798
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,196
Yeah, fine. Just fine.

799
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,307
There's just a hitch.

800
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,004
A mini-hitch.

801
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,371
I don't think I can get them.

802
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,875
The photos.

803
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,314
I'm not sure
they'll give them to me.

804
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:58,079
The mini-hitch is... Cheech!

805
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,380
- Cheech?!

806
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,046
- Yeah, Cheech.
- Fuck!

807
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,396
- Two of his guys.
I dunno, guys who work for him.

808
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:12,330
They said they'd whack me
if I picked up the photos!

809
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,595
They said, "We'll whack you.

810
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,295
"Conferences are our turf."

811
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,770
- I don't care
about your silly worries.

812
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,670
Too late.
The shit's hit the fan!

813
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,970
I need the photos at 7!

814
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:27,614
We fuck for less, we fuck for less!
Really!

815
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,719
Don't discretion and class
count anymore?

816
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:34,323
Work well done, personalized service,
who cares?

817
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,017
78% repeat call rate! 78%!

818
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,493
Nobody gives a damn. So what?

819
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,598
I won't be intimidated, dammit!

820
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,218
Fuck!!

821
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,242
- What the fuck?!

822
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,784
- I do what I can in life.

823
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,361
I get up, I go to work.

824
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,094
I deserve it.

825
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,998
I think I deserve the good things...

826
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,037
... in life.

827
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,641
I cry.

828
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,346
I get up in the morning
and cry like a baby.

829
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,483
"Stop, why are you crying?"

830
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,718
I can't say, but I cry.

831
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,024
If I listened to myself...

832
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,321
... I'd kill myself.

833
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,860
But I have no time...

834
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,472
... to kill myself.

835
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:22,481
(lively Latin music)

836
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,833
- You stay till the end.

837
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,106
- I don't know anyone.

838
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,542
- Exactly, you need to get out more.

839
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,182
Olivier, it's a party, smile.

840
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,753
- I feel like it's forced.

841
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:56,280
I'll stay for your category,
and then we'll see.

842
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,426
- Hello!

843
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,823
How's it going?

844
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,764
You're not dancing?

845
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,492
- We just got here.

846
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,067
- Give me your coats.

847
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,499
- Thank you!

848
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,371
- Olivier, give me your coat.
- No, no, no.

849
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,940
- Olivier?

850
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,235
- I'll hold on to it for now.

851
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,004
- What's with you?

852
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,614
- I'll hold on to my coat for now.

853
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:21,681
Excuse me, miss.

854
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,516
Could I have a glass of water?

855
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,321
- Can I borrow him?
- He's all yours.

856
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,893
(music slowing)

857
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,840
- Hello?

858
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,776
Are you home?

859
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,712
(knocking)

860
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,510
Hello?

861
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,768
- The winner of tonight's
first Tropical Sun award is...

862
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,234
... Sophie Bilodeau!

863
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,899
- Bravo!

864
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,321
- Thanks!

865
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,055
Thanks a lot!

866
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:42,227
It's always great to receive
a trophy like this.

867
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,730
Especially since
I've worked very hard this year

868
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:47,899
to satisfy my clients.

869
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,129
I think that...

870
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:55,801
the key to success,
the only key, is hard work.

871
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,213
You have to work,

872
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,747
put in the time, keep at it.

873
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,017
If you think you can make do

874
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,813
with three or four Scott Towels...

875
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:07,945
(laughter)

876
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,649
- I'm thrilled for her!

877
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,590
- I'd also like to thank Suzanne

878
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,493
and her amazing team in Personnel

879
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,462
for tonight's wonderful party.

880
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,601
The decorations,

881
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,203
the Jacuzzi,

882
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,430
the water overflowing, you fuck!

883
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,940
It's great.

884
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,211
We can't wait till next year!

885
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,305
Before I go,

886
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,916
I'd like...

887
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:40,215
I'd like to thank Olivier...

888
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,016
my partner,
who's here tonight.

889
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,088
Olivier...

890
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,053
if she dies it's your fault!

891
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,991
Thank you!

892
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,171
(silence)

893
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,372
(knocking)

894
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,245
- Not bad, huh?

895
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,429
- You're not dancing?

896
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:36,598
- No.

897
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,427
- Me neither.

898
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,633
- Olivier, will you please--

899
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,741
- Well, well!

900
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,776
I don't believe it!
(laughing)

901
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:52,643
We met this morning.

902
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,449
- You did?

903
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,412
- Of course. You...

904
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,018
You were...

905
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,553
Fort Lauderdale, right?

906
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,157
- Right, absolutely.

907
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,759
Thanks for the excellent service.

908
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,722
Do you know her?
- Barely.

909
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,422
- Courteous, attentive...

910
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,902
Enterprising too, right?

911
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,330
As for trophies,

912
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:20,036
I'd have given you one too!

913
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,774
A woman of hidden talents.

914
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,572
- I'll go lie on a deck chair.

915
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:29,078
- Tell me something, Miss Jennifer...

916
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:34,286
... in Fort Lauderdale,
is sodomy de rigueur?

917
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,156
Jennifer?

918
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,832
Jennifer? Jennifer?
Hey, hey.

919
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,796
I didn't plan to come.

920
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,806
A colleague of my wife invited me.

921
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,807
Are you OK?
- Just fine.

922
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,345
- Great party, huh?

923
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:03,949
Your real name's Sophie, right?

924
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,455
Hey, hey.

925
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,895
What's wrong?
Where are you running to, doll?

926
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:24,929
Why are you leaving like this?

927
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,268
Do you want to...

928
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,468
go to Fort Lauderdale with me?

929
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:35,346
How bout a little Fort Lauderdale
in the snow?

930
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,248
- Ahhhhh!

931
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:52,930
(groaning)

932
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,997
- It's twenty to eight!
- Sorry.

933
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,898
- Go on, you drive.
- What?

934
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,773
Want me to come?
- Hurry up!

935
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,416
Move it!

936
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,686
- What?
- Get going!

937
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,288
Floor it, fuck!

938
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,370
And the pictures?

939
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,731
The pictures, Max!
- They're great.

940
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:07,876
- Good.

941
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,075
Those guys cause problems?

942
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,271
- Those guys?
- Cheech's guys.

943
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,917
- I didn't see them.
- They didn't show?

944
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,210
- No.

945
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,582
- What were they like?

946
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,020
- Cheech's guys?
I didn't see them.

947
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,422
- When you saw them before.

948
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,084
- I didn't see them.

949
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,856
- Not when you got the film,
when you left it!

950
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,261
You called me.
- Right, I saw them!

951
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,994
- Was one guy fat?
- I think so.

952
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,933
The other was skinnier,
with a moustache, I think.

953
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:41,833
Did Stéphanie call?
- No.

954
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,905
- I dropped by her place,
she isn't answering her cell.

955
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,482
I'm really worried.

956
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,777
- Hold these a sec.

957
01:14:58,961 --> 01:14:59,950
OK.

958
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,800
Give it to me.

959
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,496
The photos?
- I have them.

960
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,160
Well, give 'em to me!

961
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,766
- Here.
- Perfect.

962
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,440
Good.

963
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,064
- I'll make it through the day.

964
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,567
I'll make it through the day.
(sniffling)

965
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,831
I'll make it through the day.

966
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,235
I'll make it... through the day.

967
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:11,631
- Stop here.

968
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,642
We'll act real calm and cool,
like professionals.

969
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,214
Are we professionals or not?

970
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:29,850
- We're professionals.

971
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,543
- If you see Cheech's guys, tell me.
- Here?

972
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:35,189
- What do you think?
The shit hit the fan.

973
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,619
- Your briefcase...

974
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:41,930
- What?

975
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,225
- Want me to carry it?

976
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,297
I'm your assistant.
It looks more professional.

977
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:50,805
- Alright.

978
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:55,902
Good thinking.

979
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,020
What are you doing?
- Huh?

980
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,153
What are you up to?

981
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:20,962
I'll take it.

982
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,569
Keep your eyes peeled.

983
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:15,353
I want you to put on your best smile
and shut up.

984
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,029
Here we go.

985
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:39,170
If you recognize anyone, tell me.

986
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,473
- Like Cheech's guys?

987
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,583
Ron?

988
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,222
Is that Gaétan?

989
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,295
Wanna go?

990
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,171
Ron...

991
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,139
- Wait here a sec.

992
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,560
- What are we doing?

993
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,554
- You can close the door.

994
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:55,886
- Alright.

995
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:03,390
I'm a bit early, I think.

996
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,630
- No problem.

997
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,925
Cheech is here.

998
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,896
- He is?

999
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,267
- In the next room.

1000
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,772
He's real eager to meet you.

1001
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:18,378
- Glad to hear it.

1002
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:21,647
Could you...

1003
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,445
Could you give me just two minutes?

1004
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,619
To freshen up.

1005
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,552
The day has been...

1006
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,247
- Trying?

1007
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,086
- Quite.

1008
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:37,261
- No problem,
take all the time in the world.

1009
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,093
- Thank you.

1010
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:14,333
- I don't get it.
- Neither do l.

1011
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,504
Knock, see who answers.

1012
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,038
Tell me if you recognize anyone.

1013
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,706
- I don't get it.
- Just do it.

1014
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:41,853
- I'm ready.

1015
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,932
Ready and waiting.

1016
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,017
Cheech isn't here?

1017
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,383
- Cheech?

1018
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,355
- Yes.
- In half an hour.

1019
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,729
He'll be out in half an hour.

1020
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:18,056
Long enough...

1021
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,596
- Long enough for what?

1022
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,236
- To test your skills.

1023
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,699
- Could I speak to him, please?

1024
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,466
- You want to speak to Cheech?

1025
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:29,769
- Yes, please.

1026
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,472
- After. You can speak to him after.

1027
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:36,550
- I'd like to speak to him now.

1028
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:39,247
- I don't think that'll be possible.

1029
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,088
You have to be patient,

1030
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:43,520
sweetheart.

1031
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:58,599
He's not here?

1032
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,099
Cheech isn't here?

1033
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:02,767
I see.

1034
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:04,807
He's gone.

1035
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,477
Cheech is gone.

1036
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,217
- Where is he?

1037
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,225
Where is he?!

1038
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:21,186
Where is he?!

1039
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,191
- Jenny?

1040
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,529
Hello.

1041
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,227
- By what right...?

1042
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,906
Beat it. It's none of your business.

1043
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,141
I'm with a client. He's a client.

1044
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,083
- Raymond Palucci.

1045
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,622
You may not know me,
but I know you.

1046
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,618
- I know you very well.

1047
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,055
- He's dead.

1048
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:58,296
Cheech is dead.

1049
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,333
It's so sad.

1050
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,535
Prostate cancer.

1051
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,669
Four of us at the funeral.

1052
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,544
The agency closed three weeks ago.

1053
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,707
$187,000 in the hole.

1054
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:17,644
We've got an office suite
if you're interested.

1055
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,253
Not marble, but a good imitation.

1056
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,093
- It's not what you think.

1057
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:29,594
- That depends.

1058
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:32,460
What do you think I think?

1059
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,066
- I just wanted to meet him.

1060
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,670
Cheech.

1061
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,030
I didn't know.

1062
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,073
I didn't know anything.

1063
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:46,337
Did you trash his office?

1064
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:47,415
- No.

1065
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,849
But we'd have loved to.

1066
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,453
- The Regency's closed?

1067
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:59,582
- 27 years of loyal service
down the drain.

1068
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,090
- I'm sorry.

1069
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,362
What's wrong?

1070
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,302
Want me to go tell Gaétan?

1071
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:15,736
He's waiting.

1072
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,571
- One's fat,
one has a moustache.

1073
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,440
- What?

1074
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:22,549
- Cheech's men. One's fat,
one has a moustache?

1075
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,150
- Did I say that?

1076
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,844
- Don't you remember?
- No.

1077
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:29,613
- They knew about the book.

1078
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,258
- I said...

1079
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:34,224
- What?
- Yeah, the guys knew.

1080
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:38,063
They said, "The conference is ours."

1081
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,633
You said that.
- I don't remember.

1082
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:43,464
- You said Cheech's guys--
- I thought that--

1083
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:44,730
- OK.

1084
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,768
I want you to explain something.

1085
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:51,309
How can two guys work for a dead man?

1086
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,940
How can two guys
speak for a dead man?

1087
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,417
How can a dead man steal a book?!

1088
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,416
- You told me it was Cheech!

1089
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:00,952
I don't know Cheech!

1090
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:04,421
All I heard was Cheech, Cheech, Cheech.
So I thought...

1091
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,651
Maybe they weren't Cheech's men.

1092
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,092
- Not his men?
- Maybe not.

1093
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,459
- Why'd you lie?
- I didn't lie.

1094
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:12,895
- Why'd you lie?

1095
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:16,230
- Stop. You should ask Jenny that!
- Why'd you lie?!

1096
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:20,873
- Your staff seems to be
giving you trouble.

1097
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,634
(chuckling)

1098
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:42,188
- Max...

1099
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:44,788
I want an answer.

1100
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,729
I want the truth.

1101
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,996
Did you steal the book?

1102
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,069
- So you think I did it?

1103
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,768
I refuse. I refuse to answer, Ron.

1104
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,107
- Answer me!

1105
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:03,512
- Stop it, I have a gun too.

1106
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:05,409
- You stole the book!

1107
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,845
- I have a gun.

1108
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,552
- You stole my book!

1109
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,192
- Ron...

1110
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:19,691
I'll just go, OK?

1111
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:24,529
- I'm gonna shoot.

1112
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,731
I swear I'm gonna shoot.

1113
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,569
- I just want to leave.

1114
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:33,639
- Maxime...

1115
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,348
Maxime...

1116
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,220
I'm so unhappy.

1117
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,558
(alarm beeping)

1118
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:52,362
- Fuck.

1119
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:48,088
- Ron?

1120
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,550
- I'm still going to sleep
with you, right?

1121
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:27,526
- Could you read me my book, please?

1122
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,229
The book in my briefcase.

1123
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:34,394
Please.

1124
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:49,344
- Shall I start now?

1125
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,381
"Lesson one."

1126
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:01,361
"ln this first lesson,

1127
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:04,794
"you will have to visualize
different landscapes.

1128
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:10,070
"First landscape: a beach.

1129
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,174
"Picture that beach,

1130
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:18,574
"then picture yourself on the beach.

1131
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,771
"Close your eyes,

1132
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:23,041
relax and open..."

1133
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,081
Are you listening?

1134
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:34,659
Can you hear me?

1135
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:38,424
Hello?

1136
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,925
Hello?

1137
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:02,782
- Hello?

1138
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:04,554
Are you alright?

1139
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:08,295
- Not at all.

1140
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,757
- If it's 4, it's on the 4th floor, huh?

1141
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:27,559
- Yes.

1142
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:29,229
- Thanks.

1143
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:39,039
- Excuse me.

1144
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,710
- Can I help you?

1145
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,378
- No, I'm sorry.

1146
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:43,435
Stef?

1147
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:47,239
- Max?

1148
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:49,876
I killed myself.

1149
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:52,683
But I think I slept.

1150
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,151
I fell asleep.

1151
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:00,822
But I'm not home,
I think I'm somewhere else.

1152
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:02,959
I'm sorry.

1153
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:04,557
Look,

1154
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:06,695
I think I stopped bleeding.

1155
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:10,500
The Scott Towels are crusted on.

1156
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,070
I can't get them off.

1157
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,332
The guy told me to leave
but I couldn't.

1158
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:15,805
Can we go now?

1159
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:18,878
- I'm sorry about before.

1160
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,308
I could've given you
more Scott Towels.

1161
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:26,650
- Jenny?
- Sophie?

1162
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:28,846
Why're you here?
I can explain.

1163
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:32,550
- What happened, Stéphanie?
- You know her?

1164
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:33,955
- You live here, Jenny?

1165
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:57,745
- It's...

1166
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:00,519
It's Jennifer now, I think.

1167
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:21,736
(answering machine beeping)

1168
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:23,376
- Hello, Ron?

1169
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:24,670
It's Mom.

1170
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:27,208
Well...

1171
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:31,116
... we waited for you.

1172
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,082
But we got fed up.

1173
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:35,722
We'd hired someone
to make it special.

1174
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:38,886
So we left it all there.

1175
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:43,560
It's a professional decorating job.

1176
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:46,532
Where are you?

1177
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:52,729
Anyway, I'm calling
to wish you happy birthday.

1178
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:55,567
So...

1179
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:58,072
... happy birthday.

1180
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:00,036
OK?

1181
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:01,704
Bye.

1182
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:23,870
- Hi.

1183
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:25,829
Isn't Sophie with you?

1184
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:27,706
You said she'd come.

1185
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:29,970
Too bad, you missed Mélanie.

1186
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:34,103
We had a lovely evening.

1187
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:37,740
She said to say hi.

1188
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,886
You get my messages?

1189
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:44,656
It leaked a bit,

1190
01:37:44,825 --> 01:37:46,554
but not that much.

1191
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:49,062
Was there much damage?

1192
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:54,133
- Lots.

1193
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:11,437
Smile: Now. Ask your doctor.
