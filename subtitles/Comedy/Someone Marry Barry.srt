DESMOND: In every group of friends,
there's always one guy

2
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,290
who can best be described as
the inappropriate one.

3
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,759
I call that guy a Barry.

4
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:25,297
A Barry says and does things
other people only think.

5
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:29,134
And he does not know the word propriety.

6
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:30,969
There are all kinds of Barrys.

7
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:32,671
Old Barrys...

00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,842
Young Barrys...

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,513
And Barrys all over the world.

10
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:47,353
And that's me and my three
best friends when we were ten.

11
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:49,221
The one on the end, that's our Barry.

12
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:51,290
His name is Barry.

13
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,559
Growing up we thought
Barry was hilarious.

14
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,194
He played pranks on girls,

15
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:57,496
he infuriated teachers

16
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,031
and we loved him for it.

17
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,699
But, as we've gotten older,

18
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,235
and started having careers,
wives, and families,

19
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,303
he's become an embarrassment,

20
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:07,039
a detriment to our livelihoods
and reputations,

21
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,508
a social wrecking ball.

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,343
I believe friendship has no limits.

23
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:14,179
At least I did...

It was the best time of my life.

he proved to me what a great pal he was

00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,009
Yeah, you just gotta make it fun, man, you know?

165
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:18,944
It's not that hard.

166
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:20,178
Rafe, you know, you should go with him.

167
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,280
Yeah, I should.
I'll do that.

168
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:23,448
Uh, later.

169
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,050
Excuse me. I never got a chance
to thank you.

170
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:27,085
You run a lovely funeral, and--

171
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,787
you guys are giving me shit?

172
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,189
He's trying to get laid at his dad's funeral.

173
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,023
(PHONE VIBRATES)
Oh.

174
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,593
It's about the pitch.
I gotta take it.

175
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:37,062
Let's go.
My feet are killing me.

176
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:38,630
Okay, well, maybe just one moment longer,

177
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:39,431
you know, for Rafe,

178
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,899
because it's a big day for him.

179
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,034
Well, it's not like we can do anything for him.

180
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:44,603
His dad's already dead.

181
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,773
I just--I'll give you
another foot massage.

182
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,908
Whatevs.
Just find me when you're ready.

183
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,610
Alright, I love you--

184
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:59,284
oh.

185
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,889
You gotta break up with her, man.

186
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:04,589
What?

187
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:05,624
You gotta break up with her.

188
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:08,426
Are you on drugs?
No.

189
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,494
She walks all over you.

190
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,796
You--you--you--
you're just too blind to see it

191
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:12,297
because you're in shock that she talks to you,

192
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,665
let alone actually dates you.

193
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,634
Okay, n--news flash, uh,

194
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:16,735
Desmond and Rafe love her.

195
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:17,936
No they don't.
Yeah, they do.

196
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:18,804
No, they don't like her either.

197
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:19,771
They're just too afraid to tell you.

198
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:22,007
You deserve better than her.
She's mean.

199
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:23,608
She's manipulating you with that kiss.

200
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,677
Don't you see that?
I mean, yeah...

201
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,446
Any guy would gladly get up
to his nuts in her guts, okay?

202
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:29,614
That's not in dispute here, okay?

203
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:31,917
The problem is, she's a twunt.

204
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,151
It's a new term I'm using.

205
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:36,354
It's a combo of two words.
Guess which two.

206
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:37,622
Twitter?
Twat and cunt.

207
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:38,590
Ah!

208
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,791
Yeah.
Would you prefer cwat?

209
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:40,793
The terms are interchangeable.

210
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,528
She's not a twunt or a cwat.
She's both.

211
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,663
No.

212
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,831
She's the one.

213
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,766
She's the one.
(LAUGHING)

214
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,802
Oh, oh...

215
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:52,370
...oh...

216
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,105
I did it again, didn't I?
Yeah.

217
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:56,775
I'm kidding--I was kidding
about her being a twunt, man.

218
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,177
And about her looking like an eastern european porn star.

219
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,880
You didn't say anything about her looking
like an eastern european porn star.

220
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:03,615
Oh, not around you, no.

221
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:07,686
Okay, you look like...
A Western european porn star.

222
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:10,121
That's what I'm shooting for.

223
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,123
You're the cwunt now, dawg.

224
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:12,991
What?

225
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,359
Peace.

226
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,629
Cwunt's not even a word, Kurt!

227
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,999
Hey JT.

228
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,734
Let's get to those cookies, huh?

229
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,804
Oh, man, I feel so bad about what I did to Rafe.

230
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:26,538
It's the only thing I can think about.

231
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,709
Man, you work with a lot of pretty ladies, don't you?

232
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:32,711
Barry, look, I know you need
somebody to talk to right now,

233
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,412
but you can't just drop by my office

234
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:35,847
whenever you feel like it, okay?

235
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,515
Yeah, yeah, uh...
This is an important time.

236
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:38,750
We're in the last run of this pitch.

237
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,085
I'm up for creative director.

238
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:41,152
Are you listening?

239
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:42,420
Yeah.
- Well then--

240
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:43,722
oh, yeah.
Oh, hell yeah.

241
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,123
Who is the cutey--pie?

242
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,224
Yeah, that's the, uh,

243
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:47,759
that's the account planner I was telling you about.

244
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,760
That's her?

245
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:49,929
I'd hate being around that all day.

246
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,429
You'd get horny enough to go home and screw your wife

247
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:52,797
every once in a while.

248
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,934
Excuse me, but Rach and I have plenty of sex.

249
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,402
Oh, you do?
I--I didn't know that.

250
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:00,005
When was the last time you had intercourse?

251
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:03,174
Um...

252
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:05,010
My point exactly, Desmond.

253
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:07,379
Can I--can I be totally blunt
with you for a sec?

254
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,713
Can you not be blunt?
I don't think so.

255
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:11,449
I tried one time.
I had a migraine for three days.

256
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:13,618
Your marriage is not your only problem, okay?

257
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,786
Whatever happened to High School Desmond?

258
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,221
He was fun!

259
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:17,789
He, like, smoked pot every once in a while,

260
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,758
play the keys, hang out.

261
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,428
Now you're like this unrecognizable workaholic robot.

262
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,863
You won't even go out for lunch with me.

263
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,197
(SIGHS)
Fine.

264
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:27,599
We'll get lunch, okay?

265
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,934
Just let me finish these storyboards.

266
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:30,902
Oh, yeah, of course.
All about the work.

267
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:33,038
Because if we land this account, dude,

268
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,874
it'll be a total game--changer,
you know what I mean?

269
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:38,476
Barry?

270
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:42,847
(CHEWING LOUDLY)

271
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,483
Good morning.

272
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:50,055
Oh, come on.
Oh my God.

273
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,460
Oh.

274
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:57,963
That is a bad combo.
What's that?

275
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,465
Lox and sausages...
Loxages.

276
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,666
Yeah, that's a lot of meat.

277
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:02,801
Yeah, don't do it.
No.

278
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,602
How do you get any work done around here?

279
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,404
Half way to Bonerville.
(LAUGHS)

280
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,639
Where's Bonerville?

281
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,741
In my pants.
I'm fighting a semi right now.

282
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,476
A semi?
Semi hard on.

283
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:13,411
I'm half mast from looking at
all this talent around here.

284
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,914
Yeah, well advertising does attract

285
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,983
a lot of good--looking women,
so.

286
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:17,949
Do you work here?

287
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,818
Actually, I, uh, I own the agency.

288
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,852
What?!
Yeah.

289
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,821
Nice moves, man.

290
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:24,589
Oh, look at that.
It's boner o'clock.

291
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,291
Barry, what are you doing?
Bill, I'm sorry.

292
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,760
No, no, he--
he's cracking' me up.

293
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:29,694
Yeah.
What?

294
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,795
Yes. I was cracking him up.

295
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:32,263
Just telling him about how these women here

296
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,665
are giving me a woodrow Wilson.

297
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,134
Especially that cute brunette
account planner he pointed out.

298
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:38,870
So, uh, bill, the pitch is going great.

299
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,572
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, go ahead.

300
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,108
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,510
Looka--looka--looka,
there she is right there.

302
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,312
What are you--that one! Her!

303
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,980
Desmond was telling me that back when he used to

304
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:50,148
actually have sex with his wife,

305
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,017
he used to imagine her instead.

306
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,785
She was his closer, you know what I mean?

307
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,053
And bill, don't lie to me.

308
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:56,888
I know you've done the exact same thing.

309
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,889
I bet you I haven't.

310
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,057
Why, because you got Ed?

311
00:11:59,059 --> 00:11:59,958
No...

312
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,026
Because she's my daughter.

313
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:03,028
(COUGHING)

314
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:06,865
You made her?

315
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:07,665
Mm--Hmm.

316
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,900
Des, I'm--I'm--I'm sorry.

317
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,702
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

318
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:12,003
Seven years I put in here, Barry!

319
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,972
I know, listen, I--I--I don't
want you to sweat it, okay?

320
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,040
I'm gonna go back in and I'm gonna talk to your boss.

321
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,141
I'm gonna sort the whole thing out.

322
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:17,876
Don't!
You've done enough.

00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:57,582
MAN: Okay everyone, let's have a seat!

486
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,183
Hi.
Hi, I'm Leslie.

487
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:00,485
Hi, I'm Barry.
Hi.

488
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,053
(LAUGHING)
Hi.

489
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,254
Next!

490
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,589
Excuse me?
Next.

491
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:06,824
Barry, that's not how speed dating works.

492
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,226
I'm not feelin' it with her.

493
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:09,694
Are you kidding me?
Is he kidding me?

494
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,430
Listen, no matter what
you're feeling--

495
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:14,332
I'm not feeling anything.
That's the problem.

496
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:17,268
You're--you're beautiful,
we're just, you know,

497
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,569
we don't have... it.

498
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,937
You have to wait until they ring the bell.

499
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:23,241
The bell? I gotta talk to her
for the whole five minutes?

500
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:23,941
Yeah.

501
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:24,942
I'm sitting across from you.

502
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,577
I hear the words coming out of your mouth.

503
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,679
Look, if it's any consolation, he's always like this.

504
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:30,348
Yeah.
Nice shirt.

505
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,716
Do not--hey!

506
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:33,017
Do not make fun of my friends.

507
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,185
Fuck you!
- What? I--

508
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:36,754
what did I do?
I have to live with this!

509
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:38,523
(SIGHS)
Quite the mouth on her.

510
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,291
She's got some anger issues.

511
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:43,561
Barry, Barry. Listen to me
very carefully, all right?

512
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:46,364
When you meet these women, whatever comes to your mind...

513
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,065
Yeah?
...Say the opposite.

514
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,267
Got it.

515
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,068
Ah, yeah, backwards town.
Got it.

516
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,271
Yeah, yeah, that looks super real.

517
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:56,374
That shirt does not give off the impression

518
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,276
that you own several stray dogs.

519
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:58,810
(DINGS)

520
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:02,580
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit outta me.

521
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,482
I mean, uh...

522
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:08,820
You do not look like a cutter at all.

523
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:10,788
It's even harder than we thought.

524
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,291
It's time to bring out the big guns.

525
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,927
So, Mister Goker,

526
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,929
how does this exactly, um, work?

527
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:20,298
Well, the brides obviously don't come in the mail,

528
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,235
but, uh, they do come in a very small crate on a boat,

529
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:28,506
and we, of course, make sure to poke the holes in the box

530
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,308
so they can breathe.

531
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,810
Keep it human.

532
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:33,811
Oh...

533
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:38,182
I'm kidding!
(ALL LAUGHING)

534
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:39,484
We don't put 'em in a box!

535
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,352
What are we, monsters? No!

536
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:43,888
Just a very small, dangerous boat.

537
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:46,524
So I guess you're the man with all the bitches.

538
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:48,292
Okay... bitch?

539
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,628
Okay, I gotta ask you guys a question right now.

540
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,497
Do you, uh...

541
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,432
...do you guys hate women?

542
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,133
No, I love women.

543
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:58,002
Because I don't sell women

544
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:01,172
to men who hate women.

545
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,374
We do not sell bitches!

546
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,642
If we did,

547
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:08,312
it'd be called Goker's mail order bitches!

548
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:12,016
Not Goker's mail order brides!

549
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,384
Okay?

550
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:17,021
Uh, yeah, it was--it was just
a slang term, you know.

551
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,458
I'm just gonna put it out there.

552
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,495
Um, I'm not--I'm not--I'm not
actually looking,

553
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,396
is that okay?

554
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,330
Yeah.

555
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,665
I am not looking to marry anybody,

556
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,866
maybe just a girlfriend.

557
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:31,402
Unless she's like super,
super--duper cool,

558
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,169
then maybe.

559
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:35,540
Look, let me make something very clear here, all right?

560
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,742
Here at Goker's we are not just about business.

561
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,878
First and foremost, we are about love,

562
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,682
passion, romance, fucking, okay?

563
00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:47,818
Hot fuck action at a really reasonable price.

564
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,754
Hot flippin' and flappin'

565
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,523
smackin' ass cracks together, all right?

566
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:54,492
You ever--you ever slam
your ass crack

567
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,193
against a woman’s ass crack?

568
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,229
It rivals penetration, guys.

569
00:20:58,231 --> 00:20:59,497
I know you don't believe me,

570
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,599
but you're gonna be able to
try it with one of these women

571
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,035
and find me right.

572
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:08,239
So, just to be clear, here, on your old, uh, application.

573
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:11,409
Now your name is Barry Burke,
your favorite food is fried,

574
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,210
your favorite book is the novelization

575
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,079
of the bill Murray classic "stripes,"

576
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:16,514
it's one of my favorite books.

577
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,249
I did not care for the movie.

578
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,785
And you live off a settlement you got from the city

579
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:23,788
for walking into an exposed manhole.

580
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,525
Yeah, I actually, I removed that manhole cover myself

581
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,894
and then intentionally walked into said manhole,

582
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,129
but that is--that is neither
here nor there.

583
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:34,699
Oh, no, no, that is both here and there, my friend.

584
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,368
That is genius.
- I'm a geniu--

585
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,603
can you say that to them, please?

586
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:40,938
All right, Barry...

587
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,473
Prepare to meet...

588
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,309
The new love of your life...

589
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,377
Juanita.

590
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,245
Oh, wow.
Wow.

591
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:50,381
Oh my God, she's beautiful.

592
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:51,215
Schwing!

593
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:55,620
Her village has been completely ravaged by disease,

594
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:56,954
flood, famine, and rebels,

595
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:59,256
so she is very open to meeting

596
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:01,892
gentlemanly, successful american men.

597
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:05,096
Okay, well how about
a not--so--gentlemanly,

598
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:06,897
not--so--successful american man?

599
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:07,932
Are you kidding me?

600
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,267
She'd marry a raccoon with an extended asshole

601
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,303
if it got her out of her fucking village.

602
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,437
She's gonna love you, man.

603
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,538
(CHUCKLES)

604
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:19,977
So, how was your plane flight?

605
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,580
Oh, uh, da plane.

606
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:26,617
Da plane? Bzzzzzz.

607
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,652
Whoosh.

608
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:29,086
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

609
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:31,656
Muy bueno? Good.
Good, good, good.

610
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:32,523
That's good.

611
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:36,160
Probably not a lot of planes where you come from, huh?

612
00:22:36,162 --> 00:22:38,295
Is there not a lot of planes where you come from?

613
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:40,531
Cars either?
Probably not a lot of cars.

614
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,100
What do you--what do you use
to get around, a donkey?

615
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:44,402
Do you ride a donkey?

616
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:47,371
Yeah, a donkey's probably safer anyway, you know,

617
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,140
because I bet you like to throw back the Cervezas.

618
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:50,374
Mmm, Cervezas.

619
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:51,709
Cervezas, yeah.

620
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,377
Tequila!
(CHUCKLES)

621
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,512
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

622
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,616
I was hoping that we could make it a little physical

623
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:00,484
because I notice you carry a...

624
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:03,020
Formidable amount of junk in your trunk.

625
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:04,388
Junk in trunk?

626
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,623
Face it, guys, it's over.

627
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,525
We'll never find him a wife.

628
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:10,528
Let's go. I wanna meet up with
that funeral director, anyway.

629
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:17,168
So, you work at the parks department?

630
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,804
Yeah, I am director of events.

631
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:21,405
Wow.
Yeah.

632
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,907
What a cool job.
It is. It's really cool.

633
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,410
We do concerts and Shakespeare in the park.

634
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:27,745
I go to that.
You do?

635
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:28,846
I love that.

636
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:31,015
Oh. I--I have to work
a lot of weekend nights,

637
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:32,249
but it's fine.

638
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:33,718
I love it, so, yeah.

639
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:35,519
I don't wanna freak you out,

640
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:38,155
'cause this is obviously our first date,

641
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:40,791
but you're the total package.

642
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:47,598
Well, yeah, I mean your online
profile was nice and charming

643
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,568
and the picture is beautiful but in person

644
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,936
you're just like...

645
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:54,739
...radiant.

646
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,173
Oh, um...

I think you're pretty great, too.

648
00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:01,712
I like to take things slowly, if that's all right.

649
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:03,581
Yes. Couldn't agree more.

650
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,584
I like to take things slow myself.

651
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,753
I-- I--I didn't think you were
that type of girl.

652
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:11,589
What type of girl?

653
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:14,058
Someone who'd just jump in the sack on the first date,

654
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,226
or whatever.

655

(LAUGHING)

656
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:21,098
I-- I--I am that type of girl.

657
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,799
I am.

658
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:22,767
Oh, really?
Yeah.

659
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:24,068
Yeah, right.

660
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,035
We'd probably be fucking right now

661
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:27,605
if it wasn't for my situation...

662
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:29,774
...below deck.

663
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:32,710
I'll go ahead and give you a hint.

664
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:36,046
It rhymes with beast inspection.

665
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:39,917
I think I know, yeah, I think I know what you mean.

666
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,654
Okay, it's not itchy anymore, but um...

667
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,556
It just probably doesn't smell very good.

(LAUGHING)
Anyway--

669
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:48,626
so, what kind of music do you like?

670
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,161
I'm mostly into reggae and dub.

671
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:52,763
Dub, ska, dance hall.

672
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:54,098
My favorite food is fried.

673
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,266
Italian and Mexican.

674
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:57,001
And Mexican.

675
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:59,069
Also Italian and Japanese.

676
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,472
Oh, I am a Sushi slut.

677
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,407
And how does that manifest itself?

678
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:04,742
I'm a whore for Sushi.

679
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:06,744
Uh... also...

680
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:10,247
...wow, I can't believe
you ate that all in one bite.

681
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:12,449

Ah!

683
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:14,785
I'm gonna be straight with you.

684
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:17,588
You're breasts were a lot bigger in the photo.

685
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,024
In your photo, you looked a lot taller.

686
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:21,258
You had more neck.

687
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,960
It was a--like a head shot.

688
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:24,461
You had less teeth.

689
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:28,165
And, uh, you looked a lot
more third--worldly...

690

Mexicany.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

And I don't mind... much.

693

It is not that I find you unattractive...

...at all.

695
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:39,009

...false advertising.

some urine might actually exit my penis.

I wasn't going to say that.

Yes!

Very good guess.

820

Be honest, do you think it was inappropriate?

00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:40,444
For you to talk about your own feminine hygiene issue

I know!

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,657

It's just I prefer to be
honest because--

858
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,180
everyone wastes so much time being polite

when they could just say what they mean.

She was smart, witty,
good--looking.

978
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,994
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

979
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:05,195
Did you get her phone number?

980
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:07,364
No, I figured I'd bump into her sometime.

981
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:08,398
Dude!
Oh.

982
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,866
Are you out of your mind?

983
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:11,401
We've scoured this entire city

984
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:12,669
to find someone who can tolerate you

985
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,870
for more than three seconds,

986
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,739
then you finally find somebody that likes you

987
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:17,307
and you don't even get her fucking number?

988
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,376
I wanted to play it cool.
Cool?!

989
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:20,644
We are way past cool, man.

990
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:22,412
This shit is desperate!

991
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:25,015
Can I have a chocolate malt?
I need a malt.

992
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:26,483
We'll find her.
Just--what was her name?

993
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:28,418
Mel.
Mel what?

994
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,255
Mm... Mel, um...
Melvin?

995
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:33,323
Mel Gibson.

996
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:37,060
Mel, uh, it was like, ah!
The--the--the, like the--

997
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:38,595
think, think, think what was her name?

998
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:39,930
Fuck, Barry!

999
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:42,365
Well then, heck, Barry, what's the gd point?

1000
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,701
Barry! I will literally
club you with this bar spoon

1001
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:46,536
if you don't tell me who she is.

1002
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:47,404
Tell me!

1003
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:49,406
Wait, I just got it!

1004
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:51,107
Oh, Mel Miller.
She's pretty.

1005
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,243
Wow. Graduated from
Berkeley.

1006
00:37:53,245 --> 00:37:55,412
Volunteers at a dog adoption center.

1007
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:56,079
Is this real?

1008
00:37:57,048 --> 00:37:59,416
Or is this some, like, catfish type situation?

1009
00:37:59,418 --> 00:38:01,084
I got her number.
Call her.

1010
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:01,551
Wait!

1011
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:04,421
We only got one shot at this, all right?

1012
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:05,655
Better do it right.

1013
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:11,528
Boo!
(GASPS)

1014
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,563
(LAUGHING)

1015
00:38:13,565 --> 00:38:16,099
Oh, every time!
Yeah.

1016
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:20,604
Oh, it is ridiculously hot out there.

1017
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:22,072
Oh.

1018
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:27,210
I am so clammy and sticky and disgusting.

1019
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,714
I think I put deodorant on.

1020
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:32,949
(COUGHS)

1021
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:34,918
Whoo!
Are you wearing my bra?

1022
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,752
Oh...

1023
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:39,055
Yeah, I had to borrow it.
Why?

1024
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:40,557
To match your thong.

1025
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:42,959
Do you want it back?

1026
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:43,994
No.

1027
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,529
Oh, you sure?

1028
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:48,465
Actually I might need a hand.

1029
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,266
N-- no, you keep it.
Really.

1030
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:51,368
Thank you.

1031
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:54,638
It's really stuck up there.

1032
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,672
Yeah.

1033
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:58,608
So, you heard anything from the cab guy?

1034
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,677
Oh, that guy.
Um, no.

1035
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,979
He hasn't got my number, so--
- bummer.

1036
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:04,614
I don't care, anyway.

1037
00:39:04,616 --> 00:39:06,583
It's better for you if I'm single.

1038
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:07,117
Right?

1039
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,520
What would you do without your wing girl?

1040
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:12,122
Get dates.

1041
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:13,423
You wouldn't, Paige.

1042
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:14,157
No?

1043
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,660
It's really hard for you.

1044
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:21,498
Babe, you've got to learn to love yourself,

1045
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,532
before others can love you.

1046
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,601
My self--esteem is fine now.

1047
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:27,871
No, I mean literally love yourself.

1048
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:29,239
You know?

1049
00:39:29,674 --> 00:39:31,374
Down there.

1050
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:32,776
Between your legs.

1051
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:34,310
Do you know what I mean?

1052
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:36,346
Try the shower head.

1053
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:38,615
Try your electric toothbrush.

1054
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,884
Yours is a lot more powerful than mine

1055
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,485
and really gets in there.

1056
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:44,354
That is really disgusting.

1057
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:46,156
It's not. It's natural.

1058
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:48,525
This is the problem with you, Paige.

1059
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:52,362
Why do you think I spend so long
in the bathroom every morning?

1060
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:54,531
I'm masturbating.
Hm.

1061
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,332
A good hour before breakfast

1062
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:59,035
and usually forty--five
minutes if I can squeeze it in

1063
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:00,670
when I get home.

1064
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:03,139
I'm gonna get you masturbating
if it's the last thing I do.

1065
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:04,040
I'm all good.

1066

♪(ELECTRONIC MUSIC ON CELLPHONE)♪

1067
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:13,850
Hey, Mel, this is Barry, uh, from the cab.

1068
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:15,385
Oh, um...

1069
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:17,220
Uh...

1070
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:20,190
It's him, it's the guy.

(BREATHING QUICKLY)

1072
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:25,228
It's the guy from the cab.

1073
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,098
Okay, speak as little as possible.

1074
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,265
Okay, okay.
I'm all good.

1075
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:33,503
Hey, so um...

1076
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:36,406
You some kind of pervert stalker or something?

1077
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:37,674
Yeah, sometimes.

1078
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,375
No!
Just read the cards.

1079
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:41,277
Uh, I can't read Kurt's handwriting.

1080
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:42,579
What are you talking about?
It says,

1081
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:44,280
"I was wondering if you're
not doing anything friday night

1082
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:45,448
if you'd like to go to dinner with me

1083
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,716
or any other activity."

1084
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:48,752
Oh my God, could you make it any wordier?

1085
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:50,019
Who are you talking to?

1086
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:51,054
I'm talking to you.

1087
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:53,757
I was wondering if you want me
to come in your--what?!

1088
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,691
No!

1089
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:56,392
What's going on?
I don't know.

1090
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:58,728
Speak from your heart.
Shut up!

1091
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,196
Are you talking to me?
Yes.

1092
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:01,698
Oh, really?

1093
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,966
No, no.

1094
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:04,601
Read the card.
You shut up.

1095
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:05,635
Please don't screw this up.

1096
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:06,836
You shut up!

1097
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:08,705
Fuck off.

1098
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:09,639
Fuck you.

1099
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:12,575
Are you getting' busy on friday night?

1100

(SIGHS)
I dunno.

1101
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:16,279
You tell me if I'm getting busy friday night.

1102
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:17,714
What, is English her second language?

1103
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:19,282
I think so.
(GIGGLES)

1104
00:41:19,284 --> 00:41:22,819
And, uh--and we'll talk
about the details later.

1105
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:24,721
Cool... see ya.

1106
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:26,055
Cool, see ya.

1107
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:27,891
Oh!

1108
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:29,726
He got a date!

1109
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,561
Down there.

1110
00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:33,096
I have a date.

1111
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:34,364
What?
Yeah.

1112
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,801
I mean we'll see.
I don't know.

1113
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:39,102
I love him.

1114
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:41,337
I think I need to go and have a shower.

1115
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:46,576
I feel so inspired after that,
it was just--

1116
00:41:46,578 --> 00:41:47,811
I know.

1117
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:49,579
It's like I'm alive, right?
I know, I know!

1118
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:51,581
I feel alive.
It's just, it was so real.

1119
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,650
Oh God, this--
this is hands--down

1120
00:41:53,652 --> 00:41:55,652
the best first date I've ever had.

1121
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:57,287
Yeah?
Ever!

1122
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:59,255
Mine too.
Yeah?

1123
00:41:59,257 --> 00:42:03,626
And no one has ever taken me to a cockfight before.

1124
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:04,661
I can't believe that.

1125
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:06,696
You got cockfight written all over you.

1126
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:07,764
It's so... violent.

1127
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:09,766
And so bloody, I know.

1128
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:11,534
Feathers everywhere.

1129
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:12,669
Poor little guys.
Yeah.

1130
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:15,505
Yeah, but you made that great call on dinner, so...

1131
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:16,506
Yeah?
Yeah.

1132
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:18,975
Oh, well I'm--
I'm glad you liked it.

1133
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:22,679
I think they have incredible cuisine at Hooters,

1134
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,981
but most people don't notice 'cause of...

1135
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:26,649
All the massive tits.

1136
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:28,718
I know, the tits are distracting.

1137
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,688
This feels so natural.

1138
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,889
I know.

1139
00:42:36,293 --> 00:42:38,661

You're intended.

1307
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:02,712
Could be your future bride.

1311
00:49:08,386 --> 00:49:09,285
Indeed you did.
In detail.

1312

You might even get a peek at that bush.

I don't know.
We'll see what we can do.

1324

I'm okay with just meeting her.

Why'd you invite Barry again?

1326
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:31,307
I told you, he's got a girlfriend now, so...

1327

And?

1328

This'll be the kinder, gentler Barry.

1330

Exactly, she'll keep him on a short leash.

to get up

Barry,

01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:23,104
I will admit, he has a poor batting average,

1822
01:08:23,106 --> 01:08:25,340
but he is right in this instance!

1823
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:26,274
Why are you getting so angry?

1824
01:08:26,276 --> 01:08:28,042
Because I am a treasure, Camille,

1825
01:08:28,044 --> 01:08:30,178
and you're a bad pirate.

1826
01:08:30,913 --> 01:08:32,180
What?

1827
01:08:32,915 --> 01:08:34,416
You're joking, right?

1828
01:08:34,418 --> 01:08:36,384
I'll tell you something else.

1829

No one, in their right mind, unless they're insane,

01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:47,228
Not anymore.

1841

This is what it looks like, okay?

1842
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:06,481
This is what it looks like

1843
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:08,950
with a man who now has his dignity back.

1844
01:09:08,952 --> 01:09:10,218

wow.

1848
01:09:40,683 --> 01:09:42,016
It seems like you miss him.

1849
01:09:42,018 --> 01:09:43,651
Uh...

1850
01:09:43,986 --> 01:09:45,320
...no.

1851
01:09:45,955 --> 01:09:47,822
No, I don't, not really.

1852
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:51,426
I just...

1853
01:09:52,495 --> 01:09:54,863
...I never met anyone
I felt so connected to

1854
01:09:54,865 --> 01:09:56,898
in my entire life.

1855
01:09:58,033 --> 01:10:02,237
And, so, it hurts a bit.

1856
01:10:03,472 --> 01:10:06,307
Because I thought he was different.

1857
01:10:06,309 --> 01:10:09,410
But he wasn't and that's fine.

1858
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:14,015
There's a new tech guy at my office.

1859
01:10:14,017 --> 01:10:15,550
I could introduce you.

1860
01:10:15,552 --> 01:10:17,218
What do ya think?

1861
01:10:19,455 --> 01:10:24,726
I think I am not going to let myself get hurt anymore.

1862
01:10:24,728 --> 01:10:26,461
But thanks.

1863
01:10:28,397 --> 01:10:30,265
Thank you.

1864
01:10:39,074 --> 01:10:40,842
Hey, what's going on?

1865
01:10:40,844 --> 01:10:43,545

1866
01:10:43,547 --> 01:10:45,513
Yeah, I can't sleep.

1872
01:11:00,396 --> 01:11:04,032
But you have to promise something.

1873
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:05,667
What?
What?

1874
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:07,135
Okay, look, um...

1875
01:11:08,103 --> 01:11:11,205
You love your job just as much as I love my job.

1876
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:12,240
Yeah.

1877
01:11:13,442 --> 01:11:15,410
But I feel like things were
just starting to get good again

1878
01:11:15,412 --> 01:11:17,245
and now we're kind of like slipping back

1879
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,581
into that bad place, you know what I mean?

1880
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:21,883
I do.

1881
01:11:21,885 --> 01:11:22,684
Yeah.

1882
01:11:22,686 --> 01:11:25,119
Okay, so let's just make a deal.

1883
01:11:25,121 --> 01:11:26,421
You don't work weekends

1884
01:11:26,423 --> 01:11:28,623
and we'll both take our vacation days.

Mmm.

1890
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:37,699
I'm still gonna get fired.

1891
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:40,101
No... 'Cause I've got a plan.

1892
01:11:42,771 --> 01:11:44,739
Strictly week days, huh?
- Mm--Hmm.

1893

We, uh, found some balance.

1894

I dumped Camille.
Really?

1895
01:11:49,546 --> 01:11:51,713
Yeah, I--I think
I can do better.

1896
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:52,747
Wow.

1897
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:53,815
We never liked her.

1898
01:11:53,817 --> 01:11:55,550
Not even a bit.
Barry mentioned that.

1899

She was a straight--up
bizznussneeznashnush.

1900
01:11:58,121 --> 01:12:00,154
She offered me a blow job once.

1901
01:12:00,156 --> 01:12:02,390
Too soon.
She offered. I said no.

1902
01:12:02,392 --> 01:12:03,458
Rafe, how's dating?

1903
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,826
Uh, haven't been.

1904
01:12:04,828 --> 01:12:07,495
Without Barry I've been spending a ton of time with JT.

1905
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:09,263
The kid's great.

1906
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:11,132
He does miss Barry, though.

1907
01:12:11,134 --> 01:12:14,102
I mean I don't, at all, no.

1908
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:15,937
The guy was a nightmare.

1909
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:18,506
It's so much easier without him around.

1910
01:12:18,508 --> 01:12:19,941
No more messes to clean up.

1911
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:20,942
No more hassles.

1912
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:23,478
No one to apologize for.

1913
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,480
No one to apologize for.

1914
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,584
It kinda sucks.

1915
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:30,985
Yeah.

1916
01:12:30,987 --> 01:12:32,387
Totally.

1917
01:12:35,457 --> 01:12:36,991
I'm just so bummed, you know,

1918
01:12:36,993 --> 01:12:38,593
not only was she a really fantastic girl,

1919
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:44,532
but she had... these great,
big juicy jugs, you know?

1920
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:46,434
Just showstoppers.

1921
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,102
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Oh...

1922
01:12:48,104 --> 01:12:49,470
Someone's at my door.
I--I gotta go.

1923
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:50,606
I'll call you later, okay grandma?

1924
01:12:50,607 --> 01:12:52,206
I love you. Bye.

1925
01:12:55,511 --> 01:12:57,078
ALL: Hey.

1926
01:12:58,347 --> 01:13:00,014
What are you guys doing here?

1927
01:13:00,016 --> 01:13:01,416
Can we talk?

1928
01:13:04,286 --> 01:13:05,319
Uh...

1929
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:07,955
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on in.

1930
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:13,227
And when we say we are sorry
about everything we said and did

1931
01:13:13,229 --> 01:13:14,562
we really mean it.

1932
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,164
What we said was mean.

1933
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,199
And the stuff we said about Mel, too.

1934
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:19,567
I mean she didn't deserve that.

1935
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:21,803
Yeah, she didn't deserve that.
She's a sweetheart.

1936
01:13:21,805 --> 01:13:23,237
But I'll relay that message to her

1937
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:24,706
if I ever talk to her again.

1938
01:13:25,374 --> 01:13:26,574
We want you back, Barry.

1939
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:28,209
We're your friends, Barry.
Always.

No matter what ridiculous, obnoxious, inane,

01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:33,047
stupid thing you might do.

1942
01:13:33,049 --> 01:13:35,550
Yeah, I probably will do something like that.

1943
01:13:35,552 --> 01:13:37,652
Barry, will you forgive us?

1944
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:40,488
I don't think so.

1945
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:43,725
Now I want you guys to get out of my house right now.

1946
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:46,027
Get outta here!

1947
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:48,529
I'm kidding! I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, guys.

1948
01:13:48,531 --> 01:13:50,098
Oh my God I got goose bumps.

1949
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,532
Like, I could barely pull that off.

1950
01:13:51,534 --> 01:13:52,500
Did you guys see that?

1951
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:53,434
Ah!
Yeah.

1952
01:13:53,436 --> 01:13:54,569
So, pals forever?

1953
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:55,603
Dick tattoos, finally?

1954
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:56,672
- Are we gonna do it?
- ALL: No.

1955
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:59,373
You get a tattoo of a dick on your dick

1956
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:01,242
and on the tattoo of the dick on your dick

1957
01:14:01,244 --> 01:14:02,577
it says, "pals forever."

1958
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:03,678
I'm mainly concerned about the pain.

1959
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,846
That'a the point!

1960
01:14:04,848 --> 01:14:06,047
Asshole!

1961
01:14:06,049 --> 01:14:07,682
(LAUGHTER)

1962
01:14:07,684 --> 01:14:09,450
I love it when you get this guy.

1963
01:14:09,452 --> 01:14:10,618
Look at you!
(LAUGHING)

1964
01:14:15,057 --> 01:14:18,793
KURT: And I knew that if I just concentrated hard enough,

1965
01:14:18,795 --> 01:14:19,894
believed hard enough,

1966
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:22,530
DESMOND: You didn't revive the possum, Kurt.

1967
01:14:22,532 --> 01:14:24,966
That's what they do.
They play possum.

1968
01:14:24,968 --> 01:14:26,400
You never heard of playing possum?

1969
01:14:26,402 --> 01:14:28,536
No, why would you wanna play with a dead animal?

1970
01:14:28,538 --> 01:14:30,304
They're not dead.
They're pretending to be dead.

1971
01:14:30,306 --> 01:14:32,740
You did not revive that animal.

1972
01:14:32,742 --> 01:14:36,410
Rafe, maybe you're not understanding me.

1973
01:14:36,412 --> 01:14:39,580
You don't have the powers to revive dead animals.

1974
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:40,615
DESMOND: Whatcha got there, man?

1975
01:14:40,617 --> 01:14:42,750
Hey! Hey, buddy.

1976
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:43,785
Nothin'.

1977
01:14:43,787 --> 01:14:47,288
Just, uh... oh, uh, I, uh,

1978
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:49,056
have something here I've been meaning to give to you

1979
01:14:49,058 --> 01:14:51,058
for a little while.

1980
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,495
It's, uh, my share of the mail order bride.

1981
01:14:54,497 --> 01:14:56,631
Or it's a start, anyway.

1982
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:57,932
Thanks, man.

1983
01:14:57,934 --> 01:15:01,803
I do need a wallet, but for now, this'll have to do.

1984
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:04,472
How are you, man?
Good, good, good.

1985
01:15:04,474 --> 01:15:05,640
Yeah, I'm really well.

1986
01:15:05,642 --> 01:15:08,109
You know, like, uh, things feel...

1987
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:10,812
...uh, things feel shitty.

1988
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:11,813
I can't get over Mel.

1989
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:13,247
I can't stop thinking about her.

1990
01:15:13,249 --> 01:15:15,116
I'm just--
I'm a wreck.

1991
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:17,084
You know, I--I--
(CHUCKLES)

1992
01:15:17,086 --> 01:15:19,020
Most girls don't understand me, des.

1993
01:15:19,022 --> 01:15:19,854
They punch me.

1994
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,657
But Mel, she got me.

1995
01:15:22,659 --> 01:15:24,325
And I blew it.

1996
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:25,760
Well, you got us, man.

1997
01:15:25,762 --> 01:15:27,328
Yeah, I know, I know. And I--

1998
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:29,096
I'm thrilled that we're all hanging out together again,

1999
01:15:29,098 --> 01:15:30,731
believe me, I--I just...

2000
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,769
Nobody else makes me feel the way that she does.

2001
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:36,370
And that's no slam to you guys, you know?

2002
01:15:36,372 --> 01:15:37,705
Nobody makes me feel that way.

2003
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:40,474
I-- I--I've never even
considered

2004
01:15:40,476 --> 01:15:42,343
spending the rest of my life with somebody.

2005
01:15:42,345 --> 01:15:43,711
Have you told her this?

2006
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:45,947
What do you mean?
Like, how you feel?

2007
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:47,048
How would I do that?

2008
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:49,884
I mean, what you said sounded pretty darn good.

2009
01:15:49,886 --> 01:15:52,053
No, what?
You think?

2010
01:15:52,055 --> 01:15:53,354
Absolutely.

2011
01:15:53,356 --> 01:15:54,989
I gotta tell her, don't I?
For sure.

2012
01:15:54,991 --> 01:15:57,191
I gotta do this. I'm gonna--
we gotta--I gotta do this.

2013
01:15:57,193 --> 01:15:58,226
I'm gonna do it on monday.

2014
01:15:58,228 --> 01:15:59,861
Well, um, why--
why monday?

2015
01:15:59,863 --> 01:16:02,797
Monday's way better for me.
The weekend is packed.

2016
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:03,865
I got--I got grout.

2017
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:06,300
I gotta transfer all my Blu-Rays to DVD.

2018
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:08,202
You cannot wait 'til monday, Barry.

2019
01:16:08,204 --> 01:16:10,504
You've met the woman that you
wanna drive everyone crazy with

2020
01:16:10,506 --> 01:16:11,806
for the rest of your life.

2021
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:14,008
Yeah.
You have to be with her now.

2022
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,643
I have to.
Good.

2023
01:16:15,645 --> 01:16:16,911
Do you know where she is?

2024
01:16:16,913 --> 01:16:19,647
What's today?
Um, friday.

2025
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:21,582
Yeah, I know exactly where she is.

2026
01:16:21,584 --> 01:16:23,517
Let smile the heavens upon this holy act

2027
01:16:23,519 --> 01:16:26,854
that after hours with sorrow chide us not.

2028
01:16:26,856 --> 01:16:28,623
Amen.

2029
01:16:29,324 --> 01:16:31,392
But come what sorrow can.

2030
01:16:31,394 --> 01:16:34,028
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy

2031
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,664
that one short minute gives me in her sight.

2032
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,865
Do we really need to be running?

2033
01:16:37,867 --> 01:16:39,834
No, it's just more romantic this way!

2034
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:42,837
Hey, any idea where I could get some clean urine?

2035
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:45,172
I have some.
Not mine, but I have some.

2036
01:16:45,174 --> 01:16:46,440
It is my ghostly confessor.

2037
01:16:46,442 --> 01:16:48,676
Romeo shall thank thee for us both.

2038
01:16:48,678 --> 01:16:51,212
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

2039
01:16:51,214 --> 01:16:53,915
Ah, Juliet if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine

2040
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:55,917
and that thy skill be more to blazon

2041
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:58,119
the imagined happiness that both receive and...

2042
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:00,788
(WHISPERING)
Barry... Barry.

2043
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:01,756
What?

2044
01:17:01,758 --> 01:17:02,757
There's an entrance.

2045
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:03,958
No, it's okay, I got in.

2046
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,693
I fell in over here.

2047
01:17:05,695 --> 01:17:07,061
Do you guys know Mel Miller?

2048
01:17:07,063 --> 01:17:08,696
My true love has grown
to such excess--

2049
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:11,365
anybody seen Mel Miller?
Hey.

2050
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:13,200
Comes a messenger.
(CHUCKLING)

2051
01:17:13,202 --> 01:17:14,035
Sorry.

2052
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:15,736
Go to, messenger.

2053
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:17,271
I'll have words with you later.

2054
01:17:17,273 --> 01:17:18,706
Ah!
Oh!

2055
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,474
Mel Miller?
Mel Miller?!

2056
01:17:20,476 --> 01:17:21,909
Shut up, asshole!

2057
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:23,411
She's a british blonde bombshell,

2058
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:24,278
works here?

2059
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,881
Listen, they both take suicide pills

2060
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:28,149
and they die, okay?
It's really sad.

2061
01:17:28,151 --> 01:17:29,483
(CROWD BOOING)

2062
01:17:29,485 --> 01:17:31,819
You just ruined the whole play, you idiot!

2063
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,287
Oh my God. Oh, you didn't
know that?

2064
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:34,989
Oh you guys didn't know that?

2065
01:17:34,991 --> 01:17:36,424
It's called the eighth grade, dummies!

2066
01:17:36,426 --> 01:17:38,926
Try it some time.
It's Romeo and Juliet.

2067
01:17:38,928 --> 01:17:40,027
Ah, there she is, there's--

2068
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:42,296
I need to talk to you, please come here.

2069
01:17:42,298 --> 01:17:43,798
Pretend it's part of the show, Barry, please.

2070
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,766
Not until I say some things to you.

2071
01:17:45,768 --> 01:17:46,934
(AUDIENCE COMPLAINING)

2072
01:17:46,936 --> 01:17:48,402
This will just take a moment.

2073
01:17:48,404 --> 01:17:50,604
He's very sick.
I'm so sorry.

2074
01:17:50,606 --> 01:17:52,907
I'm sorry, this is a lovely setting for Shakespeare.

2075
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:54,108
Now I just need to say a couple of things.

2076
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,643
No, no, stay here.
I have to do it here!

2077
01:17:55,645 --> 01:17:57,244
I have to do it here!

2078
01:17:57,246 --> 01:17:58,913
So--sorry.
- Yes.

2079
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:00,982
Yes.
Sorry.

2080
01:18:02,617 --> 01:18:03,918
I--

2081
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:06,520
I la--mmm--

2082
01:18:06,922 --> 01:18:08,856
I love--I love--

2083
01:18:09,424 --> 01:18:11,625
I love your tits.
- Oh!

2084
01:18:11,627 --> 01:18:12,860
That's--'ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!

2085
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:14,261
That's not what I meant.
That's not what I meant.

2086
01:18:14,263 --> 01:18:15,830
I'm--I'm--I'm--
I'm not that gross.

2087
01:18:15,832 --> 01:18:17,865
I do love her tits I just--
you got great tits,

2088
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:19,500
I love your tits.
I know that.

2089
01:18:19,502 --> 01:18:22,336
I can do better, I--I--
- what?

2090
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:24,205
I love--I love--

2091
01:18:24,706 --> 01:18:26,340
I love your breath...

2092
01:18:26,342 --> 01:18:27,942
Even in the morning when it--
when it smells

2093
01:18:27,944 --> 01:18:29,443
like a sweaty sock.

2094
01:18:29,445 --> 01:18:30,778
I love it even more that way.

2095
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,880
I just wanna climb inside your mouth and live there.

2096
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:34,348
I love that I could al--
I can always tell

2097
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,050
what you've had for lunch because I can taste it later

2098
01:18:36,052 --> 01:18:37,685
when we're making out.

2099
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:39,720
And--and I love--I love that
you're so not into your looks

2100
01:18:39,722 --> 01:18:41,555
that you don't even care that
you have a daddy long legs mole

2101
01:18:41,557 --> 01:18:43,357
growing under your arm and it's got little whiskers

2102
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:44,658
and you never pluck 'em.

2103
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,460
It's disgusting.
I do.

2104
01:18:46,462 --> 01:18:50,698
And I--and I--and I love, I love that
your accent is so thick I have...

2105
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,966
I literally have no idea what you're saying to me

2106
01:18:51,968 --> 01:18:53,567
half the time.
Is that it?

2107
01:18:53,569 --> 01:18:55,536
Yeah. See, I could barely
even understand that.

2108
01:18:55,538 --> 01:18:58,839
I love that your nose whistles
every time I make you come.

2109
01:18:58,841 --> 01:19:01,542
And I--and I love that your
little nickname for my butt hole

2110
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:03,244
is my smelly button.

2111
01:19:03,246 --> 01:19:06,180
And--and--and I love that you
have to take off all your clothes

2112
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:08,015
every time you have to take a poo.

2113

01:19:12,255 --> 01:19:13,821

I love that you have

2117
01:19:13,823 --> 01:19:16,390
a-- a dedicated savings account
just for future space travel.

2118
01:19:16,392 --> 01:19:18,492
I do. Yeah, I do.

And--and--and I love
your little mustache.

I didn't know you noticed it.

2121
01:19:23,266 --> 01:19:25,566
It's my favorite little mustache I've ever seen.
