1
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,991
Jesus!

2
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:51,039
"To the city of San Francisco.
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

3
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:54,585
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

4
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:57,713
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

5
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:01,259
...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...

6
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,909
...and I will set up meeting.
If I do not hear from you...

7
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:09,810
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a... . "

8
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,147
"Scorpio. "

9
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:19,091
What goes on in their minds?
Kooks.

10
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:23,263
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

11
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:27,226
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

12
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:32,440
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

13
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,881
Instead, we pay a police department.

14
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:39,322
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

15
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:42,347
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

16
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,291
Send Inspector Callahan in.

17
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,088
Callahan?

18
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:57,781
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.
All right.

19
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,658
Let's have it.

20
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:04,038
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

21
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,835
For the past 3/4 hour...
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

22
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:13,319
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

23
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,742
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

24
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,047
There's a madman loose.

25
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:34,489
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

26
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,850
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

27
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:44,813
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

28
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,941
...rifle nuts, peepers...
Mr. Mayor?

29
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:51,278
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

30
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:55,241
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

31
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:59,412
...and in the black area.
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

32
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:04,209
We're sure it's a 30-06.
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

33
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:06,087
We're running a computer check...

34
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:10,258
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

35
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,178
...October 23 and November 21.
Why?

36
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,785
Natives of Scorpio.

37
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,122
Thank you, Inspector.

38
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:22,251
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

39
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,213
How about you?

40
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:27,673
Nobody.

41
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:31,115
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?
Nobody.

42
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,372
All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.

43
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:43,212
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

44
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:47,174
You'll play this creep's game?
It'll give us breathing space.

45
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,886
It might get somebody killed.

46
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,284
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

47
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:56,456
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

48
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:59,584
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

49
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:03,026
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

50
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:13,558
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

51
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:15,331
That's my policy.

52
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,564
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

53
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:23,257
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

54
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,029
Intent?

55
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:27,428
How did you establish that?

56
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,581
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

57
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:37,544
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

58
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,071
I think he's got a point.

59
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:40,948
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

60
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,034
Usual.

61
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:46,058
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

62
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,457
What difference does it make?

63
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:49,917
Not much.

64
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,879
Hey, Jaffe...

65
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,572
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

66
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:01,283
Tan Ford?

67
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,645
Yeah, tan Ford.
Engine running?

68
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,503
I don't know.
How can I tell?

69
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:15,570
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

70
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,760
Look at that pollution.

71
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,852
Do me a favor, will you?

72
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,772
Call this telephone number.

73
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:32,673
Police Department?
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

74
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:36,219
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

75
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,347
Got it.

76
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:42,580
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

77
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:45,604
In progress.
Yes, sir.

78
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:53,843
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

79
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:58,952
Shit!

80
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,074
Halt!

81
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,359
I know what you're thinking.

82
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:44,383
Did he fire six shots or only five?

83
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:48,763
To tell the truth, in all the excitement
I've kind of lost track myself.

84
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:52,309
Since this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

85
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,812
...and would blow
your head clean off...

86
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,400
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

87
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:01,382
Well, do you, punk?

88
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,263
I got to know.

89
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:45,181
Son of a bitch!

90
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:51,751
It looks like we can save that leg.

91
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:55,818
I've got a couple under my knee.
Ever consider
another line of work?

92
00:14:56,548 --> 00:15:01,136
I really appreciate this, Steve.
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

93
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,222
Nothing fancy, now.

94
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:06,872
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

95
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,939
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

96
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,693
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

97
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,552
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a... .

98
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,950
Sorry, Harry.

99
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:23,870
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

100
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,520
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

101
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:30,127
For $29.50, let it hurt.

102
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,569
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

103
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,143
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Maria.

104
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,486
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

105
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:14,828
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?
Whenever you do.

106
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:19,417
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
checking the search patterns.

107
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:22,754
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

108
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,257
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

109
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,907
- He was?
- He wanted me to tell you: "Well done! "

110
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:33,182
I can't tell you how moved I am.
I pass along a compliment...

111
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:37,145
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

112
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,335
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

113
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:43,923
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

114
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:47,365
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

115
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,763
I'm putting somebody
with you.

116
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:57,689
What are you talking about?
You need a partner.

117
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:01,443
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

118
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:05,302
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

119
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,516
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.
I have no time to break in newcomers.

120
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:14,583
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

121
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,441
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

122
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,466
...and Fanduchi's dead.
So?

123
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:27,723
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.
What about De Georgio?

124
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:29,287
No way!

125
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,685
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

126
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:34,814
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

127
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,255
I got it.

128
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:45,972
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

129
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:50,769
You from around here?
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

130
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:54,419
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

131
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,652
Just what I need is a college boy.

132
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:01,824
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

133
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,431
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

134
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:09,436
- Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.
- I intend to.

135
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,939
Inspector Callahan.

136
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:15,902
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

137
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,883
I'll remember that.

138
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:22,993
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

139
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,705
You're a sweet man, Harry.

140
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:33,630
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

141
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:37,801
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?
That's one thing about our Harry.

142
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:39,261
Doesn't play favorites.

143
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:44,371
Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

144
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:50,107
You name it.
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

145
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,818
Especially spics.

146
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:48,015
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

147
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,039
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

148
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,068
You, on the roof!

149
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:17,632
You, there!

150
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:19,509
Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

151
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:22,846
Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

152
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:43,077
I don 't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!

153
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:46,310
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

154
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:52,254
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.
That's possible.

155
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:03,412
- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.

156
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:08,001
Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

157
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:13,215
He is an adult male.
Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.

158
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,822
When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

159
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:19,889
...pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.

160
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:25,938
He had a tan suitcase...
...which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...

161
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:31,778
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!
I know what you mean.

162
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:36,888
- There!
- What?

163
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,765
Tan suitcase.

164
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,372
- Where?
- I lost him.

165
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:46,690
There he goes, over there.
Does that bag look tan?

166
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:51,070
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.
Go to Filber and hang a left.

167
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:56,284
Look out for these people!
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

168
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,793
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

169
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:07,338
I saw him.

170
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,737
- There he is.
- I see him.

171
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:16,933
Car 2, the license number...
...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.

172
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:26,110
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go in here.

173
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:29,447
Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?

174
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:35,078
Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.

175
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:36,955
10-4.

176
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:52,181
You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.

177
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,791
Anybody home?

178
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:45,261
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

179
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:04,658
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

180
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:14,043
You getting an eyeful?
You goddamn pie hawker!

181
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:17,589
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

182
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,122
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

183
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,379
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

184
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:37,090
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

185
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:42,721
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

186
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,016
Beat it. Get out of here.

187
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:52,837
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

188
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,653
I just had another thought.

189
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,425
Yeah? About what?

190
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,137
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

191
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:08,375
Inspector 71.

192
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,215
Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.

193
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:17,552
Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

194
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:21,828
- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.

195
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,852
California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.

196
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:26,833
10-4. We're on our way.

197
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,359
It's some idiot.

198
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,340
Where? I don't see him.

199
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:54,260
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

200
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:59,891
I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.

201
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:03,437
In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.

202
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:08,443
California license D-dog,
C-Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.

203
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,478
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

204
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:39,102
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here... .

205
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:42,335
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

206
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,377
Don't you try to get me!

207
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:01,695
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

208
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:05,449
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

209
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:10,663
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

210
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:13,583
Won't you try to grab me?

211
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:19,110
A friend of mine was up about 20 floors
with a jumper a few years ago.

212
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:22,865
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.
Mashed all over.

213
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:27,453
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which... .

214
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:30,790
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

215
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,649
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

216
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:39,133
It's such a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

217
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:43,200
Even if they find your driver's license!
All that blood!

218
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:49,040
I think I'm going to puke!

219
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:53,211
Don't do that, son.
All those people down there looking up.

220
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:56,444
The fire chief looking up.
With his face... .

221
00:31:56,965 --> 00:31:58,425
You bastard!

222
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:47,543
Get the stretcher up here.

223
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:04,854
Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry.
Every dirty job that comes along.

224
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,184
Inspector 71.

225
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:23,834
This is Inspector 71.

226
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:28,527
Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

227
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:34,888
What about him?
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

228
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:41,249
Anybody know who the boy is?
His name was Charlie Russell.

229
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,231
I'm his mother.

230
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,881
He's only 10 years old.

231
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:05,860
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You'd better go check on the mother.

232
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:20,043
What do you have?

233
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:22,754
That 30-06 shell casing.

234
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:25,153
He was up here all right.

235
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,410
Welcome to Homicide.

236
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:54,769
The man who designed blue serge uniforms
for police departments...

237
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,689
...has to sell these for a living!

238
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:03,946
.458 Magnum?

239
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:09,056
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

240
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,958
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

241
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:19,172
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.
What have you got, Lieutenant?

242
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:23,865
The blue flags represent the units that
are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

243
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:26,367
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

244
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:29,392
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

245
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:33,772
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

246
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,464
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.
We're saving that for him.

247
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:41,280
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

248
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:46,181
It's a building that overlooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

249
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:48,371
Something bothering you?

250
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:52,021
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

251
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:55,254
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

252
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,695
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

253
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:03,075
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

254
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:06,517
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

255
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,792
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

256
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:16,007
Must appeal to their
superego or something.
Scorpio strikes again.

257
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,614
They like that feeling.

258
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,472
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

259
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,705
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

260
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,981
And they're having a novena tonight.
Go on.

261
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:35,403
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.
The Russell boy was black.

262
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:39,366
He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.

263
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,677
Inspector 71.

264
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:01,057
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

265
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:29,005
How about the priest?
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

266
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:34,949
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.
Who?

267
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:38,287
Never guess.

268
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:41,624
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

269
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:16,209
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

270
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:32,790
Son of a bitch took the bait!

271
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:37,170
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

272
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:20,135
Now!

273
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,309
- You all right?
- I think so.

274
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,413
Call an ambulance.

275
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,063
Collins never knew what hit him.

276
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:10,050
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

277
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:13,387
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

278
00:42:59,898 --> 00:43:02,609
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

279
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:05,425
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

280
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:12,099
Ann Mary Deacon.
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

281
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:17,001
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

282
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:18,982
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive. "

283
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:23,362
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

284
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:26,803
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

285
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:30,766
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

286
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,876
One man with yellow bag.
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

287
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:37,544
9 p.m.

288
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:42,863
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. tomorrow.
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

289
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:46,930
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

290
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:50,163
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio. "

291
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:53,917
Anything else?

292
00:43:55,064 --> 00:43:57,567
The mother identified the bra...

293
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,653
...the hank of hair...

294
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:01,113
...and that.

295
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:03,407
The dentist identified that.

296
00:44:04,763 --> 00:44:07,891
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

297
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:14,982
You know she's dead.
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

298
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:19,779
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

299
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:23,012
He's using up a lot of favors.

300
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:26,036
He wants to pay.

301
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,165
No tricks.

302
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,029
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

303
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:43,660
You got it.
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

304
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,580
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

305
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,083
No cover?
Not even one man?

306
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,549
Sure that's how to do it?
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

307
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,014
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

308
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,560
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

309
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:09,523
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

310
00:45:09,836 --> 00:45:12,651
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

311
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:25,583
Testing 1, 2, 3...

312
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:29,232
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

313
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,238
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow. "
Okay, that's better.

314
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,679
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

315
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:39,139
...forget it.

316
00:45:39,348 --> 00:45:43,936
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?
Bring it back in one piece.

317
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:49,776
$200,000.

318
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:52,175
Count it and sign for it.

319
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:56,659
Did you count it out?

320
00:45:59,162 --> 00:46:01,248
Did you count it, chief?

321
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,002
It's not my responsibility.

322
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:10,633
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

323
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,682
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

324
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,773
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

325
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:29,821
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

326
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:41,188
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

327
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:44,630
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

328
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,991
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

329
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:05,695
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

330
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:13,584
- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

331
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:19,111
- What's your name?
- Callahan.

332
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:21,822
- What are you?
- Police officer.

333
00:48:23,386 --> 00:48:24,742
Hello?

334
00:48:35,483 --> 00:48:37,778
All right, police officer...

335
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:39,759
...this is how we play.

336
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:44,243
I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.

337
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:47,580
If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.

338
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:52,377
If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

339
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:54,046
...the girl dies.

340
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:57,279
- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.

341
00:48:57,383 --> 00:48:58,634
No car.

342
00:48:59,156 --> 00:49:03,014
I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

343
00:49:03,014 --> 00:49:06,664
I ring 4 times.
You don 't answer by the fourth ring...

344
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,376
...that's the end of the game.

345
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,044
The girl dies.

346
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,130
What time you got?

347
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:17,406
- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.

348
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:19,804
I'm watching you.

349
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:23,975
Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.

350
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:29,398
Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

351
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,158
- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.

352
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:21,123
Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.

353
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:25,190
Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

354
00:52:30,956 --> 00:52:32,833
You sound like you had a good rest.

355
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:36,901
You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.

356
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:40,655
You better make it,
because if you don 't, dead girl!

357
00:52:40,759 --> 00:52:43,992
Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

358
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:49,310
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

359
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,871
What's in the bag, man?

360
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:29,460
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

361
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,545
Just give us the wallet.

362
00:53:34,465 --> 00:53:37,072
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

363
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:06,168
Don't answer that!

364
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:19,724
- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.

365
00:54:24,417 --> 00:54:26,294
Chico, he hung up.

366
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:32,551
- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.
Go to the cross.

367
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:14,578
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

368
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:17,081
I'm going up.

369
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:33,557
I see a couple of people.

370
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:41,379
Just a couple of kids necking.
Boys or girls?

371
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:02,131
I'm Callahan.

372
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:06,511
My friends call me Alice.

373
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:08,805
And I will take a dare.

374
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:12,455
When was the last time
you were busted?

375
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:16,001
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

376
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:18,399
Well, do it at home.

377
00:57:21,595 --> 00:57:22,743
Freeze!

378
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:25,454
Just like a statue.

379
00:57:26,497 --> 00:57:27,957
That's right.

380
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:31,607
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

381
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,527
I'll kill you and the girl both.

382
00:57:35,257 --> 00:57:36,612
Understand?

383
00:57:38,177 --> 00:57:39,324
Yeah.

384
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:42,452
Drop the bag.

385
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:47,145
Left hand.

386
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,439
Let's see the gun.

387
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:56,113
My!

388
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:58,199
That's a big one.

389
00:57:59,763 --> 00:58:01,640
Left hand. Throw it.

390
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:04,248
Easy.

391
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:11,965
Raise your hands.
Come on, get them up.

392
00:58:15,823 --> 00:58:17,075
Now turn.

393
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:19,056
Face the cross.

394
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:22,914
Come on.

395
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:26,043
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

396
00:58:47,734 --> 00:58:51,905
You lift that hand once more and
I won't let you know where the girl is!

397
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:54,512
Do we understand each other?

398
00:58:55,138 --> 00:58:57,432
Do we understand each other?

399
00:58:57,745 --> 00:59:01,708
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

400
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:05,149
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

401
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:07,756
Do we understand each other?

402
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:13,179
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

403
00:59:13,388 --> 00:59:15,369
Listen to me carefully.

404
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,559
I've changed my mind.

405
00:59:17,976 --> 00:59:20,062
I'm going to let her die.

406
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:24,025
I just wanted you to know that.

407
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:33,202
You understand? I ijust wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.

408
00:59:42,274 --> 00:59:44,047
Goodbye, Callahan!

409
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:55,206
Chico, don't kill him!

410
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:53,464
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, Chief.

411
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:56,383
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

412
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:59,721
He's right here.
He's got two cracked ribs.

413
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:02,745
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

414
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:07,646
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.
I'm sending him home.

415
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:09,419
Right, Chief.

416
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:12,965
He says beat it! That's an order.

417
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,970
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

418
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:21,724
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

419
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:24,123
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

420
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:29,024
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.
What am I going to tell him?

421
01:02:31,527 --> 01:02:33,926
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

422
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:37,680
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

423
01:02:37,993 --> 01:02:40,600
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

424
01:02:40,913 --> 01:02:44,980
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

425
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:50,090
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

426
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:58,432
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

427
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,334
- Put him on.
- What is it?

428
01:03:03,855 --> 01:03:09,069
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

429
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:13,762
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

430
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:16,161
Long blond hair...

431
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:19,393
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

432
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:25,025
Pale complexion.
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

433
01:03:26,172 --> 01:03:28,570
They usually give a phony name.

434
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,699
But I've seen him someplace.

435
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:36,079
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

436
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:38,269
I'm trying to think!

437
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:39,937
It was... .

438
01:03:40,772 --> 01:03:45,673
I believe he works around here.
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

439
01:03:45,986 --> 01:03:47,759
Yes, just a moment.

440
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,684
She'll be dead in an hour!
I'm trying to remember!

441
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,960
I've got who he is.

442
01:04:00,794 --> 01:04:05,070
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

443
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:08,407
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

444
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:11,327
- Live where?
- There.

445
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:17,897
Kezar Stadium.

446
01:05:22,344 --> 01:05:24,534
Illegal entry. No warrant.

447
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:26,620
Looks like we climb.

448
01:05:27,871 --> 01:05:29,644
Too much linguine.

449
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,607
I'll find another way.

450
01:08:50,495 --> 01:08:51,538
Stop!

451
01:09:11,456 --> 01:09:14,689
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

452
01:09:16,044 --> 01:09:17,817
You need any help?

453
01:09:18,651 --> 01:09:22,823
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

454
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,785
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

455
01:09:27,307 --> 01:09:29,497
Let me have a doctor!

456
01:09:29,705 --> 01:09:32,625
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

457
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:35,754
The girl, where is she?
You tried to kill me!

458
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:40,238
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

459
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:43,784
I want a lawyer.
I said, where's the girl?

460
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:47,329
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

461
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:50,875
I have the right to a lawyer!

462
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:53,274
Don't! Please!

463
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:55,985
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

464
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,827
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

465
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,103
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

466
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:45,066
- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.

467
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:47,882
Won't you come this way?

468
01:11:48,299 --> 01:11:51,740
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

469
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,481
I'll be done in a minute.

470
01:12:02,898 --> 01:12:04,358
Have a seat.

471
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:12,180
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

472
01:12:13,848 --> 01:12:17,185
A very unusual piece of police work.

473
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,522
Really amazing.

474
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:22,712
I had some luck.

475
01:12:23,025 --> 01:12:27,822
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

476
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:34,496
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

477
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:38,876
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

478
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:42,213
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

479
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:46,906
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

480
01:12:48,366 --> 01:12:51,286
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

481
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:55,666
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

482
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:58,065
You should be.
I've got news for you.

483
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:01,923
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

484
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,156
What are you talking about?
He's free!

485
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:09,431
You're letting him go?
We have to.
We can't try him.

486
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:14,229
And why is that?
Because I'm not wasting
1 /2 million tax dollars...

487
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:17,149
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

488
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:19,756
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

489
01:13:20,068 --> 01:13:23,197
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

490
01:13:23,301 --> 01:13:24,553
Zero.

491
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:29,767
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

492
01:13:29,975 --> 01:13:33,000
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

493
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:36,232
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

494
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:41,342
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?
It's the law.

495
01:13:42,177 --> 01:13:44,158
Then the law is crazy!

496
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:47,599
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

497
01:13:47,808 --> 01:13:52,709
He also holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

498
01:13:52,918 --> 01:13:54,274
Your Honor?

499
01:13:55,316 --> 01:14:00,113
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

500
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:04,702
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

501
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:10,855
...is inadmissible in court.
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

502
01:14:11,168 --> 01:14:14,400
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

503
01:14:14,609 --> 01:14:19,093
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!
But I didn't know that!

504
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:24,516
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

505
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:29,000
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

506
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:34,840
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...
...physical evidence...

507
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:37,343
...would have to be excluded.

508
01:14:43,287 --> 01:14:45,268
There must be something
you can get him on!

509
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:48,710
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

510
01:14:49,335 --> 01:14:52,777
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

511
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,218
Now, the suspect's rights...

512
01:14:56,427 --> 01:14:58,200
...were violated...

513
01:14:58,512 --> 01:15:00,702
...under the 4th and 5th...

514
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:03,727
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

515
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:06,542
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

516
01:15:06,751 --> 01:15:11,652
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?
The district attorney's office!

517
01:15:12,695 --> 01:15:14,364
If you'll let us.

518
01:15:16,032 --> 01:15:20,099
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

519
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:24,583
He won't be out there long.
What is that supposed to mean?

520
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:28,025
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

521
01:15:28,338 --> 01:15:31,362
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

522
01:15:31,675 --> 01:15:35,950
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

523
01:15:36,263 --> 01:15:37,932
How do you know?

524
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:40,956
Because he likes it.

525
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:10,708
You sure you weren't tailed?

526
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:11,855
Yeah.

527
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,760
You really want $200 worth.

528
01:18:39,907 --> 01:18:41,784
Every penny of it.

529
01:18:56,175 --> 01:18:59,930
Might as well be comfortable.
Go on, sit.

530
01:19:07,647 --> 01:19:09,107
Relax.

531
01:19:10,358 --> 01:19:12,339
Take it easy.

532
01:19:12,652 --> 01:19:15,051
It's going to be all right.

533
01:19:56,347 --> 01:19:58,850
You sure you want the rest of it?

534
01:19:59,371 --> 01:20:01,248
Every penny's worth!

535
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:06,150
You black son of a bitch!

536
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:30,239
This one's on the house.

537
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:46,716
That's got to be him.

538
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,182
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

539
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:57,666
I swear it. As God is my judge.
Why are they harassing you?

540
01:20:57,979 --> 01:20:59,960
They tried to frame me with the murder.

541
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:03,089
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

542
01:21:03,402 --> 01:21:07,469
I'm supposed to be innocent until proven
guilty and look at what they did to me.

543
01:21:07,782 --> 01:21:11,327
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

544
01:21:11,536 --> 01:21:16,750
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.
Did you see who did this to you?

545
01:21:17,063 --> 01:21:23,111
Can you identify him?
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.

546
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:28,743
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

547
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:32,393
Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.

548
01:21:32,393 --> 01:21:35,938
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

549
01:21:36,668 --> 01:21:38,545
What about it, Harry?

550
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:43,864
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.
Have you been following him?

551
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:48,974
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

552
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:51,685
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

553
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:55,231
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

554
01:21:55,961 --> 01:22:01,488
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.
I don't want any more surveillance!

555
01:22:02,531 --> 01:22:04,199
Neither does he.

556
01:22:06,181 --> 01:22:08,058
What does that mean?

557
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,769
Good night, sir.

558
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:16,400
Go ahead. Try them.

559
01:22:16,922 --> 01:22:20,467
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

560
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:23,909
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

561
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:27,559
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

562
01:22:27,767 --> 01:22:30,792
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

563
01:22:34,024 --> 01:22:37,153
Doing a lot of thinking about it and... .

564
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:42,367
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

565
01:22:43,097 --> 01:22:45,078
...what for? You know?

566
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,648
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

567
01:22:57,488 --> 01:22:59,782
See you tomorrow. Same time?

568
01:23:22,516 --> 01:23:25,228
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

569
01:23:25,853 --> 01:23:29,920
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.
No class.

570
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:33,153
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

571
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:35,448
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

572
01:23:35,656 --> 01:23:39,410
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

573
01:23:39,619 --> 01:23:44,416
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

574
01:23:44,624 --> 01:23:47,023
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

575
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:52,133
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

576
01:23:52,237 --> 01:23:53,801
And I think...

577
01:23:54,636 --> 01:23:57,556
...what if it's the last time I see him?

578
01:23:58,181 --> 01:23:59,954
Am I the only one?

579
01:24:00,163 --> 01:24:03,500
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?
No.

580
01:24:04,647 --> 01:24:06,941
You mean she got used to it?

581
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:10,695
No, she never did, really.
What, then?

582
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:12,885
She's dead.

583
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,493
Please, forgive me.

584
01:24:16,118 --> 01:24:21,020
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.
No reason for it, really.

585
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:24,357
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

586
01:24:24,878 --> 01:24:27,068
I want you to tell Chico...

587
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:33,116
...that I understand him quitting.
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

588
01:24:33,742 --> 01:24:36,975
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

589
01:24:38,539 --> 01:24:40,104
I really don't.

590
01:25:17,229 --> 01:25:20,149
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

591
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:25,050
What the hell happened to you?
My wife's brother.

592
01:25:25,363 --> 01:25:28,387
I hit her...
...so he hit me.

593
01:25:28,595 --> 01:25:30,160
Several times.

594
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,080
$5.69.

595
01:25:35,165 --> 01:25:40,901
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.
14 times the last 3 years.

596
01:25:41,214 --> 01:25:46,949
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

597
01:25:48,097 --> 01:25:51,955
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

598
01:25:52,164 --> 01:25:54,666
Please, I scare easy.

599
01:25:57,691 --> 01:26:00,611
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

600
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:38,361
Goodbye.

601
01:26:39,613 --> 01:26:41,386
See you tomorrow.

602
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:54,004
Everybody out who gets out here?

603
01:26:54,421 --> 01:26:58,801
School bus inspector.
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

604
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:02,660
I'm authorizing it, so go.
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

605
01:27:02,972 --> 01:27:07,248
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

606
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:12,984
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

607
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:21,118
Let's have some fun now.
Who knows a song?

608
01:27:21,326 --> 01:27:26,749
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.
Come on, sing for us.

609
01:27:27,688 --> 01:27:29,982
Old MacDonald had a farm.

610
01:27:30,295 --> 01:27:32,172
E-l-E-l-O

611
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:35,092
And on his farm, he had some ducks...

612
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:14,266
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

613
01:29:18,124 --> 01:29:20,731
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

614
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:25,111
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

615
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:30,013
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

616
01:29:30,638 --> 01:29:33,558
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

617
01:29:34,184 --> 01:29:36,061
Tell them the man is dangerous.

618
01:29:36,374 --> 01:29:40,128
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

619
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:44,612
"To the City of San Francisco.
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

620
01:29:44,925 --> 01:29:49,618
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

621
01:29:50,348 --> 01:29:54,102
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

622
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:59,525
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...
...exactly what I say. Scorpio. "

623
01:30:02,549 --> 01:30:06,721
Better have somebody standing by!
I don't think it's a false alarm.

624
01:30:07,033 --> 01:30:11,935
There's a call for you on line 2.
I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

625
01:30:18,505 --> 01:30:22,259
- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.

626
01:30:23,927 --> 01:30:28,829
I got the bus and... .
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

627
01:30:29,142 --> 01:30:32,792
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.
Just tell him.

628
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:35,816
Not my fault, he had a gun...
Just your name!

629
01:30:39,883 --> 01:30:41,864
This is Marcella Platt.

630
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:47,496
You can check if you want.
But I don 't see any point.
I'm not bullshitting.

631
01:30:47,704 --> 01:30:52,605
It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...
...the kids start dying.

632
01:30:52,918 --> 01:30:56,673
- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.

633
01:30:56,673 --> 01:30:59,488
The money will be there
by the time you get there.

634
01:30:59,697 --> 01:31:03,138
Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.

635
01:31:03,138 --> 01:31:05,120
Just me and a busload of kids.

636
01:31:05,432 --> 01:31:08,665
I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
Blvd., on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

637
01:31:08,874 --> 01:31:12,107
I don 't want any police cars...
...helicopters, whatever.

638
01:31:12,524 --> 01:31:16,591
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

639
01:31:16,799 --> 01:31:18,676
Where are you going?

640
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:22,326
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

641
01:31:24,308 --> 01:31:29,313
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.
I give you my word of honor.

642
01:31:30,669 --> 01:31:32,859
Marcella Platt. It checks.

643
01:31:36,822 --> 01:31:39,325
Willing to take the money to him?

644
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:43,496
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

645
01:31:43,913 --> 01:31:46,833
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

646
01:31:47,459 --> 01:31:52,256
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!
And that's a direct order!

647
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:57,679
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

648
01:33:18,499 --> 01:33:20,584
Row, row, row your boat

649
01:33:20,793 --> 01:33:22,983
Gently down the stream

650
01:33:23,191 --> 01:33:27,467
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

651
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:33,307
Where are we going?

652
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:38,000
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

653
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:43,005
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.
I want to go home to my mother.

654
01:33:43,214 --> 01:33:45,091
Go home to your what?

655
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,281
Now, sing! Sing again!

656
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:50,931
Row, row, row your boat
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

657
01:33:52,704 --> 01:33:54,789
Are you sick?
What is it?

658
01:33:55,624 --> 01:33:58,231
Sing or your mothers will die!

659
01:33:58,544 --> 01:34:01,672
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

660
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:10,745
Get in the right-hand lane.

661
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:15,750
Not right to treat children that way.
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

662
01:34:16,063 --> 01:34:18,462
And get in the right-hand lane!

663
01:34:25,032 --> 01:34:27,117
I want my mother.

664
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:38,484
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.
Make a right there.

665
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:42,551
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

666
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:45,054
Not this one.

667
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,348
I want my mother.

668
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:49,643
Shut up!

669
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,501
Just get to the right!

670
01:35:07,997 --> 01:35:09,561
Jesus!

671
01:35:17,695 --> 01:35:20,302
What the hell is he doing up there?

672
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:28,436
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

673
01:38:47,514 --> 01:38:49,391
Drop the gun, creep!

674
01:38:51,894 --> 01:38:53,980
I'll blow his brains out.

675
01:38:57,421 --> 01:38:59,298
Drop the fucking gun!

676
01:39:46,643 --> 01:39:48,937
I know what you're thinking.

677
01:39:49,563 --> 01:39:53,109
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

678
01:39:54,047 --> 01:39:58,114
To tell you the truth, I forgot myself,
in all this excitement.

679
01:39:58,427 --> 01:40:02,181
But being this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

680
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:05,206
...and will blow your head clean off...

681
01:40:05,414 --> 01:40:07,917
...you've got to ask yourself...

682
01:40:08,647 --> 01:40:10,524
..."Do I feel lucky?"

683
01:40:16,364 --> 01:40:18,450
Well, do you, punk?
