00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
HOW MANY ATTEMPTS?

168
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,880
2 ON THE WAY,
3 SINCE THEN.

169
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
TIME BEFORE LAST,
I GOT TO STUTTGART.

170
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,080
HOW'S THIS ONE
GOING?

171
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,000
SIR, EVERYTHING
DEPENDS ON THE FACT

172
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,400
THAT SOME GOONS DON'T PATROL
WHEN WE'RE SHOWERING.

173
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
UH, SOME OF THEM?

174
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
YES, LIKE HANS
AND ANTON.

175
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,360
AT LEAST ONE
SHOULD BE OUTSIDE

176
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
WALKING
BACK AND FORTH,

177
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,400
BUT THEY KNOW WE'RE
INSIDE HAVING A SHOWER.

178
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,880
SO THEY COME INSIDE,
LEAN AGAINST THE DOOR,

179
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,240
HAVE A SMOKE
IF THEY CAN BUM ONE.

180
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,920
IF SOMEBODY WENT MISSING,
THEY WOULDN'T REPORT IT.

181
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,880
WHY NOT?

182
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,320
THEY'D THINK
THEY'D MISCOUNTED

183
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
AND LEAVE IT
UNTIL ROLL CALL.

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
IF YOU'D COVER
FOR ME AT ROLL CALL,

185
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,920
I COULD BE GONE
FOR DAYS.

186
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,080
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE
GOING TOO FAST FOR ME.

187
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,480
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET
OUT OF THE WASH HOUSE?

188
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,680
THERE'S A VENT
IN THE SHOWER ROOM.

189
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,840
IT LEADS INTO A
STOREROOM OR SOMETHING.

190
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
BUILT AS A LAVATORY

191
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
TO MATCH THE ONE
ON THE GERMAN SIDE.

192
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,200
IF I CAN GET IN
AND PICK THE LOCK...

193
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,000
YOU'D BE BACK IN THE ENCLOSURE
WHERE YOU STARTED.

194
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,760
BUT I'D BE ALL ALONE.
THERE'S NO ONE THERE.

195
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,120
NOW, I COULD
GET ONTO THE ROOF,

196
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,560
GO UNDERNEATH
THE BARBED WIRE,

197
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,960
AND DROP INTO
THE GERMAN COMPOUND.

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
NAKED?

199
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,360
AND, UH, HOW
ARE YOU PLANNING

200
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,320
TO GET OUT OF THE GERMAN
COMPOUND NAKED?

201
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,920
I'VE GOT 5 OR 6 IDEAS.

202
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,600
SHALL WE DISCUSS THEM?

203
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,880
YES.

204
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,320
COLBY INSISTED ON
PLAYING THE OTHER RANKS

205
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
AGAINST THE BEST
OF THE OFFICERS.

206
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
WHAT'S THE IDEA
BEHIND THAT?

207
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,320
I SUPPOSE HE WANTS TO PICK
THE BEST TEAM POSSIBLE.

208
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,640
I DON'T THINK HE'S QUITE
GOT THE POINT, HAS HE?

209
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,160
TELL HIM TO COME AND
SEE ME, WILL YOU?

210
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,160
OH!
OH!

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
WELL DONE, SON.

212
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,040
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

213
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,160
SID ARMOR.

214
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,720
HOW'D YOU LIKE DOUBLE
RATIONS FOR A MONTH?

215
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
WHOSE MOTHER DO YOU
WANT ME TO STRANGLE?

216
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,200
WELCOME ABOARD.

217
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,440
OK, I'M READY
TO SIGN UP.

218
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,040
SIGN UP, HATCH.

219
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,160
TACKLE HIM!
TACKLE HIM!

220
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,120
GOAL!

221
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
NICE SHOT.

222
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,200
THANKS, COLBY.

223
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,960
IT'S NOT LIKE PLAYING
FOR MANCHESTER,

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,200
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN
NOT PLAYING AT ALL.

225
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,160
WELCOME ABOARD.

226
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,120
WHAT ABOUT ME?

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,560
GET OUT THERE.

228
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
WHAT ABOUT ME?

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
GET OUT THERE
AND PLAY.

230
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,920
[BLOWS WHISTLE]

231
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,800
THE MAP OF MARBURG
IS FROM AN OLD GUIDEBOOK,

232
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,240
BUT IT'S RELIABLE,
I SHOULD HOPE.

233
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,920
THERE'S A FAST TRAIN
TO COLOGNE

234
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,120
AT 5:33
EVERY SATURDAY.

235
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,000
UNDER THE MAP IS
A SKETCH OF THE STADIUM

236
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,920
WITH EXITS, PERSPECTIVES,
AND CHANGING ROOMS.

237
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,080
COLONEL...WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

238
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR ESCAPE, COLBY.

239
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,920
MY ESCAPE?

240
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,800
YES, OF COURSE.

241
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,240
THE WHOLE TEAM,
IF POSSIBLE.

242
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,160
WHAT ABOUT THE LORRY THAT'S
TAKING YOU TO THE MATCH?

243
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,880
YOU COULD LOOSEN
THE FLOORBOARDS ON THE WAY IN

244
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,320
AND DROP OUT
ON THE WAY BACK.

245
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,560
YOU STICK TO SCROUNGING,
AND I'LL STICK TO FOOTBALL.

246
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
IT'S YOUR DUTY
AS AN OFFICER.

247
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,520
IT COULD BE AN
EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY.

248
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
CERTAINLY
WORTH CONSIDERING.

249
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,560
I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN GETTING THEM KILLED.

250
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,240
ARE YOU
AFRAID TO TRY?

251
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,120
YOUR ESCAPING IS JUST SOME
BLOODY UPPER-CRUST GAME!

252
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,560
THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB,

253
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,480
AND THEY JUST WANT TO BE
LEFT ALONE UNTIL IT'S OVER.

254
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,880
NOW, THAT
WILL BE ALL, COLBY.

255
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,160
THANK YOU.

256
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,600
YOU SEE THAT?

257
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,000
AM I GOOD,
OR AM I GOOD?

258
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,440
WHAT'S
YOUR NAME?

259
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,880
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

260
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,320
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

261
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
TERRY BRADY.

262
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,560
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO LIVE
WITH THE OFFICERS?

263
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,480
ONLY IF YOU GOT
A CHAPERON, MATE.

264
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,840
WELCOME ABOARD,
TERRY.

265
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
SHOOT!
SHOOT!

266
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,280
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO DO THAT?

267
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,920
WHEN I WAS A BOY...

268
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,320
IN TRINIDAD...

269
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,360
ON THE STREETS
WITH THE ORANGES.

270
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,800
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO PLAY
FOOTBALL AGAINST THE GERMANS?

271
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,920
WHY NOT?

272
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
HEY! FOUL THERE!
STUPID BLOODY YANK!

273
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,840
WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU THINK THIS IS?

274
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,800
BLOODY HELL!

275
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
WHAT DID I DO?

276
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,640
YOU KNOW
BLOODY WELL!

277
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,600
TELL ME.

278
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,000
YOU CANNOT TACKLE
LIKE THAT IN SOCCER!

279
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,880
I WAS JUST GOING
FOR THE BALL!

280
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,320
USE THAT AMERICAN
STYLE AGAIN,

281
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,760
AND
YOU'LL BE BARRED!

282
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,680
YOU PLAY ENGLISH.
I PLAY AMERICAN.

283
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,600
DON'T PLAY THE BLOODY
AMERICAN GAME!

284
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
WHAT KIND OF GAME
IS THIS,

285
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,200
FOR OLD LADIES
AND FAIRIES?

286
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,640
I QUIT.

287
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,320
OK!

288
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,840
1, 2, 3,

289
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,360
4, 5, 6,

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,360
7, 8, 9,

291
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,640
TURN.

292
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,120
1, 2, 3,

293
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,200
4, 5, 6...

294
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,440
HATCH, THE COMMITTEE
HAS CONSIDERED YOUR PLAN.

295
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,320
YOU MAY SEE THE TAILOR
AND THE FORGER.

296
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,240
I'VE GOT TO SEE
THE LOCKSMITH.

297
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,160
YES, BUT SEE
THE TAILOR FIRST.

298
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
THAT TAKES TIME.

299
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,000
7, 8, 9,

300
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,440

301
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
THANKS.

302
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,120
HEY, COLBY!

303
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,520
COLBY, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

304
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,880
YOU KNOW THAT
FOOTBALL TEAM OF YOURS?

305
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,280
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN DO WITH IT?

306
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,160
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ON THAT FOOTBALL TEAM.

307
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,080
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU COULDN'T PAY ME

308
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,840
TO BE ON THAT
FOOTBALL TEAM, COLBY.

309
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,280
YOU GOT IT, COLBY?

310
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,640
I DON'T NEED YOU OR YOUR
FOOTBALL TEAM ANYMORE!

311
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,080
YOU GOT IT?

312
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,480
I DON'T NEED
THIS AGGRAVATION, COLBY!

313
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,240
CAPTAIN COLBY.

314
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,640
HOW ARE YOU?

315
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,400
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

316
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,720
<i>MARTIN,
ZWEI BIER, BITTE.</i>

317
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,040
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

318
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,080
OUR FOOTBALL MATCH
HAS BEEN TAKEN

319
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,120
A LITTLE
OUT OF OUR HANDS.

320
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,160
OH?

321
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,160
IT HAS BEEN DECIDED

322
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,120
THAT A GERMAN NATIONAL TEAM
WILL PLAY A COMBINED TEAM

323
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,000
FROM THE PRISONERS OF WAR
OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

324
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,280
AUGUST 15th AT
COLOMBES STADIUM IN PARIS.

325
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,920
PARIS?

326
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,800
THAT'S CRAZY.

327
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,560
COME IN, MUELLER.

328
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,960
THIS IS HAUPTMANN
REINHOLD MUELLER,

329
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
COACH FOR
OUR NATIONAL TEAM.

330
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,160
CAPTAIN JOHN COLBY.

331
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,320
WE'VE MET...

332
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
A LONG TIME AGO.

333
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,080
<i>JA, IN LONDON.</i>

334
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,880
YOU WERE CENTER HALF.

335
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,680
HAUPTMANN MUELLER
WILL ASSIST ME,

336
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,120
MANAGE OUR TEAM,

337
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,440
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

338
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,560
PARIS.

339
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,480
WHAT IF I REFUSE?

340
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,680
I THINK YOU WILL RECOGNIZE
SOME OF THOSE NAMES.

341
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,400
Mueller: NO, THANK YOU.

342
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,800
YEAH.

343
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,800
THERE ARE SOME
GOOD PLAYERS ON HERE--

344
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,240
BRITISH,

345
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,560
FRENCH,

346
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
DUTCH...

347
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
EVEN A NORWEGIAN.

348
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,240
WHAT ABOUT THE POLES
AND THE CZECHS?

349
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,360
I MEAN,
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD,

350
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,760
I COULD THINK
OF HALF A DOZEN

351
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
EAST EUROPEAN PLAYERS

352
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,320
WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE
ON THAT SQUAD.

353
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
ISN'T THAT SO, MUELLER?

354
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,680
I'M SORRY.
I CANNOT LET YOU

355
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,120
HAVE ANY EASTERN
EUROPEANS.

356
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
WHY NOT?

357
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,240
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

358
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,240
OFFICIALLY,
THEY DO NOT EXIST.

359
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,680
GERMANY DOES NOT
RECOGNIZE THEM

360
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,120
AS PRISONERS OF WAR.

361
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,560
THEY'RE
IN LABOR CAMPS.

362
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,000
WELL, MAYBE
NOT OFFICIALLY,

363
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,920
BUT THEY DO EXIST
AS PLAYERS...

364
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
DON'T THEY?

365
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
THESE EAST EUROPEAN PLAYERS

366
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,200
ARE ALIVE OR DEAD,

367
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,600
BUT YOU CAN FIND THAT OUT.

368
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,200
AS AN OFFICER
AND A GENTLEMEN,

369
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
YOU ARE OBLIGED
TO GIVE ME

370
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,520
A MARGINAL CHANCE
OF WINNING.

371
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,920
MAKE YOUR LIST,
CAPTAIN.

372
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,480
I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

373
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
COLLABORATION PAYS.

374
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
I DON'T CONSIDER IT
COLLABORATION.

375
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,760
AND YOU WANT TO BE
EXHIBITED IN PARIS

376
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,200
LIKE
PERFORMING FLEAS?

377
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,840
LONDON WON'T TAKE
VERY KINDLY TO THIS.

378
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,360
YOU'VE
INFORMED LONDON?

379
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,120
NO NEED.

380
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,720
THE GERMAN
PROPAGANDA MACHINE

381
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
WILL TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

382
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
CAPTAIN HATCH.

383
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,360
AH.

384
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
A CUSTOMER. GOOD.

385
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,240
HOW ARE YOU?

386
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,160
I'M VERY WELL,
VERY WELL.

387
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,560
NOW, IF YOU'LL
JUST GET DRESSED...

388
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,000
THAT'S IT.
OVER THERE.

389
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,920
WILL YOU CHAPS
STAND GUARD

390
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,800
WHILE I DEAL WITH OUR
AMERICAN FRIEND HERE?

391
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,240
STAY WHERE YOU ARE,
PHILLIP.

392
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,800
JUST, UH, JUST LISTEN.

393
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,880
HERE WE ARE.

394
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,760
UH, HAVE YOU SHAVED?

395
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,200
HAVE YOU SHAVED?

396
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
GOOD ENOUGH?

397
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
VERY GOOD.

398
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
RATHER GRATIFYING.

399
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,120
IN SPITE OF THE RELATIVELY
GOOD CONDITIONS HERE,

400
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,520
COMPARED TO OTHER
CAMPS, THAT IS,

401
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
EVERYONE STILL
WANTS TO ESCAPE.

402
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,120
GETTING DRESSED? GOOD.

403
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,200
DON'T DILLYDALLY.

404
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,200
NOW, I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
A STUDIO PORTRAIT,

405
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,080
BUT IT'LL DO.

406
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
AHH.

407
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,000
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE LENS
AS WELL, DID YOU?

408
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,720
NO. I'M A GENIUS,
NOT A MAGICIAN.

409
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,040
SIT DOWN.

410
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,160
RIGHT, NOW,
DON'T SMILE.

411
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,080
WE WANT
THAT CRIMINAL LOOK

412
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,680
ASSOCIATED WITH
PASSPORT PHOTOGRAPHS.

413
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,320
JUST, UH, SULLEN,
DEPRESSED, DEJECTED.

414
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,760
THAT--THAT'S--
THAT'S LOVELY.

415
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,000
HOLD THAT.

416
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,240
WAIT, WAIT.
ONE MORE FOR LUCK?

417
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,040
NO. FILM'S TOO
VALUABLE. SORRY.

418
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,600
THIS WILL DO.

419
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,200
THERE WE ARE.

420
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,680
NOW, DUPAIN IS THE NAME
YOU WANT, IS IT?

421
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,520
YEAH, MARCEL DUPAIN,
ELECTRICIAN.

422
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,520
I NEED AN ADDRESS
IN LYONS

423
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,400
AND PAPERS TO SHOW I'M
A CONSCRIPTED WORKER.

424
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,760
YES. WHY DOES MONSIEUR DUPAIN
WANT TO GO HOME?

425
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,120
UH, COMPASSIONATE LEAVE,
DEATH IN THE FAMILY.

426
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,040
CAN YOU DO IT?

427
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,480
YES. IT'S
QUITE SIMPLE.

428
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,360
I MIGHT EVEN MANAGE A LETTER
ON YOUR BEREAVEMENT.

429
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
LET'S SEE.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

430
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
UH...FRENCH POLICE...

431
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
AND GERMANY...

432
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,480
HEALTH OFFICER...

433
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,160
MILITARY DISTRICT.

434
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,600
THEY KEEP CHANGING.

435
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,120
THAT'S VERY
INCONSIDERATE OF THEM.

436
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,360
VERY. HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE?

437
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,760
YOU MUST REALIZE
IT'S MY BUSY TIME.

438
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,640
EVERYBODY WANTS TO ESCAPE
IN THE GOOD WEATHER.

439
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,920
JUST, UH, BE PATIENT,
ALL RIGHT?

440
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,360
BE PATIENT. YEAH.

441
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,880
THANKS.

442
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,040
HMM.

443
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,520
WHO THE HELL ARE THEY?

444
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,760
WHO THE HELL
ARE THOSE GUYS?

445
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
I'VE HAD IT. LOOK.

446
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,480
THEY SWITCHED
THE GUARDS ON ME.

447
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,240
THOSE GOONS ARE PATROLLING
OUTSIDE OF THE WASH HOUSE.

448
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,200
I KNOW.

449
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,160
WHAT?

450
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,080
HANS AND ANTON
HAVE BEEN SWITCHED

451
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,000
TO WATCH OVER
THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

452
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,440
COLBY'S FOOTBALL TEAM?

453
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,360
THOSE ARE MY GUARDS.
I NEEDED THEM.

454
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,280
IN 2 OR 3 WEEKS,
I WAS OUT OF HERE.

455
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,720
WELL, THAT'S BAD LUCK.

456
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,160
JUST BETWEEN OURSELVES,

457
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WAS A VERY GOOD PLAN.

458
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,360
HERE WE ARE.

459
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
OH, UH, LUIS,
THIS IS ARTHUR.

460
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,560
HELLO, ARTHUR.

461
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
SID, TERRY.

462
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,800
LUIS FERNANDEZ.

463
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,920
TERRY.

464
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,360
HERE'S YOUR BEDS
OVER HERE.

465
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,800
I'LL HAVE
A TOP ONE.

466
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,720
HELP YOURSELF.
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.

467
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,160
I'LL TAKE
THE BOTTOM ONE

468
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,600
IN CASE
I SLEEPWALK.

469
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,720
NOT BAD.

470
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,160
IT'S LIKE
THE SAVOY HOTEL.

471
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,600
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

472
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,520
AND NO BLEEDING
CHAMBERMAIDS.

473
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,960
IS THIS ONE?

474
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
HI, GUYS.

475
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

476
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,200
I'M JOINING THE TEAM.

477
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,520
OH? TELL ME EVERYTHING.

478
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,920
BEING ON THIS TEAM'S
A ONE-WAY TICKET

479
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,840
OUT OF HERE, RIGHT?

480
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
YOU'RE NOT ON THIS TEAM.

481
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,600
OH, YEAH,
SURE, I AM.

482
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,040
I'M THE TRAINER.

483
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,000
THE WHAT?

484
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,400
YOU FORGOT TO PUT IN
FOR A TRAINER.

485
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,200
MAYBE I CAN'T PLAY
YOUR KIND OF FOOTBALL,

486
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,600
BUT IN MY KIND,
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

487
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,000
ABOUT BRUISES, SPRAINS,
AND CHARLEY HORSES.

488
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,440
JUST GET
YOUR VON STEINER

489
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,880
TO GET ME
SOME BANDAGES,

490
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,280
SOME LINIMENT,
OIL, TAPES,

491
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,000
WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

492
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,320
I DON'T WANT
A TRAINER.

493
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,720
COLBY,
I'M A BALLPLAYER.

494
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,960
I DON'T WANT
TO BE LEFT OUT

495
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
OF SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

496
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,800
PULL THE OTHER ONE.

497
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,160
I JUST WANT TO BE
AROUND THE GUYS.

498
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
BULLSHIT.

499
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,960
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

500
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,680
I DON'T NEED
A CON MAN.

501
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,280
YOUR TEAM
WRECKED MY ESCAPE.

502
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,880
HOW?

503
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,280
I WAS READY AND
WAITING FOR MY PAPERS.

504
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,680
I WAS GOING
THROUGH THE WASH HUT,

505
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,040
BUT ONLY IF THOSE
2 GOONS WERE ON DUTY.

506
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,680
NOW THOSE 2 GOONS HAVE
BEEN TRANSFERRED TO YOU,

507
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,960
SO THE ONLY WAY OUT
IS THROUGH THAT TEAM.

508
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,880
NO.

509
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,440
WHY NOT?

510
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,360
I WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR DEATH.

511
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,000
YOU'LL GET
YOURSELF SHOT.

512
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
THAT'S MY CHOICE,
ISN'T IT?

513
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,720
IS IT YES OR NO?

514
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,120
OK.

515
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,120
TONY.

516
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,560
NICE TO SEE YOU.

517
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,000
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

518
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,440
HELLO.
HATCH, THE TRAINER.

00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,840
YEAH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

521
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,240
I'LL TELL YOU
IN A MINUTE.

522
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,160
COLBY'S MY NAME.
HELLO.

523
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,040
HATCH, THE TRAINER.
WELCOME TO MY HOLIDAY CAMP.

524
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,480
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

525
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,360

YES.

HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

COME INSIDE.

530
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
HATCH, THE TRAINER.

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT,
AND I'LL EXPLAIN.

532
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,840
THE EXTRA FOOD
IS PART OF THE DEAL.

533
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,640
WE STILL RESPOND TO
ROLL CALL 3 TIMES A DAY.

534
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,080
BUT APART FROM THAT,
WE MAKE OUR OWN RULES.

535
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,440
THERE IS NO RANK HERE.

536
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,360
THIS IS A FOOTBALL TEAM.

537
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
I AM THE CAPTAIN
AND THE MANAGER.

538
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,720
ANY QUESTIONS?

539
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
WELL...

540
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,120
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DID IT.

541
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,720
CHEERS ANYWAY.

542

IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME,

543
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,200
AND NONE OF US
FEELS LIKE

544
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,760
OR LOOKS LIKE
WORLD-CLASS PLAYERS.

545
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,920
IT'LL BE DIFFICULT GETTING
INTO SHAPE WITH THOSE BOOTS,

546
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
SO LET'S HOPE
THE GERMAN MAJOR

547
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,240
GIVES US
THE PROPER GEAR.

548
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,680
WELL...

549
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,600
UH, WE GOT TO START
SOMEWHERE,

550
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,000
SO LET'S START
WITH BASICS, SHALL WE?

551
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,360
SLOW, EASY STRETCHING
AND PULLING, OK?

552
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,920
WE WON'T BE NEEDING
THAT FOR A WHILE.

553
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,560
LET'S GO.

THAT'S OK.

NO PROBLEM,
I CAN HANDLE THAT,

566

WRONG WITH YOU,

NOT LATER, OK?

YES, YES.
