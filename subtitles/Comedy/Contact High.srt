1
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
It's obviously a major malfunction.

2
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:20,115
...their President is a crook.
Well, I'm not a crook.

3
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,499
Robert Kennedy was shot
in that ballroom.

4
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:32,352
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!

5
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,339
A sniper has fired
at President Kennedy.

6
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:46,597
Or have you ever been
a member of the Communist party?

7
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,856
Hi-yo, Silver!

8
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:59,214
... 194 1...

9
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,906
...a date which will live in infamy.

10
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:11,126
We bring you the final edition of
our Maxwell House Good News of 1939.

11
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,915
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North
America, and all the ships at sea.

12
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,979
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

13
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,876
CQ...

14
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,260
...this is W-9 GFO.

15
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,798
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here.
Come back?

16
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,060
CQ...

17
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,837
...this is W-9 GFO here.

18
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:52,982
Come back?

19
00:03:56,955 --> 00:04:00,955
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.
Is anybody out there?

20
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,209
Not getting anything.

21
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:04,988
Small moves, Ellie.

22
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,841
Small moves.

23
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:14,076
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here.
Come back?

24
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,790
Copy, W-9 GFO.

25
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,826
K-4 WLD here.

26
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:20,723
What do I say?

27
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,388
Just be yourself.

28
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,470
Where are you, K-4 WLD?
Come back?

29
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,071
Pensacola.
Over.

30
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,854
Pensacola, where's Pensacola?

31
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:30,694
I'll give you a hint.

32
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:32,502
Orange juice.

33
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,906
Copy that, K-4 WLD. How's the
weather down there in Florida?

34
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:42,148
Pensacola, Florida.

35
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,739
I have to tell you, Sparks.

36
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,850
1,116 miles.

37
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,569
Pretty good.

38
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,351
That's the farthest yet.

39
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,065
Can we hear all the way to New York?

40
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:08,554
Sure.

41
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,899
Can we hear all the way
to California?

42
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:13,914
I don't see why not.

43
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,614
Can we hear all the way to Alaska?

44
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,354
On a really clear day.

45
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,537
Can we hear all the way to China?

46
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:24,063
On a really, really clear day.

47
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:28,083
Could we talk to the moon?

48
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,520
If it's a big enough radio,
I don't see why not.

49
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:34,223
Could we talk to Jupiter?

50
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,915
Or what's the one after that?

51
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:38,798
Don't tell me.

52
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:42,512
I'll give you a hint.

53
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:44,108
Hula-Hoops.

54
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,283
Saturn!
Could we talk to Saturn?

55
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,441
Dad, could we talk to Mom?

56
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,300
I don't think even the biggest radio
could reach that far.

57
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,200
All right, no more stalling.

58
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,642
Pensacola!

59
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:25,747
That's a beauty.

60
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,659
Now get some sleep.

61
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,347
Hey, Dad?

62
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:42,004
Do you think there's people
on other planets?

63
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,922
I don't know, Sparks.

64
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:47,053
But I guess I'd say...

65
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,383
...if it is just us...

66
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,208
...it seems like
an awful waste of space.

67
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:15,233
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

68
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,057
Repeat. This is W-9 GFO.
Come back?

69
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,100
I'm going to need a bigger antenna.

70
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:56,782
What do you think, Doc Arroway?

71
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Isn't she a beauty?

72
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:03,772
It'll do.

73
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,949
The village is five miles away.

74
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,365
There's a general store
in the cantina.

75
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:10,657
They can order anything
from San Juan.

76
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,352
When can I get dish time?

77
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:16,101
Dr. Clark said you couldn't wait.
Your first shift is tonight.

78
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:13,456
Go back.

79
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:18,106
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.

80
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,473
There!

81
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:23,928
-Right there?
-You hear it? Right there, that's it.

82
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:27,874
All right, 1221 .46.
That's well within the L-band.

83
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,320
Check off-axis.

84
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,402
On it.

85
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,809
It's not in the neighborhood.

86
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,635
Here it is.
J-1741 ...

87
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,611
... + 2748.

88
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,928
Catalogued November 4, 1982.
Pulsar.

89
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,730
Must've been the glitch
in the timing that threw me.

90
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,668
Must've been a starquake.

91
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:03,913
I think it's great that you listen.
Most don't do that anymore.

92
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:06,926
It's just an old habit.
It makes it feel more real.

93
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,130
Ellie.

94
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:09,539
Kent Clark.

95
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,986
They said you'd been...

96
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,580
...up at Owen's Valley
working under Drumlin.

97
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,209
How'd you like him?

98
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:25,439
That much? About what I'd expect
after what he had to say about you.

99
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,544
And what was that?

100
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:29,554
That you are brilliant...

101
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,069
...driven...

102
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:32,892
...a major pain in the ass...

103
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:36,007
...and obsessed with a field
of study he considers tantamount...

104
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:37,693
...to professional suicide.

105
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,465
Anything else?

106
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,393
Those were the highlights.

107
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,366
David, Dr. Vernon.
Dr. Arroway.

108
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:49,972
Believe you've already met our tireless
research assistant, Mr. Fisher...

109
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:53,054
...as well as his cologne.

110
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:56,057
Brook's looking at the black hole
in M-87.

111
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,002
Ellie's studying Markarian 541,
a major gamma ray source.

112
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:04,935
Dr. Arroway will be spending her
precious telescope time listening for...

113
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:07,758
...listening for...

114
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,488
Little green men.

115
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:18,886
One down...

116
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:21,083
...a couple billion to go.

117
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,727
Arecibo, right?

118
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,133
Does it show?

119
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,390
Cracker Jack?

120
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:46,407
No, thanks.

121
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:47,928
Mind if I sit down?

122
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:53,661
I hear the locals,
they call it "El Radar."

123
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,552
Convinced it has some
dark military purpose.

124
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,399
I think we're harmless.

125
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,038
Palmer Joss.

126
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,279
-Ellie Arroway.
-Nice to meet you, Ellie.

127
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,273
What are you studying up there?

128
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:11,543
The usual.

129
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:15,447
Nebulae, quasars, pulsars,
stuff like that.

130
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,380
What are you writing?

131
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,816
The usual.
Nouns, adverbs...

132
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:21,634
...adjective here and there.

133
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,891
I work on a project, SETI.

134
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,708
Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence?

135
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,600
That is out there!

136
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,080
Are you a student or something?

137
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:37,717
I'm a writer.
I'm writing a book.

138
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,586
I'm here doing research...

139
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,848
...about how technology affects
Third World cultures.

140
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:45,706
I'm also looking for this guy,
David Drumlin.

141
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:50,029
He's head of the National Science
Foundation. I want an interview.

142
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,132
I take it you know him?

143
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,105
You could say that.

144
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,901
SETI.

145
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,770
That's fringe!

146
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:05,538
I've crossed paths with him. Something
like that must really chap his ass.

147
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:09,684
Compass.

148
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,970
That's for you.

149
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,264
You better keep this.

150
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,135
Might save your life someday.

151
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,523
Have dinner with me tonight?

152
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:34,751
I don't make a good
research subject. I'm not quotable.

153
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,421
No quotes.
Scout's honor.

154
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:39,174
Good meal, good company.

155
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:41,344
I've got to go.

156
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,297
Drumlin's coming in Tuesday.

157
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:04,462
Now I remember
why I took that desk job.

158
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,064
Dr. Drumlin, how are you?

159
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:11,214
Glad you could make it.

160
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:15,285
If I'd known it took 3 planes,
I might've reconsidered.

161
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:16,896
How is that new office?

162
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,680
Still settling in. They already want to
give half my budget to the Pentagon.

163
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,866
Still waiting for E.T. to call?

164
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,566
Good to see you too!

165
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,096
Asshole!

166
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,509
Looks like it's
going to be a long night.

167
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,290
Science must be accountable to the
people paying for it, the taxpayers.

168
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:40,848
We must stop wasting money
on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

169
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:43,874
...and spend it on practical,
measurable ways...

170
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,758
...to improve the lives
of the people who are paying.

171
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:50,077
Not unlike my L-band,
globular clusters work.

172
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,299
You want to do away
with all pure research now?

173
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,870
What's wrong with science
being practical? Even profitable?

174
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,259
Nothing, as long as your motive...

175
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,359
...is the search for truth. Which is
what the pursuit of science is.

176
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,429
That's an interesting position
from a man...

177
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,256
...on a crusade against
the evils of technology...

178
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:12,777
...Father Joss.

179
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:16,693
I'm not against technology, Doctor.
I'm against...

180
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,120
...the men who deify it
at the expense of human truth.

181
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,582
Kent, I need to have
a word with you. Over here, please.

182
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:36,397
You think that hurt my chances
with that interview?

183
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,513
You're a priest?

184
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,611
Not really.

185
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:45,051
I got my Masters in Divinity...

186
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:48,945
...then left the seminary to do
secular humanitarian work...

187
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:51,657
...coordinating
Third World churches.

188
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,509
I couldn't live
with the celibacy thing.

189
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:01,185
You could call me
a man of the cloth...

190
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:04,043
...without the cloth.

191
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,007
You want to get out of here?

192
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,718
You see that large W-shaped
constellation there? That's Cassiopeia.

193
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:20,534
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

194
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:22,652
I listen to them a lot.

195
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:25,212
It's a remnant of a supernova.

196
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,827
When did you know
you wanted to be an astronomer?

197
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,434
When I was about eight years old...

198
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,420
...watching the sunset...

199
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:38,572
...I asked Dad, "What's that bright
star over there?"

200
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:45,125
He said that it wasn't a star.
It was...

201
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,493
...a whole planet called Venus...

202
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:56,301
...which should be over there soon.

203
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:59,718
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?

204
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:03,395
Because they thought
it was so beautiful and glowing.

205
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,300
But they didn't know...

206
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,555
...that it's filled with...

207
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:13,153
...deadly gases
and sulfuric acid rain."

208
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,030
Wow, I thought,
"This is it! I'm hooked!"

209
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,948
There are four hundred billion
stars out there...

210
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,111
...just in our galaxy alone.

211
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,670
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

212
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:34,197
...if just one out of a million
of those had life...

213
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:38,534
...and if just one out of a million
of those had intelligent life...

214
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,860
...there would be literally millions
of civilizations out there.

215
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,446
If there wasn't...

216
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,509
...it'd be an awful waste of space.

217
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:57,645
Amen.

218
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:10,463
So I was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

219
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,431
And then I felt something.
I don't know.

220
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,451
All I know is that I wasn't alone.

221
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:26,017
For the first time in my life
I wasn't scared of nothing...

222
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,631
...not even dying.

223
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,130
It was God.

224
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:40,757
And there's no chance that...

225
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:45,421
...you had this experience because
some part of you needed to have it?

226
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:50,209
I'm a reasonably intelligent guy,
but this...

227
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,713
My intellect
couldn't even touch this.

228
00:18:57,364 --> 00:18:58,324
No.

229
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,350
I've been to Sunday school
a few times.

230
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,550
And?

231
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:11,155
I kept asking all these
really annoying questions like...

232
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,621
..."Where did Mrs. Cain come from?"

233
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,843
And pretty soon they asked my dad...

234
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,788
...if he wouldn't mind
keeping me home from now on.

235
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:23,433
Your dad...

236
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,677
Is it this guy?

237
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:28,068
Yeah.

238
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:32,208
You're close to him, aren't you?

239
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:36,544
I was. He died
when I was nine years old.

240
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,846
I never got to know my mother.

241
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,794
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:50,238
That's got to be tough.

243
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,382
Being alone.

244
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,499
What do you say...

245
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:10,158
...we pack a picnic tomorrow
and hike up to Mount Arecibo?

246
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,020
I don't think I can.
I've got to work.

247
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:19,218
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I know a great dive.

248
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,296
No, I don't think so.

249
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:28,035
Ellie, did I miss something?

250
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,415
No.

251
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,430
Shit, I'm late!

252
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:37,267
I told Kent
that I'd be there at 10:30.

253
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:41,736
I'm not trying to push you.

254
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,219
I've wanted to look at
this sector for weeks.

255
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,122
Just hang out...

256
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,405
...and sleep in.
There's food in the fridge.

257
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,279
How can I reach you?

258
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,109
Just leave your number.
I'll call you.

259
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:18,866
Dad!

260
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,471
It's starting,
you're going to miss it!

261
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,205
Dad, there's another one!
Hurry up!

262
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,747
In a minute, Sparks!
I'm almost done.

263
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,492
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!

264
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,421
I'll get the medicine.

265
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:53,854
I know it's hard
to understand this now...

266
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:59,206
...but we aren't always meant to know
why things happen the way they do.

267
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,135
Sometimes,
we just have to accept it...

268
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,199
...as God's will.

269
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,276
I should have kept medicine
in the downstairs bathroom.

270
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,235
Then I could've gotten to it sooner.

271
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:39,438
CQ...

272
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:43,623
...this is W-9 GFO.
Do you copy?

273
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,496
Dad, this is Ellie.
Come back.

274
00:24:52,972 --> 00:24:54,852
This is Eleanor Arroway...

275
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:58,063
...transmitting on 14.2 megahertz.

276
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:06,346
Are you there?

277
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:09,896
Come back.

278
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,077
Are you there?

279
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,019
Dad, this is Ellie.

280
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,446
Hi, Kent.
What are you doing up so early?

281
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:59,015
I was thinking...

282
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:01,907
...we'd make a pretty good team.

283
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:06,016
We could put together
an ad hoc SETI program.

284
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:08,611
You know the Very Large Array
in New Mexico?

285
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,120
It's a dynamite place
to do SETI work...

286
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:13,142
What are you talking about?

287
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,357
Drumlin pulled the plug.

288
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,140
We're homeless.

289
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,055
It's true, you pulled the plug?

290
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:37,811
You can't see it now,
but I'm doing you a favor.

291
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:41,925
You're too promising a scientist to
waste your gifts on this nonsense.

292
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,219
I don't consider what could be...

293
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:47,231
...the most important
human discovery nonsense!

294
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:49,002
400 billion stars...

295
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:52,026
And two probabilities.
One, there's intelligent life...

296
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:54,756
...but too far away
to contact in your lifetime.

297
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:57,367
-And two!
-You're making a decision...

298
00:26:57,947 --> 00:27:00,867
There's nothing but gases
and carbon compounds...

299
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,202
...and you're wasting your time!

300
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,377
In the meantime,
you won't be taken seriously.

301
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,309
Your career will be over!

302
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,706
So what?

303
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,489
It's my life!

304
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,630
Hey, Kent.
You were right.

305
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:54,671
Screw Drumlin. We'll raise the money
ourselves. We'll go to New Mexico.

306
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,317
Chicago's set.
Let me know how it goes.

307
00:27:57,618 --> 00:28:00,418
I've got more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

308
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:03,748
Did that investor from Houston
ever get back to us?

309
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:06,048
I'll hit him up on my way to L.A.

310
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,338
Beg for some of that
Hollywood money!

311
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:11,595
They've been making
money off aliens for years.

312
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:14,949
-Begging is good for the soul.
-We'll see.

313
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:16,993
Just do me a favor.

314
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:19,756
Try not to be too...confrontational.

315
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,559
Confrontational? Me?
What do you mean?

316
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:24,464
I'll see if I left anything.

317
00:28:57,832 --> 00:29:01,472
It's a unique time in our history,
in the history of any civilization.

318
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:04,478
It's the moment
of the acquisition of technology.

319
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:07,561
That's the moment
where contact becomes possible.

320
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:10,671
The Very Large Array
in New Mexico...

321
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,135
...is the key to our chances
for success.

322
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:15,437
With its 27
linked radio telescopes...

323
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:19,134
...we can search more accurately
than at any other facility.

324
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:24,009
We've gotten approval to buy the
telescope time from the government.

325
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,201
Now all we really need is the money.

326
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,880
A nice presentation, Doctor.

327
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:33,552
But while our foundation arm
has a mandate to support...

328
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,885
...experimental programs,
your proposal...

329
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:41,105
...seems less like science,
and more like science fiction.

330
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,133
Science fiction.

331
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:49,935
You're right.

332
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:52,147
It's crazy.

333
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:55,729
In fact, it's even worse
than that: nuts!

334
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,321
Want to hear something nutty?

335
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,030
Two guys wanted to build
a thing called an airplane.

336
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,264
People go in it and fly like birds.
Ridiculous, right?

337
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,319
What about breaking
the sound barrier...

338
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:11,202
...or rockets to the moon, or atomic
energy or a mission to Mars?

339
00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:13,164
Science fiction, right?

340
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,986
All I'm asking is for you to
just have the tiniest bit of vision.

341
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:22,652
To step back
and look at the big picture.

342
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:28,048
Take a chance on something which could
end up the most impactful moment...

343
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,706
...for humanity, for the history...

344
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,667
...of history.

345
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:37,438
I'm sorry.

346
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:40,164
I just spent 13 months...

347
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,537
...coming into rooms
and talking to people like you.

348
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:45,853
You're my last chance.

349
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,890
Sorry I wasted your time.

350
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:49,725
Doctor.

351
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:51,663
Yes, sir.

352
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,302
You have your money.

353
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,480
Thank you.

354
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:12,573
Thank you.

355
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:03,523
Perfect cast!
Come on, fishy!

356
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:05,378
Frank, look at the size...

357
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:07,529
...of that son of a bitch!

358
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:21,927
Welcome back, Dr. C.

359
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:23,698
How'd it go?

360
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,950
How was the trip?

361
00:32:26,222 --> 00:32:27,662
I've had better.

362
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:31,271
Drumlin!
Is this a personal vendetta now?

363
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:35,325
There's been enormous pressure
from other scientists as well.

364
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,653
It doesn't matter. Hadden's funding
us for 2 more years.

365
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:43,351
The government doesn't want their
telescopes used by the high priestess...

366
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:45,627
...of the desert anymore.

367
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:47,965
What?

368
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:51,411
Staring at TV static for hours,
listening to washing machines.

369
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,680
These stories get out!

370
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,532
I was seeking patterns in the chaos!

371
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,848
It doesn't matter,
we're a joke to them.

372
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,423
They want us out!

373
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:04,034
We've got 3 months
till the paperwork goes through.

374
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:10,072
I'll start looking for
other funding.

375
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:14,345
Could you face reality?
Just this once? We lost.

376
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,490
It's over.

377
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,301
Fine.

378
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:26,577
I'm not stopping.

379
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:30,187
If I have to, I'll go it alone.
I've done it before.

380
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:23,575
My guest tonight is author
and theologian Palmer Joss.

381
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,073
He's become a spiritual counselor...

382
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,719
...and a recent fixture
at the White House.

383
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,950
"God's Diplomat, "
according to The New York Times.

384
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:35,761
His latest book, "Losing Faith, "
is currently number one...

385
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:38,322
...on that publication's
bestseller list.

386
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:41,508
Thanks for being here.
You've had quite a ride...

387
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:43,197
...the last few years.

388
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:45,066
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.

389
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:48,048
Fish, I was thinking.

390
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:52,761
Who would make the best astronomers?
Think about it.

391
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:57,912
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

392
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:00,201
I give.

393
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,930
Vampires!

394
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,767
Are you anti-technology
and anti-science?

395
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:06,723
No, not at all.

396
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:09,846
The question that
I'm asking is this:

397
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:12,073
Are we happier...

398
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:16,161
...as a human race? Is the world
fundamentally a better place...

399
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:18,393
...because of science
and technology?

400
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:21,544
We shop at home,
we surf the Web...

401
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:24,374
...but at the same time
we feel emptier...

402
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:27,582
...and more
cut off from each other...

403
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:29,543
...than at any other time
in human history.

404
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:32,266
We're becoming
a synthesized society...

405
00:35:32,706 --> 00:35:34,746
...in a hurry to get to the...

406
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,162
We're looking for the meaning.

407
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,805
What is the meaning?

408
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,667
We have mindless jobs,
take frantic vacations.

409
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:59,078
Deficit finance trips
to the mall to buy things...

410
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,810
...that we think will fill
these holes in our lives.

411
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:05,776
Any wonder we've lost
our sense of direction?

412
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:48,291
Holy shit!

413
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:07,597
Right ascension...

414
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:11,607
...18 hours, 36 minutes,
56.2 seconds!

415
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,455
Declination...

416
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:17,736
... + 36 degrees, 46 minutes...

417
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,274
...56.2 seconds!

418
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,270
Confirm!

419
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:27,537
Right ascension,
18 hours, 36 minutes...

420
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,915
...56.2 seconds!

421
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:33,389
Is anybody awake in there?
I'm moving the array!

422
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,595
Confirm!

423
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,289
Boss has a bogey!

424
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,796
Right ascension, 18 hours...

425
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,433
We're on it!

426
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:46,653
36 hours...

427
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,950
...47 minutes and 1 second!

428
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:50,812
Strong possible...

429
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:53,434
...pulse chain on sub-array four!

430
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:56,187
I'm moving the rest.
Confirm coordinates!

431
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:59,012
Check the status of the array.

432
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,700
She's doing all the dishes.

433
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,056
Systems nominal.

434
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,056
Hello.

435
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,353
Full systems check!

436
00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:14,872
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system.

437
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:17,957
Stay on top of
the systems diagnostics!

438
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,006
Check reference point offsets.

439
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:24,126
And I want you off-axis
on 27 the second we get there!

440
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,899
And tell Willie
to break out the big boy!

441
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,590
Copy that.

442
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:32,333
Yeah! Go, Ellie!

443
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:35,636
I hear it on the headphones.
We got to be sure about this.

444
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:38,181
Give me another array status.

445
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:43,467
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

446
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,355
But there's a bad drive on 16.

447
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,021
The four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

448
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,053
There's a bad drive on 16.
Copy that?

449
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:57,549
What shall I do
about the source queue?

450
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,721
Forget it and hold the queue.

451
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:04,136
Get ready to set the target frequency
to manual the second we're aligned.

452
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:08,758
Do you copy? I want you to go
off-axis on 27 the second we're there!

453
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:11,709
And leave the LO frequency
where it is!

454
00:39:12,154 --> 00:39:15,154
Don't let it get away!
If you lose it, scan the band!

455
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:18,052
Run every frequency
you can think of.

456
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:24,784
How you doing?

457
00:39:29,387 --> 00:39:30,467
Talk to me, guys.

458
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:34,243
Partially polarized moving pulses,
amplitude modulated.

459
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:38,124
We're locked. Systems are fine.
What's the frequency?

460
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:39,486
4.46...

461
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:41,176
...23 gigahertz.

462
00:39:43,074 --> 00:39:44,634
Hydrogen times pi.

463
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:46,157
Told you!

464
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:48,094
Strong sucker too!

465
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,688
I got it!
I'm patched in!

466
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:52,502
Let me hear.

467
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,542
Listen to that.

468
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:03,774
Make me a liar, Fish.

469
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,994
It could be AWACS
out of Kirkland jamming us.

470
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:08,397
But I doubt it.

471
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:10,775
See if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.

472
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,992
Patch it back
and give me the off-axis.

473
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,264
-We recording?
-Never stopped.

474
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,660
Thank you, Elmer!

475
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:22,682
AWACS status is negative.

476
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:23,885
White Sands?

477
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:25,697
On this frequency? No.

478
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:27,503
I'll punch up the darks.

479
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,890
How's spying tonight?

480
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:34,305
Come on!

481
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:39,055
NORAD's not tracking
any snoops in this vector.

482
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:40,894
Shuttle's in sleep mode.

483
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,365
Okay, point source confirmed.

484
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:45,267
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

485
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,341
Position?

486
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:48,985
I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra.

487
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:50,857
-Vega?
-Can't be!

488
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:53,095
It's only 26 light years away.

489
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,226
-Peak intensity?
-Coming up!

490
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,279
Vega.

491
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:01,822
Vega. I scanned it a bunch of times
at Arecibo. It was always negative.

492
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,111
Got it!

493
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:05,118
Reading over 100 janskys.

494
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:08,305
Jesus! I can pick it up on my...

495
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:12,289
No!

496
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,590
Come on!

497
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:50,005
It's restarting.

498
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:53,194
Wait a minute.
Those are numbers.

499
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:55,153
That was 3, before it was 2.

500
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,168
Base 10 numbers.
Count and see how far we get.

501
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,880
One.

502
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:08,539
Seven.

503
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:12,898
Those are primes.

504
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:16,252
2, 3, 5, 7 are all prime numbers.

505
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:18,642
No way that's a natural phenomenon!

506
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:21,649
Let's just calm down
and pull up the star file on Vega.

507
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:26,429
It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young.

508
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:28,374
It can't have a planetary system...

509
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,730
...let alone life
or a technological civilization.

510
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:34,475
Maybe they're not from there,
they're visiting.

511
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,986
Spacecraft? This system's full
of debris. It'd get clobbered.

512
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:42,461
Not if they used their
laser blasters and photon torpedoes.

513
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:45,681
-That's not funny.
-How else can we explain it!

514
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:49,184
He's right. If we go public
with this and we're wrong...

515
00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:51,634
...it's over. We're cooked.

516
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:55,885
I wish Kent was here.

517
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,430
Whatever it is, let's do something.
Vega will set.

518
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:07,154
Position confirmed. We've got 4.4623
gigahertz, confirmed.

519
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,260
We've got 112 janskys.

520
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,792
Do you have a source location yet?

521
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:17,751
We put it right smack in the middle.

522
00:43:18,517 --> 00:43:19,717
Vega.

523
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:24,738
Thanks. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

524
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,350
Right-o.

525
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:39,392
101 . The pulse sequenced...

526
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,911
...through every prime number
between 2 and 101 .

527
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:46,572
Who do we call now?

528
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:50,856
Everybody.

529
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:02,059
The rumors are flying,
the implications extraordinary.

530
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:04,175
Detection of an unidentified...

531
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:08,541
...radio source from space
can neither be confirmed nor denied.

532
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:10,766
But the military arriving...

533
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:14,492
Sources close to the VLA
report they have been contacted...

534
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,770
...by some form
of intelligent being...

535
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:21,421
...living outside our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation.

536
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:26,739
I want all of these people
out of here.

537
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,940
Where's the girl?

538
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:34,907
22 stations worldwide...

539
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:36,531
...now confirm the signal.

540
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,357
Vega's now below our horizon.

541
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,875
You're hearing the signal
from the Russian...

542
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,740
Get decryption people here.

543
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,976
Lunacharsky's visiting at Cal Tech.

544
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:46,589
Explain this to me.

545
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:50,735
If the source of the signal is so
sophisticated...why the remedial math?

546
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:52,471
Why not just speak English?

547
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:55,977
Maybe because 70%%% of the planet
speaks other languages.

548
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:59,006
Mathematics is the
only truly universal language.

549
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,231
It's no coincidence
that they're using primes.

550
00:45:02,587 --> 00:45:03,467
I don't get it.

551
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:04,957
Prime numbers.

552
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:08,576
Integers only divisible
by themselves and 1 .

553
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:14,403
We think this may be a beacon,
an announcement...

554
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,493
...to get our attention.

555
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:20,332
If it's attention you want,
you got that. One thing: Vega.

556
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:24,017
People have looked at Vega
for years, with no results.

557
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:27,167
Yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

558
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,820
It's hardly yesterday.

559
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:31,604
The signal's been transmitting
for 26 years.

560
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:34,446
Excuse me, who are you?

561
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:37,037
Michael Kitz,
National Security Advisor.

562
00:45:37,346 --> 00:45:38,626
Your reputation...

563
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:42,128
First, ask the gentlemen
with the guns to wait outside.

564
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,938
This is a civilian facility.

565
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:52,935
With all due respect...

566
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:54,043
Excuse me.

567
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:57,701
Hi! I'm so glad you're back!

568
00:45:58,377 --> 00:45:59,537
Come hear this.

569
00:46:00,297 --> 00:46:01,577
Is this great?

570
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:04,079
-Who are all these people?
-I have no idea.

571
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,426
Sit down. We need help
with the spectrum analysis.

572
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,286
-I'll get on it.
-Headsets.

573
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:11,682
I'll just come right to the point.

574
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:15,821
Announcing this all over the world may
well be a breach of national security.

575
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:17,793
It's not a person-to-person call.

576
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:22,033
You think a civilization sending this
message intends it just for Americans?

577
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,173
You might have consulted us.

578
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:28,464
-The contents could be very sensitive.
-You want to classify prime numbers?

579
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:32,456
Due to earth's rotation, we're
in line with Vega only hours a day.

580
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:36,963
The only way to monitor the signal
is to cooperate with other stations.

581
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:41,511
If Dr. Arroway hadn't acted quickly,
we'd have lost key elements.

582
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:43,338
Fine, they've got the primes.

583
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:46,292
But if a more significant
transmission is to come...

584
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:48,537
We need help to receive and decode.

585
00:46:48,826 --> 00:46:51,346
You understand
that my job is to protect...

586
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:54,589
-Listen.
-I hear it.

587
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:55,881
Hear what?

588
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:57,049
Harmonic.

589
00:46:57,297 --> 00:47:00,977
Bingo! I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

590
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:02,863
There's a lot more here.

591
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,699
-Get on the negative sideband.
-I'm already on it.

592
00:47:05,977 --> 00:47:07,057
What is it?

593
00:47:07,312 --> 00:47:08,752
Another signal!

594
00:47:08,981 --> 00:47:11,741
A second signal at double
the frequency. Looks like...

595
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:13,975
Get a TV monitor!

596
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:16,581
Patch it into the image processor.

597
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,068
Want the new data?

598
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:20,048
Yeah, the new one we just recorded.

599
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:22,211
David, explain this to me, please.

600
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:25,181
There's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

601
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:26,426
We're hot.

602
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:29,316
Go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

603
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:31,873
You're patched in.

604
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,462
It's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

605
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:42,001
What do you make of that?

606
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,160
It's two different
interlaced frames. I'm framing one.

607
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:51,263
-lt's just noise.
-Trying frame two.

608
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:55,787
I've got an offset carrier.
I think it's audio.

609
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:57,334
Plug it in!

610
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:02,926
Center that segment.

611
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:04,266
Centering.

612
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:09,849
Can you clean it up?

613
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:11,511
I'm working on it.

614
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:25,909
What the hell...?

615
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:27,919
Try zooming out.

616
00:48:31,978 --> 00:48:32,898
Freeze!

617
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:34,345
Reverse values.

618
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:37,746
Try zooming out again.

619
00:48:41,826 --> 00:48:43,906
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock...

620
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,060
My God!

621
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,244
What's going on?

622
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:58,127
You're not going to believe this.

623
00:49:11,662 --> 00:49:13,342
Does anybody speak German?

624
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,155
"I declare the Games in Berlin...

625
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:19,978
...at the celebration...

626
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:23,018
...of the first Olympics
of the New Era...

627
00:49:23,346 --> 00:49:24,626
...as opened."

628
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:36,847
Get me the White House.

629
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,020
20 million people died
defeating the bastard...

630
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:43,009
...and he's our first ambassador
to outer space?

631
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:46,494
The broadcast of the '36 Olympics
was the first TV transmission...

632
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,320
...that went into space.

633
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:51,831
Sending it back is a way of saying,
"Hello, we heard you."

634
00:49:52,138 --> 00:49:54,338
Or, "Sieg Heil,
you're our kind of people."

635
00:49:54,642 --> 00:49:57,042
Hitler's politics
have nothing to do with this.

636
00:49:57,354 --> 00:50:00,874
It's unlikely they understood it.
People must understand...

637
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:03,433
The people are
in very good hands, Doctor.

638
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,419
We'll take it from here.

639
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,454
Smile, folks. We're on.

640
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:11,029
A message of unknown origin
from deep space...

641
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:14,853
... was received by American
scientists. Now to the White House.

642
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:18,544
We're told the President
will have only a few remarks...

643
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:20,369
...about today's
extraordinary events...

644
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:23,878
...and that he won't be taking
any questions from the press.

645
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,224
Good afternoon.

646
00:50:33,157 --> 00:50:35,237
I'm glad to be joined by my...

647
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:37,334
...Science and Technology Advisor.

648
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,926
This is the product
of years of exploration...

649
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:45,332
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

650
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,275
Like all discoveries...

651
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,751
...this one will continue
to be reviewed...

652
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,099
...examined...

653
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:52,789
...and scrutinized.

654
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:55,941
It must be confirmed
by other scientists.

655
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:57,436
But clearly...

656
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:01,389
...the fact that this is being
explored is a vindication...

657
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:06,047
Fish, what is the story over here?
I thought Ellie was supposed to be on.

658
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:07,813
I don't know.

659
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:09,781
Guys?

660
00:51:12,214 --> 00:51:14,774
Those interlaced frames
we thought were noise?

661
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:18,447
This has structure.
I'm hearing structure.

662
00:51:19,892 --> 00:51:22,132
If this discovery is confirmed...

663
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:25,916
...it will be one of the most stunning
insights into our universe...

664
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:28,195
...that science has ever uncovered.

665
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,061
Its implications
are as far-reaching...

666
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,848
...and awe-inspiring
as can be imagined.

667
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:37,487
Even as it promises answers
to some of our oldest questions...

668
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:39,357
...it poses still others...

669
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,190
...even more fundamental.

670
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,306
We will continue
to listen closely...

671
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:45,074
...to what it has to say...

672
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:47,345
...as we continue
the search for answers...

673
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:48,842
...and for knowledge...

674
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:51,344
...that is as old
as humanity itself...

675
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:54,448
...but essential
to our people's future.

676
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:55,666
Thank you.

677
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,664
Is there a renewed assessment
of security threat?

678
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:01,995
I'll answer your questions
after a few corrections.

679
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:03,928
The message was received Friday...

680
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,209
...at 6:31 a.m.
Mountain Standard Time.

681
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:08,063
It was largely mathematical...

682
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:10,897
...and in spite of reports
to the contrary...

683
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:13,701
...appears to be
completely benign in nature.

684
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:17,814
Let me say that again.
The message is completely benign.

685
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:21,187
The President has contacted
the world's heads of state...

686
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:24,205
...and every security measure
is being taken.

687
00:52:24,529 --> 00:52:27,489
To better explain the events
of the last 48 hours...

688
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:32,066
...is the leader of the scientific team
that made this remarkable discovery...

689
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:36,339
...Dr. David Drumlin, special
Science Advisor to the President.

690
00:52:44,517 --> 00:52:45,837
Thank you, Rachel.

691
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:47,308
Hello.

692
00:52:49,274 --> 00:52:51,594
In 1936,
a very faint television signal...

693
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:56,023
...transmitted the opening ceremonies
of the Olympic Games as a show...

694
00:52:56,368 --> 00:52:58,768
...of German superior technology.

695
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:03,875
That signal left Earth at the speed
of light and 26 years later...

696
00:53:04,296 --> 00:53:07,776
...arrived in the vicinity
of the star we call Vega.

697
00:53:09,095 --> 00:53:12,775
That signal has been sent back to us
hugely amplified...

698
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:16,149
...an unmistakable
sign of intelligence.

699
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:17,479
Kent, go ahead.

700
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:21,893
The Adolf transmission used 25 frames
per second but we're receiving 50.

701
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:25,961
So we put the other 25
through search algorithms.

702
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:28,809
We found a series of markers
on the top of each frame.

703
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:30,804
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, go ahead!

704
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,246
Send it, Willie.

705
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:33,903
Here it comes.

706
00:53:37,345 --> 00:53:38,545
It's digital...

707
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:42,805
...massive amounts of data which
extend right to the higher harmonics.

708
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:45,046
Jackpot!

709
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:48,238
All right, as you'll see...

710
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:51,766
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

711
00:53:52,117 --> 00:53:54,837
...we found these sections.

712
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:58,483
We thought they were noise,
but they're actually data...

713
00:53:58,793 --> 00:54:00,073
...huge amounts of it.

714
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:04,497
When we combine this with the data
from the original signal...

715
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:08,004
...we get
these encrypted pages of text.

716
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:12,351
No two are alike and
we've uncovered over 10,000 already.

717
00:54:12,689 --> 00:54:14,769
What does it mean, Doctor?

718
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,999
We have no idea.
It could be anything.

719
00:54:18,364 --> 00:54:20,404
Volume 1 of an
Encyclopedia Galactica.

720
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:23,219
Instructions for us
on their colonization procedures.

721
00:54:23,496 --> 00:54:25,736
Moses with a few billion
new commandments.

722
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:28,082
How long will it take to decode it?

723
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,580
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...

724
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:34,884
We need to get
the best decryption people we have.

725
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:39,721
I intend to use the VLA
as my command post.

726
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:43,382
In the meantime, my office
has made out a preliminary budget.

727
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:44,933
Wait a minute.

728
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,435
This is a privately-funded
operation.

729
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:49,899
We lease dish time
from the government...

730
00:54:50,202 --> 00:54:52,762
This is a clear-cut case of eminent
domain.

731
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,080
I'm recommending to the President
we militarize this project.

732
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,821
What?! This is my project!

733
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,290
Nobody knows more about this
than I do. David, tell them...

734
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:05,555
Excuse me!
Could we calm down here?

735
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:07,301
I'm going to recommend that...

736
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,439
...Dr. Drumlin coordinate
the decryption effort.

737
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:13,932
But in light of Dr. Arroway's
long experience in these matters...

738
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:18,279
...for the time being, she will
direct operations at the VLA...

739
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:23,099
...understanding that future discoveries
will be kept in strict confidence...

740
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,661
...until such time
as the President...

741
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:29,643
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

742
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:30,929
Yes.

743
00:55:31,221 --> 00:55:33,421
This is CNN Breaking News.

744
00:55:34,058 --> 00:55:36,898
The President
called the message from Vega...

745
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,310
... "a stunning insight
into our universe..."

746
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:48,377
...as police clashed
with neo-Nazi protesters.

747
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:50,787
So, there's life on other planets.

748
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:54,524
Boy, this will really change
the Miss Universe contest.

749
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:59,500
Health officials worldwide are concerned
that the message from Vega...

750
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:02,406
...might trigger
a rash of mass suicides...

751
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:05,204
...not unlike recent cult deaths
near San Diego...

752
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,443
Even a scientist must admit...

753
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:11,931
...there are some pretty serious
religious overtones to all this.

754
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,525
Here's someone whose organization...

755
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:17,145
...is accused of conducting
its own inquisition:

756
00:56:17,497 --> 00:56:20,137
Richard Rank,
head of the Conservative Coalition.

757
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,502
Thank you.

758
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:25,712
This is yet another example of science
intruding into matters of faith.

759
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,130
This means they
have been reacting to TV signals...

760
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:33,237
...from the 1930s.
They're just getting them.

761
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:37,165
Imagine how disappointed
they'll be if they're Cubs fans.

762
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,530
We now go to Jeremy Roth,
who is reporting...

763
00:56:40,824 --> 00:56:44,144
...from the Very Large Array
near Socorro, New Mexico.

764
00:56:44,537 --> 00:56:45,897
Like a bolt from the blue it came.

765
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:48,128
"The Message from Vega"
has caused...

766
00:56:48,418 --> 00:56:50,698
...thousands of believers
and non-believers...

767
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:54,565
...to descend upon the VLA facility
here in the desert of New Mexico.

768
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:57,488
Many have come to protest,
many to pray...

769
00:56:57,765 --> 00:57:02,245
...but most have come to participate in
what's become the best show in town.

770
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:10,512
Well, I saw the thing
coming out of the sky

771
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:13,949
It had one long horn
and one big eye.

772
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:16,849
I commenced to shaking
and said, "Oo-ee!"

773
00:57:17,419 --> 00:57:20,299
"Looks like
a Purple People Eater to me"

774
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,980
Hail to Vega
Hail to Vega

775
00:58:19,052 --> 00:58:20,772
But they have failed!

776
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:24,027
It's the same people who,
again and again...

777
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:26,391
...have brought us
to the brink of destruction!

778
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:30,250
Who've polluted our air,
who've poisoned our water!

779
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:33,944
Now these scientists...

780
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:36,788
...have had their chance.

781
00:58:37,078 --> 00:58:40,078
Are these the kind of people...

782
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:44,222
...that you want
talking to your God for you?

783
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:50,141
Efforts continue around the clock.

784
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:53,951
But for now, almost 2 full weeks
after the message's arrival...

785
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:57,430
...scientists here at the VLA
still have no answers...

786
00:58:57,817 --> 00:58:59,457
...only more questions.

787
00:58:59,778 --> 00:59:02,938
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Socorro, New Mexico.

788
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,649
More on the quest for the message's
meaning, after this.

789
00:59:09,584 --> 00:59:11,344
They have to line up somehow.

790
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:13,469
This one doesn't fit, either.

791
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:16,319
We've tried over
a million permutations.

792
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,836
Always, I can only get
three corners to fit.

793
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:23,056
I don't understand
their significance.

794
01:00:06,585 --> 01:00:07,745
Somebody broke in...

795
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:15,179
Hello?

796
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:19,262
Whoever you are,
you broke into the database...

797
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,680
What? Now?

798
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:27,693
Where?

799
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,160
I'll be there.

800
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:11,203
You should feel fortunate.

801
01:01:11,973 --> 01:01:13,373
He hardly lands for anyone.

802
01:01:45,147 --> 01:01:46,947
Dr. Arroway.

803
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:52,144
I presume?

804
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:54,612
Mr. Hadden.

805
01:01:55,996 --> 01:01:59,036
I've had my eye on you
a long time, Doctor.

806
01:02:00,044 --> 01:02:03,364
I consider you one of my
most valuable long-term investments.

807
01:02:05,343 --> 01:02:07,703
And when it comes
to my investments...

808
01:02:09,516 --> 01:02:12,076
...I always do my homework.

809
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:18,622
Eleanor Ann Arroway...

810
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:21,263
...born 25th August, 1964...

811
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,135
...De Pere, Wisconsin.

812
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:27,450
Mother, Joanna, died from
complications during childbirth.

813
01:02:28,335 --> 01:02:30,935
Early testing indicated
high predisposition...

814
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:34,135
...towards science and mathematics.

815
01:02:34,928 --> 01:02:36,088
Father, Theodore...

816
01:02:36,305 --> 01:02:39,705
...advised to provide enrichment
activities in these areas...

817
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:42,623
...did so conscientiously
until his death...

818
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:46,699
...from myocardial infarction,
November 10, 1974.

819
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,440
You graduated from high school
in 1979...

820
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:53,708
...almost two full years early.

821
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,130
Awarded full scholarship, M.I.T...

822
01:02:57,378 --> 01:02:59,498
...graduated magna cum laude.

823
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,190
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...

824
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:05,427
...where you worked
on the lanthanide-doped ruby maser...

825
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:09,966
...dramatically increasing
the sensitivity of radio telescopes.

826
01:03:10,564 --> 01:03:14,004
Subsequently offered a teaching
position at Harvard University...

827
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,320
...which you turned down
to pursue SETI work...

828
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:20,976
...at the Arecibo Observatory
in Puerto Rico.

829
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:25,858
Changes in N.S.F. policy...

830
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:29,621
...gave rise to certain
funding problems...

831
01:03:30,802 --> 01:03:32,242
...at which point...

832
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:34,725
...you came to my attention.

833
01:03:36,185 --> 01:03:38,385
You compromised our security codes.

834
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,577
Once upon a time...

835
01:03:44,656 --> 01:03:46,696
...I was a hell of an engineer.

836
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,080
Please, sit, Doctor.

837
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:50,829
I have guests so rarely...

838
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:54,201
...it's important
they feel welcome in my home.

839
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,660
You live here?

840
01:03:58,343 --> 01:04:01,543
I find it convenient
to keep my interests...

841
01:04:03,017 --> 01:04:03,977
...mobile.

842
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:10,689
Anyway, I've had my fill
of life on the ground.

843
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:14,136
I guess I should...

844
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:18,226
I guess I should thank you for
having bailed me out all that time.

845
01:04:23,714 --> 01:04:25,794
I know a good bet when I see one.

846
01:04:28,262 --> 01:04:30,942
Earl Grey.
No sugar, no milk, I believe.

847
01:04:34,396 --> 01:04:36,196
What am I doing here?

848
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:49,621
The powers that be
have been very busy lately...

849
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:52,347
...positioning themselves...

850
01:04:52,631 --> 01:04:55,311
...for the game of the millennium.

851
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:04,790
Maybe I can help deal you back in.

852
01:05:06,276 --> 01:05:08,476
I didn't realize that I was out.

853
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,874
No. Maybe not out...

854
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:14,358
...but certainly
being handed your hat.

855
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:23,438
I've had a long time
to make enemies, Doctor.

856
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,700
There are many governments...

857
01:05:28,976 --> 01:05:30,456
...business interests...

858
01:05:31,146 --> 01:05:34,986
...even religious leaders that would
like to see me depart this earth.

859
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:39,054
And I'll grant them their wish
soon enough.

860
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:43,179
But before I do,
I wish to make a small contribution.

861
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:48,486
A final gesture of goodwill to the
people of this planet who have given...

862
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:54,070
...from whom I have taken so much.

863
01:05:57,644 --> 01:05:59,084
You found the primer.

864
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:02,644
Clever girl!

865
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:04,579
Lights.

866
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,808
Pages and pages of data.

867
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:19,427
Over 63,000 in all.

868
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,923
And on the perimeter of each...

869
01:06:22,222 --> 01:06:25,622
Alignment symbols, registration
marks, but they don't line up.

870
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:27,429
They do...

871
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:29,451
...if you think like a Vegan.

872
01:06:30,442 --> 01:06:33,282
An alien intelligence
has got be more advanced...

873
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,412
...and that means efficiency
functioning on multiple levels...

874
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,546
...and in multiple...

875
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:41,591
...dimensions.

876
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:47,509
Yes, of course!

877
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:49,218
Where's the primer?

878
01:06:49,762 --> 01:06:51,042
You'll see.

879
01:06:51,598 --> 01:06:55,918
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

880
01:06:58,275 --> 01:07:01,635
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

881
01:07:02,907 --> 01:07:06,787
Buried within the message itself
is the key to decoding it.

882
01:07:07,246 --> 01:07:10,486
Within the layering of the matrix,
we have these basic equations:

883
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:16,177
So with this very elementary foundation,
they have given us a kind of...

884
01:07:16,635 --> 01:07:18,875
...general scientific vocabulary.

885
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,420
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

886
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:22,924
This was the key...

887
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:25,546
...that allowed us to decipher
their language...

888
01:07:25,857 --> 01:07:29,457
...for physics, geometry, chemistry.
Next frame, Ellie.

889
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:34,588
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

890
01:07:35,663 --> 01:07:36,623
...we find this.

891
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:44,491
Those look like engineering
schematics, almost like blueprints.

892
01:07:46,012 --> 01:07:46,972
Yes.

893
01:07:47,305 --> 01:07:50,465
It is our belief that
the message contains instructions...

894
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:54,130
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

895
01:07:54,691 --> 01:07:57,251
A machine?
That does what, Doctor?

896
01:07:57,696 --> 01:07:59,856
We don't know.
It might be some type...

897
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:05,347
...of advanced communication device,
or a teaching machine of some kind.

898
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,197
Or it might be...

899
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:10,187
...some kind of a transport.

900
01:08:10,715 --> 01:08:13,115
-Transport?
-There's no proof of that.

901
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:16,867
The fact is you don't know
what it does. It could be anything.

902
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:20,590
A Trojan Horse. We build it
and out pours the entire Vegan army.

903
01:08:21,022 --> 01:08:23,422
Why risk the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

904
01:08:23,734 --> 01:08:25,974
Right.
Some kind of a Doomsday Machine.

905
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,558
Every time they detect
a new civilization...

906
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:31,105
...they fax
construction plans from space.

907
01:08:31,412 --> 01:08:34,892
We poor saps build this thing
and blow ourselves to kingdom come.

908
01:08:35,251 --> 01:08:38,731
There's no reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

909
01:08:39,257 --> 01:08:42,617
Why is it the egghead position
that aliens are always benign?

910
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,160
We pose no threat to them.

911
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:47,873
It'd be like us
going out of our way...

912
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:49,870
...to destroy microbes
on an anthill.

913
01:08:50,148 --> 01:08:51,588
Interesting analogy.

914
01:08:52,193 --> 01:08:53,153
How guilty would we feel...

915
01:08:53,403 --> 01:08:56,043
...if we destroyed a few microbes
on an anthill?

916
01:08:56,407 --> 01:08:57,527
I hope you're right.

917
01:08:57,868 --> 01:08:58,868
I really do.

918
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:02,479
But my job is to protect American
lives from any threat...

919
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:04,831
...so I am obligated
to assume the worst.

920
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:07,048
Yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

921
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,740
My problem is this:

922
01:09:09,468 --> 01:09:12,548
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

923
01:09:13,307 --> 01:09:16,667
Our internal numbers show
support for this is incredibly soft.

924
01:09:17,021 --> 01:09:19,581
If the President
stays this course...

925
01:09:19,858 --> 01:09:22,538
...his numbers will be going
south like ducks in winter.

926
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:23,946
This is nuts!

927
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:25,116
Excuse me...

928
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:26,326
...Miss.

929
01:09:26,869 --> 01:09:29,269
We know nothing
of these creatures' values.

930
01:09:29,706 --> 01:09:32,026
We don't even know
whether they believe in God.

931
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,095
This doesn't make any sense. If...

932
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:36,098
Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.

933
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:38,741
We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

934
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,761
No, of course not.
I understand.

935
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,250
What I meant to say...

936
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:47,935
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

937
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:51,725
If it was religious in nature,
it should have taken the form...

938
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:54,631
...of a burning bush
or a voice from the sky.

939
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:56,950
But a voice from the sky...

940
01:09:58,123 --> 01:10:00,603
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.

941
01:10:04,382 --> 01:10:06,022
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

942
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:11,567
I agree with Mr. Rank
that there are unavoidable...

943
01:10:11,893 --> 01:10:13,973
...religious implications at stake.

944
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:16,550
But that doesn't justify
being an alarmist.

945
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:20,851
I hope that we can find
a common ground...

946
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:24,327
...break through obstacles
that may have kept us apart.

947
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:27,693
Listen, I need to make
one thing very clear.

948
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:32,562
Our organization will not be placated
with flowery New Age rhetoric...

949
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:34,267
Mr. President!

950
01:10:36,888 --> 01:10:38,888
The President
met with top advisors...

951
01:10:39,183 --> 01:10:42,343
...regarding the latest efforts
to decode the message.

952
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:47,130
While there has been some progress,
the official line remains cautious.

953
01:10:47,529 --> 01:10:49,529
If you're asking
when we'll find out...

954
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:52,106
... what the purpose
of that Machine is...

955
01:10:53,204 --> 01:10:55,804
...maybe tomorrow,
maybe next year, maybe never.

956
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,740
There he is. The man with his finger
on the nation's spiritual pulse.

957
01:11:06,265 --> 01:11:07,865
It's so good to see you.

958
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:09,224
You too.

959
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:14,779
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.

960
01:11:15,612 --> 01:11:17,212
I'm really happy for you.

961
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:18,909
Are you?

962
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:21,437
Mr. Joss, the President's waiting.

963
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,897
The President's waiting.

964
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,780
See you at the reception?

965
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:34,070
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

966
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:48,441
Miss Constantine,
may I speak to you?

967
01:11:48,786 --> 01:11:50,106
Certainly.

968
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:53,517
I have a big problem.

969
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:58,445
Do you know where I can find
a really great dress?

970
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:22,086
God created man in the form of
Himself, not in the form of monkeys!

971
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,293
Get a job!
Don't waste my tax dollars!

972
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:01,451
You look beautiful, Ellie.

973
01:13:03,187 --> 01:13:05,387
-So do you.
-You really do.

974
01:13:09,196 --> 01:13:10,556
I read your book.

975
01:13:11,616 --> 01:13:12,776
Here we go.

976
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:14,765
You want me to quote you?

977
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:16,859
"Ironically...

978
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,086
...the thing people are
most hungry for...

979
01:13:19,378 --> 01:13:20,578
...meaning...

980
01:13:20,838 --> 01:13:23,998
...is the one thing science
hasn't been able to give them."

981
01:13:24,343 --> 01:13:25,303
Yeah.

982
01:13:27,682 --> 01:13:29,602
It's like you're saying that...

983
01:13:30,018 --> 01:13:32,218
...science killed God.

984
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:35,409
What if science simply revealed...

985
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,471
...that He never existed
in the first place?

986
01:13:42,036 --> 01:13:44,116
I think we need to get some air.

987
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:46,967
And a few more of these.

988
01:13:48,587 --> 01:13:49,707
Thank you.

989
01:13:51,717 --> 01:13:53,197
A little chilly out here.

990
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:54,911
Yeah, this is nice.

991
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,424
I got one for you.

992
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:58,283
Occam's Razor. Ever heard of it?

993
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,120
Hoccam's Razor.
Sounds like some slasher movie.

994
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,000
No, Occam's Razor is a basic
scientific principle which says:

995
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:08,604
Things being equal, the simplest
explanation tends to be right.

996
01:14:09,076 --> 01:14:10,196
Makes sense to me.

997
01:14:10,745 --> 01:14:11,825
So what's more likely?

998
01:14:12,122 --> 01:14:13,082
Thank you.

999
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:16,228
An all-powerful God
created the universe...

1000
01:14:16,545 --> 01:14:19,385
...then decided not to give
any proof of His existence?

1001
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:20,757
Or...

1002
01:14:21,094 --> 01:14:24,174
...that He doesn't exist at all
and that we created Him...

1003
01:14:24,557 --> 01:14:26,997
...so we wouldn't feel
so small and alone.

1004
01:14:28,021 --> 01:14:29,141
I don't know.

1005
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:33,238
I couldn't imagine living in a world
where God didn't exist.

1006
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:35,678
I wouldn't want to.

1007
01:14:36,408 --> 01:14:38,648
How do you know
you're not deluding yourself?

1008
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:40,699
I mean, for me...

1009
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,675
...l'd need proof.

1010
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:44,712
Proof?

1011
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:49,567
Did you love your father?

1012
01:14:50,762 --> 01:14:52,362
Your dad, did you love him?

1013
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,680
Yes. Very much.

1014
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:00,395
Prove it.

1015
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:08,577
Kent.

1016
01:15:09,331 --> 01:15:10,731
The White House.

1017
01:15:13,796 --> 01:15:17,636
No excuses. Whoever's responsible,
I want their head on a platter.

1018
01:15:18,178 --> 01:15:19,338
What happened?

1019
01:15:19,972 --> 01:15:21,412
You were right all along.

1020
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:24,488
The team at the VLA
has worked around the clock...

1021
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:27,213
...and the hard work
has finally paid off.

1022
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:31,499
This key section uncovered tonight,
and obtained exclusively by CNN...

1023
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:34,303
...shows an illustration
of a human figure...

1024
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,380
...inside a geometric structure
of some kind.

1025
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:39,425
This and other contextual clues...

1026
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:42,635
...now lead scientists to believe
the message is, in fact...

1027
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:44,726
President called
an emergency meeting.

1028
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:46,487
I imagined he would.

1029
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,720
...designed to take a single human
occupant into space...

1030
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:52,467
...presumably to the star Vega.

1031
01:16:16,263 --> 01:16:17,343
Tell me.

1032
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:19,014
They will build it.

1033
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:20,028
Who goes?

1034
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:23,631
The President's gone international
to spread the risk and cost...

1035
01:16:23,983 --> 01:16:24,863
Who goes?

1036
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:27,294
Well, it's complicated.

1037
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:32,100
They have formed
a group of international candidates.

1038
01:16:32,412 --> 01:16:34,332
Now, it's your discovery.

1039
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:38,436
They understand that. You're
at the top of a very short list.

1040
01:16:38,922 --> 01:16:41,402
But they're also forming
a selection committee.

1041
01:16:41,717 --> 01:16:45,717
It's made of scholars, theologians,
scientists, philosophers...

1042
01:16:46,099 --> 01:16:47,059
You're on it.

1043
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:49,471
I've been asked, yes.

1044
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,042
I guess that means...

1045
01:16:54,737 --> 01:16:57,457
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...

1046
01:16:57,783 --> 01:16:58,863
Yeah.

1047
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:01,358
What you don't understand,
Ellie, is...

1048
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:02,907
I understand.

1049
01:17:04,459 --> 01:17:08,299
I want you to know, whatever
happens, as far as I'm concerned...

1050
01:17:12,096 --> 01:17:13,296
Good luck.

1051
01:17:17,645 --> 01:17:21,005
Whatever you do, make sure
he doesn't monopolize the committee.

1052
01:17:21,484 --> 01:17:23,404
He is not on the committee, Ellie.

1053
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:30,373
He just resigned.
He wants to be the one to go.

1054
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:35,786
The President is already feeling
the financial pinch.

1055
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:39,214
Sources say the cost of the project
is spiraling...

1056
01:17:39,511 --> 01:17:42,191
...to more than a third
of a trillion dollars...

1057
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:45,715
...making this perhaps
the most expensive single project...

1058
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:47,861
...in all of human history.

1059
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:50,029
Months of debate finally reached...

1060
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,640
...a conclusion last week as 10
candidates were selected by the I.M.C...

1061
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:58,721
...representing a cross section
of political and religious views.

1062
01:17:59,081 --> 01:18:01,601
Many are the same experts
who have consulted...

1063
01:18:01,919 --> 01:18:04,119
...on the Machine's design
and function.

1064
01:18:04,423 --> 01:18:08,463
They will actively participate on-site,
during the construction process.

1065
01:18:09,096 --> 01:18:12,096
The choice of these 10 candidates
has been controversial.

1066
01:18:12,476 --> 01:18:15,116
One-third of the candidates
are American.

1067
01:18:15,481 --> 01:18:18,121
And many
international observers ask why.

1068
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:21,295
The U.S. is shouldering
a large part of the cost...

1069
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:24,453
Isn't it true that contractors,
like Hadden Industries...

1070
01:18:24,744 --> 01:18:27,944
...are making contributions
in exchange for technology rights?

1071
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:31,649
Different nations are being
compensated in different ways.

1072
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:36,407
Japan made headlines by opting
to forego candidate representation...

1073
01:18:36,887 --> 01:18:39,807
...in exchange for the
systems integration subcontract.

1074
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:41,865
On what basis do you choose...

1075
01:18:42,103 --> 01:18:44,903
...a human being
to represent humanity?

1076
01:18:45,233 --> 01:18:46,353
Good question, Larry.

1077
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:48,210
If nothing else...

1078
01:18:48,738 --> 01:18:52,578
...it should be somebody fluent in the
language the message was given in.

1079
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:54,071
Science, in this case.

1080
01:18:54,747 --> 01:18:57,027
Despite your obvious enthusiasm...

1081
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:59,534
...there's been
a lot of criticism...

1082
01:18:59,796 --> 01:19:02,356
...that this endeavor
is simply too dangerous.

1083
01:19:02,633 --> 01:19:04,993
Some of that criticism
from scientists.

1084
01:19:05,304 --> 01:19:07,984
One Nobel Prize winner noted,
his words:

1085
01:19:08,851 --> 01:19:10,571
"There is every indication...

1086
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:14,492
...that this is beyond our capabilities,
that this endeavor will fail...

1087
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:18,178
...and that the Machine's occupant
will pay for it with his life. "

1088
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:20,212
How do you respond?

1089
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:23,695
This message is from a civilization
that may be anywhere...

1090
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,640
...from hundreds to millions
and millions of years ahead of us.

1091
01:19:28,004 --> 01:19:31,044
I have to believe that
an intelligence that advanced...

1092
01:19:31,843 --> 01:19:33,483
...knows what they're doing.

1093
01:19:34,973 --> 01:19:38,173
Now all it requires
on our part is...

1094
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:39,897
Faith?

1095
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:45,026
I was going to say,
a sense of adventure.

1096
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:46,681
And in breaking news...

1097
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,314
...astronaut John Russell...

1098
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:52,338
...considered to be the leading American
candidate for the Machine seat...

1099
01:19:52,707 --> 01:19:54,867
...has dropped out of the running.

1100
01:19:55,378 --> 01:19:58,298
Russell met with reporters today
at his Houston home.

1101
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,801
I told my dad I didn't want him...

1102
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,680
...to go.

1103
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,371
Daddy, don't go.

1104
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:08,994
Nothing would give me more pride...

1105
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:10,353
...than to...

1106
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:12,988
...represent my country.

1107
01:20:13,404 --> 01:20:15,044
But what can I say to this?

1108
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:19,675
Consortium officials had no comment,
but inside sources...

1109
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:21,919
...have disclosed
that Dr. Arroway...

1110
01:20:22,209 --> 01:20:26,049
...appears to now be the
front-runner for the Machine seat.

1111
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,660
"Meet me at noon.
Must talk."

1112
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:32,174
I didn't expect a message
like this from you.

1113
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:33,754
Thanks for coming.

1114
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,860
Is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1115
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:40,229
Selectors and selectees
mingling around?

1116
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:42,623
Can we talk about Einstein?

1117
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,760
Yeah, sure.

1118
01:20:45,493 --> 01:20:48,653
Special relativity.
This Machine...

1119
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:54,212
...if it works, and you travel
to Vega at the speed of light...

1120
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,672
-...when you come back...
-lf you come back.

1121
01:20:59,097 --> 01:21:00,737
If you come back...

1122
01:21:01,266 --> 01:21:05,386
...you'll be 4 years older, but over 50
years will have passed here on Earth.

1123
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:07,051
Basically.

1124
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:10,303
And everybody that you care about...

1125
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:13,685
...will be gone, dead and buried.

1126
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:18,059
If you came back,
if you survived at all...

1127
01:21:19,877 --> 01:21:23,557
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying
this isn't dangerous.

1128
01:21:23,883 --> 01:21:27,843
The rest of the candidates and myself
understand the risks we're taking.

1129
01:21:28,223 --> 01:21:29,183
Why?

1130
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:32,076
It's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

1131
01:21:32,396 --> 01:21:34,956
You, Ellie. You!
You personally.

1132
01:21:36,068 --> 01:21:38,748
By doing this,
you're willing to give your life.

1133
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,152
You're willing to die for it.

1134
01:21:43,078 --> 01:21:44,278
Why?

1135
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:51,725
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

1136
01:21:52,425 --> 01:21:54,065
...something...

1137
01:21:54,345 --> 01:21:57,945
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?

1138
01:21:59,102 --> 01:22:02,862
If this is a chance to find out
even a part of that answer...

1139
01:22:04,526 --> 01:22:07,406
I don't know,
I think it's worth a human life.

1140
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:09,318
Don't you?

1141
01:22:16,252 --> 01:22:18,812
You're an incredibly brave woman,
Ellie.

1142
01:22:21,635 --> 01:22:23,475
Or incredibly nuts.

1143
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:55,025
I'm really confused.

1144
01:22:56,478 --> 01:22:57,718
So am I.

1145
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:02,420
I think I speak for us all
when I thank you for your patience.

1146
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:06,061
Myself, I have one
final question, Dr. Arroway.

1147
01:23:07,786 --> 01:23:09,986
If you should meet these Vegans...

1148
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:14,370
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1149
01:23:14,713 --> 01:23:16,313
...what would it be?

1150
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,810
I suppose it would be:

1151
01:23:20,054 --> 01:23:21,654
"How did you do it?

1152
01:23:22,308 --> 01:23:26,548
How did you evolve? How did you
survive technological adolescence...

1153
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:28,859
...without destroying yourself?"

1154
01:23:29,568 --> 01:23:34,288
That more than any other question is
one I personally would like answered.

1155
01:23:34,868 --> 01:23:36,588
Not too bad, Mike.

1156
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:38,570
I join Dr. Bergeron...

1157
01:23:38,874 --> 01:23:42,074
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

1158
01:23:42,421 --> 01:23:44,901
We're all impressed
with your candor...

1159
01:23:45,341 --> 01:23:46,821
...and your stamina.

1160
01:23:47,344 --> 01:23:50,544
I think we're ready to move on
to your final statement.

1161
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:52,651
I have one more question.

1162
01:23:52,978 --> 01:23:54,458
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1163
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:00,808
Would you consider yourself...

1164
01:24:01,365 --> 01:24:03,605
...a spiritual person?

1165
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,287
I don't understand
the point of the question.

1166
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:15,355
I consider myself a moral person.

1167
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:20,120
We're sure that's the case, but what
Mr. Joss is in fact asking...

1168
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:22,237
Do you believe in God?

1169
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:32,945
As a scientist...

1170
01:24:33,412 --> 01:24:36,692
...I rely on empirical evidence,
and in this matter...

1171
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:40,368
...I don't believe
that there's data either way.

1172
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:45,181
So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1173
01:24:49,186 --> 01:24:52,146
I don't understand the relevance
of the question.

1174
01:24:55,194 --> 01:24:58,114
95%%% of the world's population...

1175
01:24:58,449 --> 01:25:02,049
...believes in a Supreme Being
in one form or another.

1176
01:25:03,373 --> 01:25:06,493
I believe that makes the question
more than relevant.

1177
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,504
I believe...

1178
01:25:26,908 --> 01:25:29,388
I believe I've already
answered that question.

1179
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:36,781
I'm proud of what
we've achieved as a species...

1180
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,135
...and as a civilization.

1181
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:43,365
I would hate to see
everything we stand for...

1182
01:25:43,682 --> 01:25:47,242
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

1183
01:25:47,605 --> 01:25:49,925
...all that God
has blessed us with...

1184
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,800
...betrayed...

1185
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:58,261
...in the final hour because we sent a
representative who did not put our...

1186
01:25:58,955 --> 01:26:01,595
...most cherished beliefs first.

1187
01:26:04,964 --> 01:26:06,124
Thank you.

1188
01:26:39,431 --> 01:26:40,711
Why'd you do it?

1189
01:26:45,357 --> 01:26:49,317
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

1190
01:26:52,868 --> 01:26:56,028
I couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

1191
01:26:56,373 --> 01:26:58,333
...who doesn't believe in God.

1192
01:27:00,462 --> 01:27:01,782
Someone who...

1193
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:05,300
...honestly thinks
the other 95%%% of us...

1194
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,277
...suffer from some form
of mass delusion.

1195
01:27:11,812 --> 01:27:13,772
I told the truth up there.

1196
01:27:15,192 --> 01:27:18,512
Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

1197
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:56,311
With full humility
and utmost gratitude...

1198
01:27:56,628 --> 01:27:58,668
...I accept this great honor...

1199
01:27:58,965 --> 01:28:02,885
...and I promise I will do my best
to represent my nation...

1200
01:28:03,263 --> 01:28:06,583
...my planet and my God
on this historic...

1201
01:28:06,893 --> 01:28:07,933
...journey.

1202
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:10,719
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1203
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,344
There's a carnival atmosphere
at Cape Canaveral...

1204
01:28:56,633 --> 01:28:58,673
...as the International
Machine Consortium...

1205
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:02,170
...hosts as much a media event
as a systems test.

1206
01:29:02,726 --> 01:29:06,326
David Drumlin is supervising
the on-site portion of the test.

1207
01:29:06,648 --> 01:29:08,448
We spoke with him earlier today.

1208
01:29:08,735 --> 01:29:10,415
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

1209
01:29:10,696 --> 01:29:13,496
...using the robot passenger...

1210
01:29:14,076 --> 01:29:16,356
... who we lovingly call Elmer.

1211
01:29:22,213 --> 01:29:24,573
The press wants to
ask you a few questions...

1212
01:29:24,883 --> 01:29:27,443
...as soon as they're done
with Dr. Drumlin.

1213
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:31,901
When we release the pod...

1214
01:29:32,353 --> 01:29:34,713
...a substantial amount of energy
will be generated.

1215
01:29:35,566 --> 01:29:38,126
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

1216
01:29:38,445 --> 01:29:40,725
...using our robot passenger,
who we...

1217
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:43,074
...lovingly call Elmer.

1218
01:29:43,744 --> 01:29:44,744
Thank you.

1219
01:29:44,996 --> 01:29:46,196
You're welcome.

1220
01:29:47,709 --> 01:29:49,869
They're ready for you
out at the site.

1221
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:52,190
Yeah, just a minute.

1222
01:29:58,391 --> 01:30:00,591
-Congratulations.
-Glad you could come.

1223
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,340
Didn't expect to see you here.

1224
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:06,953
Well, I'm still...

1225
01:30:07,404 --> 01:30:09,924
...Crew Ops at the Control Center.

1226
01:30:10,701 --> 01:30:14,621
I suppose the fact that I discovered
the message means I have PR value.

1227
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:16,359
Of course.

1228
01:30:18,128 --> 01:30:21,168
I know you must think
this is all very unfair.

1229
01:30:21,884 --> 01:30:23,804
And maybe that's an understatement.

1230
01:30:25,306 --> 01:30:27,546
What you don't know is, I agree.

1231
01:30:28,227 --> 01:30:31,347
I wish the world was a place
where fair was the bottom line...

1232
01:30:31,648 --> 01:30:34,848
...where the idealism you showed
at the hearing was rewarded...

1233
01:30:35,195 --> 01:30:37,235
...not taken advantage of.

1234
01:30:39,076 --> 01:30:41,796
Unfortunately,
we don't live in that world.

1235
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,290
Funny...

1236
01:30:46,796 --> 01:30:49,796
...I always believed the world
is what we make of it.

1237
01:30:51,928 --> 01:30:52,728
Excuse me!

1238
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:58,205
Good luck on the test.

1239
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,100
Thank you.

1240
01:31:08,703 --> 01:31:09,703
Test director...

1241
01:31:09,955 --> 01:31:12,115
...everything looks good.
Ready to go.

1242
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:15,629
I want things double
and triple-checked here.

1243
01:31:15,964 --> 01:31:19,044
We only get one shot at this.
Let's get it right.

1244
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:22,599
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are ready for start-up.

1245
01:31:22,932 --> 01:31:26,132
All controllers, I need a go-no-go
for test initiation.

1246
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:27,401
-Mechanical?
-Go.

1247
01:31:27,689 --> 01:31:28,609
Electrical?

1248
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:29,816
Dynamics?

1249
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,228
Communications?

1250
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:32,608
Pod systems?

1251
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:33,942
Safety?

1252
01:31:34,449 --> 01:31:37,169
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test
procedures are complete.

1253
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:38,899
Yes, verified.
I'm go.

1254
01:31:39,164 --> 01:31:41,564
Pad Leader,
is everything okay with you?

1255
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:44,315
Roger. The pad is a go.

1256
01:31:44,714 --> 01:31:47,314
Test initiation, on my mark.

1257
01:31:47,927 --> 01:31:49,127
5...

1258
01:31:49,555 --> 01:31:50,675
...4...

1259
01:31:51,099 --> 01:31:52,219
...3...

1260
01:31:52,559 --> 01:31:53,519
...2...

1261
01:31:54,103 --> 01:31:55,143
...1 .

1262
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:56,810
Mark.

1263
01:31:57,358 --> 01:31:59,078
-Test start.
-Rings are unlocked.

1264
01:31:59,361 --> 01:32:00,881
Power levels show a good start.

1265
01:32:01,113 --> 01:32:02,873
We've begun the test of...

1266
01:32:03,116 --> 01:32:07,516
...earth's first system built by sharing
knowledge with a neighbor in space.

1267
01:32:07,873 --> 01:32:10,033
All power sources
on core induction bus.

1268
01:32:10,294 --> 01:32:11,974
IPV power transfer.

1269
01:32:12,255 --> 01:32:15,295
Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

1270
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:19,930
-Gerry, how are we looking?
-Looks good. We're underway.

1271
01:32:20,225 --> 01:32:21,945
Looks like a normal start-up.

1272
01:32:22,228 --> 01:32:24,508
Roger, David.
It's looking good here.

1273
01:32:30,156 --> 01:32:33,396
We are moments away from
the initiation of the drop sequence.

1274
01:32:33,787 --> 01:32:35,427
All systems are go.

1275
01:32:38,502 --> 01:32:40,262
-Mechanical, you still happy?
-Roger.

1276
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:41,785
It's very exciting...

1277
01:32:42,007 --> 01:32:43,567
...from up here.

1278
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:47,651
We've got 4%.

1279
01:32:50,937 --> 01:32:53,537
Frequency 9.85.

1280
01:32:54,651 --> 01:32:56,571
Harmonics in the green.

1281
01:32:56,862 --> 01:32:59,062
G-level 1. 1.

1282
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:03,566
-5%.
-Confirmed. We are at 5%.

1283
01:33:03,873 --> 01:33:05,433
David, how's it looking to you?

1284
01:33:05,792 --> 01:33:08,632
Okay. I'm going to take a look
and show you what we got.

1285
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:10,682
Instrumentation looks good.

1286
01:33:10,925 --> 01:33:14,285
We have a good picture
from Dr. Drumlin's PRD.

1287
01:33:14,972 --> 01:33:17,292
Hope you guys are seeing
what I'm seeing.

1288
01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:19,695
All systems are go.

1289
01:33:21,315 --> 01:33:22,835
This is really something!

1290
01:33:23,067 --> 01:33:24,627
For purposes of this test...

1291
01:33:24,904 --> 01:33:29,024
...Dr. Drumlin will be on top of the
Gantry crane that's over the Machine.

1292
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:31,370
We've got some video animation...

1293
01:33:31,705 --> 01:33:34,985
...to show just how this Machine...
it is thought... will work.

1294
01:33:35,336 --> 01:33:36,936
The passenger pod will release.

1295
01:33:37,213 --> 01:33:39,453
It will come down
through the center of the rings...

1296
01:33:39,759 --> 01:33:41,519
...and into the Machine's core.

1297
01:33:41,803 --> 01:33:44,003
The question everyone
here is asking is...

1298
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:45,789
... what happens then?

1299
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,620
Some believe the rings function...

1300
01:33:47,896 --> 01:33:50,736
...as some sort of an accelerator
or something...

1301
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:53,690
...sending its energy
into the pod...

1302
01:33:53,946 --> 01:33:56,346
...making it rocket away
at near light speed.

1303
01:33:56,659 --> 01:34:00,979
Others believe it might open up
a doorway to some other dimension.

1304
01:34:01,457 --> 01:34:02,417
Who's right?

1305
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:05,031
That's what
today's test is all about.

1306
01:34:05,588 --> 01:34:07,668
-35%%%.
-Subsystems ready?

1307
01:34:07,967 --> 01:34:09,807
40%%% normal acceleration.

1308
01:34:11,597 --> 01:34:14,437
Controllers stand by
to initiate drop sequence...

1309
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,250
...on my mark.

1310
01:34:16,521 --> 01:34:18,601
All systems ready for drop sequence.

1311
01:34:18,983 --> 01:34:20,463
45%%%.

1312
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:26,533
Verify closure.

1313
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:29,153
46.

1314
01:34:29,624 --> 01:34:34,104
All controllers stand by to initiate
IPV drop sequence. On my mark.

1315
01:34:34,965 --> 01:34:36,285
48%%%.

1316
01:34:37,594 --> 01:34:39,674
I'm feeling
a very strange vibration.

1317
01:34:40,223 --> 01:34:43,143
-Are you feeling it down there?
-Gerry, can you confirm?

1318
01:34:43,853 --> 01:34:45,053
Everything looks good.

1319
01:34:45,856 --> 01:34:46,736
Crew Ops?

1320
01:34:47,024 --> 01:34:47,904
Nothing wrong.

1321
01:34:48,109 --> 01:34:49,669
We see nothing abnormal here.

1322
01:34:49,945 --> 01:34:52,665
No good. Hold sequence.
I'll take a direct reading.

1323
01:34:53,242 --> 01:34:54,602
What's he talking about?

1324
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:56,471
Can anyone say grandstanding?

1325
01:34:56,872 --> 01:34:58,792
He sure knows he's on TV!

1326
01:34:59,084 --> 01:35:01,924
Back home that's what we call
an overcooked ham.

1327
01:35:02,422 --> 01:35:04,502
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!

1328
01:35:04,968 --> 01:35:07,648
What do you read on the first
and second order G-levels?

1329
01:35:07,972 --> 01:35:09,532
G-levels are right on!

1330
01:35:11,435 --> 01:35:14,235
We confirm Drumlin's readings.
All normal. We're go.

1331
01:35:15,608 --> 01:35:18,168
I think we're okay,
but we'll let him finish.

1332
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:22,854
-Mechanical, you still okay?
-Roger. Right on the money.

1333
01:35:23,411 --> 01:35:24,571
Security problem!

1334
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:27,559
Ellie, are you sure?

1335
01:35:28,294 --> 01:35:29,854
He shouldn't be there.
I know him.

1336
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:32,810
Gerry, execute the
rapid shutdown sequence.

1337
01:35:33,176 --> 01:35:36,216
Security, move emergency
response team into position.

1338
01:35:36,598 --> 01:35:38,358
Get Drumlin on a secure loop.

1339
01:35:38,684 --> 01:35:40,004
You got him.

1340
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:42,671
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I hear.

1341
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:45,231
We've got a security breach here.

1342
01:35:45,694 --> 01:35:46,654
Behind you.

1343
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:47,786
The tall guy.

1344
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,520
The technician.

1345
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:50,991
See him?

1346
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:54,697
He shouldn't be there.

1347
01:36:00,842 --> 01:36:02,242
Something's in his hand!

1348
01:36:03,429 --> 01:36:06,189
Him! Take him!
Security breach!

1349
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,400
A bomb!

1350
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:10,967
I want that emergency response team
up on the gantry. Now!

1351
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:12,361
Stage One Alert!

1352
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:15,249
Move all fire and rescue personnel
into position one.

1353
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:55,709
All right, back to your stations.

1354
01:36:56,048 --> 01:36:59,008
I need you to be professional.
Settle down!

1355
01:36:59,303 --> 01:37:01,663
Pad Leader, do you copy?

1356
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:22,188
The scene earlier today,
when David Drumlin...

1357
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:24,302
...advisor to two Presidents...

1358
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:28,268
...and winner of the National Academy
of Sciences lifetime award...

1359
01:37:28,721 --> 01:37:32,241
... was laid to rest
at Arlington National Cemetery.

1360
01:37:36,232 --> 01:37:37,912
In a related story...

1361
01:37:38,193 --> 01:37:39,433
Can I help you?

1362
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:43,370
I've got some mail for you.

1363
01:37:43,827 --> 01:37:48,227
...the apparent suicide note of the
terrorist now believed responsible...

1364
01:37:48,584 --> 01:37:51,384
...for the explosion
in Florida this week.

1365
01:37:51,838 --> 01:37:53,398
What we do...

1366
01:37:53,758 --> 01:37:56,558
... we do for the goodness
of all mankind.

1367
01:37:57,472 --> 01:38:00,192
This won't be understood,
not now...

1368
01:38:00,685 --> 01:38:02,365
...but the Apocalypse to come...

1369
01:38:03,522 --> 01:38:05,602
... will vindicate our faith.

1370
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:30,861
Welcome home.

1371
01:39:37,661 --> 01:39:39,141
Comrade Arroway...

1372
01:39:40,206 --> 01:39:43,446
... we have been expecting your call.
One moment, please.

1373
01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:54,511
Mr. Hadden?

1374
01:39:55,145 --> 01:39:56,465
Doctor!

1375
01:39:57,607 --> 01:39:59,367
How kind of you to call.

1376
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:01,989
Mr. Hadden, where are you?

1377
01:40:04,283 --> 01:40:05,283
The Russian government...

1378
01:40:05,494 --> 01:40:08,734
... was kind enough
to give me accommodations on Mir.

1379
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:11,635
You're living on a space station?

1380
01:40:13,088 --> 01:40:15,008
It's quite simple, really.

1381
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:19,872
The low oxygen,
zero gravity environment...

1382
01:40:20,224 --> 01:40:24,704
...is the only thing keeping
the cancer from eating me alive.

1383
01:40:26,566 --> 01:40:29,086
Actually, I quite like it up here.

1384
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:32,778
My little room
has one hell of a view.

1385
01:40:41,046 --> 01:40:42,806
I want to show you something.

1386
01:40:47,597 --> 01:40:49,517
Hokkaido Island.

1387
01:40:50,894 --> 01:40:53,014
The systems integration site.

1388
01:40:54,232 --> 01:40:55,712
Look closer.

1389
01:41:04,122 --> 01:41:06,842
First rule in government spending:

1390
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:11,641
Why build one when you can have
two at twice the price?

1391
01:41:12,133 --> 01:41:15,013
Only, this one can be kept secret.

1392
01:41:15,806 --> 01:41:17,766
Controlled by Americans...

1393
01:41:18,267 --> 01:41:21,507
...built by Japanese
subcontractors...

1394
01:41:22,565 --> 01:41:25,085
... who also happen to be...

1395
01:41:26,154 --> 01:41:27,754
...recently acquired...

1396
01:41:28,366 --> 01:41:30,766
... wholly-owned subsidiaries...

1397
01:41:31,704 --> 01:41:33,624
...of Hadden Industries.

1398
01:41:37,337 --> 01:41:40,417
They still want
an American to go, Doctor.

1399
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:45,786
Want to take a ride?

1400
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:30,499
Augmenting our restraint and...

1401
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:32,831
...communications console
subsystem...

1402
01:42:33,086 --> 01:42:35,006
...is your personal recording unit.

1403
01:42:35,381 --> 01:42:38,781
Normal,
infrared and ultraviolet lenses.

1404
01:42:39,596 --> 01:42:43,316
Digital microchip good for
thousands of hours of recording.

1405
01:42:44,812 --> 01:42:46,892
Okay, look, I understand...

1406
01:42:47,232 --> 01:42:50,472
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

1407
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:53,220
But I just want to go on record
one more time.

1408
01:42:53,616 --> 01:42:56,936
The transmitted specs never said
anything about any chair...

1409
01:42:57,288 --> 01:42:59,128
...or a restraining harness...

1410
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:01,336
...or survival gear.

1411
01:43:02,129 --> 01:43:03,889
Why can't we just trust
the original...

1412
01:43:04,132 --> 01:43:07,972
Doctor, both the IMC Board and
the SI team reviewed the matter...

1413
01:43:08,305 --> 01:43:11,745
...and concluded that the design
impact is negligible.

1414
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:13,749
Bottom line is...

1415
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,393
...we're not putting anyone
aboard this Machine...

1416
01:43:16,692 --> 01:43:19,572
...unless there is
some sort of minimal protection.

1417
01:43:19,988 --> 01:43:21,268
End of story.

1418
01:43:28,334 --> 01:43:32,174
We've given these to the astronauts
since the start of the space program.

1419
01:43:33,717 --> 01:43:35,917
It's never been made public,
of course.

1420
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:38,219
It's fast and it's painless.

1421
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:43,899
I'm going to travel 26 light years
to commit suicide?

1422
01:43:44,316 --> 01:43:45,956
Something may go wrong.

1423
01:43:46,528 --> 01:43:49,088
There may be
an unforeseen mechanical failure.

1424
01:43:50,033 --> 01:43:52,913
You could be marooned,
unable to return.

1425
01:43:54,206 --> 01:43:57,246
There are 1,000 reasons
we can think of to have this...

1426
01:43:57,544 --> 01:44:00,384
...but mostly it's for the reasons
we can't think of.

1427
01:44:27,087 --> 01:44:28,167
Come in.

1428
01:44:29,758 --> 01:44:31,998
Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.

1429
01:44:32,262 --> 01:44:33,222
Thank you.

1430
01:44:44,404 --> 01:44:46,044
I know there's not much time.

1431
01:44:46,282 --> 01:44:49,242
As soon as I found out about it,
I called the President.

1432
01:44:49,579 --> 01:44:51,179
I came with Kitz.

1433
01:44:51,832 --> 01:44:54,032
I had to see you one more time.

1434
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:55,934
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1435
01:44:56,422 --> 01:44:58,062
No, I'm glad you came.

1436
01:44:58,425 --> 01:45:00,545
There's something
I got to say to you.

1437
01:45:02,014 --> 01:45:06,094
The reason I didn't vote for you was
a good one, but not the real one.

1438
01:45:07,313 --> 01:45:09,233
I didn't vote for you to go...

1439
01:45:11,194 --> 01:45:12,994
...because I don't want to lose you.

1440
01:45:14,157 --> 01:45:16,237
Now you find your way home,
all right?

1441
01:45:33,352 --> 01:45:34,752
23 hours ago, the world...

1442
01:45:35,021 --> 01:45:38,981
... was stunned by the announcement
of the existence of another Machine...

1443
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:42,159
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.

1444
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:43,050
Now...

1445
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:46,060
...the question
that's on everyone's mind:

1446
01:45:46,329 --> 01:45:48,009
Will history repeat itself?

1447
01:45:48,499 --> 01:45:50,739
With a piece of engineering
this complex...

1448
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:54,884
... with so many unknowns,
could the unthinkable occur?

1449
01:45:55,217 --> 01:45:58,417
The security in Hokkaido
has been incredibly tight.

1450
01:45:58,722 --> 01:46:02,002
No reporters whatsoever
have been allowed near the site.

1451
01:48:42,714 --> 01:48:45,594
Restraint secure.
Life support functions normal.

1452
01:48:45,927 --> 01:48:46,767
Roger.

1453
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:48,930
This is Control.
Do you copy?

1454
01:48:49,307 --> 01:48:50,627
Reading you five-by-five.

1455
01:48:51,769 --> 01:48:53,209
Give me Ellie's PRD.

1456
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,400
Video unit recording
and transmitting.

1457
01:48:56,818 --> 01:48:59,338
-Are you reading me?
-That's affirmative.

1458
01:48:59,614 --> 01:49:01,254
Video looks good.

1459
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:03,239
Copy, Control.

1460
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:07,383
Ellie, we're going to proceed
to button you up.

1461
01:49:09,378 --> 01:49:10,458
I'm ready.

1462
01:49:14,385 --> 01:49:16,145
Confirming walkway retraction.

1463
01:49:16,931 --> 01:49:18,291
-Communications?
-Go.

1464
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:20,437
-Life support?
-Go.

1465
01:49:20,853 --> 01:49:22,213
We are go for closure.

1466
01:49:24,692 --> 01:49:26,332
I'm go here.

1467
01:49:27,446 --> 01:49:30,766
Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

1468
01:49:32,537 --> 01:49:34,217
Let me get you a chair.

1469
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:39,910
-lt's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
-You too.

1470
01:49:40,758 --> 01:49:42,518
Wouldn't peg him as a Polo man.

1471
01:49:51,983 --> 01:49:53,423
I got a visual on the door.

1472
01:49:55,905 --> 01:49:57,665
The door is looking good.

1473
01:50:02,999 --> 01:50:04,599
Door alignment looks good.

1474
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:35,359
We're green across the board.

1475
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:38,030
Copy that, Control.
IPV is secure.

1476
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:49,469
Copy that, 30%.

1477
01:50:54,366 --> 01:50:55,766
How you doing in there?

1478
01:50:56,369 --> 01:50:56,969
Kent?

1479
01:50:57,913 --> 01:50:58,633
Is that you?

1480
01:50:59,081 --> 01:51:00,601
That's a big affirmative.

1481
01:51:01,543 --> 01:51:02,983
Who let you in there?

1482
01:51:03,379 --> 01:51:05,299
A higher power intervened.

1483
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:08,787
I'm glad you came.

1484
01:51:13,519 --> 01:51:14,639
35%.

1485
01:51:15,481 --> 01:51:16,761
Copy that, 35%.

1486
01:51:17,066 --> 01:51:18,466
-Mechanical?
-We're good.

1487
01:51:18,694 --> 01:51:20,014
40%.

1488
01:51:23,576 --> 01:51:25,496
I'm picking up a moderate vibration.

1489
01:51:26,747 --> 01:51:28,707
Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?

1490
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,160
It looks good here.

1491
01:51:30,461 --> 01:51:33,541
She's feeling the same thing
they felt at the Cape.

1492
01:51:33,841 --> 01:51:34,881
Vibration's normal.

1493
01:51:38,348 --> 01:51:40,068
Copy that, 50%.

1494
01:51:45,608 --> 01:51:47,448
Vibration's a little stronger now.

1495
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:50,020
We're picking up
some low frequency noise.

1496
01:51:50,949 --> 01:51:52,429
Mechanical, confirm?

1497
01:51:52,702 --> 01:51:54,022
It looks fine to me.

1498
01:51:54,288 --> 01:51:56,368
Roger.
Jerry, what do you think?

1499
01:51:56,666 --> 01:51:57,506
I'm still go.

1500
01:51:57,751 --> 01:51:59,231
People, we are still go.

1501
01:52:02,091 --> 01:52:03,571
Something's happening.

1502
01:52:07,724 --> 01:52:09,084
You see that light?

1503
01:52:09,393 --> 01:52:10,473
I'm seeing...

1504
01:52:13,775 --> 01:52:15,655
I can't tell if it's daylight.

1505
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:18,929
There it is again.
It's coming from the bottom.

1506
01:52:20,493 --> 01:52:22,013
Let me show you.
See that?

1507
01:52:22,287 --> 01:52:24,407
Negative.
You're breaking up.

1508
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,913
-Can we boost signal?
-lt's at maximum.

1509
01:52:27,503 --> 01:52:28,743
65%%%.

1510
01:52:28,964 --> 01:52:30,604
The material is changing.

1511
01:52:30,842 --> 01:52:34,202
It's bordering on translucence.
The system's intact.

1512
01:52:37,685 --> 01:52:39,165
It has to be...

1513
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:41,839
...some kind of
electromagnetic field.

1514
01:52:42,192 --> 01:52:43,232
Do you read this?

1515
01:52:43,527 --> 01:52:45,047
We see only interference.

1516
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:46,999
It's becoming translucent.

1517
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:50,390
I can't describe it.
I can't even explain it!

1518
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:54,128
70%%%.

1519
01:52:54,376 --> 01:52:56,656
We have intermittent comm,
but we are go!

1520
01:52:57,089 --> 01:52:59,009
Initiate secondary drive systems.

1521
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,260
Initiating
auxiliary booster sequence.

1522
01:53:01,595 --> 01:53:03,075
We're go for ignition.

1523
01:53:10,525 --> 01:53:11,965
We have auxiliary ignition.

1524
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:20,020
Life support, how is she?

1525
01:53:20,289 --> 01:53:23,009
Heart and respiration are high
but within limits.

1526
01:53:23,502 --> 01:53:24,782
Ellie, do you copy?

1527
01:53:25,005 --> 01:53:25,885
If you hear...

1528
01:53:26,131 --> 01:53:27,931
...I am okay to go.

1529
01:53:36,730 --> 01:53:37,890
80%.

1530
01:53:38,232 --> 01:53:40,952
All vibration and G-levels
are in the green.

1531
01:53:46,453 --> 01:53:48,653
Control, if you're reading me...

1532
01:53:48,957 --> 01:53:51,117
...I am okay to go!
Okay to go!

1533
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,380
85%%%.

1534
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:54,030
All tips are on the profile.

1535
01:53:56,259 --> 01:53:59,139
90%%%. We're detecting
some structural instability.

1536
01:54:00,432 --> 01:54:03,232
-ls she holding?
-We're within limits, barely.

1537
01:54:04,855 --> 01:54:06,775
I'm okay to go!

1538
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:10,379
I'm okay to go!

1539
01:54:16,748 --> 01:54:18,108
My God!

1540
01:54:29,224 --> 01:54:30,584
Okay to go!

1541
01:54:30,852 --> 01:54:31,852
I'm okay!

1542
01:54:32,145 --> 01:54:33,585
100%%% target velocity.

1543
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:39,310
Tremendous EMI levels around Machine!
Field measurements are off-scale.

1544
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:41,940
We're approaching our abort limits.

1545
01:54:44,538 --> 01:54:45,698
Okay to go.

1546
01:54:50,881 --> 01:54:51,681
I hear her!

1547
01:54:52,258 --> 01:54:55,058
I hear her.
Barely, but she's there.

1548
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:56,590
Okay to go.

1549
01:54:56,932 --> 01:54:58,292
Says she's okay to go.

1550
01:55:01,355 --> 01:55:03,115
Steve, we're real close.

1551
01:55:03,525 --> 01:55:06,405
-Your core reading?
-lnternal environment looks normal.

1552
01:55:06,946 --> 01:55:09,546
Inside the core,
the weather's beautiful.

1553
01:55:13,748 --> 01:55:14,988
I'm okay to go.

1554
01:55:17,504 --> 01:55:18,984
I'm okay to go.

1555
01:55:19,507 --> 01:55:20,867
Initiate drop sequence.

1556
01:55:24,389 --> 01:55:26,109
On my mark.

1557
01:55:26,893 --> 01:55:27,853
10...

1558
01:55:28,353 --> 01:55:29,353
...9...

1559
01:55:30,398 --> 01:55:31,358
...8...

1560
01:55:32,943 --> 01:55:33,903
... 7...

1561
01:55:34,362 --> 01:55:35,322
...6...

1562
01:55:35,948 --> 01:55:36,908
...5...

1563
01:55:37,241 --> 01:55:38,201
...4...

1564
01:55:38,785 --> 01:55:39,385
...3...

1565
01:55:40,371 --> 01:55:41,291
...2...

1566
01:55:41,539 --> 01:55:42,539
I'm okay to go.

1567
01:55:46,922 --> 01:55:48,482
Oh, God!

1568
01:55:58,105 --> 01:55:59,705
Ellie to Control.

1569
01:56:00,442 --> 01:56:02,882
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

1570
01:56:07,619 --> 01:56:09,899
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

1571
01:56:16,132 --> 01:56:17,252
I'll try...

1572
01:56:18,135 --> 01:56:19,535
...to keep recording!

1573
01:56:20,305 --> 01:56:21,905
I'm going through...

1574
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:24,061
...some kind of a tunnel!

1575
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,105
There's a light source ahead!

1576
01:56:41,836 --> 01:56:42,916
Brilliant...

1577
01:56:43,172 --> 01:56:44,412
...blue-white.

1578
01:56:46,176 --> 01:56:47,616
Residual radiation?

1579
01:56:59,404 --> 01:57:00,684
It's a star.

1580
01:57:01,323 --> 01:57:02,443
I must have...

1581
01:57:03,201 --> 01:57:04,641
...gone through a wormhole.

1582
01:57:09,919 --> 01:57:11,159
It's Vega!

1583
01:57:22,396 --> 01:57:24,156
I'm in another wormhole now!

1584
01:57:27,904 --> 01:57:28,984
I had no idea!

1585
01:57:29,239 --> 01:57:30,679
A series of them!

1586
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:34,906
They're alive.

1587
01:57:35,165 --> 01:57:36,245
It's like...

1588
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:39,029
...some kind of a transit system.

1589
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:41,450
A subway!

1590
01:57:41,716 --> 01:57:43,036
Oh, God!

1591
01:57:48,768 --> 01:57:50,648
I have to keep talking.

1592
01:57:53,776 --> 01:57:55,056
It's a triple...

1593
01:57:55,278 --> 01:57:57,478
...no, a quadruple system.

1594
01:57:58,157 --> 01:57:59,197
Beautiful!

1595
01:58:02,497 --> 01:58:03,737
They're alive!

1596
01:58:12,178 --> 01:58:13,738
Another wormhole!

1597
01:58:14,181 --> 01:58:15,941
This one's much more violent!

1598
01:59:49,613 --> 01:59:50,573
Some...

1599
01:59:51,991 --> 01:59:53,631
...celestial event...

1600
01:59:55,163 --> 01:59:56,123
No!

1601
01:59:57,082 --> 01:59:58,562
No words!

1602
01:59:59,085 --> 02:00:00,645
No words...

1603
02:00:02,423 --> 02:00:04,023
...to describe it!

1604
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:07,579
Poetry!

1605
02:00:09,183 --> 02:00:10,663
They should have sent...

1606
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:12,517
...a poet.

1607
02:00:13,106 --> 02:00:14,506
It's so beautiful!

1608
02:00:15,818 --> 02:00:17,058
Beautiful!

1609
02:00:18,906 --> 02:00:20,666
So beautiful.

1610
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:27,650
I had no idea.

1611
02:03:07,362 --> 02:03:08,602
Hi, Sparks.

1612
02:03:10,534 --> 02:03:11,494
Dad?

1613
02:03:19,547 --> 02:03:21,027
I missed you.

1614
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,060
Aren't you...?

1615
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:31,070
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there for you, sweetheart.

1616
02:03:41,413 --> 02:03:42,693
You're not real.

1617
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:46,111
None of this is real!

1618
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:48,060
That's my scientist.

1619
02:03:49,508 --> 02:03:53,628
When I was unconscious, you
downloaded my thoughts, my memories.

1620
02:03:54,807 --> 02:03:56,087
Pensacola!

1621
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:01,799
We thought it might
make things easier for you.

1622
02:04:15,713 --> 02:04:17,113
Why did you contact us?

1623
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:18,941
You contacted us.

1624
02:04:19,552 --> 02:04:21,112
We were just listening.

1625
02:04:22,014 --> 02:04:23,294
There are others?

1626
02:04:23,683 --> 02:04:24,803
Many others.

1627
02:04:29,984 --> 02:04:31,144
They all...

1628
02:04:31,695 --> 02:04:34,735
...travel here through
that transit system you built?

1629
02:04:35,325 --> 02:04:36,805
We didn't build it.

1630
02:04:37,996 --> 02:04:39,476
We don't know who did.

1631
02:04:41,585 --> 02:04:44,105
They were gone
long before we ever got here.

1632
02:04:45,173 --> 02:04:46,933
Maybe someday they'll come back.

1633
02:04:48,011 --> 02:04:50,491
All the civilizations
you find come here?

1634
02:04:50,765 --> 02:04:51,965
Not all.

1635
02:04:53,769 --> 02:04:56,769
-ls this some test?
-No, no test.

1636
02:04:59,903 --> 02:05:01,343
You have your mother's hands.

1637
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:13,709
You're an interesting species...

1638
02:05:14,425 --> 02:05:16,025
...an interesting mix.

1639
02:05:17,387 --> 02:05:19,987
You're capable
of such beautiful dreams...

1640
02:05:21,143 --> 02:05:23,183
...and such horrible nightmares.

1641
02:05:24,815 --> 02:05:26,575
You feel so lost...

1642
02:05:27,402 --> 02:05:29,842
...so cut off, so alone.

1643
02:05:31,658 --> 02:05:32,898
Only you're not.

1644
02:05:37,459 --> 02:05:39,059
In all our searching...

1645
02:05:39,295 --> 02:05:42,135
...all we've found
that makes the emptiness bearable...

1646
02:05:42,967 --> 02:05:44,367
...is each other.

1647
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:49,910
What happens now?

1648
02:05:51,312 --> 02:05:52,392
Now?

1649
02:05:53,816 --> 02:05:55,216
You go home.

1650
02:05:55,819 --> 02:05:56,819
Home?

1651
02:05:57,321 --> 02:05:58,401
But...

1652
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:00,350
...I have so many questions.

1653
02:06:00,826 --> 02:06:02,386
Do we get to come back?

1654
02:06:03,539 --> 02:06:05,299
This was just a first step.

1655
02:06:06,001 --> 02:06:07,721
In time, you'll take another.

1656
02:06:09,339 --> 02:06:11,779
But other people need to see
what I've seen...

1657
02:06:12,051 --> 02:06:14,971
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.

1658
02:06:17,476 --> 02:06:19,076
Small moves, Ellie.

1659
02:06:21,023 --> 02:06:22,623
Small moves.

1660
02:07:06,214 --> 02:07:07,814
We've got video on Ellie!

1661
02:07:08,092 --> 02:07:09,972
She's through!
She is in the net.

1662
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:12,500
She's alive.
Get the President on the phone!

1663
02:07:13,433 --> 02:07:14,913
What's going on?
How is she?

1664
02:07:15,812 --> 02:07:17,452
Ellie, this is Control.
You copy?

1665
02:07:17,773 --> 02:07:19,133
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

1666
02:07:19,943 --> 02:07:21,463
-She's alive.
-Put her on P.A.

1667
02:07:21,779 --> 02:07:23,219
Ellie, hold on tight.

1668
02:07:23,949 --> 02:07:27,109
We're still trying to determine
the nature of the malfunction...

1669
02:07:27,454 --> 02:07:29,894
...but the important thing
is you're okay.

1670
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:31,210
What?

1671
02:07:31,585 --> 02:07:32,985
It's all right.

1672
02:07:33,254 --> 02:07:35,054
The important thing is you're safe.

1673
02:07:36,133 --> 02:07:37,893
What malfunction?

1674
02:07:42,351 --> 02:07:43,631
What happened?

1675
02:07:45,314 --> 02:07:46,794
What day is this?

1676
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:48,610
I'm sorry.

1677
02:07:48,860 --> 02:07:50,260
Did you say what day?

1678
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:53,430
How long was I gone?

1679
02:07:55,829 --> 02:07:59,829
The IPV dropped
straight through the Machine.

1680
02:08:00,878 --> 02:08:02,558
You didn't go anywhere.

1681
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:04,620
But I did.

1682
02:08:05,009 --> 02:08:06,249
I did go.

1683
02:08:06,845 --> 02:08:08,925
That's what I've tried
to tell everyone.

1684
02:08:13,647 --> 02:08:16,087
But the headset
didn't record a single image?

1685
02:08:16,902 --> 02:08:18,142
Just this.

1686
02:08:18,487 --> 02:08:19,487
Static.

1687
02:08:19,698 --> 02:08:20,658
Thank you.

1688
02:08:22,201 --> 02:08:23,841
Let me show you what we saw.

1689
02:08:33,927 --> 02:08:37,407
43 separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1690
02:08:37,891 --> 02:08:41,211
The IPV dropped straight through.
Everyone saw exactly...

1691
02:08:41,688 --> 02:08:43,008
...the same thing.

1692
02:08:43,399 --> 02:08:44,839
Nothing happened.

1693
02:08:46,529 --> 02:08:48,449
How do you explain this, Doctor?

1694
02:08:50,743 --> 02:08:51,903
I can't.

1695
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:53,520
I'd encourage you...

1696
02:08:55,375 --> 02:08:57,495
...not to inflame this situation...

1697
02:08:57,754 --> 02:08:59,514
...beyond the facts.

1698
02:08:59,757 --> 02:09:02,837
Let us deal with this on the facts.

1699
02:09:03,262 --> 02:09:06,142
We are monitoring
what has actually happened.

1700
02:09:06,433 --> 02:09:09,393
We are taking
what we believe are factually...

1701
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:11,650
...appropriate steps.

1702
02:09:12,025 --> 02:09:14,985
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

1703
02:09:15,279 --> 02:09:17,839
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

1704
02:09:18,159 --> 02:09:20,879
...the President has ordered
a special inquiry.

1705
02:09:21,163 --> 02:09:23,883
But the appointment
to the committee of Michael Kitz...

1706
02:09:24,168 --> 02:09:26,888
... who has resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1707
02:09:27,214 --> 02:09:29,534
...has raised eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

1708
02:09:29,843 --> 02:09:33,363
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, announced no candidacy.

1709
02:09:33,765 --> 02:09:36,965
I resigned as
National Security Advisor...

1710
02:09:37,312 --> 02:09:41,272
...in order to devote
all of my energy to this inquiry.

1711
02:09:42,194 --> 02:09:46,634
The people of the world have a right
to know what really happened.

1712
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:50,220
Yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1713
02:09:50,498 --> 02:09:54,338
...the IPV was out of contact
for only a fraction of a second.

1714
02:09:54,671 --> 02:09:56,431
Isn't that correct, Doctor?

1715
02:09:58,468 --> 02:10:00,708
A fraction of a second Earth time,
yes.

1716
02:10:01,639 --> 02:10:02,959
Earth time?

1717
02:10:03,225 --> 02:10:06,545
Senator, I believe that the Machine
opened up a wormhole...

1718
02:10:07,064 --> 02:10:11,504
...a tunnel through space-time, also
known as an Einstein-Rossen Bridge.

1719
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:16,030
Due to the effect of general relativity,
what I experienced as 18 hours...

1720
02:10:16,369 --> 02:10:18,569
...passed instantaneously on Earth.

1721
02:10:18,873 --> 02:10:22,833
Isn't it true these wormholes
are merely theoretical predictions?

1722
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:25,900
There is no evidence
they actually exist?

1723
02:10:26,217 --> 02:10:27,817
There is no direct evidence, no.

1724
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,340
Tell me...

1725
02:10:29,848 --> 02:10:32,688
...why would these aliens
go to all this trouble?

1726
02:10:33,394 --> 02:10:37,274
Bring you thousands of light years,
then send you home without proof?

1727
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:40,750
They said it's how it's been done
for billions of years.

1728
02:10:41,406 --> 02:10:44,566
You have no proof because
they didn't want you to have any.

1729
02:10:45,078 --> 02:10:46,958
A phenomenon known
in psychiatric circles...

1730
02:10:47,207 --> 02:10:49,487
...as a self-reinforcing delusion.

1731
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:51,820
You think I was delusional?

1732
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:56,090
I do think you may have suffered
some kind of an episode. Yes, I do.

1733
02:10:56,428 --> 02:10:59,148
I'd like to propose
an alternate hypothesis...

1734
02:10:59,433 --> 02:11:02,993
...and I'd like you to bring your
scientific expertise to bear on it.

1735
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:06,319
To fake a signal from Vega...

1736
02:11:07,236 --> 02:11:08,476
...what would you need?

1737
02:11:10,449 --> 02:11:14,089
You'd need a satellite to transmit
it, but it would be impossible to...

1738
02:11:14,455 --> 02:11:18,255
You'd need a satellite
and launch capabilities to orbit it.

1739
02:11:18,586 --> 02:11:21,706
And the message itself. To put
something like this together...

1740
02:11:22,091 --> 02:11:24,291
...so complex,
drawing on many disciplines...

1741
02:11:24,553 --> 02:11:25,833
Would be impossible.

1742
02:11:27,725 --> 02:11:29,205
Impossible?

1743
02:11:29,727 --> 02:11:32,527
Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

1744
02:11:33,566 --> 02:11:36,006
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

1745
02:11:36,362 --> 02:11:38,282
...enormous financial resources...

1746
02:11:38,824 --> 02:11:42,744
...someone perverse enough, eccentric
enough to come up with the idea?

1747
02:11:44,624 --> 02:11:45,344
Hadden?

1748
02:11:46,502 --> 02:11:48,422
S. R. Hadden.

1749
02:11:53,012 --> 02:11:54,612
You're implying that this was...

1750
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:57,370
...some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?

1751
02:11:57,644 --> 02:11:58,924
S. R. Hadden...

1752
02:11:59,354 --> 02:12:03,674
...a legendary power broker in
perhaps his final bid for immortality.

1753
02:12:04,195 --> 02:12:06,755
Maybe he wanted to
exploit new technologies...

1754
02:12:07,032 --> 02:12:09,152
...having world governments
pick up the tab.

1755
02:12:09,411 --> 02:12:12,091
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

1756
02:12:12,415 --> 02:12:15,895
...to unite the world in some
common goal. Maybe all of the above.

1757
02:12:16,421 --> 02:12:18,461
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant...

1758
02:12:19,217 --> 02:12:20,817
...and complicated man.

1759
02:12:23,724 --> 02:12:27,404
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

1760
02:12:28,230 --> 02:12:30,230
...known as Occam's Razor?

1761
02:12:36,576 --> 02:12:37,656
Yes.

1762
02:12:39,706 --> 02:12:44,226
It means the simplest explanation
generally tends to be the right one.

1763
02:12:44,588 --> 02:12:45,548
Exactly.

1764
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:48,740
You tell me.
What is more likely here?

1765
02:12:49,053 --> 02:12:52,293
A message from aliens
results in a magical machine...

1766
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:55,200
...that whisks you
to the center of the galaxy...

1767
02:12:55,521 --> 02:12:58,241
...to windsurf with Dad
and a split second later...

1768
02:12:58,567 --> 02:13:01,927
...returns you home
without a single shred of proof?

1769
02:13:02,489 --> 02:13:05,809
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

1770
02:13:06,119 --> 02:13:09,439
...the unwitting star in the
farewell performance of one...

1771
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:10,670
...S.R. Hadden?

1772
02:13:10,918 --> 02:13:14,478
A man with the means and motive
to play you and all of us...

1773
02:13:14,799 --> 02:13:18,959
...as pawns in the most elaborate,
most expensive hoax of all time?

1774
02:13:24,146 --> 02:13:27,666
You come to us with no evidence,
no records...

1775
02:13:28,569 --> 02:13:30,249
...no artifacts...

1776
02:13:30,656 --> 02:13:34,656
...only a story that, to put it
mildly, strains credibility.

1777
02:13:36,122 --> 02:13:39,002
Over half a trillion dollars
were spent.

1778
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:41,820
Dozens of lives were lost.

1779
02:13:43,007 --> 02:13:47,207
Are you going to sit there and tell
us we should just take this all...

1780
02:13:48,474 --> 02:13:49,834
...on faith?

1781
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,860
Please answer the question, Doctor.

1782
02:13:59,824 --> 02:14:01,904
Is it possible
that it didn't happen?

1783
02:14:02,244 --> 02:14:03,324
Yes.

1784
02:14:06,208 --> 02:14:09,248
As a scientist I must concede that.
I must volunteer that.

1785
02:14:13,844 --> 02:14:15,164
Let me get this straight.

1786
02:14:15,555 --> 02:14:19,395
You admit you have no physical
evidence to back up your story?

1787
02:14:20,145 --> 02:14:20,945
Yes.

1788
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:24,150
You admit you may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

1789
02:14:25,194 --> 02:14:27,434
You admit if you were
in our position...

1790
02:14:27,698 --> 02:14:31,098
...you would be as incredulous
and skeptical as we?

1791
02:14:32,747 --> 02:14:36,587
Then why don't you simply withdraw
your testimony and concede...

1792
02:14:37,045 --> 02:14:40,965
...that this journey to the center
of the galaxy never took place?

1793
02:14:44,097 --> 02:14:45,857
Because I can't.

1794
02:14:52,902 --> 02:14:55,502
I had an experience.

1795
02:14:57,951 --> 02:15:00,511
I can't prove it.
I can't even explain it.

1796
02:15:00,788 --> 02:15:03,668
But everything I know as
a human being, everything I am...

1797
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:06,040
...tells me it was real.

1798
02:15:08,592 --> 02:15:11,912
I was given something wonderful,
something that changed me forever.

1799
02:15:12,389 --> 02:15:13,429
A vision...

1800
02:15:14,016 --> 02:15:15,576
...of the universe...

1801
02:15:16,395 --> 02:15:18,475
...that tells us undeniably...

1802
02:15:19,024 --> 02:15:21,304
...how tiny and insignificant...

1803
02:15:21,569 --> 02:15:24,969
...and how rare and precious
we all are.

1804
02:15:26,284 --> 02:15:29,284
A vision that tells us
that we belong to something...

1805
02:15:29,664 --> 02:15:34,104
...that is greater than ourselves,
that none of us are alone.

1806
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:42,100
I wish I could share that.

1807
02:15:45,771 --> 02:15:46,851
I wish...

1808
02:15:48,525 --> 02:15:50,885
...that everyone, if even for one...

1809
02:15:51,321 --> 02:15:52,481
...moment...

1810
02:15:52,782 --> 02:15:54,022
...could feel...

1811
02:15:54,534 --> 02:15:57,414
...that awe and humility and hope.

1812
02:16:06,927 --> 02:16:09,087
That continues to be my wish.

1813
02:16:50,408 --> 02:16:52,928
Dr. Arroway,
can I get a picture, please.

1814
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:36,179
Reverend Joss!

1815
02:17:36,434 --> 02:17:37,994
What do you believe?!

1816
02:17:43,945 --> 02:17:47,785
As a person of faith, I'm bound by a
different covenant than Dr. Arroway.

1817
02:17:49,787 --> 02:17:51,867
But our goal is one and the same.

1818
02:17:52,458 --> 02:17:54,058
The pursuit of truth.

1819
02:17:57,674 --> 02:17:58,914
l, for one, believe her.

1820
02:18:22,502 --> 02:18:25,342
So what happens now?
We give her a medal?

1821
02:18:25,882 --> 02:18:28,202
I'd say at least a healthy grant.

1822
02:18:28,678 --> 02:18:31,958
You read the confidential report
from the investigating committee?

1823
02:18:32,308 --> 02:18:33,668
I flipped through it.

1824
02:18:34,186 --> 02:18:38,306
I was very interested in the section
on Arroway's video unit.

1825
02:18:39,193 --> 02:18:41,433
The one that recorded the static.

1826
02:18:42,866 --> 02:18:44,106
Continue.

1827
02:18:45,161 --> 02:18:48,401
The fact that it recorded static
isn't what interests me.

1828
02:18:53,882 --> 02:18:55,122
Continue.

1829
02:18:56,052 --> 02:18:57,852
What interests me...

1830
02:18:58,221 --> 02:19:01,781
...is that it recorded
approximately 18 hours of it.

1831
02:19:07,193 --> 02:19:08,993
That is interesting, isn't it?

1832
02:19:15,789 --> 02:19:19,589
And you can see over there,
we're building 45 brand new dishes.

1833
02:19:20,004 --> 02:19:23,684
That means when you put them together
with all the radio telescopes...

1834
02:19:24,051 --> 02:19:25,371
...all over the world...

1835
02:19:25,637 --> 02:19:29,837
...we'll hear farther into space
than anyone has ever heard before.

1836
02:19:31,562 --> 02:19:34,362
Are there other people
out there in the universe?

1837
02:19:35,443 --> 02:19:36,803
That's a good question.

1838
02:19:37,112 --> 02:19:38,192
What do you think?

1839
02:19:38,865 --> 02:19:39,825
I don't know.

1840
02:19:40,325 --> 02:19:41,805
That's a good answer.

1841
02:19:43,121 --> 02:19:44,081
Skeptic, huh?

1842
02:19:45,416 --> 02:19:49,776
The important thing is that you all
keep searching for your own answers.

1843
02:19:50,465 --> 02:19:52,425
One thing about the universe,
though.

1844
02:19:53,470 --> 02:19:54,590
The universe...

1845
02:19:55,139 --> 02:19:57,219
...is a pretty big place.

1846
02:19:58,310 --> 02:20:00,550
It's bigger than anything...

1847
02:20:01,022 --> 02:20:03,742
...anyone has ever
dreamed of before.

1848
02:20:05,445 --> 02:20:07,085
So if it's just us...

1849
02:20:08,992 --> 02:20:11,072
...it seems like
an awful waste of space.

1850
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:14,000
Right?
