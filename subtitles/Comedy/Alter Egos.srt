That superhero's name

Then why is the government

You can charge that to the room.

Hey, I'm sorry that asshole cop
mentioned your dad like that.

I'm used to it, right?

221
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,737
- Your dad
was a great superhero.

- Really?
How great could he be?

223

Either he did
what everybody said he did,

224
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,710
or he was too stupid,
he just let it happen.

- Yeah, well, the supercorps
said he didn't do it.

226
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,247
- Then why couldn't they
prove it?

- Well--
- no, no, no, no, no, no.

I don't want to debate it.

I don't want to talk about it.

I've got my own life.
Got my own problems.

231
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:12,456
Like, for example,
when I don't meet Emily today,

232
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,525
she's gonna hate me,
exactly like she hates Brendan.

233
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,462
Unless I create
another alter ego for myself.

234
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,597
- Don't do that.

235
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:23,500
- I might do it.

00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:28,305

you were Brendan?

Technically, this is supposed
to be my day off.

00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,879
- You have to clear
your schedule.

240
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,614
You don't just punch a clock
on a mission.

241
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,349
With great power
comes great respon--

242
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:40,550
- yeah, all right,
I get the point.

243
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,420
Can I call her from your phone?

244
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:45,789
- You can't use
a superhero phone.

245
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,659
What is she going to think
when she sees the caller I.D.?

246
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,828
That I was going to Hampton bays
to meet you,

247
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,830
so I don't think she's
really going to freak out.

248
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,966
- You told her
about this mission?

249
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:57,634
- She's my girlfriend.

250
00:12:57,636 --> 00:13:00,637
- Oh, come on, man, no.
She's Brendan's girlfriend.

251
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,639
She's not supposed to know
about superhero stuff.

252
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:05,976
- Okay, well, it's not really
that simple.

253
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:10,747
Because she's, um...
She's cheating on me.

- With me.
Fridge.

257
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:23,960
- Look, bottom line is that
Emily is not happy with Brendan.

258
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:28,799
She doesn't want to be dating
some broke wannabe cartoonist.

259
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,802
- This is a seriously
unprofessional situation.

260
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:35,105
- She deserves more
than just hanging around,

261
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,506
ordering takeout,

262
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:38,975
and watching reruns
with that guy.

263
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,410
- Is that for dramatic effect?

264
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,812
- Wh-what?

265
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,580
- Calling him "that guy"?

266
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:44,715
It's you.
You're him.

267
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,450
You're that guy.

268
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,085
- It's funny.
I don't feel like him.

269
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,686
Not, like, one little bit.

270
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:52,522
I actually think
that I'm taller than Brendan.

271
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,358
You think that's possible?

272
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,361
- No.

273
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:58,929

that Fridge

was always a way bigger hit
with the ladies.

275
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,836
So when I, Fridge, saw her
walking down the street,

276
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:09,973
I froze the sidewalk, right,
to make her slip and fall

277
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,008
so that I could catch her
and save her.

She had never looked
at Brendan--

00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:23,687
at me--like that before.

282
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,589
And then when I, Brendan,

283
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:27,457
called her to ask
what she was doing that night,

284
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,126
she said she was sick
and had to stay in,

285
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:30,961
when really she had plans
with me, Fridge.

286
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:33,864
I took her to some place
that Brendan could never afford.

287
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,800
There were these guys
who owed me a favor.

288
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:39,403
I kept their freezer cold
during the blackout.

289
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:43,006
And then we went
back to her apartment.

You see why I don't want to
change back into my alter ego?

If I become Brendan,
who knows what he's going to do?

295
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,487
He might do something stupid,
and break up with her.

296
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:58,889
Then he's going to ruin this
great thing

that I've got going on
with Emily.

So you can test out

And it's not really

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,526
- Jesus Christ.

643
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,894
I am just going through
some shit right now.

644
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,763
- Well, don't take it out on me,
dickhead.

645
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:41,831
- Don't do that.

646
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,966
Can I say something please?
- What?

647
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,868
- Can I say one thing?
- What?

648
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,103
- I really like you.

649
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:49,372
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

650
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:50,773
We had some good times together.

651
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:52,842
- Then why do you want
to break up with me?

652
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:54,510
- Why do you think?

653
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:56,779
- I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

654
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:59,548
- Really?
- Yes, really.

655
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,916
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

656
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:02,985
Uh-huh, why?
- Yeah.

657
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,988
- Um...
- Why?

658
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,157
- Shit.
You know what?

659
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,558
I'm going to, um...

660
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,595
Can you give me one second,
please?

661
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,597
- What?
- I need one second.

662
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,866
- Come on.
What the hell, Fridge?

663
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,837
Come on, Fridge!

664
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:28,744
- Excuse me, ma'am.

665
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:33,616
I was just looking...
For a friend of mine.

666
00:31:33,618 --> 00:31:35,184
- You know, that's very rude.

667
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,553
- Oh, sorry.

668
00:31:43,427 --> 00:31:46,195
Fridge!

669
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,597
I don't have time for this.

670
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,872
Fridge!
What are you doing?

671
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,475
- Hey, claudel.

672
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,710
- You got my 15 bucks?

673
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:02,578
- What?

674
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,481
Oh, shit, the mug.

675
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:07,116
Right.
Um...

676
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:11,020
Just let me say that I'd like
to apologize about that.

677
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:14,190
- I don't believe you,
cold sore,

678
00:32:14,192 --> 00:32:15,224
or whatever your name is.

679
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,659
- [Chuckles]
Yes.

680
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:18,127
[Clears throat]
Okay.

681
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:20,863
Right.
Great.

682
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:41,951
I will be right there.

683
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:51,026
Hey.

684
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,095
Claudel?

685
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:58,834
Claudel!
Hey!

686
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:01,604
I'm really sorry
to keep you waiting.

687
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,240
- Oh, I figured you forgot.
Um, no biggie.

688
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,208
Are you still on for lunch?

689
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,246
- The thing is, could we push
lunch back just a little bit?

690
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:13,215
I'm kind of loaded down
with work stuff.

691
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,884
- Brendan?
Who the hell is this?

692
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:18,087
- Emily!
What are you doing here?

693
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:20,856
- What do you think, idiot?
- Oh, God.

694
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:22,791
- Brendan.

695
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,860
Can I talk to you
a moment alone, please?

696
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:29,164
- God damn it.
- You know him?

697
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,133
- No, no.

698
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,701
No, absolutely not.

699
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:34,103
- It's important.

700
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,672
- Does anybody look like
they need to be saved here,

701
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,007
captain honeybuzz?

702
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:41,176
We're all safe here,
so you can go.

703
00:33:41,178 --> 00:33:44,113
Thank you.
Back to the hive.

704
00:33:44,115 --> 00:33:47,283
I'm sorry, um--
this is my girlfriend.

705
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:49,585
This is my ex-girlfriend,
Emily.

706
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:52,788
- So you lied when you said
you had work?

707
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,623
- Oh, no, I didn't lie,
because I have work.

708
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,225
- Oh, is that what I am to you,
Brendan, work, huh?

709
00:33:56,227 --> 00:34:00,162
- No, damn it, I didn't
mean that when I said work.

710
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,332
- Wow, okay, you two seem
like you have a lot to discuss.

711
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,901
- No.
- Yes, no, we do.

712
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,102
- I'll see you around.

713
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,637
- Great, that's great.

714
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,072
Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

715
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:12,675
- What are you doing here?
Are you here to apologize?

716
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,677
- Apologize to you?

717
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,745
Have you lost your mind?

718
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:18,147
- Well, no, because I know

719
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,849
you're sleeping
with that superhero, Fridge.

720
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,052
Yeah, guess how.
He told me.

721
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:24,687
So...

722
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,659
- But you two
are the same person.

723
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,628
- Who the hell told you that?

724
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,063
- Oh, come on.
You look the same.

725
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:36,131
You sound the same.
You smell the same.

726
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,801
You fuck the same.
- We fuck the same?

727
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:43,272
- No, not really.
But I'm your girlfriend, okay?

728
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:45,040
I know these things.

729
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,810
That superheroes
have these alter egos

730
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,345
to hide among civilians.

731
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:53,082
So you made up this
Clark Kent-type loser, okay?

732
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:57,186
I'm just trying to help you
get free of this geek.

733
00:34:57,188 --> 00:35:01,090
You're just
so much more passionate

734
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:04,827
when you're
in that Fridge costume.

735
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,772
- No.

736
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:17,906
- Please?
- No, no, no.

737
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:22,778
Look, Brendan is the real me.

738
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,181
- What?

739
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:28,751
- Brendan is the real me.

740
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:30,119
- Are you sure?

741
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,387
- Yes, I'm sure.

742
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:35,991
- Well, why would you
choose Brendan?

743
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,860
- It's not a choice, Emily.

744
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:40,129
That's just the way it is.

745
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:42,998
- Well, you should know that I'm
not gonna choose Brendan.

746
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,670
- Right, see, and that is why
we are breaking up.

747
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,672
- [Sighs]

748
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:51,707
I want to hear that from Fridge.

749
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,275
- Fridge is not available
right now.

750
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,011
- No, no, I came
all the way here to talk to him,

751
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:57,746
not this loser.

752
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:59,281
So if you want to break up
with me,

753
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,783
do it in your Fridge costume.

754
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,018
- That's not gonna
change anything.

755
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,755
This loser is breaking up
with you.

756
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:08,157
We're over.

757
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,726
- Fine.

758
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:15,097
Fine!

759
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:16,465
And, for the record,

760
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:21,236
it's not cheating
if it's with the same person.

761
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:23,939
- Okay, I take that back.

762
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:25,974
Just so long as you promise

763
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:31,447
that you will never
reveal my identity to anyone.

764
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:34,349
- You're insane.

765
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:38,353
I can't believe I let you ice
all over my face.

766
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:41,724
[Sighs]

767
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,937
- Well, that is a woman
who reads her emails.

768
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,342
I don't know what to say.
I'm--I'm--

769
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:03,078
- should I upgrade you
to the honeymoon suite?

770
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,915
- No, we are 100% broken up.

771
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,284
I promise you.

772
00:37:09,286 --> 00:37:12,154
- You were just making out
all over the parking lot.

773
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:14,490
- She kissed me.

774
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:15,891
- The last thing that I need

775
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:18,761
is another guy
who has another girl.

776
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:22,865
- I know.
I'm really sorry about that.

777
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,234
Look, I want to get
to know you better,

778
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:28,137
and I want to have lunch
with you,

779
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:33,542
just sometime closer
to dinnertime.

780
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:37,379
- Are you asking me to dinner?

781
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,381
- Will you have dinner with me?

782
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,386
- Yes.

783
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:47,089
- Great.

784
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:50,526
That's very good news.

785
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:52,027
Okay.

786
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:09,912
Hey, dude.

787
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:14,216
Look, I'm sorry I've been
out of it,

788
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,218
but I got everything
sorted out now.

789
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,286
Emily's gone.

790
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:19,154
I got a dinner date
with claudel.

791
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,522
Weather's clearing up.

792
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:24,493
So let's just focus
on the mission, right?

793
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:27,129
So what'd you want to tell me
about the prisoner?

794
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:28,430
- He's your parents' killer.

795
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,299
- Okay, wow, Jesus.
I said I was sorry.

796
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,100
You don't have to be a dick
about it.

797
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,435
- I'm not joking.

798
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:34,903
I'm serious.

799
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,572
The supervillain who killed
your mom and dad

800
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:39,441
is in that room.

801
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:42,110
