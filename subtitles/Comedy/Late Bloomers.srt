00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,015
Were you early, Auntie?

20
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,685
No, I just arrived.
Where's your father today?

21
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,356
Working at home,
past his deadline.

22
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,866
You know, moths ruined
your uncle's striped trousers.

23
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,534
Could Katsu wear them?

24
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,205
Bu? Wouldn't he look odd
in striped shorts?

25
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,042
That doesn't matter.
Just snip off the legs.

26
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,878
I could fix them, but...

27
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,713
Please do.

28
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,551
You've brought them?

29
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,222
Don't bother too much.
They won't last.

30
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,724
But reinforce the seat.

31
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,744
I missed you.

32
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,583
I did wait at
Shimbashi Station though.

33
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,420
I missed my train.

34
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:04,763
Please forgive the delay.
Let's begin.

35
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,386
Eraser.

36
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,395
Found it?

37
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,066
Oh, here it is.

38
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,736
"Friedrich List."
There's no "z" after all.

39
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:32,244
Just as I thought.
Liszt was the composer.

40
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,748
"1811 to 1886."

41
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,419
<i>Electric company.
Meter check.</i>

42
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,920
Sure, go ahead.

43
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,590
<i>Got a stool handy?</i>

44
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,759
Where is it?

45
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,095
In the corridor,
under the stairs.

46
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,597
- Sorry.
- No bother.

47
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,605
<i>Thanks.</i>

48
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,784
So Professor,
List was mostly self-taught?

49
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:18,957
Yes, and he became a noted economist
of the historical school.

50
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,794
He loathed bureaucracy...

51
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,796
<i>You're three kilowatts over.</i>

52
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,298
Thanks.

53
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,805
How many pages done?

54
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,141
- 12 or 13.
- I see.

55
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,312
That means six or seven more.

56
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,168
I'm home.

57
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,089
I'm home.

58
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,591
- Hello Mr. Hattori.
- Hello.

59
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,428
Rewriting?
Thanks for saving me the trouble.

60
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,097
How's your aunt?

61
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,266
She had to rush home.

62
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,600
Make us some tea.

63
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,605
Can you stay for dinner?

64
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,024
No, I must be going.

65
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,736
Why? I can go to Tokyo
with you tomorrow.

66
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,947
Tokyo? What for?

67
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,577
To see the doctor.
And you need some new collars.

68
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,800
Professor, we miscalculated
my mahjong hand the other day.

69
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:53,927
We did?

70
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,472
So it was 8 and 16?

71
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,975
I was ahead after all.

72
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,646
Say, Noriko!

73
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:07,816
Noriko!

74
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,487
Is Sei at home?

75
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,655
Why?

76
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,158
Go see.
We'll have a game.

77
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,327
Are you done?

78
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,329
Yes. Almost.

79
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,414
No game then!

80
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,670
Get our tea!

81
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,065
You brought the manuscript?

82
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,733
Yes, of course.

83
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,437
Hey, want to sit?

84
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,107
No, I'm fine.

85
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,462
Home at the usual time?

86
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:19,174
Yes, unless there's
a faculty meeting.

87
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,677
Take care.

88
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,899
- Professor Onodera?
- Hello!

89
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,067
Just arrived?

90
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,362
No, yesterday.
You're looking better.

91
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,905
I am?

92
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,534
Got plans?

93
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,702
Shopping.

94
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,703
May I join you?

95
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,871
You're not busy?

96
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,205
Not any more.

97
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,377
Look, an art exhibition.
Shall we go?

98
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,546
I need sewing needles.

99
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,089
Let's get some.

100
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,494
"Art Associations Joint Exhibit"

101
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:03,090
"Takigawa Restaurant"

102
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,573
Tired, Nori dear?

103
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,118
It was worth it.
To see Ueno again.

104
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,080
But you know,
some people are awful.

105
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,126
See the guy shooting at
that pigeon on the statue?

106
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,587
Who was he, William Tell?

107
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,089
<i>Here you are.</i>

108
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,927
Professor Shigeno dropped by.

109
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,304
Oh? He's still in town?

110
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,265
Said he was leaving this morning.

111
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,938
By the way,
this is Somiya's daughter.

112
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,483
Really? What a lovely young lady.

113
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,444
Didn't she used to have a bowl cut?

114
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,821
- That's her.
- You don't say.

115
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,115
Your father comes here often.

116
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,285
Welcome.

117
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,794
- Warm sake?
- Sure.

118
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,130
Nori dear, some sake?

119
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,799
Not for me.

120
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,677
Something else then?
Some food?

121
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,805
I'm fine for now.
Let me pour for you.

122
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,139
Alright then.

123
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,477
- More please.
- Yes sir.

124
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,361
You know...

125
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,823
I heard...

126
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:31,992
Heard what?

127
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,704
That you remarried.

128
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,163
Yes, I did.

129
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,374
I feel sorry for Misako.

130
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,500
Why?

131
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,712
It's just... awkward, isn't it?

132
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,841
It doesn't seem so.
They get on quite well.

133
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,178
Do they really?
It still upsets me.

134
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,848
What does? My new wife?

135
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,018
Not her. You.

136
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,519
Why?

137
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,189
It seems... unclean.

138
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,190
Unclean?

139
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,027
- Dirty, even.
- Dirty?

140
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,865
What a predicament!
So I'm dirty now?

141
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,872
- Any better?
- Not at all.

142
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:23,752
Really? Not at all?
What a pretty pickle I'm in.

143
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,919
Indeed.

144
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,257
- I see. Unclean, eh?
- Exactly.

145
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,718
You got me good.

146
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,251
I'm back.

147
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm back. With a guest.

148
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,093
Who?

149
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,262
- Hey!
- Ho!

150
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,266
I was going home
when I met Nori in Ginza.

151
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,602
Business in town?

152
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,938
Yes, the Education Ministry.

153
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,441
Father, a surprise.

154
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,822
Oh! Where were they?

155
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,327
Not here, that's for sure!

156
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,621
Ta-da!

157
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,999
Ah, Takigawa?
You went there?

158
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,503
Yes, I made her
keep me company all day.

159
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,506
- More sake?
- Great idea!

160
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,799
- Any left?
- Yes.

161
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,134
Warm it up.

162
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,344
How's your blood count?

163
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,512
Down to 15.

164
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,305
Oh? That's good.

165
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,017
She's much healthier.

166
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,480
Working so hard during the war
took its toll.

167
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,986
And she spent her rare days off
carrying spuds home.

168
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,697
Times were tough.
She suffered.

169
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,160
There isn't much.

170
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,870
It's fine, dear.

171
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,880
Is your family well?

172
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,716
Yes, but it seems I've sinned.

173
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,675
How?

174
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,219
Nori called me "unclean."

175
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,888
- Who is?
- I am.

176
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,724
I'm dirty, aren't I Nori?

177
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,350
Yes, you are!

178
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,522
Is Misa well?

179
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:55,361
She's just as bad. She's got the idea
that marriage is life's graveyard.

180
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,239
Says she won't marry till she's 24.

181
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,243
Then again,
she may be right.

182
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,581
Anyway, it's out of my hands.
But how about Nori?

183
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,919
Yes, it's time I did something
about her.

184
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,922
She's 27?

185
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,597
- It's lukewarm.
- Oh, I'll...

186
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,766
- Do it next time.
- Alright.

187
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,105
Is the seaside near?

188
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,900
A 15-minute walk.

189
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,779
That far?
Is it on this side?

190
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,447
No, that side.

191
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,784
Oh. And the shrine's over this way?

192
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,619
No, that way.

193
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,079
And Tokyo?

194
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,289
Tokyo's that way.

195
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,958
So that's east?

196
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,418
No, that's east.

197
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,129
Oh? Has it always been so?

198
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,798
Yes, of course it has.

199
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:02,971
No wonder Yoritomo moved
his shogunate here. It's unconquerable!

200
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,908
Alright? Aren't you tired?

201
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,202
No, I'm fine!

202
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,759
So which type am I?

203
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,471
Well, you don't seem like
the jealous type.

204
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,641
On the contrary, I am.

205
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,268
I wonder.

206
00:23:56,144 --> 00:24:00,982
As they say, my sliced pickled radish
stays linked together.

207
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,445
That's to do with you and your knife.

208
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,657
There's no link between
pickled radish and jealousy.

209
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,494
So, you like linked pickled radish?

210
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,332
I like some, every now and then.

211
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,667
You do?

212
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,314
Young people have changed a lot
since our day.

213
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,984
Like that bride.
She's from good stock,

214
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,362
but she wolfed down everything,
even sake.

215
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,368
Stuffing sashimi into that
big painted mouth. I was shocked.

216
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,497
Who wouldn't?
Food used to be scarce.

217
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:04,003
At my wedding, I was so grateful,
I couldn't even eat a rice ball.

218
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,380
But you'd eat it now.

219
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,218
Never! Then again,
who can say?

220
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,678
You'd eat.

221
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,554
Would I now?

222
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,555
You would.

223
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,392
Perhaps you're right.
But not the sashimi.

224
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,727
Yes, you would.

225
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,521
- I would?
- Yes.

226
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,069
You don't want a bride to cry,

227
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,572
but if she doesn't,
she wasn't raised right.

228
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,908
That's a sign of the times.

229
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,535
What about Nori?

230
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,538
She's not the crying type.

231
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,915
No, what about her marrying?

232
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,252
She's healthy now, right?

233
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,712
She is, but...

234
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,423
She should have married long ago.

235
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,261
- How about him?
- Who?

236
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,554
Your assistant.

237
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,389
Oh, Hattori?

238
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,724
Well? How about him?

239
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,562
He'd be a good catch,
but whether Noriko agrees...

240
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,441
It doesn't seem likely.
They're just friends.

241
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:11,737
But who knows how she feels
deep down inside?

242
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,613
You think?

243
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,284
I do. That's what young people
are like today.

244
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,243
You think?

245
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,078
- Why not ask?
- Who?

246
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,788
- Nori.
- Ask what?

247
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,957
If she likes Hattori.

248
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,586
I see. Perhaps I will ask.

249
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,422
Ask her, or we'll never know.

250
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,425
You never can tell.

251
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,859
I'm back.

252
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,697
Hello. You're early.

253
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,210
Train crowded?

254
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,711
No, I got a seat.

255
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,340
Your aunt gave us some pickles.

256
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,508
She did?

257
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,885
The 28th is your PEN Club.

258
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,055
Oh, at the Country Club.

259
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,390
This Saturday.

260
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,728
Mr. Hattori was here.

261
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,563
When?

262
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,901
Just past noon.
Would you like your dinner now?

263
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:19,073
We went out together.
On bicycles.

264
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,575
With Hattori?

265
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,744
Shichirigahama's lovely.

266
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,934
What did he say?

267
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,769
Nothing in particular.

268
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,699
Hey, Noriko! A towel!

269
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,622
You shared a bike?

270
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,709
Don't be silly!
Sei lent me one.

271
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,733
We're out of soap.

272
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,234
Oh?

273
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,491
My sash.

274
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,250
Shichirigahama was nice?

275
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,420
- Yes, we went on to Chigasaki.
- I see.

276
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,790
It's a little burnt.

277
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,388
So, how about Hattori?

278
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,225
How about him?

279
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,726
Yes, Hattori.

280
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,854
He's quite nice.

281
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,484
Would he make a good husband?

282
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,820
I'm sure he would.

283
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,321
He would?

284
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,323
He's kind.

285
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,659
Yes. Yes he is.

286
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,498
I like his type.

287
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,338
Your aunt was wondering how he'd be.

288
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,507
For what?

289
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,760
For you. As your husband.

290
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,848
What?

291
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,267
Tea! Some tea, please!

292
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,523
What is it?

293
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:44,862
Father, he has a fiancée.
They got engaged a long time ago.

294
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:49,950
She's sweet and pretty.
Three years my junior at school.

295
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:50,868
I see.

296
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:56,081
He'll tell you about it soon.
I know the girl well.

297
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,374
I see.

298
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,878
We should give them a gift.

299
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,297
I see.

300
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,217
So Hattori's getting married.

301
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,637
What should we give?

302
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,558
So he's already engaged?

303
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:15,643
He is.

304
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,254
- What would you like?
- I don't know.

305
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,006
Just a hint.

306
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,843
A keepsake from the professor
would be nice.

307
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:54,098
We can only afford 2 or 3,000 yen.

308
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,349
I'm not sure.

309
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:56,767
Any good ideas?

310
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,602
Sure. I'll think it over.

311
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:01,105
- With your fiancée?
- Alright.

312
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,777
Want to see Mari Iwamoto play violin?

313
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,613
- When?
- Tonight. I have tickets.

314
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,031
That's nice.

315
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,954
You bought them for me?

316
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:17,955
I did.

317
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:18,706
Really?

318
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:19,790
Of course!

319
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,542
Are you sure?

320
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,046
I'd better not.
She'll be jealous.

321
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,966
- Come on, let's go.
- No way.

322
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,384
She won't mind.

323
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,052
I'd rather not.

324
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,976
Your pickles are linked?

325
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,187
Yes, my blade must
be getting dull.

326
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:15,157
"Mari Iwamoto Solo Violin Recital"

327
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,171
<i>Good evening!</i>

328
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,007
- Who's there?
<i>- Mr. Somiya?</i>

329
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,260
- Aya?
<i>- Yes.</i>

330
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,188
<i>- Good evening.</i>
- Come in.

331
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,439
<i>Is Nori home?</i>

332
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,191
She will be soon.
Come in.

333
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,955
Sit over here.

334
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:11,628
Closer.

335
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,384
I visited my sister in Hayama.

336
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,719
I see.

337
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,471
I hear you've been
doing well lately.

338
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,640
In what way?

339
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,809
That you're very busy.

340
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,644
Not so much.

341
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,731
Typists are in great demand, no?

342
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:34,401
I'm not a typist.
I'm a stenographer.

343
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,236
Oh, pardon me.

344
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,824
You do English shorthand?

345
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:41,742
I do.

346
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:42,743
Impressive.

347
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,994
Not really.

348
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,412
Yes, it is.

349
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,916
Not short of money then.

350
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,251
Well, the pay's not bad.

351
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,669
I see.

352
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:59,009
So, your parents aren't nagging you?

353
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:00,677
About what?

354
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:01,929
To remarry.

355
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,099
No, not for some time.
Knock on wood.

356
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,768
Once was enough?

357
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,770
What, marriage?

358
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,023
I wouldn't say that.

359
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,193
- What's his name?
- Who?

360
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,195
- Your ex.
- Ah, Ken.

361
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:21,531
Yes, Kenkichi.
Seen him since?

362
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:22,950
No, not once.

363
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,618
But if you did?

364
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,119
I'd glare at him.

365
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,455
He's that bad?

366
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,541
I'd run away.
I detest him.

367
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,378
Is that so?

368
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,887
<i>- I'm home.</i>
- Hello you!

369
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:45,722
What's wrong?

370
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,557
My legs fell asleep.

371
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,560
It's you, Aya!

372
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,896
- I'm back.
- Hello.

373
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,481
We were chatting.

374
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,816
Staying tonight?

375
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:56,900
Let's go up.

376
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,235
Had dinner?

377
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,237
I'm fine. Have you?

378
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,322
- I have.
- Let's go.

379
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,842
Why'd you miss class reunion?

380
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:22,843
Many come?

381
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,345
14 or 15.
Mrs. Spitfire too.

382
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,182
Professor Murase?
Foaming at the mouth as usual?

383
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,186
Yes. Spat all over the place.
Even in our tea.

384
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,689
No one near her drank theirs.

385
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,524
Mine was safe though.

386
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,651
- Did that girl come?
- Who?

387
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,361
The first to be wed.

388
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,988
- Oh, Ikegami?
- Yes.

389
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:50,871
She fibs. She claimed
she had only three children,

390
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,207
but it's really four.
She left one out.

391
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,208
Four already?

392
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:59,838
That's right. Plus,
Fish-Face Shinoda was there.

393
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,048
Oh, Shinoda?

394
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,051
She left her job to get married.

395
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,844
Where's he from?

396
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,554
Mikawashima.

397
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,222
Really?

398
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,850
No, but it's likely.

399
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,064
Oh, thank you.

400
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,565
Some bread and tea.

401
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,025
You shouldn't have.

402
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,069
Will this do?

403
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,905
- There's no sugar.
- Oh, right.

404
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,740
Father, I'll get it.

405
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,868
I'll turn in then.
Good night, Aya.

406
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,578
Good night.

407
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,377
Some bread?

408
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,045
A little later.

409
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,381
We're missing spoons too.

410
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,924
We are.

411
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,760
Was she there? Watanabe?

412
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,554
Oh, Kuro?
She couldn't come.

413
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,600
She's pregnant. Large tummy.
Seven months along.

414
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,396
Really? When did she marry?

415
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,272
She didn't.

416
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,739
Oh dear!

417
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:12,285
Such things happen.
It's all divine providence.

418
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,581
Only you and Hirokawa
are still single.

419
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,749
Really?

420
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,793
When will you marry?

421
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,795
I won't.

422
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,797
You should. And quickly.

423
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,466
- I won't.
- You should!

424
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,928
Don't tell me that.
You've no right.

425
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,639
I do. I've every right.

426
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,975
No way, divorcee.

427
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,812
I do. I've only got one strike.

428
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,481
Next time I'll get a hit.

429
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,652
Going to bat again?

430
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,281
Sure. I just had a bad first innings.

431
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,324
The right ball will come.

432
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,660
You should go for it too.

433
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,330
What's so funny?
I'm serious.

434
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,791
How about that bread now?

435
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,126
Bread can wait.

436
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:02,836
I'm starving.

437
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,337
Too bad.

438
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,340
I'll eat alone then.

439
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:10,677
I'd like some too, actually.

440
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,679
I'll go get some.

441
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,181
Got any jam?

442
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,015
We do.

443
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,516
Bring a little.

444
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,018
Or a lot, "actually"?

445
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,019
A lot.

446
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,757
Bu honey?

447
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:35,929
Why don't you go play ball?
Did you get in a fight?

448
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,771
Bu honey!
Why are you so mad?

449
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,110
It won't dry. The paint.

450
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,612
What paint?

451
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:54,447
On my bat.

452
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,450
- Oh, you painted it red?
- Yeah.

453
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:03,623
Oh dear, the hallway's a mess.
Your mother will scold you.

454
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,085
- She already did.
- Did you cry?

455
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,964
No I didn't. Go away, Noriko.
You nagging Nelly.

456
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:13,800
Big talk for a crybaby.

457
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:18,805
What? Want me to oil you too?
Go away, nagging Nelly!

458
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,265
Bu honey!

459
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,435
- Nori dear!
- Has your guest left?

460
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,478
No, but come on down.

461
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,314
Hey!

462
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,609
You're grounded today.

463
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:49,461
This is Somiya's daughter, Noriko.
This is Mrs. Miwa.

464
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,841
I see you often in Kita Kamakura.

465
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,510
Do forgive my staying so long.

466
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,346
Not at all.

467
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,475
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

468
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,029
Nori dear, come here.

469
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:23,036
Have a seat.

470
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,375
What is it?

471
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,382
Isn't it time you got married?

472
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:38,343
That again? Don't mind me.

473
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:42,055
I do mind. Sit down.

474
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,523
I have a fine prospect.
Won't you meet him?

475
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,072
Name is Satake, a graduate of
Tokyo University, from a good family.

476
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,033
He works for Nitto Chemicals.

477
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,537
His father was a director there,
pre-war.

478
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:09,582
He's 34. Just right for you.

479
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:14,045
He's well regarded at work.
How about it?

480
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,883
Oh, he looks like
that American fellow.

481
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,886
From that baseball movie.

482
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:23,430
Gary Cooper?

483
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:28,435
Yes, Cooper. Looks just like him.
Especially his mouth!

484
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,437
Not up here though.

485
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:38,111
How about it? Please meet him.
He's a fine young man.

486
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,447
Well, won't you?

487
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,450
I don't want to get married yet.

488
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,244
Not yet? Why?

489
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:51,416
Why? If I do,
he won't be able to cope.

490
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,126
Who?

491
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,298
Father. I'm accustomed to his ways,

492
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,760
but he is a bit fastidious.

493
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:06,097
If I left home,
Father wouldn't cope.

494
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,478
You can't help that.

495
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,649
But I know him better than anyone.

496
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,487
Leave him out of this.
What about you?

497
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,158
I couldn't do that to him.

498
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,828
You'll never get married then.

499
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,165
I don't care.

500
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,804
Nori dear,
about Mrs. Miwa...

501
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,931
How would she be?

502
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,476
What do you mean?

503
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,813
Your father will need someone.

504
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,651
I was wondering
if she would do.

505
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,278
Come sit here again.

506
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,203
She had a good husband,

507
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,374
but he died and she's childless,
the poor woman.

508
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:19,379
What do you think?
She's sensible, with good taste.

509
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,549
Has Father heard this?

510
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,552
I did mention it the other day.

511
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,556
What did he say?

512
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,893
He just cleaned his pipe.
Didn't seem put off though.

513
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,565
So why ask me?

514
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:42,402
I had to know
how you feel about it. Well?

515
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,905
I'm fine with it,
if Father is too.

516
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,468
Oh, hello.
What did your aunt say?

517
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,305
Nothing really.

518
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,642
The bath's ready.
Water's just right.

519
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:22,835
What?

520
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,587
What did she say?

521
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,715
What's wrong?

522
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,468
Something happen?

523
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,822
Where are you going?

524
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,658
Shopping.

525
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,585
<i>Hello.</i>

526
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:54,010
Oh, it's you sir.
They're both out today.

527
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,017
- They left this morning.
- They did?

528
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:05,646
They said they were
off to see a Noh play.

529
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:11,027
I see. When they return,
please give them this.

530
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,446
Yes, of course.

531
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,989
With my thanks.

532
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:18,034
Yes sir. I'm sorry
you missed them.

533
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,870
Thank you for coming.

534
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,701
Should I chop some kindling?

535
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:04,580
Sure. Hey, get a load of this.

536
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,752
Why, it's Mr. Hattori.

537
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,172
I always thought
he'd marry Miss Noriko.

538
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,423
Indeed.

539
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:21,848
What a fine photo. So lifelike.
And such a fetching bride.

540
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:42,428
<i>The water iris I planted</i>

541
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:57,652
<i>at my old home</i>

542
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:30,810
<i>Only the color of the flowers</i>

543
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:43,656

544
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:06,762

00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:16,105

00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:27,033
<i>Only the color of the flowers</i>

547
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:37,877
<i>That man who lived long ago</i>

548
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:49,722

549
00:55:50,556 --> 00:56:06,739
<i>The scent of citrus flowers</i>

00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:28,928
<i>conjures memories from the past</i>

551
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:41,023
<i>A hair ornament made of calamus leaves</i>

552
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:51,283
<i>Which is their color?</i>

553
00:56:51,700 --> 00:57:00,793
<i>The purple water iris and calamus
are so alike</i>

554
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:20,980
<i>Lo, a cicada sings atop the tree</i>

555
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:33,659
<i>A robe with sleeves</i>

556
00:57:49,216 --> 00:58:00,269
<i>as white as deutzia blossoms</i>

557
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:06,108

<i>The dark of night begins to break</i>

559
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:21,457
<i>The rays of the morning sun</i>

560
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:30,716
<i>illuminate pale purple clouds to the east</i>

00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:40,059
<i>The purple iris</i>

562
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:48,317
<i>attains enlightenment,</i>

563
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:55,824
<i>opening its heart</i>

564
00:58:56,116 --> 00:59:03,082
<i>Now is the time</i>

565
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:11,924
<i>for flora and Terra too</i>

566
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:22,017
<i>Now is the time</i>

567
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,197
The Noh was rather good today.

568
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,369
How about a meal at Takigawa?

569
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,872
Well?

570
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,130
I need to go somewhere.

571
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,631
Where?

572
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:54,133
Somewhere.

573
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,260
Will you be late?

574
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,720
I don't know.

575
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,065
Sorry I kept you waiting.

576
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:36,318
Had to finish making my shortcake.

577
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:39,405
Put in too much vanilla,
but it's good.

578
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,740
Let's go to the other room.

579
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,828
Your hands are so cold!

580
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:51,417
Fumi? Please bring the cake
to the other room.

581
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:13,605
What brought this on?

582
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,944
Well? What?

583
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,282
No reason.

584
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:37,796
Want some?

585
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,299
Say, is it hard?

586
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,801
- What?
- Stenography.

587
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,473
Not very.
After all, I manage.

588
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:51,310
Come on, have some.
It's good.

589
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:59,818
But why do this now?
Well? Why do it?

590
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,987
No reason, I said.

591
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:04,656
You can't work for no reason.

592
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:09,161
If Ken hadn't been such a cad,
I wouldn't be working.

593
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:15,834
I couldn't move back home.

594
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,836
Just go get married.

595
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,838
Don't tell me that.

596
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,840
You need to hear it.

597
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:23,842
I don't want to.

598
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,178
Marry for "no reason" then.

599
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:31,183
Not eating?

600
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,184
Don't want it.

601
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,352
Have some.

602
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,520
Don't want to.

603
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,021
But it's good.

604
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:36,855
No.

605
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,859
Just a bite.
I made it for you. Have some!

606
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:41,860
Don't want to.

607
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:45,030
Have some,
or I'll force feed you.

608
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:46,365
I said I don't want to!

609
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:49,368
Why the hysterics?
Suit yourself.

610
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,539
You need a husband badly.

611
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:58,710
Going somewhere?

612
01:03:58,919 --> 01:03:59,545
Home.

613
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,880
Home? You're leaving?

614
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:06,218
Aren't you staying?
Stay with me!

615
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,416
I'm home.

616
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:43,088
Hello. Where've you been?

617
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,923
At Aya's.

618
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,266
A letter came from your aunt.

619
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,436
She says to come on Saturday.

620
01:04:57,728 --> 01:04:58,937
Day after tomorrow.

621
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,310
She ran it by you,
didn't she?

622
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:45,984
Give him a chance.
He'll be there.

623
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:49,154
Can't I refuse?

624
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:50,989
Just give him a chance.

625
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,661
You can always turn him down.

626
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,166
Noriko?

627
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:04,336
Come here.

628
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,009
Sit.

629
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:23,522
I'm sure your aunt has told you
about this Satake.

630
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:29,027
I met him. He's an upstanding,
handsome fellow.

631
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:34,700
I don't think even you
would be disappointed.

632
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,035
Go see for yourself.

633
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,209
You can't live like this forever.

634
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:47,212
You'll have to marry sometime.

635
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:50,882
Now's as good a time as any.

636
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:56,555
How about it?
Your aunt worries for you too.

637
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,141
Well?

638
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,059
But I...

639
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:06,898
I want to stay with you.

640
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,234
That won't do.

641
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:14,239
Of course, I'd dearly love
to have you around...

642
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:15,574
Then why not...

643
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:22,080
No, it won't do.
I've clung to you dearly for too long.

644
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:27,252
I wasn't willing to give you up,
and I regret that.

645
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:34,426
If you don't marry,
I couldn't live with myself.

646
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,764
But if I do marry,
what will you do?

647
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,766
I'll manage.

648
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:43,935
How?

649
01:07:44,603 --> 01:07:45,771
One way or another.

650
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,606
Then I can't do it.

651
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,357
Why?

652
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:55,280
Your shirts and collars.
You'd never wash them.

653
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,949
You wouldn't even shave.

654
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,619
I'd shave alright.

655
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:06,458
And if I didn't tidy your desk,
no one else would.

656
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:12,964
You'd eat burnt rice every day
because you can't cook.

657
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,968
I can picture how hopeless you'd be.

658
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:24,309
Well, hypothetically speaking,
what if you didn't have to worry?

659
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:30,315
For instance, if someone else
looked after me?

660
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:32,567
Someone else?

661
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,569
Hypothetically.

662
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:41,326
Father...
You mean like Mr. Onodera?

663
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,498
You'd find a new wife?

664
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:51,086
A new wife?

665
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,422
That woman today?

666
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,092
It's all arranged?

667
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:02,180
You mean it?
You really mean it?

668
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,895
Father, go away!

669
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,064
Go downstairs.
Go downstairs!

670
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,494
So, you'll go,
day after tomorrow?

671
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,664
We're all so worried about you.

672
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:18,256
Alright? You'll go?
Do it for me.

673
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,783
Ah, another fine day tomorrow.

674
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:27,492
What did Nori say?

675
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,329
She didn't say a thing.

676
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:36,167
She didn't? But it's been a week
since I introduced them.

677
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,837
I have to give them an answer.

678
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,007
Yes, I realize that.

679
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:50,015
But pressuring her
could ruin everything.

680
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:53,018
The other party's very keen.

681
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:57,188
I'm sure Nori
couldn't find fault with him.

682
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:03,028
She likes him.
I'm certain. Dead certain.

683
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,213
Why'd she go to Tokyo again today?

684
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,382
You're complacent too.

685
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,552
I must have her answer today.

686
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,389
When will she be back?

687
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:32,557
Don't know.

688
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,401
Look, I found a purse.

689
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:48,740
It's a good sign!
The wedding will go ahead.

690
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,992
Won't you turn it in?

691
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:54,662
Sure I will, but it's
a lucky charm. Let's go.

692
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,947
What was he like?

693
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,032
What type?

694
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,535
- Was he fat?
- No.

695
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,370
- Skinny?
- No.

696
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,080
Then what was he?

697
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,125
He played basketball in college.

698
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,086
Oh? Is he handsome?

699
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:44,879
What's he like?

700
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:48,425
My aunt thinks he looks
like Gary Cooper.

701
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:52,220
Lucky you!
You've always liked Gary Cooper.

702
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:55,598
I think he looks more
like our electrician.

703
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,892
He looks like Cooper?

704
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,645
He does. A lot.

705
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:04,482
Then Satake does too!
Silly girl.

706
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,318
I'll slap you!

707
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:15,076
I'm impressed though.
You've done well for yourself.

708
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:18,329
He sounds lovely.

709
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:21,666
Don't hesitate, go for it.

710
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:29,007
Good men are hard to find
these days. What's not to like?

711
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:31,176
- But I don't like it.
- What?

712
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,011
Arranged marriage.

713
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:34,596
You're too fussy.

714
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:38,349
You'd never marry
unless someone arranged it.

715
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,518
- But...
- But it's true.

716
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:45,690
If you found someone,
would you dare to propose?

717
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:50,653
You don't have it in you.
You'd just blush and squirm.

718
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:52,030
That's true, but...

719
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:56,284
An arranged marriage suits you.
Mine wasn't arranged,

720
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,039
and look what happened.
It was a failure.

721
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,500
Men are no good.

722
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:08,379
They're sly. They say and do
nice things until you're married,

723
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,966
but after that,
you only see their bad side.

724
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,802
Marriage is all the same.

725
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:16,387
Maybe it is.

726
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:21,309
It is. It's the same. Go for it.
If he's no good, walk out.

727
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,979
No sweat. No sweat at all.

728
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:28,566
Just go for it.
All you need to do is smile.

729
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,401
He'll fall for you.

730
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,487
Then get him under your thumb.

731
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:33,571
I couldn't!

732
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:37,867
You will. That's what you do.
You think I'm joking?

733
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:38,993
I'm not sure!

734
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:41,412
There! That's the smile to use.

735
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,831
Try it. It's a sure bet.

736
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,751
Nori's late.

737
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,505
Maybe I'll go for now.

738
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:54,592
Wait a little.
She'll be on the next train.

739
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,010
If you say so.

740
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:59,347
I hope she chooses wisely.

741
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,102
She will.
She's taken to him.

742
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:05,687
She has?

743
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:10,900
She's shy. For a girl her age,
she's old-fashioned.

744
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:12,527
Perhaps she is.

745
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:20,201
Is something silly holding her back?

746
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:21,286
Like what?

747
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,788
Like Satake's first name.

748
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,790
Kumataro Satake?

749
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:28,251
Yes. Kumataro.

750
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,462
I like "Bear boy."
Sounds tough.

751
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:38,886
It's you who's old-fashioned,
worrying over something like that.

752
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:44,642
But doesn't it make you think
he has a hairy chest?

753
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,062
That might trouble a young girl.

754
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:51,899
And what if Nori marries him?
What do I call him?

755
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,569
"Kumataro" sounds like a bandit,

756
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:59,741
"Mr. Kuma" sounds rustic,
and "Kuma dear" is like a baby bear.

757
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:04,245
Well, we'll have to
call him something.

758
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:08,666
Exactly. So I'm going
to call him "Ku honey."

759
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,251
"Ku honey"?

760
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,337
Yes. How about it?

761
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,924
She's back.

762
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:27,185
I'm back.

763
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:29,187
Here she comes!

764
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:32,023
Yes, if I'm not mistaken...

765
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,441
- I'm back.
- Hello.

766
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:34,942
Hello dear.

767
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:38,655
What'll it be?
I'll go ask.

768
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,947
- Listen.
- What?

769
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:41,199
Be tactful.

770
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:42,700
Don't worry.

771
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:58,508
Oh, hello Nori dear.

772
01:17:58,633 --> 01:17:59,967
Hello.

773
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,305
So, what's your answer?

774
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:07,892
How about it?
Given it some thought?

775
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:13,731
Well, have you?

776
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:24,992
You know, you're perfect
for each other. Don't you think?

777
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:37,672
Well, will you marry him?
Will you?

778
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,091
Yes.

779
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,759
You will?

780
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,511
Yes.

781
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:46,180
You will? You'll really do it?

782
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,768
Thank you!
I'll let them know right away.

783
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,771
You're sure?

784
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:57,775
Thank heavens!
What a load off my mind.

785
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:10,788
How'd it go?

786
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,957
She'll marry. I knew it.

787
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,751
Really? That's great.

788
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:18,296
I have to run now.
My, what a relief.

789
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:20,965
I'll tell them.

790
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:22,967
Please do. Thank you.

791
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:24,469
I'll take the 9:35.

792
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,888
Then you'd better hurry.

793
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,560
My worries are over.

794
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,645
I can sleep soundly now.

795
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:39,317
I'll be back to help with wedding
plans. Come when you can too.

796
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,651
Yes, I will.

797
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:49,410
This purse was lucky.

798
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,662
Better turn it in.

799
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:53,831
Don't worry, I will!

800
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,252
You close up. Good night.

801
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:01,172
Thanks again. Take care.

802
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:07,011
- Good night.
- Good night.

803
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,703
Your aunt just left.

804
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,205
She did?

805
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,457
She was overjoyed.

806
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,127
Sure you did the right thing?

807
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:42,547
Yes.

808
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:46,717
You're not just giving in?

809
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:49,846
No.

810
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,890
You're not reluctant?

811
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:55,810
Not at all.

812
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:59,355
I see. Glad to hear it.

813
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:01,459
- Sleep well on the train?
- I did.

814
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:06,213
So did I. When I woke up,
we were already at Seta.

815
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:08,966
I was out from Nagoya to Maibara.

816
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,657
Flowers and tea for sale!

817
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:55,972
Sorry. All spruced up now.

818
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:57,515
Tired, Nori dear?

819
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,849
No, not very.

820
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:00,184
Really?

821
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:06,524
It's great to have you here.

822
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:12,363
Noriko suddenly decided
to get married.

823
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:13,656
She did?

824
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,367
So it's our last trip.

825
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:19,537
You don't say.
Congratulations. Great.

826
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,706
Congratulations.

827
01:23:22,957 --> 01:23:27,503
Nori dear, what's he like?
How does he measure up to me?

828
01:23:27,962 --> 01:23:29,880
There's no comparison.

829
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:33,009
Who's better?

830
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,511
You are, of course.

831
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:39,849
I am? Really?
That calls for a treat.

832
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,560
How about lunch,
at the Hyotei?

833
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:43,561
Sounds good.

834
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,855
Misako wants to see you.

835
01:23:46,731 --> 01:23:49,400
Really? I'd love to see her too.

836
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,569
With "dirty" old me?

837
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,238
Do you mind?

838
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:40,910
Kyoto is lovely.
So relaxing.

839
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:45,956
It's nothing like Tokyo.
Not dusty at all.

840
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:50,086
Professor, do you visit Kyoto often?

841
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:54,298
No, I haven't for years.
Not since the war.

842
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:55,966
Is that so?

843
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:58,135
<i>Mr. Somiya!</i>

844
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,116
So Nori dear,
does she look dirty?

845
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,326
Don't tease me.

846
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,328
What do you think?

847
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,831
What's dirty, Father?

848
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,000
It's unclean.
Right, Nori dear?

849
01:26:27,183 --> 01:26:30,019
We walked so much today.

850
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,730
Aren't you tired?

851
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:34,064
I'm not.

852
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:41,405
Last time I went to Kodai Temple,
the bush clover was splendid.

853
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:44,575
Plans for tomorrow?

854
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,412
Misako comes for me at 10.

855
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:52,416
Where are you going?
You should see the museum.

856
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:53,584
Sure.

857
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,093
Shall we turn in?

858
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,721
Yes. Shall I turn off the light?

859
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:06,764
Please.

860
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:26,784
Father?

861
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:34,959
I ignorantly said terrible things
to Mr. Onodera.

862
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,294
What about?

863
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:44,802
His wife is so lovely.
They make a wonderful couple.

864
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,931
How could I have called them dirty?

865
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:53,143
Don't let it worry you.

866
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,313
What I said was outrageous.

867
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,816
He never took it seriously.

868
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:00,484
He didn't?

869
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:04,321
He didn't. So don't worry.

870
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,952
Father?

871
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:16,667
I couldn't stand the idea
of you doing the same thing, but...

872
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,912
It's good she decided to marry.

873
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:38,248
I know she'll make a good wife.

874
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:44,588
If I could choose, I'd prefer a son.
Daughters are irksome.

875
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:52,221
You raise them,
then give them away.

876
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:59,603
If they're unwed, you worry.

877
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:03,565
Yet if they do marry,
it's somehow irksome.

878
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,277
Serves us right.
We married someone's daughters.

879
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,238
Can't argue with that.

880
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,830
Father, hand me that.

881
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:09,339
How time flies. One minute we arrive,
the next we're leaving.

882
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:14,303
True. But I loved it here in Kyoto.

883
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:16,847
I'm glad we came.

884
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:21,018
A day in Nara
would've been nice though.

885
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:33,155
Why didn't we do this
more often together?

886
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:37,034
This is our last trip together.

887
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:43,332
You'll be busy when we get home.
Your aunt is waiting.

888
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:49,046
I hope we find
seats on the train tomorrow.

889
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:57,221
I didn't take you anywhere,
but your husband will.

890
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,224
Satake will take care of you.

891
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,727
What is it?

892
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:08,357
What's wrong?

893
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:10,526
I...

894
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,739
I want to stay this way.

895
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:24,540
I don't want to go anywhere.
Being with you is enough.

896
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,918
I'm happy just as I am.

897
01:32:29,545 --> 01:32:33,715
I doubt marriage will make me
happier than this.

898
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:37,261
This is the life I want.

899
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,721
That's easy to say, but...

900
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:44,101
Don't get me wrong.
Marry if you want to, Father.

901
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:47,563
I just want to be by your side.

902
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,107
I'm so fond of you.

903
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:55,445
I'm happiest when
I'm with you like this.

904
01:32:58,365 --> 01:33:03,954
Father, please.
Let things stay as they are.

905
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:10,961
I know that marriage won't make me
any happier than I am now.

906
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:12,963
Don't say that.

907
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:15,465
You're wrong.

908
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:26,143
I'm 56 now.
My life is nearing its end.

909
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:32,482
But you two have your future
ahead of you. A brand new life.

910
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:37,654
One that you and Satake
must build together.

911
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:42,826
It is not my place to interfere.

912
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:48,332
That's how people have done things
since the dawn of time.

913
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:57,466
Marriage may not mean
happiness from the start.

914
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:04,348
On the contrary, you'd be wrong
to expect immediate happiness.

915
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,519
Don't wait for happiness.

916
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:12,689
You two must make your own.

917
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,692
Happiness isn't a wedding.

918
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:22,032
Happiness comes from a new couple
creating a new life together.

919
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:28,497
It may take a year,
or two, or five, or ten.

920
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:31,625
Happiness comes only through effort.

921
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:35,545
Only then can you claim to be
man and wife.

922
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:41,885
Your own mother wasn't happy
when we married.

923
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:46,556
For years, we had our troubles.

924
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:52,229
Many times I found her weeping
in a corner of the kitchen.

925
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:56,149
But fortunately,
she persevered.

926
01:34:58,235 --> 01:35:03,990
You must trust each other.
You must love each other.

927
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:12,165
All the fondness you've shown for me
must now be given to Satake.

928
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,668
Alright?

929
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:21,174
That's how you'll truly find
a new happiness.

930
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:24,511
Please understand.

931
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:28,682
Do you understand?

932
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:32,853
I do. Forgive me for
being so selfish.

933
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:35,856
I see. You do understand.

934
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:40,193
Yes. I was being selfish.

935
01:35:40,444 --> 01:35:42,863
I'm glad you understand.

936
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:47,784
I didn't want you to marry
feeling the way you did.

937
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:54,374
Marry him. I'm sure you'll
be happy. It's not difficult.

938
01:35:55,667 --> 01:36:02,382
You'll make a fine couple.
I'm looking forward to that day.

939
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:08,889
When you do, you'll look back
on this talk of ours and laugh.

940
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:12,726
Forgive me...

941
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:18,398
...for worrying you.

942
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:24,070
No, just find it. Your own happiness.
Won't you?

943
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,741
Yes, I'll do my best.

944
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:33,330
Yes, you will. I'm sure.
I know you can.

945
01:36:34,206 --> 01:36:39,586
I'll rest easy in that knowledge.
Find your own happiness.

946
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:19,626
It rained last night.
I was worried.

947
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:23,964
Yes, but luckily it's fine now.
Rain would've been terrible.

948
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,131
Indeed.

949
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:29,469
Where was your honeymoon?

950
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:30,637
Yugawara.

951
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:35,475
Really? Noriko's going there.
Just buses from the station?

952
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:38,979
- No, taxis too.
- Oh, taxis?

953
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:42,649
Professor, you're wanted upstairs.

954
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:43,567
I am?

955
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:49,573
The bride's looking lovely.
Why not go and see for yourself?

956
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,992
Alright then, I will.

957
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:57,998
She makes a wonderful bride.

958
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:05,672
- Brother, she's all ready.
- She is?

959
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,507
- The cars?
- They're here.

960
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:08,842
They are?

961
01:38:16,725 --> 01:38:20,270
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

962
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:24,858
So, you're ready?

963
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:41,041
- We'll go on ahead.
- Please.

964
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:43,793
- I'll take this.
- Thank you.

965
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:07,567
Nori dear, you have your fan?

966
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:08,902
I do.

967
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:23,416
Such a beautiful bride.
I wish your mother could see you.

968
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:30,256
Well, shall we be going?

969
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,927
We don't want to be rushed.

970
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,431
Anything to say to her?

971
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,934
No, I've nothing more to say.

972
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,102
You're sure?

973
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,772
Alright Nori dear, let's go.

974
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:07,627
Father...

975
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:22,475
You've been so good to me,
for so long... Thank you for everything.

976
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:31,151
Be happy, and be a good wife.

977
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,823
Be happy.

978
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:45,165
Remember, be a good wife.

979
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:47,333
I will.

980
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:55,008
Now, shall we go?

981
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,742
Aya dear, another drink?

982
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:09,582
This is my third.

983
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:16,422
I can handle five. I once drank six,
then I keeled over.

984
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:17,340
You don't say.

985
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:22,971
There you go. Your daughter
and Professor Onodera came recently.

986
01:42:23,138 --> 01:42:23,805
So I heard.

987
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:26,516
I was amazed.
She's all grown up.

988
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:27,809
Where is she?

989
01:42:27,976 --> 01:42:31,312
We just saw her off.
She was wed today.

990
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:35,817
She was? You came from the wedding?
Congratulations.

991
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:36,985
Thank you.

992
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:38,319
Thank you sir!

993
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,492
Mr. Somiya?

994
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:54,043
Where would she be now?

995
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,504
Oh, I'd say around Ofuna.

996
01:42:56,629 --> 01:43:00,675
Probably. You're going to
be lonely now.

997
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:05,013
Not too much.
I'll soon get used to it.

998
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,348
Ready for your fourth?

999
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:17,525
Mr. Somiya?

1000
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:20,904
Will you take a wife?

1001
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:22,322
Why ask?

1002
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:26,910
Noriko was worried.
It's what worried her the most.

1003
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:35,001
Don't go and do something so silly.
You mustn't remarry. Alright?

1004
01:43:35,627 --> 01:43:37,503
- You mean that?
- I do.

1005
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:42,217
I had to say something
to get Noriko to marry.

1006
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:50,433
You're amazing! Such a gentleman.
I'm so moved.

1007
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:55,939
Don't worry, you won't get lonely.
If you do, I'll come. I mean it.

1008
01:43:56,105 --> 01:43:58,900
Good. You'll really come,
Aya dear?

1009
01:43:59,067 --> 01:44:02,528
I certainly will.
What a lovely feeling.

1010
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:07,951
My fifth!

1011
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:18,586
I'm done.

1012
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:24,300
Aya, you mean it? You'll come?
I'll be waiting.

1013
01:44:24,509 --> 01:44:29,097
I will. I definitely will.
I don't tell lies like you do.

1014
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:30,223
What?

1015
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:33,268
At least, not as convincingly.

1016
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:41,067
I had no choice!
It was the biggest lie of my life.

1017
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,527
- Hello sir.
- Hello.

1018
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:28,197
Did you see Miss Noriko off alright?

1019
01:45:28,323 --> 01:45:29,615
Yes, thank you.

1020
01:45:29,741 --> 01:45:32,660
Glad to hear it.
My warmest congratulations.

1021
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:34,495
Thank you for everything.

1022
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:38,541
Well, good night sir.

1023
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:41,711
Give my regards to Sei.

1024
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:48,551
- Good night sir.
- Good night.

1025
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:11,319
The End
