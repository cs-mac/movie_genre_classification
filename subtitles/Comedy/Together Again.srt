1
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,241
You'll understand if I don't let you
go in with me, won't you, Gilbert?

2
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,406
Under the circumstances,
I would like a moment alone with my father.

3
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,542
Do you have to be so darn dramatic
about everything?

4
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,622
Good night! Your father is only a statue.

5
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,384
How does he know
whether you're alone with him or not?

6
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,153
I forgive you for that, Gilbert.

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,696
I realize you can't help it if you
don't understand about certain things,

8
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,459
you being from the South the way you are.

9
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,331
That statue just happens to
be symbolic of the very soul

10
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,404
of this town, that's all.

11
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,767
Now it looks like it's going to rain,

12
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,069
so if you don't mind, I'm in kind of a hurry.

13
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,507
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

14
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,047
You will not.
You'll come by for me like you always do.

15
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,512
I know it.

16
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,159
-Hello, Diana.
-Good evening.

17
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,593
I always save all the ribbons.

18
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,131
Sometimes the wordings on them
absolutely make you cry,

19
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,359
they're so beautiful.

20
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,493
Well, it ain't every statue
that has memorial services

21
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,198
-for it every year.
-Well, I guess not.

22
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,677
The Water Department is
always the most poetical.

23
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,972
Last year, their ribbon said,

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,946
"Every drop of our water is
a tear for your departure."

25
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,518
Isn't that super?

26
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,555
It makes me so happy to think
of all the hoses and faucets and things

27
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,216
all over town crying about my father.

28
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,467
A birthday party for a statue!

29
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,298
Why, it's enough to turn your stomach.

30
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,962
Folks thought a heap of Jonathan, Mort.

31
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,664
Well, I didn't.

32
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,935
And now I not only have to
look at him day and night,

33
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,307
but I have to look at him from behind.

34
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,670
The first thing I'm going to do
when I'm mayor of this town

35
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,806
is get rid of that hulking insult!

36
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,613
I wouldn't be so sure of myself,
if I was you, Mort.

37
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,687
Folks think a heap of Anne, too.

38
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,016
A lady mayor. Why, it's a disgrace.

39
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,718
There's lots of lady things nowadays, Mort.

40
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,454
It wouldn't startle me none if
someday we'll have a lady president.

41
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,691
-I hope I'm dead!
-Anne has done a good job, Mort.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,896
I was talking to somebody just
the other night about her reelection and...

43
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,267
You're supposed to be talking about me.
You work for me, don't you?

44
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,001
Sure, Mort, but you've been running
for mayor against the Crandall family

45
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,806
for so many years that
nobody pays any attention to it anymore.

46
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,948
-lf I can't beat a woman...
-She has done a good job, Mort.

47
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,416
But she'll slip. Women always do.

48
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,784
And when she does, I'll be around, Perc.
I'll be around.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,194
Jessie's waxed the stairs again.
I wish she wouldn't.

50
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,769
That's the third time I've slipped.

51
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,134
Besides, it makes the hall smell
like an old bee's nest.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,698
I told her about it a dozen times,
but it seems Diana likes them waxed.

53
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,368
It seems Jessie likes them waxed.

54
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,571
It seems they've been waxed for 100 years.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,980
It also seems you're a big shot in your office
and a nonentity at home.

56
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,746
It's starting to rain. Has Diana come in yet?

57
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,117
Why should she come in?

58
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,351
There are two men out there
watching her be wistful.

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,519
She won't walk out on that in a hurry.

60
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:27,362
-Shame on you. How do you feel?
-Gout isn't very pleasant, you know.

61
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,934
Of course not.

62
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,870
It seems such a pity it has to flare up

63
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,168
every time the family is expected
to make a public appearance.

64
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,971
-lt does seem a pity, doesn't it?
-Yes.

65
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,278
That's just what I thought.

66
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,009
It's a little late, isn't it? Faker!

67
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,985
For heaven's sakes, don't tell Diana.

68
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,853
Father, I really should.
It would serve you right.

69
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,950
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

70
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,722
-Well, I'm not.
-Grandfather!

71
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,989
What?

72
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,156
Hello, Diana.

73
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,927
Grandfather Crandall, you weren't sick.
You didn't have the gout at all.

74
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,063
You just didn't want to
go to the anniversary. You cheated.

75
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,266
I don't know where you get
this dishonesty about things.

76
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,242
You certainly didn't get it from me
or my father.

77
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,213
It's not that I care about myself,
but I think it's so humiliating to my father

78
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,908
that his own father...

79
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,884
For heaven's sakes, don't cry.
I'll go next year.

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,217
I'll go tomorrow. But don't cry.

81
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,020
First thing you know, you'll get thin again
and your mother will have my hide.

82
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,822
You think I got thin on purpose
just to get you in trouble.

83
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,295
I can't help it if I'm metabolic, can l?

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,022
Darling, please!

85
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,896
You'll feel wretched tomorrow.

86
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,562
Of course I will, but it won't be my fault,
will it?

87
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,298
I'm perfectly willing to be healthy,

88
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:44,035
but if certain persons are always
upsetting your glands, how can l?

89
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,770
Run on upstairs and I'll send Jessie up.

90
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,608
I don't want Jessie, Mother. I want you.

91
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,644
All right, darling,

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,718
I'll be up in a minute.

93
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,357
It's like living with a box of matches.

94
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,865
-It's just her age, Father.
-Her age?

95
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,060
You've been telling me that for 10 years.

96
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,627
What age does she have to be
before she gets unmetabolic?

97
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,139
I think it's all an act, anyway.

98
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,539
Don't judge everybody by yourself, darling.

99
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,372
And take that silly thing off your foot.

100
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,946
All right, all right.

101
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,844
Diana does worry me, though, Father.

102
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,316
She isn't strong
and yet she seems healthy enough.

103
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,011
It's hard to put your finger on.

104
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,557
If you'll take my advice,
you'll put a hand on hard.

105
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,753
I did that once, remember?
She went to bed with a nervous breakdown.

106
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,131
Nobody was more upset than you were.
Remember?

107
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,789
Well, she looked so little in that big bed.

108
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,631
Exactly. And I am just enough of an
egotist to love her loving me so much.

109
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,641
But it makes me feel so terribly responsible.

110
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,708
More so than if she were a child of my own.

111
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,811
I don't suppose
you know what I mean by that?

112
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,909
Yes, I do. You are not my own child
and look how I worry about you.

113
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,682
Me? Why, for heaven's sake?

114
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,917
Well, it isn't normal
for a beautiful young woman

115
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,256
to have her sense of duty
all swollen up like yours is.

116
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,422
-lt isn't becoming, either.
-You never will be serious.

117
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,796
I have never been more serious in my life!

118
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,802
It hurts my soul to see
a beautiful dish like you

119
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,531
wasted on a neurotic stepchild,

120
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,870
a hunk of a statue
and a fusty community like Brookhaven.

121
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,739
-My soul, it hurts!
-Why, darling.

122
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,473
All right, all right, all right.

123
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,778
Has it ever occurred to you that l
like my life? Because I do, you know.

124
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,112
-Why?
-It's neat.

125
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,413
-It's practically antiseptic.
-It's busy...

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,851
Full of storm drains and taxes.

127
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,889
-It's comfortable.
-You're too young to be comfortable.

128
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,117
And I have you,
you miserable old reprobate.

129
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,160
I can think of a couple of things
you haven't got.

130
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,855
-What?
-Well, you're a widow.

131
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,190
-Yes.
-And...

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,591
Don't be so darn difficult!

133
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,170
-You know, darling, you amuse me.
-Amuse you?

134
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,207
Yes. You can't bear to see a woman
living alone and liking it.

135
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,073
No man can. Instinctively, it terrifies them.

136
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,146
You're a vanishing race and you know it,

137
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,774
and the minute you lose your hold
over us emotionally, wow!

138
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,385
So, naturally, your platform must be,
"Husbands are necessary."

139
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,579
And they're not, really.

140
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,950
That's the most outrageous...

141
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,287
So stop bothering your nice old head
about me, because I'm not frustrated,

142
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,123
I'm not to be pitied,
I am not anything but perfectly happy.

143
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,192
Anne Crandall, you're a liar.

144
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,662
I don't think you know it, mind you,
but you're a liar.

145
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,171
You talk like a free soul,
but you're the most manacled creature

146
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,367
-I have ever seen.
-Mercy, look at that rain.

147
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,104
Everything you do, everything you say,
everything you breathe

148
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,477
is the way Jonathan did it,
said it and breathed it.

149
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,746
Why don't you stop living his life
and live your own?

150
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,686
If I know Jonathan,
he is as irritated with you as I am.

151
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,952
I'll bet he's bored to death
with the hero-worshipping show

152
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,822
he has to put up with.

153
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,623
When you hear from him to that effect,
you'll let me know, won't you?

154
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,097
-Well...
-And until then, you just shut up.

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,167
See?

156
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,240
-Good morning, Lillian.
-Good morning, Your Honor.

157
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,711
I'm terribly sorry
about what happened last night.

158
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,806
Did you see the paper?
Mort really had a field day for himself.

159
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,317
Yes, I can believe that.

160
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,684
He claims it was a special act of providence
to end the Crandall dynasty.

161
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,349
Mr. Buchanan has quite an imagination.

162
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,784
I'm marrying somebody this morning,
am I not?

163
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,759
Yes, Your Honor, the Potter kid and his girl.

164
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,162
-Did Diana take it awfully hard?
-Yes, she did.

165
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,661
-What a question.
-ls there anything else?

166
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,569
Mr. Witherspoon is waiting inside.
He has some sanitation problems.

167
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,766
I'll sanitation problem him.

168
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,268
I've had 18 complaints
from the Southside in the past week.

169
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,902
Just because...

170
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,811
Just because people are poor,
Mr. Witherspoon,

171
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,975
they don't want to live
with a lot of old potato peelings.

172
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:50,112
-It's the manpower, Your Honor.
-Manpower, my eye. Use womanpower, then.

173
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,917
Women? To collect garbage?

174
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,824
Why not? Women see more garbage
in their lives than men do, don't they?

175
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,293
They might as well get paid for it.

176
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:01,389
Extra! Extra! Jonathan Crandall got
his block knocked off. Read all about it.

177
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,494
Extra! Extra! Jonathan Crandall got
his block knocked off. Read all about it.

178
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,836
That certainly was a tragedy
what happened to Jonathan, Your Honor.

179
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,968
Nonsense. What's tragic about it?
It can easily be repaired.

180
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,775
All right. You told me to shut up
unless I heard from him.

181
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,576
-All right, I've heard from him.
-Father, what on Earth...

182
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,878
Jonathan. You don't think
that was an accident, do you?

183
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,214
Look at that.
Does that look like an accident?

184
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,309
Father...

185
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,548
If that isn't your answer, I never saw one.

186
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,783
Jonathan pitched that lightning bolt himself.

187
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,190
He had the greatest right I ever saw, anyway.

188
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,855
You asked for a sign,
all right, you've got one.

189
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,694
Now will you quit lying to yourself
and burst those chains

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,789
and start having some fun for yourself?

191
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,495
-Father! Mr. Witherspoon is here.
-Why?

192
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,964
-Hello, Witherspoon.
-Hi.

193
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,632
Mr. Witherspoon's having problems
on the Southside.

194
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,506
But it's nothing compared to your problem,
Mr. Crandall.

195
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,010
My trouble is just man shortage.

196
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,080
So is ours.

197
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,240
My father-in-law has
such a delightful sense of humor.

198
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,376
-Your Honor, the Potter kid and...
-Tell him to wait.

199
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,224
The mayor says that you're going to
put Jonathan back together again.

200
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,292
We are not.

201
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,327
-Of course we are!
-We are not!

202
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,898
I waited five years for an excuse
to get rid of that bronze monstrosity.

203
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:11,695
-Your Honor, Mr. Buchanan is here.
-I can't see him just now. Explain to him...

204
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,169
That the garbage collector is here.

205
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,103
That's perfect. I want to see him, too.

206
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,834
I thought
your business was collecting trash,

207
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,534
instead of leaving it around
to be an eyesore.

208
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,441
-Why, it is.
-Why don't you collect it, then?

209
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,740
Look here, Mr. Buchanan...

210
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,337
There is a pile of trash
over in the town square

211
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,542
that's the worst eyesore I ever saw.

212
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,211
It's always been an eyesore,
but now that it's got no head...

213
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,309
Do you want me to haul it away?

214
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,914
Over my dead body you'll haul
that statue away. That statue stays.

215
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,188
Even without a head, my son's a better man
than you are, Mort Buchanan.

216
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,160
-But you just said, Mr. Crandall...
-I don't care what I said.

217
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,459
If Mort Buchanan wants it hauled away,
it stays.

218
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,764
If you gentlemen have finished,
I'll tell you what's going to be done.

219
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,599
The statue is going to be repaired.

220
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,472
Mother, Mother, I've just heard the most
awful thing I've ever heard in my life.

221
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,702
Diana, dear, what is it?

222
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,405
I heard you were going to put
my father's head back on again.

223
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,775
Well, yes, dear, I thought...

224
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,475
Mother, I didn't believe it when they told me.
I couldn't believe it.

225
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,677
It's the most gruesome thing
I've ever heard of.

226
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:05,746
My father's head stitched back on his...
Mother, I'd feel every stitch personally.

227
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,450
-Your Honor, the Potter kid says...
-Ask him to wait.

228
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,290
Diana, dear, what is it that you want?

229
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,830
-Why, a new statue, naturally.
-What?

230
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,331
Why not? A bigger one.

231
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,460
-On a horse, I want it.
-Wait till all that turns its back on you.

232
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,472
I have no business going to New York
to interview a sculptor. I have no time.

233
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,747
Nonsense. You've got at least 30 years more.
It's time you started using it.

234
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,449
Father, really. That's beginning
to be a little boring, if you don't mind.

235
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,388
You won't forget to
look at a new x-ray machine

236
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,517
for the hospital, will you, Your Honor?

237
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,822
Of course I won't. Why should I forget it?

238
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,396
And buy a new hat.

239
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,331
A new hat?
What's the matter with the one I have on?

240
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,527
It looks like a hat,
that's what's the matter with it.

241
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,833
When women start wearing hats
that look like hats, they're on the way out.

242
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,635
-At your age you ought to be on the way in.
-ln what?

243
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,403
Buy a new hat and find out.

244
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,739
Father!

245
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,681
-Here you are, George.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,773
-Goodbye, Father.
-Goodbye.

247
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,141
You are sure you can handle the people?

248
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,652
For goodness sakes,
Your Honor, you'll be back tomorrow.

249
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,119
-All aboard!
-Bye.

250
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,019
-All aboard!
-Bye.

251
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,420
-I can only hope.
-Hope for what, Mr. Crandall?

252
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,057
I don't think you'd remember, Lillian.

253
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,968
Fifteen, please.

254
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,554
New hat?

255
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,591
-Yes. Practically.
-Cute as heck. It does things for you.

256
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,228
Makes a guy want to do things for you, too.

257
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,335
Well!

258
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,298
Don't get sore. Women are just like actors.

259
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,398
Actors beef because people bother them
for their autographs,

260
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,774
but it's a sad day when nobody asks
them anymore. See?

261
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,280
You're quite a philosopher, aren't you?

262
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,078
You work in an artists' building
and you get to know dames.

263
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,255
Hey, lady!

264
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,794
Your stocking's crooked.

265
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,298
You got to relieve the monotony
of this job some way.

266
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,998
I beg your pardon.

267
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,803
It's quite all right. I...

268
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,376
I was just...

269
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,013
I've never seen you before, have l?

270
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,748
-Why, no, I'm...
-Sometimes I'm not sure.

271
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,944
Clothes make such a difference.

272
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,149
I have been working straight through
all night and all day,

273
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,554
so I won't want to work now.

274
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,322
-No, I didn't expect you...
-But I did have to find out if you do.

275
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,295
Here she is.
All she needs is a certain line here.

276
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,229
-I hope you've got it.
-Mr. Corday...

277
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,167
You'll find the dressing room through there.

278
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,762
-You won't have to undress completely.
-Mr. Corday...

279
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,274
-Now look, this is simply an interview.
-Yes, but l...

280
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,901
If you have the curve I'm looking for, fine.

281
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,981
If you haven't got it, then I'll just have to
look until I find it, that's all.

282
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,639
-But you don't understand.
-Now, if you don't mind.

283
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,481
I have an appointment here
with a small-town mayor at 6:00

284
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,351
and, you know, small-town mayors
might not understand

285
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,980
beautiful models running around.

286
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,752
Really? And why not?

287
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,350
Have you ever met a small-town mayor?

288
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,157
Yes, I have.
And I don't like your tone, Mr. Corday.

289
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,357
What's the matter with small-town mayors?

290
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,934
Well, they're on the narrow-minded side,
let us say.

291
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,594
I have never met one with a sense of humor.

292
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,535
And they are always all out of shape.

293
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,731
You don't say.

294
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,434
I hope you have an exquisite
sense of humor, Mr. Corday,

295
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,909
because in about two seconds
you are going to need it.

296
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,345
-What do you mean?
-I am Mayor Crandall, Mr. Corday.

297
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,247
I had an appointment with you at 6:00.

298
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,486
Well, I'm not going to apologize, you know.
Because you are a fraud.

299
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,584
I beg your...

300
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,496
You are a fraud and a delusion.
You deserve to be embarrassed.

301
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,364
You have no business running around
with mayor insides

302
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,837
-and such a beautiful outside.
-Mr. Corday...

303
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,373
And that hat.

304
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,606
That is definitely not a mayor's hat.

305
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,648
Mr. Corday, this hat, apparently,
was a grave mistake.

306
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,852
It was bought at the suggestion
of someone else.

307
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,581
I didn't think it was a very good idea
at the time.

308
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,055
But, I assure you,
there is a mayor under this hat

309
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,252
-and we'll just go on from there, shall we?
-Certainly.

310
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,724
And I shan't insult your profession

311
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:25,668
by assuming that your outward appearance
belies your reputation as a sincere artist.

312
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,840
Proving that you are
more of a gentleman than l, Mayor Crandall.

313
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,534
I have some photographs here
of the ex-Mayor Crandall.

314
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,374
The one of whom you're to do the statue.

315
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,505
I thought they might help you.

316
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,516
Yes, they would.
Would you sit down, please?

317
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,949
Thank you.

318
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,349
-Fine-looking man.
-Thank you.

319
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,349
Your father?

320
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,825
My husband.

321
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,660
-No.
-Why not?

322
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,124
No reason. No reason at all.

323
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,397
Naturally, I shall have to know
some facts about your ex-husband.

324
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,697
I mean, something about the spirit
of the man, you understand.

325
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,775
I think so.

326
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,503
How long were you married to him?

327
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,671
-Five years.
-His age when he married you?

328
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,845
Forty-two. But I don't see how that fact...

329
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,283
That's a very important fact.
A man who waits until he is 42

330
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,912
to marry must have definite characteristics.

331
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,854
I was his second wife.

332
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,983
Two wives.

333
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,356
-Any children?
-Yes. One by his first wife.

334
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:31,592
Children, one by his first wife.
None by you, then?

335
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,269
Mr. Corday, I see no need of...

336
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,933
Mrs. Crandall,
these things are of no personal interest

337
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,304
to me whatsoever, I assure you.

338
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,810
It is simply that I need to know the man,
that's all.

339
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,041
This is a professional interview
and I wish you would conduct it as such.

340
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,980
-Well, l...
-Thank you.

341
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,914
Now, let me see.

342
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,081
Was he a particularly affectionate man?

343
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,488
Mr. Corday.

344
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,028
Mrs. Crandall,
your persistence in placing this interview

345
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,359
on a personal basis
is very embarrassing to me.

346
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,193
Embarrassing to you!

347
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,338
-All right, Mr. Corday, go ahead, please.
-Thank you.

348
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,202
Now, let me see what... Oh, yes.

349
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,574
Was he a particularly affectionate husband?

350
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,376
I believe you said,
"Was he a particularly affectionate man?"

351
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,043
Just tell me the things you are aware of.

352
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,453
Mr. Corday, my husband was a Crandall.

353
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,791
The Crandalls founded Brookhaven.

354
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,860
They have been involved with...

355
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,454
They have been involved with governing
the town since its inception.

356
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,158
There is a certain dignity
that goes with such tradition.

357
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,360
Very dignified.

358
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,970
Affectionate?

359
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,865
We will place a question mark after that,
shall we?

360
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,841
A question mark it is.

361
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,745
Now, the fact that you are still Mrs. Crandall
tells me that you have never remarried.

362
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,977
Have you ever entertained
the idea of remarrying?

363
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,313
I have never entertained the idea
of remarrying.

364
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,965
I have erased the question mark
after affectionate.

365
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,555
You see how one thing leads to another?

366
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,329
-Mr. Corday.
-Excuse me.

367
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,738
Jeepers! What weather!

368
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,142
Brother, this storm is gonna make history,
I bet you!

369
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,508
-Are you Mr. Corday?
-Yes.

370
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,344
My name is Muriel Thorn.
The agency thinks I have what you want.

371
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,079
I'm pretty good!
I hear you're pretty good, also.

372
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,721
This is Mrs. Crandall, Miss Thorn.

373
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,054
Hello.

374
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,661
You don't mind if l...

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,631
Not at all.

376
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,637
-Come with me, please.
-Okay.

377
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,200
-ls that her?
-Yes.

378
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,599
We're a cinch.
I'll fit her like a motorman's glove.

379
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,608
-The door to the right.
-Be right with you.

380
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,279
Do sit down, please.

381
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,018
And now, then...

382
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,225
How long has your husband been dead,
Mrs. Crandall?

383
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,590
-Five years.
-Five...

384
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,925
You have been a widow for five years?

385
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,521
Naturally.

386
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,329
On the contrary,
there is nothing natural about that.

387
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,530
When a beautiful young woman
refuses to marry after all that time,

388
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,735
well, it is either because her marriage
was so perfect that...

389
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,641
My husband had a very happy marriage.

390
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,940
I see.

391
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,722
Does she just come out
when she gets ready?

392
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,317
I beg your pardon?

393
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,386
The model, Miss... Does she just come out?

394
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,334
I didn't think.
Perhaps you would rather she wouldn't.

395
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,329
I'm not exactly used to it.

396
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,272
Well, of course. How thoughtless of me.
I won't be a moment.

397
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,345
As you say, either she's got it or she hasn't.

398
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,242
Come in.

399
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,346
I was just admiring this old jar.
It's very odd, isn't it?

400
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,652
Yes. It's an old apothecary jar.

401
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,082
"P. Borat Sosa."
Sounds like a Latvian diplomat.

402
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,818
-lt does, doesn't it?
-Yes, it does.

403
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,088
-See you tomorrow, Mr. Corday.
-At 10:00.

404
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,897
So long, Mrs. Crandall.
Keep your mind on the folks at home.

405
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,269
She apparently had it.

406
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,639
-Had it?
-The curve.

407
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,802
Yes, she had it.

408
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,245
I should think it would
color your whole life, sort of.

409
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,341
-What?
-So much femininity.

410
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,113
You must look at women very differently.

411
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,245
I do.

412
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,324
-How?
-Other men look at a woman's eyes.

413
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,220
I look at her bone structure.

414
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,693
-You do?
-Yes.

415
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,595
For instance, I can tell you
within 2 pounds what you weigh.

416
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,397
-Do I get it free if you miss?
-Go to dinner with me if I hit?

417
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,835
-How close do you have to be?
-Two pounds.

418
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,447
All right.

419
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:37,267
-A hundred and ten.
-That's amazing! Right on the nose!

420
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,424
Thanks.

421
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,869
-You're a liar, but thank you very much.
-What do you mean?

422
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,703
You weigh 120, but you knew I wanted
very much to have dinner with you.

423
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,370
I haven't the faintest idea what I weigh.
I haven't weighed lately.

424
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,742
I said thank you.

425
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,146
Anyway, it wouldn't be possible to go
anywhere in weather like this.

426
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,344
-Why not?
-I'll just get a cab and go back to the hotel.

427
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,182
-We can take a cab anywhere.
-Look at that rain.

428
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,621
Yes, look.

429
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,193
Now, you wouldn't argue with the elements,
would you?

430
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,802
I am glad my father-in-law didn't see that.

431
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,961
What?

432
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,372
He has some of the craziest ideas.

433
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,652
You'll love this place.
The food is awful, the music is worse,

434
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:33,017
the proprietor is definitely insane,
there is gambling in the back room.

435
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,456
-Thank you. You'll love it.
-Why?

436
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,656
Gilda La Verne. A real artist.

437
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,788
-What does she do?
-I believe they call it a strip tease.

438
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,026
That must be a great treat for you.

439
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,965
But Miss La Verne is a specialist.

440
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,402
You see, Miss La Verne keeps her hat on.

441
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,702
-That is positively radical, isn't it?
-It's a tremendous success.

442
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,210
If only women could realize that
it's modesty that is attractive to men.

443
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,371
-Here we are.
-Mr. Corday. Madame.

444
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,608
-Our table ready?
-You know it. And the wine, she is chilling.

445
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,116
Good for her.

446
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:09,290
I expect you to excel yourself, Leonardo.
We are honored with the mayor of...

447
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,025
I mean, with my friend,
Madame P. Borat Sosa,

448
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,261
who is in search for artists tonight
and I told her that you were an artist.

449
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,069
Did you say P. Borat Sosa?

450
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,731
I said P. Borat Sosa. It is Latvian.

451
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,605
Madame Sosa, you have put me in a mood...

452
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,837
I... Excuse me.

453
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:33,813
Madame P. Borat Sosa. Really!
What a ridiculous name.

454
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,818
You seemed to like it in my studio.

455
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
-That was because...
-Because what?

456
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,882
-Georg.
-Hello, Pete.

457
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,755
I want it. I've got to have it.
Just for a few days, Georg.

458
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,226
-Then you can have it back.
-I'm sorry, Pete.

459
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,957
I need it for myself.
You see, I only found it tonight.

460
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:51,627
Not the face, the neck. Beautiful, beautiful.

461
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,561
Turn your... Oh, Georg, please!

462
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,641
Really! Please, this is my neck.

463
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,436
It is not your neck.
A neck like that belongs to the world.

464
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,706
You have no right to hoard it
as if it were an old ball of string.

465
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,338
All right, all right, Pete,
I told you I need it for myself.

466
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,349
You wait till you want to
borrow from me again.

467
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,941
I loaned you a knee once, remember?

468
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,351
Keep your neck. Who cares?

469
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,014
He is crazy, isn't he?

470
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,719
He is an artist.
He paid you a great compliment, you know.

471
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,695
There are very few necks
that would throw him like that.

472
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,961
There aren't. Are there?

473
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,602
Most women's necks are just something
to hold their heads up.

474
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,605
But yours is positively lyrical.

475
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,766
Well, for goodness' sake.

476
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,144
I'll have to look sometime.

477
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,941
-Miser.
-Beg your pardon?

478
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,209
Beautiful things should be shared,
Mrs. Crandall.

479
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,477
Or have you forgotten that?

480
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,916
Forgotten? I don't know what you...

481
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,353
I imagine the last five years have
kept you pretty busy just being busy.

482
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,220
-They have.
-That is interesting.

483
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,917
To get back to the statue.

484
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,258
By all means.
I didn't realize we had gotten away from it.

485
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,491
-What did you mean about my father?
-Pardon?

486
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,561
When I showed you the picture
of my husband...

487
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,573
For that I should apologize.
I imagine he carried great responsibilities.

488
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,937
He did.

489
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,106
-What was his first name?
-Jonathan.

490
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:16,614
Perhaps I could add a twinkle in the statue
that I found lacking in the photographs.

491
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:20,088
Mr. Corday,
we would like my husband just as he was.

492
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,749
Just how was he?

493
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,991
Well, he carried great responsibilities.

494
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,428
-And now you are carrying them.
-Yes, I am.

495
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,727
-Pity.
-What is pitiful about it?

496
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,825
I enjoy it tremendously.

497
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,700
A woman like you. Forgive me.

498
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:39,673
-Tell me, did your husband dance?
-Yes. Why?

499
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,542
I have learned something
about his responsible side,

500
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,344
so I must look into his lighter side.
He had one, I suppose.

501
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:52,754
-Well, he danced, if that's what you mean.
-It's not exactly. However, shall we?

502
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,383
Why not?

503
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,724
Simply as a matter of research,
Mrs. Crandall,

504
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,695
just look upon me as your husband.

505
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,063
Simply as a matter of research.

506
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,649
You danced very well together, didn't you?

507
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,049
Thank you.

508
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,751
What are you smiling about?

509
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,189
Life is full of surprises.

510
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,787
I never thought I would so enjoy
having a mayor in my arms.

511
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,824
Mr. Corday,
you're supposed to be my husband.

512
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,700
That's right. I'm forgetting my part.
Now I'm your husband.

513
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,633
Tell me, he did not enjoy
having a mayor in his arms?

514
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,042
How could he? He was the mayor.

515
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,147
That's right. Of course.
It's very confusing, isn't it?

516
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,617
Yes, it is.

517
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:41,428
Do you mind very much?
I don't feel like dancing anymore.

518
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,204
I'm sorry I failed you as a husband
so quickly.

519
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,872
Mr. Corday, if I say something,
you won't think I'm rude, will you?

520
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,444
Certainly not.

521
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:59,642
I feel that one shouldn't accept
the first thing that is offered them.

522
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,751
Yes?

523
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:06,017
I feel that one should shop around,
so to speak, until one is absolutely sure.

524
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,890
And I feel that, that should apply
in the selection of a sculptor.

525
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,461
You don't think I'm rude?

526
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,759
Not at all, but I am a very good sculptor,
Mrs. Crandall. I assure you...

527
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,527
I don't doubt that for a minute.

528
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,397
Please don't think...

529
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,839
But, in this case, it's more than just ability.

530
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,107
It is?

531
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,869
How interesting. How much more?

532
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:31,506
I mean, it's more a matter
of personality and character.

533
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,148
Do you understand?

534
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,949
Not quite.

535
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,847
Mr. Corday, I may as well be very blunt.

536
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,390
By all means.

537
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,185
I simply can't see you in Brookhaven.
You don't fit.

538
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,163
You don't think I'm rude?

539
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,531
On the contrary, I am fascinated.
But why wouldn't I fit?

540
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,161
It is a little difficult to explain.

541
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,741
Mind you, I have no personal reasons.

542
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,173
I understand that perfectly.

543
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,405
But, tell me,
the sculptor who made the first statue.

544
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,844
Did he fit?

545
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:08,443
Beautifully.
But, unfortunately, he was very old and died.

546
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,585
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,417
Besides, you'd dislike Brookhaven intensely.

548
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,425
On the contrary, I am beginning to
feel a positive yearning for Brookhaven.

549
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,427
Here we are, Mr. Corday.

550
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,019
Excuse me, madame.

551
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,224
Mr. Corday. Are we in time?

552
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,858
Just in time, I was facing a serious crisis.

553
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,738
-Look at her. Isn't she exciting?
-Very exciting, Leonardo.

554
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,000
So now I leave you with her.

555
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,700
-Good.
-Thank you.

556
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,836
To the beginning of a beautiful statue,
madame.

557
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,345
Mr. Corday,
I don't believe you understood me.

558
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,747
I just fired you.

559
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,649
Really? How could that be?

560
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,415
I understood this was simply an interview

561
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,387
to look each other over
and see if we would do.

562
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,618
-But I tried to...
-You see, with me, it is a matter

563
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,956
of something more
than an assignment, also.

564
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,086
Something more?

565
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,098
Yes. With me it is also a matter
of personality and character.

566
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,033
So to make sure that it would
be a successful engagement,

567
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,570
-I had to know you better, too.
-But...

568
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,104
And I have come to this conclusion.

569
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,834
Together, I believe we could create a statue

570
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,967
that would take its place
among the great works of art.

571
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,067
-Mr. Corday.
-Your personality

572
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,908
appeals to me very satisfactorily,

573
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,379
but may I suggest

574
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,940
that you have just a tiny bit
too much character?

575
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,521
-You...
-For successful statue creating, that is.

576
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,681
-You may suggest it...
-Mind you, it is a very small item.

577
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,452
Will you please...

578
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,692
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Crandall.
It is really a disaster.

579
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,595
Not at all, but it could have been,
Mr. Corday.

580
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,497
It's fortunate that I came
to New York and met you, isn't it?

581
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,968
Just think, I could have ordered you by mail.

582
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,267
I'm terribly sorry, dear lady.

583
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
Leonardo's is proud to present

584
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,446
that on-again, off-again,
big little star Gilda La Verne.

585
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,714
Excuse me.

586
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,731
-Sit down, please.
-Sit down! Sit down!

587
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,679
-Evening.
-Good evening.

588
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,076
You got trouble?

589
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,845
I just spilled something on my dress,
that's all.

590
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,513
You had better take it off
and let me press it dry for you.

591
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,487
No, thanks, it hardly shows.

592
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,186
Yes, ma'am, but this material draws up
all out of shape if it dries on you.

593
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,955
-Does it?
-Yes, ma'am.

594
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,793
And you don't want to go out of here
all out of shape.

595
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,924
It'll only take a minute.

596
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,842
-What a strange thing to say.
-Ma'am?

597
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,191
I was just talking to myself.
That's bad, isn't it?

598
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:05,251
That's right bad.
That man's really got you worried, ain't he?

599
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,387
What man?

600
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,228
There's only three things that can
make a woman start talking to herself.

601
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,235
Her bank account,
her man and her reputation.

602
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,332
And they all three the same things,
ain't they?

603
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,600
My, my.

604
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,940
It certainly is philosophical out tonight.

605
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,178
Here we go again.

606
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,712
It's a raid, let's get out of here!

607
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,217
Here's your dress.

608
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,733
It's a raid, it's a raid.

609
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,402
-Thank you, chum.
-Wait!

610
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,411
-This is the ladies' room, isn't it?
-It's also the way out.

611
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,580
I either have to go on a diet
or stop gambling.

612
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,351
Do you think that photographer got me,
Julia?

613
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,194
Okay, babe, come on.

614
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,596
It's you I'm talking to. Come on.

615
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,034
-Me?
-I said come on.

616
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,070
You couldn't possibly mean me.

617
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,200
Come on, La Verne.
You can ride in the front seat with me.

618
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,278
I'll keep my hat on, too.

619
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,438
-You think I'm the dancer.
-The light dawns.

620
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,450
Officer, you've made a ridiculous mistake.
I'm just a guest here.

621
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,747
Since when the guests been running
around without their dresses on?

622
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,617
That was the strangest thing.

623
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,987
I was standing right here with my dress
in my hand,

624
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,616
and all of a sudden it disappeared.

625
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,991
-Right through the window.
-Sure. Come on.

626
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,461
It disappeared right through the window.

627
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,225
Step back, everybody back.

628
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,829
This is most embarrassing to me. Please!

629
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,962
-This is most embarrassing.
-Officer, what are you doing?

630
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,596
Release this lady immediately.

631
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,299
Everybody that works here gets pulled in.

632
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,468
But you don't understand,
she doesn't work here. She...

633
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,867
Please!

634
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,447
-My name is P. Borat Sosa.
-Sure.

635
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,016
-I'm Latvian.
-Yes. We know.

636
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,210
Get your early morning paper!

637
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,449
Get your 6:00 a.m. edition here.

638
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,357
Get the latest news. Get your paper here.
Early morning paper.

639
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,128
6:00 a.m. edition!
Get your morning paper here!

640
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,394
6:00 a.m. edition! Early edition! Get it here!

641
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,595
Get your early morning paper here!

642
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,390
-Good morning, Mrs. Crandall.
-Good morning.

643
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,793
-Good morning, Mrs. Crandall.
-Will you give me my key, please?

644
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,297
I was rather worried
when you didn't come back all night.

645
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,765
-A woman alone in New York...
-You shouldn't have worried.

646
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,597
I met some friends.

647
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,331
Strip poker.

648
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,580
You had several calls.

649
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,819
-I beg your pardon?
-A Mr. Corday.

650
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,552
Thank you.

651
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:27,088
If Mr. Corday calls again, will you just say
that I checked out hours ago?

652
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,665
Yes, indeed.

653
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,997
And that I have definitely
made other arrangements.

654
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,438
You'll be sure he gets that message,
won't you?

655
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,835
Of course.

656
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,855
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

657
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,124
I am Mr. Corday. Mrs. Crandall, is she in?

658
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,994
No, sir, no.
Mrs. Crandall checked out several hours ago.

659
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,225
But that's impossible.
She was only released...

660
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,135
I mean, I'm sure she couldn't have.

661
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,832
She said she did, Mr. Corday.

662
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,637
And with us,
the customer is still always right.

663
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,302
She went further, Mr. Corday.

664
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,746
She said to tell you
she has made other arrangements.

665
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,246
I see.

666
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:37,991
-Hey, lady! You forgot your hat.
-So I did. Thank you so much.

667
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,036
You almost left it in the hotel, too,
remember?

668
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,126
You ought to put a bell on that.

669
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,638
Yes, thank you. That's an idea.

670
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,621
It's good to see you again, Father.

671
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,815
-And to have you home.
-It's nice to be home.

672
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,415
Everything all right at the office, Lillian?

673
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,221
-Yes, Your Honor, l...
-You look tired.

674
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,422
It's quite a trip rushing to New York
and rushing right back again.

675
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,021
Have any fun?

676
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,931
Fun? That's hardly what I went for, is it?
How's Diana?

677
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,230
Poisonous.

678
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,497
Lady!

679
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,837
You left this in your seat.

680
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:19,976
I...

681
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:26,073
-I almost didn't catch you.
-That's right. You almost didn't.

682
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,583
Tell me, did you really get a new hat?

683
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,347
It's just something I happened to see.

684
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,012
Did it make any difference?

685
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,489
Nonsense.
Everything all right at the office, Lillian?

686
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,788
-I told you, l...
-Oh, yes. That's right.

687
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,954
What's the matter with you?
You're jumpy as an old cat.

688
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,726
That's not very complimentary, darling.

689
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:48,929
The sculptor. Mr... What's his name? Corday.

690
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,904
Can't take the job. Isn't that a shame?

691
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,339
-He can't?
-Why not?

692
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,411
All booked up for years, practically.

693
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,472
But never mind, we'll get somebody else.
He's not the only sculptor in the world.

694
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,846
Really, l...

695
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:09,414
The way Mr. Witherspoon leaves trash
lying around, I think it's a disgrace.

696
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,859
I'm certainly going to speak to him
about that.

697
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,327
It's a disgrace.

698
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:16,656
-Did you get the x-ray machine, Your Honor?
-The what?

699
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,733
No, no.

700
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:24,001
The only one I saw was
of a much too high voltage to be safe.

701
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,009
Was that the trouble with the sculptor, too?

702
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,006
Oh, you.

703
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,912
Hello, Jessie.

704
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,981
I'm glad you're back.
New York's no place for a nice woman.

705
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,952
Never mind, I'll take the things upstairs.

706
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,691
I'm not decrepit yet.
And don't you make me out to be.

707
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,306
I think I'd better help her.

708
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,568
-Anne.
-Yes, Father?

709
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,001
-What happened to you in New York?
-Happened? To me?

710
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,071
Now, what could possibly happen to me
in New York?

711
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,640
-I could only hope.
-Well, I am sorry to disappoint you, darling.

712
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,743
I called you at the hotel.

713
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,524
-You did?
-At 7:00 in the evening and you weren't in.

714
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,183
Naturally, I had to eat, didn't l?

715
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:20,525
I called you again at 6:00 the next morning
and still you weren't in.

716
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,959
I wasn't?

717
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,824
No, you wasn't.
It must have been a very becoming hat.

718
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,109
-Father.
-What is it, Anne?

719
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,905
-I was in jail.
-What?

720
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,140
I was in jail all night
for giving an indecent performance.

721
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,113
Anne Crandall, what are you talking about?

722
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,777
I didn't do it. I didn't do anything.

723
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,515
Father.

724
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:49,223
The minute I saw him lying there
on that couch I knew I should leave.

725
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,759
It's just one of those things you know.

726
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,192
What couch?

727
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,691
He was asleep in his studio when I got there.

728
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,596
-Who?
-The sculptor.

729
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,631
I started to leave,
I had my hand on the door and...

730
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,967
And what?

731
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,873
It thundered and woke him up.

732
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,246
So it thundered and woke him up.

733
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,477
Don't get that silly smirk on your face.

734
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,046
It often thunders, doesn't it?

735
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,852
And cloudbursts stop suddenly, don't they?
It's perfectly normal.

736
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:26,695
Sure, sure. Well, I'm anxious to see him.

737
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,161
-See who?
-The man Jonathan seems to approve of,

738
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,255
that's who.

739
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,665
I knew you'd say something silly like that.

740
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,171
You're not going to see him, idiot,
because I fired him.

741
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:42,176
For pity's sake, quit your sniveling.
The world is full of artists, worse luck.

742
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,509
Heathens, all of them!

743
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,908
I just had my heart set on this one, that's all.

744
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:51,351
That's mighty funny. Where is your dress?

745
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,756
-What?
-Your good black dress?

746
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,325
I've unpacked everything. It isn't here.

747
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,220
Jessie, I told you I'd unpack!

748
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,555
I've been unpacking for you for 10 years.

749
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,225
I don't know why, all of a sudden,
I'm not capable of...

750
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,131
You're perfectly capable.

751
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,329
I wish you'd go all go away
and let me alone for a minute.

752
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,498
I have people downstairs.

753
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,706
Diana, please don't act
as if you're going to die.

754
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:25,079
You probably wouldn't have
liked the man, anyway, darling.

755
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,984
He was positively ancient, to begin with.

756
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,626
He probably wouldn't have lived
to finish the statue.

757
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,491
And you know something?
He had a beard down to here.

758
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,294
A perfect bird's nest of a beard.

759
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,699
-lsn't that disgusting?
-A beard?

760
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,598
He did?

761
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:46,003
He was all grey, too,
and he kind of sniffled all the time.

762
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,238
Mother, why didn't you tell me this before?

763
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,277
Well, I just didn't happen to
think of it before.

764
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,118
-What on Earth is this?
-What does it look like?

765
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,951
I'd dislike to say in front of children.

766
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,823
-And what is it doing under the bed?
-Was it under the bed?

767
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,055
I imagine we'd find a lot of things
under there if we'd just look.

768
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,223
Of course,
if you're criticizing my housekeeping...

769
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,460
Jessie, don't be so droopy.

770
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,728
Can't you see Mother is upset
over the way her trip turned out?

771
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,567
Come on, Mother, I'll go downstairs with you

772
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:20,074
and tell those people
what a really narrow escape we all had.

773
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,475
He certainly sounds nauseating.

774
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,784
But I don't see what difference it
makes what he looks like, if he...

775
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,947
It makes all the difference in the world,
that's all.

776
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,685
He's got to have vitality, doesn't he?
It's going to be a big statue, isn't it?

777
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:37,920
Please.

778
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:42,055
You left the matter to my discretion,
and I simply decided he wouldn't do,

779
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,531
that's all.

780
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,226
We'll get somebody else.

781
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,361
Now, if you will excuse me,
it was rather a tiring trip.

782
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,771
It's certainly a shame
that nothing came of it.

783
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,103
If he was too old to handle the job,

784
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,804
I wouldn't think he would have made
an appointment to talk about it.

785
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,610
I think he would have enjoyed the work,
if he could have gotten it.

786
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,013
I guess when you're dealing with an artist,

787
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,642
you never do know what will happen.

788
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:06,018
-No, they're very unpredictable people.
-I guess...

789
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,989
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

790
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,119
It's only when I opened the door,
I got an awful draft that...

791
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,164
Someone's at the door.

792
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,092
For heaven's sake, how do you do?

793
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,534
-Good night.
-Good day.

794
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,599
-Good night.
-Good day.

795
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,335
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

796
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,312
Well, are you going to let the man
stand on the porch all day?

797
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:34,111
-No. Come in, please. Come in.
-Thank you.

798
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,156
-This is my daughter, Diana.
-How do you do?

799
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,350
My father-in-law, Mr. Crandall.

800
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,017
-How are you, Mr. Crandall?
-How do you do?

801
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,722
-This is Mr. Corday.
-Mr. Corday!

802
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,822
This is Corday?

803
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,531
I'm sorry I was rude just now,
but we weren't expecting you.

804
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,936
As a matter of fact,
I didn't expect to come so soon, either,

805
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,669
but as you didn't give me the opportunity
of seeing you before you left New York...

806
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,677
I left in rather a hurry.

807
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:03,905
Yes, yes, you did.

808
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,414
And since it was in the nature
of unfinished business,

809
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,609
which always aggravates me, doesn't it you?

810
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,811
Yes, very much.

811
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,445
I thought I should come here and finish it,

812
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,524
one way or another,
you understand, of course.

813
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,820
Yes, that seems very efficient.

814
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,086
-So you are Corday.
-Yes, sir.

815
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,823
You don't know how I have
been wanting to meet you.

816
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,661
-Thank you very much.
-Won't you come in?

817
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,169
Diana, dear, don't you think
you ought to finish your homework?

818
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,399
But I've already done it, Mother.

819
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,565
-Let me take your hat and coat.
-Thank you.

820
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,836
I am certainly delighted to meet you,
Mr. Corday.

821
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:35,912
-Have a cigar?
-No, thanks.

822
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,002
-A cigarette?
-No, thank you.

823
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,706
-How about a drink?
-No, thank you.

824
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,909
Mother, you must not have gotten
a good look at Mr. Corday at all.

825
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,487
She thought you were very old.

826
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,488
Diana, dear, don't be rude.

827
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,526
Not at all. You see, the light in my studio
is not very good.

828
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,528
But Mother said
you had a beard down to here!

829
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,594
Well, I thought you did. Didn't you?

830
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,566
A beard? Yes, yes, I did have a beard,
but I shaved it off.

831
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,508
It's so much warmer here
in Vermont than in New York.

832
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,273
Yes, it's particularly warm today, isn't it?

833
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,404
Sit down. Sit down.

834
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,245
-May l? Thank you.
-Sit down.

835
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,149
You're going to stay right here with us,
of course.

836
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,781
Father, don't be ridiculous.
You know we haven't any room.

837
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,622
I am terribly sorry, Mr. Corday,
but we absolutely have no room.

838
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,060
Mother, he could live in the carriage house,
couldn't he?

839
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,029
-Of course not!
-Charming idea!

840
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,827
I have always wanted to
live in a carriage house.

841
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,368
For heaven's sakes, it's only a garage.

842
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,131
But we can leave the car out, Mother,

843
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,365
and Mr. Corday can build
his statue right there,

844
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,442
and I can watch it grow day by day.

845
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,273
-Oh, please, Mother!
-A very practical idea.

846
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:46,473
-Come along, I'll get you settled.
-I've got my things in the truck outside.

847
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,818
I also brought the materials for the statue,
just in case.

848
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,382
Mother, just think. All that was
in back of that beard all the time

849
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,392
and you never knew it.

850
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,981
Mr. Corday.

851
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,356
-Mr. Corday.
-Mrs. Crandall, come up, please.

852
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,755
It's not necessary that I come up at all.

853
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,627
Well, it is, unless you want the whole town
to hear us talking, Mayor Crandall.

854
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,297
You know, this is very nice. I like it.

855
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,069
-I had to talk to you.
-Good, won't you sit down?

856
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:49,077
Mr. Corday, didn't you get my message?

857
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,945
-I left you a message.
-Well, I left you about 10 messages.

858
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,415
Yes, I know.

859
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:58,144
Thank you very much for bailing me out.

860
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,918
Mrs. Crandall, I want to tell you
how really sorry I am.

861
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,356
-Mrs...
-No.

862
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,287
It wasn't nice of me to take you
to a place like Leonardo

863
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,695
-and subject you to...
-Nonsense.

864
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,167
I'm not a child. You didn't drag me there.
I went.

865
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,398
Oh, yes, I went.

866
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:20,104
Mr. Corday, you don't understand
about a town like Brookhaven.

867
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,202
If ever they found out that the mayor
spent a night in jail...

868
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:28,113
-No, really, it would be a dreadful scandal!
-I'm sure I can imagine.

869
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,346
No, I don't think you do, really.
No, you don't.

870
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,257
You have a different background. You...

871
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,027
Mr. Corday, why did you come here?

872
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,724
Why? To build a statue, of course.
Why did you think I came?

873
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,693
But doesn't it make any difference to you
that I don't want you here?

874
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:51,035
Mrs. Crandall, I feel that our civic spirit
should completely overshadow

875
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,769
any personal desires that we may have.

876
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,506
I feel it is my duty to
give Brookhaven a statue that...

877
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,808
Anyway, why don't you want me here?

878
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,442
I explained that all to you. I...

879
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,489
-I thought I explained it.
-Sometimes I am very dense, I guess.

880
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,286
I explained that...

881
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,394
-You brought that?
-I always do.

882
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,294
What do you mean, you always do?

883
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,367
Well, you see, it is not only a very old jar,

884
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,437
it has magic qualities, too. Let me show you.

885
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,135
When I want to do something very badly,
and it is difficult,

886
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:30,305
I just turn it around and presto,
I am allowed to do it! See?

887
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,448
P. Borat Sosa.

888
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,644
You blackmailer!

889
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,683
Mayor Crandall!

890
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,057
After all, if the end justifies the means.

891
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,629
-Really!
-Mrs. Crandall, give me a week.

892
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,791
If by the end of a week you say I don't fit,
I'll go. Is that fair?

893
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,903
There doesn't seem to be much
I can do about it, does there?

894
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,736
I promise to be no trouble. And who knows?

895
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,106
Maybe by that time, you will be
so much in love with the statue

896
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,679
that you will insist upon my staying here.

897
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,049
I am perfectly helpless.

898
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,248
Perfectly helpless.

899
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,586
Mr. Corday,
why do you want to stay here that badly?

900
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,996
That's what I want to find out.

901
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,950
That's very good.

902
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,082
May I say it's rather nice having someone
of culture around for a change?

903
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,318
-You are French, aren't you?
-Yes.

904
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,656
-I was born right here in Brookhaven.
-Well, I think it's very nice here.

905
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,560
But you've only been here a week.

906
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,656
Honestly, Mr. Corday,
sometimes the dullness

907
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,065
comes down over you
like a blanket or something.

908
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,968
-Really?
-lf you are sensitive, like I am.

909
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,538
Well, excuse me, Mr. Corday, that's Gilbert.

910
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,548
He's the person who picks me up
in the morning and takes me

911
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,845
to my post-graduate course.

912
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,419
Well, come on!

913
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,516
-Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

914
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:34,295
Good night! Watch where you're going.
And come on, we'll be late for school.

915
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,045
-Good morning, Mr. Crandall.
-Morning.

916
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,977
You sound very grumpy this morning.

917
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,852
We had oeufs, instead of eggs,
for breakfast, this morning.

918
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,584
-Thanks to your influence.
-I'm sorry.

919
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,717
I think your granddaughter
is a charming child.

920
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,421
My granddaughter is a ravening she-wolf.

921
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,623
And don't underestimate her.

922
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,197
Now, if my daughter-in-law
starting spouting French,

923
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,604
I wouldn't object, do you understand?
I wouldn't object at all.

924
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,980
We found it when we were cleaning up
around the station, Mr. Buchanan.

925
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:25,384
And I thought if the mayor knew
what kind of a man this Corday is,

926
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,218
well, maybe she wouldn't want him
staying at her house.

927
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:33,024
To come straight from jail to Brookhaven!
That's brazen, Mr. Buchanan! Brazen!

928
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,321
Do you think I ought to tell her?

929
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,631
No, no, I wouldn't do that, Mr. Witherspoon.
It might be a little embarrassing.

930
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,500
You see, the night this happened,

931
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:46,632
our mayor was supposed to have
had an appointment with Mr. Corday.

932
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:52,077
Sort of gives one something to think about,
doesn't it, Mr. Witherspoon?

933
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,512
Mr. Crandall, you must remain motionless.

934
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,713
-But my arm is stiff.
-Fine. Exactly as I want it.

935
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,257
Why, you are the most miserable tyrant
I have ever known.

936
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,159
Well, all artists are tyrants.
Except that I am not an artist.

937
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,663
-You're not?
-No. This statue, for instance.

938
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,825
I should be much farther along than I am.

939
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,837
You should be much farther along
with a lot of things than you are.

940
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,636
You know what I have finally realized?
I don't want to finish him.

941
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:23,440
I don't even like to work on him.
That's definitely morbid, don't you think?

942
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,038
Not at all. It's very encouraging.

943
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,208
Thank you.

944
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,585
-Encouraging?
-Very encouraging.

945
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,350
-You're jealous of him.
-Ridiculous!

946
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,221
Of course it's ridiculous.
Jonathan's the best friend you've got.

947
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,490
-Jonathan? I?
-Sure.

948
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,928
He knocked his own head off
with a lightning bolt,

949
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,501
so Anne would go to New York
in the first place, didn't he?

950
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,629
-You didn't hear about that, did you?
-No, I can't say that I have.

951
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:54,506
And she admitted herself it was a mighty
handy thunderclap that woke you up

952
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:59,048
when she was sneaking out of your studio.
Well, that was Jonathan, too.

953
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,383
-That was?
-Certainly it was!

954
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:06,148
He is just as anxious to
get her out of this rut as I am.

955
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,918
And you are the fellow he's picked to do it.

956
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,425
-It's very obvious.
-You believe that?

957
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,519
Of course I believe it.

958
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,091
It's a crazy idea, you know?

959
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,394
Sure, it's crazy, but it might work.

960
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:23,603
You mean that Anne believes
that Jonathan is...

961
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,500
Well, she says she doesn't,
but she says it in a very funny voice.

962
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,976
-No.
-Fact.

963
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,682
How can you stand that day and night?

964
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,310
Your granddaughter is keeping me
happy at my work. She told me so.

965
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,637
If you're hanging around
hoping for an invitation to dinner,

966
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,108
you're very much mistaken, you know.

967
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,443
Don't worry, I wouldn't stay if you asked me.

968
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:09,678
I couldn't eat anything, anyway,
you make me so sick at my stomach.

969
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,380
Please, must you
discuss your stomach, Gilbert?

970
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,957
You didn't used to faint, you know,
when people mentioned stomachs.

971
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:22,828
You've gotten so artistic lately, since
that old mud-dauber came around, that...

972
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:27,460
You're only speaking of probably
the world's greatest living artist, you know.

973
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,800
I wouldn't show my ignorance like that
if I were you, Gilbert.

974
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:34,240
Do you mind if I leave?
I think I'm going to be sick.

975
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,340
In fact, I wish you would.

976
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:40,473
I don't think you realize how
your adolescent presence jars on me.

977
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,886
-I thought you were leaving?
-Don't worry, I am.

978
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,762
I don't suppose you'd want to go for a walk?

979
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,995
A walk?

980
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,831
Really, Gilbert, do you think
I'm exactly dressed to go for a walk?

981
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,268
I'll tell you what you're dressed like,
Diana Crandall!

982
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,036
What you're dressed like is enough to
make a horse laugh. Hee-haw!

983
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,602
-You want to know a secret, Mother?
-Yes, what?

984
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,472
That's Mr. Corday's
absolutely favorite piece!

985
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,909
Really? I wonder why?

986
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:21,450
It's probably got something to do
with his past, don't you imagine so?

987
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:26,121
Diana, what on Earth
have you done to your hair?

988
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,656
-What have you done to yours?
-Mine?

989
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,755
It makes you look awfully young, Mother.

990
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:37,856
-ls that bad?
-I guess not,

991
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,027
but a person's age is a person's age,

992
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,071
and, Mother,
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

993
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,197
but I think it makes you look a little silly.

994
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,641
Oh, you do?
Well, I think you look a little silly yourself.

995
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,680
High heels and a party dress
on a school day, really!

996
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:54,375
-Mother, do you feel all right?
-Why, certainly, what do you mean?

997
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:59,387
I don't know. You used to be so quiet,
but lately you've been so kind of leapy!

998
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,356
What a ridiculous word.

999
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:06,588
Honestly, you children have a vocabulary
all your own, don't you?

1000
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,134
Jessie, I'm going to the stone-cutter's
with Mr. Corday.

1001
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,470
We have to choose a pedestal
for Jonathan's statue.

1002
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:22,043
Oh, and don't bother to tell Diana,

1003
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,807
because she'd want to go and she really
ought to stay home and practice,

1004
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:26,438
you know, with the recital coming up.

1005
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,347
He has been trying to get you alone
ever since he came here.

1006
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,352
Well, I see he's finally made it.

1007
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,649
Please don't be silly, Jessie.

1008
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,518
I might give you the same advice,
Mayor Crandall.

1009
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,271
I don't know what's keeping
Mrs. Crandall out this late.

1010
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,466
Really?

1011
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,874
-Just look at that rain!
-Yeah, just look at it.

1012
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:01,872
Hello?

1013
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,714
No, she's not here.

1014
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:09,284
Well, we have to find her, Mr. Crandall.
It's raining and there's a hole in the dike.

1015
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,691
Well, what do you want her to do?
Stick her finger in it?

1016
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,923
-Hadn't you better go look for her?
-Me?

1017
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:19,433
Fly right in the face of destiny?
Not me, Jessie.

1018
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,368
Wherever she is, it's doing her good.

1019
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,873
It's a very significant rain. Very.

1020
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,419
I couldn't leave if I wanted to, could l?

1021
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,857
No, your conscience should be
thoroughly comfortable.

1022
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,829
Anne, do you realize that since I have been
in this town, I never heard you laugh?

1023
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,832
And today is the first time I heard you sing.

1024
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:55,668
I did, didn't l?
I don't know what came over me.

1025
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,206
-Don't you?
-Do l?

1026
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:03,307
Well, that tango. For a moment, you and l
were dancing together, remember?

1027
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,038
-I'm afraid I do.
-Afraid?

1028
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:11,078
Of what? Me? Yourself?

1029
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,318
-Brookhaven?
-No.

1030
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:16,487
Yes. I don't know.

1031
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:21,126
I'm so mixed up.
I've never been mixed up before in my life.

1032
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,130
-Anne.
-Yes?

1033
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,293
You asked me a question once,
and I couldn't answer it.

1034
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:30,304
You asked me why I came here.
Now I can answer it.

1035
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,709
Well, it's nice to get things straightened out
in your own mind.

1036
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,869
I'm in love with you, Anne.

1037
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,944
You aren't, are you?

1038
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,482
I know exactly when it happened.

1039
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,985
When you were telling me
about the dignity of the Crandalls

1040
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,819
in that beautiful cockeyed little hat.

1041
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,893
That little hat has a lot to answer for,
hasn't it?

1042
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,692
Look at me, please, just once.

1043
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,267
-I can't.
-Why can't you?

1044
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:04,432
Because when I do,
the most ridiculous thing happens to me.

1045
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:09,006
-I know what you mean.
-I stop thinking, completely.

1046
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,038
In my position, I just can't afford to do that.

1047
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,580
-Anyway, look where we are.
-Where are we?

1048
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:22,355
We're practically sitting in a cupid's lap,
and it just isn't the place for it.

1049
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,950
Well, I cannot imagine a more perfect place
for it than a cupid's lap.

1050
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:27,996
Yes, but this is a Brookhaven cupid,

1051
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,827
and they look at things differently
than other cupids.

1052
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:34,425
Our cupids are kind of narrow-minded.

1053
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,563
Well, they should be educated,
don't you think?

1054
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,868
I told you when...

1055
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:47,606
There, you see, I've stopped thinking again.
I'm absolutely blank.

1056
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,149
You are absolutely wonderful.

1057
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:56,114
-Am l, really?
-You are absolutely wonderful.

1058
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,690
How very nice of you.

1059
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,760
Mother!

1060
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:11,032
-It's Diana.
-Well, send her home.

1061
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,698
No, for heaven's sake, I can't do that.
What would she think?

1062
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,936
Coming, darling. Come along.

1063
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:23,483
You boys are wasting your time in
Brookhaven. You know that, don't you?

1064
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,887
Apparently I will have to marry you
to be alone with you.

1065
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,924
What did you say?

1066
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,444
I had no intention of marrying you.

1067
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,979
In fact, I had no intention
of marrying anyone, ever.

1068
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,485
-Miser.
-I beg your pardon.

1069
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,960
Beautiful things should be shared,
Mr. Corday.

1070
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,497
-But not with me.
-Why not?

1071
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:48,335
Why not?

1072
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:53,039
I've other plans and they do not include...

1073
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,568
-Marriage.
-Why not?

1074
01:06:56,779 --> 01:07:00,215
-I'm a widow.
-Excellent reason for getting married.

1075
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,680
I'm a mother.

1076
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,446
Since when is motherhood
an argument against marriage?

1077
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,078
-I'm a mayor.
-Why not act like one?

1078
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,332
-What are you muttering about?
-I'm proposing.

1079
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,529
How are you doing? I'm not surprised.

1080
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,271
There's your stumbling block.
They made a deal.

1081
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,403
When Jonathan died,
the girl was all broken up.

1082
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,677
Anne promised never to marry anyone else.

1083
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,775
Good night! Be quiet!

1084
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,325
Gee, you're so pretty.

1085
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:52,430
-You did very nicely, dear.
-Nicely? What do you mean, nicely?

1086
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,435
-lt was a superb performance.
-Yeah.

1087
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,937
-Why, thank you.
-I thought you were good, too.

1088
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,031
You ought to be. The way you pound
on that thing at home all the time.

1089
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,201
Gilbert, do you always
have to spoil everything?

1090
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:03,573
-Children!
-Goodbye.

1091
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,045
Diana and I are walking home alone.

1092
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,013
-Hey!
-Yes, hey!

1093
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,249
-We are?
-We certainly are.

1094
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,081
We have a great deal to talk about tonight.

1095
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,679
-I admire your courage.
-lt will be all right, you'll see.

1096
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,257
See what?

1097
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:20,590
Your daughter and I are going to
plan a surprise for you. Good night.

1098
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,901
And I was going to get her
a hot fudge sundae.

1099
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,133
Gilbert.

1100
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,173
Do you want to do
something very nice for me?

1101
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,734
-Me? For you?
-Yes, buy me that hot fudge sundae.

1102
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,781
-Honest?
-Honest. I haven't had one in years!

1103
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,914
Well, good night!

1104
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,416
-You know something?
-What?

1105
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:50,822
I've always, you know,
just thought you were just Diana's mother.

1106
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:52,689
-I am.
-I know that.

1107
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,595
I mean, I never exactly noticed
what you looked like before.

1108
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,467
A mother is just another piece of furniture
in the girl's house, Gilbert.

1109
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:02,537
-Didn't you know that?
-I'll talk to you later.

1110
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,230
Well, good night!

1111
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,603
You see, I didn't realize until tonight

1112
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,680
that you are not at all the child
everyone thinks you to be.

1113
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,442
-You didn't?
-I could hear it in your music.

1114
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,051
A woman,
an intelligent, understanding woman!

1115
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,650
-Me?
-Certainly you.

1116
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,657
A woman a man could talk to
and be sure of being understood.

1117
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,091
-Oh, I am.
-I know that now.

1118
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,121
-Diana.
-Yes?

1119
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:32,393
When a man falls in love with a woman,
I mean really in love,

1120
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,662
he wants to marry her. You see?

1121
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:40,171
-Clearly!
-Well, now, if the woman

1122
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,335
is also in love with the man,

1123
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,971
nothing should stand in the way of their
making a life together, do you think?

1124
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:49,482
-Oh, no. That would be wicked.
-Very wicked.

1125
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:53,885
Families, obligations,
promises made unadvisedly.

1126
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:56,890
Nothing should keep them apart,
do you think?

1127
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:02,954
Mother and I made a promise once,
never to get married and leave each other.

1128
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,727
You know, like a suicide pact.

1129
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,760
That is exactly what a bad promise like that
amounts to, don't you see?

1130
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:15,276
Suicide. The killing of everything in
a woman that needs to live and be happy.

1131
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,610
That's beautiful!

1132
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,546
I never thought of it that way before.

1133
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:28,419
Well, you probably were a child then,
and didn't realize what a bad promise it was.

1134
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,322
But now that you are a woman,
and that you do realize...

1135
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,827
Do you... Do you want me to break it?

1136
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,489
It is not a matter of breaking a promise,
Diana,

1137
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,558
it is a matter of freeing a woman's heart.
Don't you see the difference?

1138
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:45,234
Oh, clearly. It's perfectly beautiful.

1139
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:49,302
And you never realized until tonight,
did you?

1140
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,976
-Realize what?
-That I was a woman.

1141
01:10:56,585 --> 01:11:00,715
It just goes to show what a shrewd
analysis of character you are.

1142
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,417
I assure you, no one else realizes it.

1143
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:08,224
That's because they are used to you.
Now, you understand, don't you?

1144
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:11,162
You do know what I am asking you to do?

1145
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:15,636
Well, naturally,
I don't have to be hit over the head.

1146
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,933
You make me very happy, Diana.

1147
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,775
-That's really all that matters, isn't it?
-Thank you.

1148
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:34,653
-Hey, Corday!
-Yes?

1149
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,082
-How'd you do?
-She'll do it.

1150
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,194
-No trouble at all.
-Good.

1151
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,293
-Does Grandfather know?
-lt was my idea.

1152
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:46,166
It was? Then, can I tell Mother?

1153
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,867
By all means. Tell your mother.

1154
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,346
Mother! Mother, can you imagine?
Grandfather!

1155
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,922
-Can I imagine Grandfather what?
-Approving.

1156
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:09,012
Approving what, dear?

1157
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,093
Mother, you've got to listen to me
very carefully and...

1158
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,685
Mother, I love you so much.

1159
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,322
-I love you, too, dear.
-I know, and...

1160
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,027
And that's what makes it kind of sad, only...

1161
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:24,037
Only, oh, Mother, he's just so wonderful!

1162
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,300
-Who?
-Mr. Corday.

1163
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:29,434
Only, I guess I'll have to get used to
calling him Georg,

1164
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,536
if I'm going to marry him.

1165
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,908
If what?

1166
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,847
I know it's a shock,

1167
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,014
-but he did it so beautifully.
-Did what, dear?

1168
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:44,491
Tell me about love and women and things.
And he's so right.

1169
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,718
Nobody has any right to stand in your way.

1170
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,059
-ln whose way?
-Mine.

1171
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,257
Mother, you won't, will you?

1172
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:57,069
Diana, are you trying to tell me that
Georg Corday asked you to marry him?

1173
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,436
Not in certain words, Mother,

1174
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:03,071
but from the way he looked
and the things he said...

1175
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:06,443
Oh, well, it's just one of those things
that a woman knows.

1176
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,484
Oh, Mother,
I'm so happy, I can absolutely do flips.

1177
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:11,985
You don't mind, do you?

1178
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,180
Well, it's a bit of a surprise.

1179
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,883
Won't Gilbert die?

1180
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,553
Gilbert's not the only one
who's going to die.

1181
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:23,460
You get into bed, darling,
and we'll talk about this in the morning.

1182
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,863
But, of course,
you don't expect me to get any sleep?

1183
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,061
I don't imagine
any of us will get much sleep.

1184
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,105
It's just so hysterically wonderful, isn't it?

1185
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,673
Hysterically.

1186
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:54,720
-You come with me!
-Where?

1187
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,890
We're going to make a call
on my new son-in-law!

1188
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,365
Son-in-law?

1189
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:04,735
Of course, you said you and Diana
were planning a surprise for me, but...

1190
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,501
This is outrageous.

1191
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,200
Well, the only thing for me to do, of course,

1192
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,369
is to go to her immediately
and explain the mistake.

1193
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,071
-You will not!
-You can't do that.

1194
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,478
Diana is pretty highly strung.

1195
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,676
Do you realize the child is
absolutely dippy in love with you?

1196
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,346
You can't just toss a young girl's emotions
around like a football.

1197
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,981
Girls that age are...
Well, it might prove dangerous.

1198
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:25,082
-Well, then I'll leave.
-That's just as bad.

1199
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,287
She'll think you've changed your mind
and ran out on her.

1200
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,364
Well, we must do something. This is awful.

1201
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,059
You two! I knew you were up to something.

1202
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:35,261
Clever as all get-out, aren't you?
Pushing people around.

1203
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,894
It was my idea. I thought that...

1204
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,905
You have the proper shape for cupid,
darling,

1205
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:41,032
but your aim hasn't been so good lately.

1206
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,805
Well, I've never felt
so miserably idiotic in all my life.

1207
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,039
This is fantastic! That child!

1208
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,639
-I told you not to underestimate her.
-What shall I do?

1209
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:58,092
Let's see. Diana always has been horrified
at the idea of a beard.

1210
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,785
-Maybe you could grow a beard!
-A beard?

1211
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:03,422
-But then, it wouldn't be grey, would it?
-lt would not!

1212
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:06,262
Maybe you could be too old for her?

1213
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:10,600
That idea seemed to nauseate her, too.
"Nauseate" is the word she used.

1214
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,970
-I am too old for her.
-You certainly are.

1215
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,339
-Now, shut up, the man is in trouble.
-And how!

1216
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,809
-How's your stomach?
-I beg your pardon?

1217
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,607
Well, we've got to think of something
to make her back out.

1218
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,011
I thought maybe it could be your stomach.

1219
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,083
-What's the matter with it?
-Nothing, but couldn't there be?

1220
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,981
-What do you mean?
-Well, be an invalid.

1221
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,610
Youngsters hate sickly people.

1222
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,815
That's a lovely idea, darling.
I'm proud of you.

1223
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,017
Don't you see what he means?

1224
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:34,527
Droop around a little, you know,
and pretend you can't eat,

1225
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,963
and I think there's an old shawl around
I could let you have.

1226
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,728
In other words, act your age, for a change.

1227
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,731
I'll do anything, you understand,
anything at all.

1228
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:44,828
I hope you starve.

1229
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,101
-Conceited idiot! Diana!
-What?

1230
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,073
Why would she think he'd marry her
in the first place?

1231
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:52,544
Why not? He proposed to me tonight, too.
I thought he meant it.

1232
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:56,243
-Now, Anne...
-The little man has had a busy day.

1233
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,385
I knew if you came here
something would happen.

1234
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:04,187
But, frankly, I didn't think it would end up
with my being your mother-in-law.

1235
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,500
-ls that you?
-That's what's left of me.

1236
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,842
-Anne, you've got to let me in.
-I do? Why?

1237
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,574
I'm starving to death, that's why.

1238
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:04,516
She won't let me eat anything.
Well, it's not funny.

1239
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:07,986
She even told the restaurants
in town not to feed me.

1240
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,891
All right. The kitchen.

1241
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,549
To show you how primitive man really is,

1242
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,355
I don't know which smells more beautiful,
the coffee or you.

1243
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,992
When a man's hungry, he wants...

1244
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,457
-He wants what?
-Food! He...

1245
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,833
-Does he?
-Doesn't he?

1246
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:01,466
-The waffles will burn.
-I don't care if the house burns.

1247
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:07,075
You're making love to your mother-in-law.
That isn't even...

1248
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,084
You said to let you in
because you were starving to death.

1249
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,619
That's right.

1250
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,120
-What about Diana?
-She belongs to Gilbert.

1251
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,693
-But she doesn't know that.
-I'll talk to him.

1252
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,195
Heaven forbid! You talked to Diana
and look what happened.

1253
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:25,061
You'd probably come back engaged to him.

1254
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:31,200
I love you, darling.

1255
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:41,346
What do you know? I hear bells!

1256
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,824
-It's the doorbell.
-Let it ring!

1257
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,428
Oh, no! I just can't let a doorbell ring.
You forget, I'm the mayor.

1258
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,997
Oh, yes, I did forget.
And what is more important,

1259
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,589
I think for one moment you forgot.

1260
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,190
Please, please, be quiet.

1261
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:03,362
I really wouldn't want anyone
to find me alone here with you.

1262
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:06,373
-ln your own kitchen?
-Well, it would take so much explanation.

1263
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,443
Really, I'll be right back.

1264
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,519
-Why, Gilbert.
-May I come in, Mrs. Crandall?

1265
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,187
Yes, I guess so.

1266
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,431
-What on Earth is it?
-I can't eat anymore. I can't sleep, either.

1267
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,699
Well, there's a kind of an epidemic
of that around.

1268
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,571
Do you think I ought to kill Mr. Corday?

1269
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,337
What did you say?

1270
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,778
Well, I'd just as soon, if it would help.

1271
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:51,580
Gilbert, come on in a minute.
I want to tell you something.

1272
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:55,452
It's awful late. Do you think it'd be all right?

1273
01:19:55,557 --> 01:20:00,221
Well, what do we care? Other people
seem to do what they want to, don't they?

1274
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,323
Sure. Like you say, by golly,

1275
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:07,424
"What's sauce for the goose,
the gander ought to get in on, too."

1276
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:11,066
Yes. Come and sit down, Gilbert.

1277
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:16,372
You see, this situation with Diana
has made me very unhappy, too, Gilbert.

1278
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,911
Maybe I ought to kill her, too.

1279
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:21,278
Oh, well, no,
I don't think that's necessary, but...

1280
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:25,318
-I do think that you and I can...
-Can what?

1281
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,685
Well, I've been noticing you
a lot lately, Gilbert.

1282
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,992
-I've been noticing you, too.
-Oh, you have?

1283
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,893
Gilbert, sometimes
I get so impatient with you!

1284
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,766
-You do?
-Well, yes.

1285
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,170
If you're in love with someone,
you ought to say so,

1286
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,936
and not just sit around in corners
looking at them.

1287
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:51,979
For heaven's sakes,
a woman can't stand that.

1288
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,707
-She can't?
-Well, no!

1289
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,784
She thinks you're not attracted to her,
and you see what happens.

1290
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:59,410
-She turns to someone else.
-Turns to who?

1291
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,318
Well, in this case, it's Mr. Corday.

1292
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,618
But he's going to marry Diana.

1293
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:05,748
Well, yes, that's what l...

1294
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,625
You don't have to turn to anybody, Mrs...

1295
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:13,799
Anne! Because I'm not going to
be like that anymore.

1296
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:15,995
-Like what, Gilbert?
-I only sat in the corner

1297
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:17,867
and looked at you, because...

1298
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:21,500
Well, because, I never even realized
I had a chance with you.

1299
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,976
-Well...
-You're so smart

1300
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,706
-and pretty and everything.
-Oh, Gilbert.

1301
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,543
-Here all the time...
-Obviously, Gilbert...

1302
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,480
Well, I didn't know, did l?

1303
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:32,815
Good night, you must have thought
I was awful dumb.

1304
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:38,685
Well...

1305
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,201
Good night! Won't Diana die?

1306
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:10,152
Darling! What's the matter?

1307
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,925
I think I'm engaged to Gilbert.

1308
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,029
-What?
-Yeah.

1309
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,256
Stop acting like a jack-in-the-box.
Either come in or stay out.

1310
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:44,958
Thank you, sir.

1311
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,957
Well, sit down. Sit down.

1312
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:56,159
Now, look here, Gilbert.
I've been wanting to talk to you.

1313
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:57,994
What's the matter with you?

1314
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:00,404
Why don't you get up on your hind legs
and act like a man?

1315
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,237
-I did.
-You did?

1316
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:03,538
Yes, sir.

1317
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,309
Good night! I sure did.

1318
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,348
-Well, now...
-Good morning, Mr...

1319
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:12,250
Well, well, Gilbert, congratulations.

1320
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:15,187
-Did she tell you already?
-Naturally.

1321
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,119
I should like to have been there.

1322
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,557
-I suppose you acted broken-hearted.
-Why should l?

1323
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,152
I think Gilbert and Anne
will make a perfect couple.

1324
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:24,561
-Gilbert and who?
-Good morning.

1325
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:28,001
Oh, hello, Gilbert. Oh, sorry.

1326
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,296
Hello.

1327
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,933
-Hello.
-Hello.

1328
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,005
Good morning, Diana.

1329
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,138
Come and sit down, Gilbert.

1330
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,618
Well, Diana, how do you feel this morning?

1331
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:49,747
-All right.
-Good.

1332
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,621
I couldn't wait to tell her.

1333
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,626
Well, how do you like it?

1334
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,754
-I think it's perfectly sweet, except...
-Except what?

1335
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,399
Well, there's kind of a disgusting difference
in their ages, that's all.

1336
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,528
But not nearly as much as
between you and Georg, dear.

1337
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:06,573
-What is this?
-You mean you don't know?

1338
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,503
-Anne and Gilbert are engaged to be married.
-What?

1339
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:15,449
You said you wanted romance in the house,
dear. Well, you've got it.

1340
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,644
Well, this is the most idiotic situation l...

1341
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,847
Mr. Crandall, please,
you're speaking of our happiness.

1342
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:26,393
Georg and I talked it over,
and we think it's so selfish of all of us

1343
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:29,361
not to share our happiness with the town.

1344
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:30,431
Ma'am?

1345
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,796
Yes, we decided to announce
our joint engagements

1346
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,664
at the unveiling of the new statue.

1347
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,999
When everybody will be there.

1348
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,700
But, good night,
I haven't even asked my mother yet. I...

1349
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:47,206
Oh, you mustn't. It will be so much more fun
to surprise her when she's with her friends.

1350
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:49,010
Don't you think so?

1351
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,109
Yes, ma'am.

1352
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,847
Well, if you don't mind,
I'll go out and come in again.

1353
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,820
This just can't be happening.

1354
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,919
Don't you feel a draft here? Diana, dear,
would you get me my shawl, please?

1355
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:06,592
-It's hot as an oven in here.
-You know, in my condition...

1356
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:14,872
And, Gilbert, you'll find my pills
in on the desk. Would you mind?

1357
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:18,537
-Pills?
-Naturally, before my eating, you know?

1358
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,982
Excuse me.

1359
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,323
Pardon me.

1360
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,603
Well, everything seems to be ready.

1361
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:57,284
-I don't see anything to cry about.
-Oh, don't you?

1362
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,851
I suppose you don't think it makes
a person nervous to be engaged?

1363
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:04,391
-Well, it does.
-Good night, I know it, don't l?

1364
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:09,195
Well, if it makes you so darn nervous,
what are you going to marry him for?

1365
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:10,423
Why don't you just tell him?

1366
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:13,126
And live in that house
with you for a stepfather?

1367
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:16,032
No, thank you, Gilbert Parker,
I would rather be...

1368
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:17,761
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1369
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:19,134
Anne Crandall exposed!

1370
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,231
Read all about it, dishonor the mayor.

1371
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:24,311
Two mayors to be unveiled today.
Extra! Extra!

1372
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:25,605
Paper!

1373
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:27,878
Anne, darling, what...

1374
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:31,315
I sent Jessie out for a paper.
How could they have found out?

1375
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,284
I cannot understand it.

1376
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:45,491
-Father!
-Well, I did it.

1377
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:50,399
-Did what?
-I told Buchanan the whole story.

1378
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,504
So sue me.

1379
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:56,232
You mean you told Buchanan
about Anne being arrested?

1380
01:26:56,611 --> 01:27:00,411
I certainly did. I certainly did. I certainly did.

1381
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,244
Father! Do you realize...

1382
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,543
Do you realize this is the end of me
as mayor of Brookhaven?

1383
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:09,987
Something had to be done to blast you
out of this town, didn't it?

1384
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,082
Well, I did it.

1385
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,423
So sue me.

1386
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,177
I've never seen Father
have a drink before in his life.

1387
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,113
-He always goes out of town to do it.
-You know, that's not a bad idea.

1388
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:37,650
Mother! Mother!

1389
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,579
Did you know this happened to you?

1390
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:43,752
Oh, darling, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1391
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,357
Mr. Corday, I challenge you to a duel.

1392
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,520
Gilbert, don't be so primeval.

1393
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:51,791
That is, unless Mr. Corday refuses.

1394
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:53,594
Refuses? Refuses what?

1395
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,693
Mr. Corday,
I want you to know that I expect you,

1396
01:27:56,804 --> 01:28:00,137
if you have any honor whatsoever,
to marry my mother.

1397
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:05,144
-You do?
-You do?

1398
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:08,147
Yes, in our part of the country, Mr. Corday,

1399
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:11,116
we don't bandy women's names around
without any clothes on.

1400
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,746
-Oh, but, darling...
-Please don't consider me in this thing at all.

1401
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,324
I'm willing to make any sacrifice.

1402
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:21,350
-So am l.
-Good night, so am l.

1403
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:27,193
Mother, I'm so sorry. But you'll just have to
take your consequences,

1404
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,566
even if he does have spells.

1405
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,002
His shawl is on a hook behind the door.

1406
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,538
Now, I'm going up
to see my poor grandfather.

1407
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,875
He must feel pretty horrible.

1408
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:42,478
Hey! Can't I go?

1409
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,981
He's my grandfather, too, isn't he?

1410
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,250
-Your grandfather?
-Well, good night!

1411
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,588
I almost married her, didn't l?

1412
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:56,997
And I'll probably end up marrying you,
won't l?

1413
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:01,291
-I'm just dumb enough.
-Why, thank you, Gilbert.

1414
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:05,037
That's the very nicest proposal I ever had.

1415
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:07,937
The very nicest, I might add.

1416
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:12,274
Good night! I should know how.
I've sure had enough practice, lately.

1417
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:16,710
Well, I feel a little like an old glove.

1418
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:19,981
-I have to make an honest woman of you.
-Yes, apparently.

1419
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,045
Well, it'll be a sweet wedding.

1420
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:24,454
The bride wore a lovely arrangement
of tar and feathers.

1421
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:26,220
Oh, darling, you're exaggerating.

1422
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:30,423
Am l? You don't know a small town.
The mayor's supposed to keep her shirt on.

1423
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,123
Anne, will you please stop worrying?

1424
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:36,932
Mrs. Crandall? Mrs. Crandall,
they just broke the windows.

1425
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,400
-So I was exaggerating, was l?
-That's impossible.

1426
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:42,772
Not ours, the newspaper office.

1427
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:44,903
What do you mean?

1428
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:49,949
Well, the Crandalls have established a little
credit here in Brookhaven, apparently.

1429
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,445
Everybody in town is waiting for you
at the statue, Mrs. Crandall,

1430
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,112
to give you a vote of confidence.

1431
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,554
Oh, Jessie!

1432
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:00,024
We all agreed that
no Crandall would act like that.

1433
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:03,057
And if they did, we wouldn't believe it.

1434
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,729
Well, everyone's waiting.

1435
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:11,128
-This is kind of nice, isn't it?
-Very nice.

1436
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,867
Very comfortable,
very typical of Brookhaven.

1437
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:17,411
Well, it's the final argument for our
getting out of here as quickly as we can.

1438
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:18,706
Getting out of here?

1439
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:21,281
We're getting married, you know.
I could not face a duel.

1440
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,044
-Well, I know, but...
-And I must certainly prove to our daughter

1441
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,949
that I am a man of honor.

1442
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:30,217
Won't she be amazed to find
how rapidly marriage improves my health?

1443
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,591
You know,
I think you ought to sort of taper off.

1444
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:36,959
I will explain to her that's why we have go to
somewhere very warm for our honeymoon.

1445
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,929
Because of my condition.

1446
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:42,196
Somewhere warm.
It sounds wonderful, doesn't it?

1447
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,901
But, of course, that's not possible right now.

1448
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,373
Not possible? Why?

1449
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:50,637
With the election coming up and everything.

1450
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,804
What about it?
Do you have to hold its hand or something?

1451
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,848
-Well, I'm in it.
-ln what?

1452
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,213
-I'm running.
-Running where?

1453
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:59,117
Against Mr. Buchanan.

1454
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,246
Why should you possibly want to
run against Mr. Buchanan?

1455
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:03,914
That sounds very unpleasant.

1456
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:06,619
-Well, so that I can be mayor.
-Why?

1457
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:08,992
Why?

1458
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:13,165
Well, I can't possibly answer
a question like that.

1459
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:14,962
I don't think you can.

1460
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,503
There's the music. Come on, we must go.

1461
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,911
-Command performance.
-Well, if you like.

1462
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:29,914
-I certainly feel I have an obligation to...
-To whom?

1463
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,452
Well, to the town.
To everybody here who believes in me.

1464
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:35,579
You saw yourself how wonderful they were.

1465
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:37,214
Wonderful, how?

1466
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,691
Well, for heaven's sake, about the scandal.

1467
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,557
You really felt they were wonderful?

1468
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:45,428
You really will feel very proud
to go out there and listen to the cheers?

1469
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:47,194
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about at all.

1470
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:48,563
You did get arrested, didn't you?

1471
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,261
-Well, yes...
-But they don't admit it, do they?

1472
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:53,397
Not for a minute.
They apologize, they compromise.

1473
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,238
They say no Crandall would act like that,
and if they did,

1474
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,039
they wouldn't believe it. Awful!

1475
01:31:58,145 --> 01:31:59,510
Well, what's awful about it?

1476
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:03,209
Anne, you know very well
if it hadn't been for Brookhaven,

1477
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:07,481
we would have had a wonderful breakfast
the next morning and laughed our heads off.

1478
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:10,148
Because it was so silly. Wouldn't we?

1479
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:16,621
You and I simply don't look
at anything alike, do we?

1480
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:20,561
Well, you paid me a great compliment
when you said I wouldn't fit in Brookhaven.

1481
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:23,660
-But you do, you have.
-I do not!

1482
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:28,068
I have hidden and whispered and explained
until I want to go where I can yell.

1483
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,767
Do you understand that?

1484
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,243
To get on top of the highest building
in the world and yell,

1485
01:32:32,346 --> 01:32:35,543
"This is my woman.
I love her and she loves me."

1486
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,277
Love isn't something you should be afraid

1487
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,683
someone would catch you
in the kitchen doing.

1488
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:41,618
But you don't understand, Georg.

1489
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:44,384
After we're married,
it would be different then.

1490
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:47,518
Then our love will be respectable, is that it?

1491
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:51,220
-Well, I think that sounds disgusting.
-lt is disgusting.

1492
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:54,267
You're forcing me to choose
between you and my duty.

1493
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:56,268
It has nothing to do with me.

1494
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,310
-I have to go.
-As you wish.

1495
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:11,281
-Please come with me.
-But why?

1496
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:14,420
Well, I want to tell them
that I'm going to marry you.

1497
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,046
To see if they approve?

1498
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:19,388
And if they don't, to keep me
in the closet with that little hat

1499
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:22,053
that also did not fit in Brookhaven?

1500
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:27,530
I must go.

1501
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:42,207
You told me once I had too much character.

1502
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:45,410
I've changed my mind,
you haven't nearly enough.

1503
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:49,221
Then you wouldn't want to stay in any case.

1504
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:52,721
No, I wouldn't want to stay in any case.

1505
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:58,898
Well, thanks for a lovely statue, Mr. Corday.

1506
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,328
Consider it a going-away present,
Mayor Crandall.

1507
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,672
Thank you very much. There will be a check
mailed to you tomorrow.

1508
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:09,766
I'll add a small amount for amusement tax.

1509
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:41,364
Started to rain again.
Hasn't Diana come in yet?

1510
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:44,774
Why should she?
She's out with her man, isn't she?

1511
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:48,371
At least she's got sense enough
not to walk out on that.

1512
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:55,822
Would you like to play
some checkers or something?

1513
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:59,415
If we're going to rot here together,
we might as well be gay about it.

1514
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,724
I don't suppose you realize
that most women live eight lifetimes

1515
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:06,527
and don't get a chance at a fellow
like Georg Corday. You...

1516
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:09,831
-What are you crying about?
-I hate checkers.

1517
01:35:15,142 --> 01:35:17,736
-I'm sorry. I...
-It's all right.

1518
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:20,975
-I don't feel so good.
-Of course you don't.

1519
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:25,146
I don't know why.
I have everything just the way I wanted it.

1520
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:26,981
You're lying again.

1521
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:31,313
I know it. Oh, Father, isn't this ridiculous?

1522
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:32,951
It is.

1523
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:39,826
-I'm pretty annoyed at Jonathan, you know.
-At Jonathan?

1524
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:42,869
Yes, he shouldn't have
started something he couldn't finish.

1525
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,699
I never would have gone to New York
in the first place,

1526
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:46,796
would l, if he hadn't lost his head?

1527
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:50,308
Now he stands out there
like a Rock of Gibraltar.

1528
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:54,278
Lightning never strikes twice
in the same place, they tell me.

1529
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,944
Well...

1530
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,754
-What are you after?
-The checkers.

1531
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:08,752
I'll go.
The dike's probably got a hole in it again.

1532
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:14,701
All right! All right! I'm coming, I'm coming!

1533
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,927
What's the matter? What are you
trying to do? Break the door down?

1534
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:21,838
-Mr. Crandall!
-What is this?

1535
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:25,106
Almost killed me, Mr. Crandall.
We were just walking past,

1536
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:26,873
minding our own business, and wham!

1537
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:29,142
We don't like it, Mr. Crandall,
to happen twice.

1538
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,775
-It's like a curse or something.
-Yes.

1539
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:34,454
Do you think maybe it means
the Crandalls should let go?

1540
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,853
Well, it looks as if something bigger
than we are

1541
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,050
has got a hand in this, don't you think?

1542
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,458
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

1543
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:48,199
It would probably be downright dangerous
for me to continue as mayor.

1544
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,701
No telling what might happen next.

1545
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,932
Well, that certainly is a most unselfish way
to look at it, Mrs... Your Honor.

1546
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,531
I suppose it's silly of us to
be so superstitious, but you...

1547
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,077
Oh, no. It's perfectly understandable.

1548
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:02,306
I wouldn't want the responsibility
of daring the supernatural.

1549
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,242
I'll resign immediately.

1550
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,615
Well, good night.

1551
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:08,949
-Good night.
-Good night.

1552
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:10,216
-Good night.
-Good night.

1553
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:12,485
-Good night. And thank you.
-Thanks for coming in...

1554
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:14,618
And thanks for everything!

1555
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:19,295
Who says there aren't
any miracles left in the world?

1556
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,095
Why, I'm free!

1557
01:37:22,236 --> 01:37:24,101
Father, I'm free!

1558
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,067
-Jessie!
-Oh, dear.

1559
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:29,165
It's all right! It's all right! Wax. Wax!

1560
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:30,805
I'm free!

1561
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:36,483
Jessie, we've just had a miracle.
You should've been here.

1562
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:39,745
-Oh, I saw him when he did it.
-Did what?

1563
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:42,550
-Who?
-The artist fellow, the night he left.

1564
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,056
He fixed it so it would fall off.

1565
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:46,854
He did?

1566
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,163
Well, what do you know about that!

1567
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,359
And you didn't say anything?

1568
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:57,732
Mrs. Crandall believes in miracles.
Let her, I say.

1569
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,063
She might not have gone, otherwise.

1570
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:03,837
Why, Jessie! You're a human being.

1571
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:07,379
That don't call for you to be insulting,
Mr. Crandall.

1572
01:38:23,931 --> 01:38:27,367
Jeepers, would you kindly whistle another
tune? That one's really getting me down.

1573
01:38:27,468 --> 01:38:30,869
Well, that's a coincidence.
It's getting me down, too.

1574
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,906
You've kind of lost your head
over that little mayor dame, haven't you?

1575
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:38,638
Well, she's the type of woman men seem to
lose their heads over, Miss Thorn.

1576
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:46,981
In fact, a certain man I know of
deliberately lost his head once,

1577
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:49,647
so that I would meet her in the first place.

1578
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,156
I don't get it.

1579
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:55,358
I don't blame you.
I didn't get it either the first time I heard it.

1580
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:58,363
But to show you how much
we want to believe in fairy tales,

1581
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:03,164
I even fixed it so that he would lose his head
again, hoping that might do it.
