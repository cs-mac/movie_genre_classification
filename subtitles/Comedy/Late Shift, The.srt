1
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,389
Woman: Come on! Come on!

2
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:21,191
[laughter]

3
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:29,766
[indistinct shouting]

4
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:34,032
[cheers and applause]

5
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,306
Team Heather by a hair!

6
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,141
[cheers and applause]

7
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:40,345
- What?
- No, we totally... we totally had that!

8
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:41,840
Hey, first rule of emergency medicine...

9
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,476
don't piss off the nurses.

10
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,777
- That breaks all ties.
- Oh, my God.

11
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,993
- I knew I should have been pushing.
- Oh, my God!

12
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,449
Hey, come on. Let me...
let me try that thing.

13
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:52,015
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,871
Let me try. Let me try.

15
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:54,364
All right, try to get
out of this choke hold.

16
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:55,814
Tell me when you think you got me.

17
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:57,523
Oh, uh, let me... oh, I got you.

18
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,692
[grunts]

19
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,160
Well, that was easy.

20
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,129
Yeah, I guess that's why
you fight MMA and I don't.

21
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,526
[grunts]

22
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,833
I have to say, as an administrator,

23
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,269
these shenanigans would
have driven me nuts.

24
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:12,608
I am having such a great time.

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,782
Who knew this ER could have
such a quiet night, huh?

26
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,933
- [conversations stop]
- Wh-What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,870
Don't... don't ever say the "Q" word.

28
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:20,976
- What, I just... 
- [stammers]

29
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,099
You don't talk about fight club,

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,200
you don't talk about a no-hitter,

31
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:27,093
and you never, ever mention
the "Q" word in an ER.

32
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:28,523
You will jinx it.

33
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,517
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

34
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:32,836
I didn't know!

35
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,991
Jordan: I haven't told my mom about us yet

36
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:37,253
because she doesn't understand
why I broke up with Scott

37
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:38,771
and she knows how hard it was for us

38
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:40,034
when you got back from the war.

39
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,434
She didn't like me before I went to war.

40
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,665
Hold on, did she really
like Scott that much?

41
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,552
W-well... [sighs] What can I say?

42
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,422
You know, he called her on mother's day.

43
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:52,627
Look, all I'm saying is that... [sighs]

44
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,869
If I tell her now <i>before</i> she leaves,

45
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,489
I'm not gonna get a moment's rest.

46
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:57,513
And to be honest with you,

47
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,432
I don't feel like dealing with her nagging.

48
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:02,095
So I just figured that
I would tell her after.

49
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,820
[pagers beeping]

50
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,276
- Someone said the "Q" word.
- [siren wails in distance]

51
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:07,763
Okay, team, so much for
coasting through the morning.

52
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,394
We have a multi-victim traffic collision,

53
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,800
stragglers filling the waiting room.

54
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,701
- What do you got?
- The first two were in a rollover MVA

55
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,383
when it slammed into
another vehicle in the rain.

56
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,149
- That vic's still on the scene.
- Okay, I got this.

57
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,752
First victim is 18 years old.

58
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,158
He has a deep gash to his left
thigh from the broken glass.

59
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,465
Me and Jordan in Trauma Two.

60
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,421
Victim two was a front-seat passenger.

61
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,725
She's a minor with
blunt-face and chest trauma.

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,635
- [groans]
- She has mild respiratory distress,

63
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:28,498
but her sats are holding.

64
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,816
Take the girl into Trauma
One. Krista, you're with me.

65
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,241
Paul and Drew, start working
through the waiting-room patients...

66
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,466
and, Drew, take Ragosa with you.

67
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,068
- Show him the ropes.
- Me? What? Why not Paul?

68
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:37,603
He's almost as green. You're not.

69
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,872
- Put the girl right here.
- Son of a bitch.

70
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:42,839
You know I can hear you, right?

71
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,426
Have fun with that.

72
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:46,250
[panting]

73
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,000
How's Taylor? Is she okay?

74
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,919
Ah, we're working on her in the other room.

75
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:51,662
But let's focus on you right now, okay?

76
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:53,452
I didn't even see the other car.

77
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,762
- Is that driver okay?
- Not here yet.

78
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,263
I'll get you an update when we have one.

79
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,618
Oh, okay, looks like he got
the femoral. I need more gauze.

80
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,755
Jordan, the third MVA
vic is two minutes out.

81
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:02,906
We got this. Go ahead.

82
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,437
All right, I'll send off a
type and cross for six units.

83
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:05,912
Get me a large BP cuff
to tourniquet the leg.

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,818
There's one in the next room.

85
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,331
[monitor beeping]

86
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:09,799
How's the boy?

87
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,992
Aah, femoral artery injury.
But TC's on the case.

88
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,748
- Here?
- The jaw's dislocated.

89
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:16,067
It's obstructing her breathing.

90
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,416
Intubation tray is ready.

91
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:18,498
- I don't think we'll need it.
- [wheezing]

92
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,222
If we can reduce the jaw,
breathing should be fine.

93
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:20,728
Just in the next room.

94
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:21,835
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay, thanks.

95
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,145
Gwen: 1, 2, 3.

96
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:26,727
Thank you. I've got it from here.

97
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,464
Is this the woman the kid's car ran into?

98
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,339
Yep, approximately 30-year-old female.

99
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,708
Tachy, but otherwise stable.

100
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,591
Paramedic on the scene
found her unconscious

101
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:34,954
with bleeding scalp lacerations.

102
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:37,660
- Doctor Chavez has been paged.
- Okay, thank you.

103
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,313
Okay, I need to tie this one off now.

104
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:43,933
- 4-0 Prolene.
- Okay.

105
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:45,182
- Oh, hey, Gwen.
- Jordan.

106
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,203
- Hey, Scott.
- 4-0 Prolene.

107
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:48,971
See you around, Jordan?

108
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,525
Joey's off on some family thing,

109
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:52,975
and I'm on call, so what do we got here?

110
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:56,209
Hemodynamically stable, but
came in with a scalp pumper.

111
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,496
I'm placing a purse-string suture,

112
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,921
which should do the trick.

113
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,496
It says here abdominal trauma.

114
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,015
Could be internal bleeding.
I'll check a fast scan.

115
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:04,020
Ultrasound, please.

116
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:05,321
Woman: Yes, Doctor.

117
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:08,376
Uh, Jordan?

118
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,459
She's pregnant?

119
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,775
Well, this just got a lot more complicated.

120
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,163
I'd say so.

121
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:15,264
- Krista, let's go!
- Done.

122
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,961
The tongue depressors
will protect your thumbs

123
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:18,742
from being bitten off,
but be careful, okay?

124
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,341
Taylor, you're gonna feel some pressure,

125
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,735
but it'll help you breathing, okay?

126
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,785
Just look at me, Taylor.
Everything's gonna be okay.

127
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:24,947
All right?

128
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,778
Place your thumbs along her bottom teeth,

129
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,609
then push inferior and posterior.

130
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,221
- [groaning]
- Slow and steady pressure.

131
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:32,346
- [screams]
- [rapid beeping]

132
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:33,696
Pulse ox is dropping.

133
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:34,578
Krista, you got to do this.

134
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,191
- Don't make me step in.
- Her jaw isn't moving.

135
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,060
Sats are down to 80.

136
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,203
You have to push harder.

137
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:40,098
- Now's not now the time to be polite.
- Okay.

138
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,942
- [crack]
- It moved! It moved!

139
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:43,815
[groans]

140
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,147
- [rapid beeping stops]
- Feels back in place.

141
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,095
- Sats are up to 95.
- Nice job, Krista.

142
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,689
- Let's get her to X-ray.
- How's my...

143
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,577
Don't talk, sweetie, okay?

144
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,915
Until we know your jaw's back in place.

145
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,052
- How's my husband?
- Your what?

146
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,415
My husband, Ryan. We
just got married tonight.

147
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,990
What are you, like 14, 15?

148
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,465
I just turned 16.

149
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,939
Do me a favor. Please don't
tell my dad about the marriage.

150
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,008
I don't think he's gonna be happy.

151
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:04,459
Yeah, that would be my guess.

152
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,747
Things are crazy in there. We got
to keep things running out here.

153
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,452
We just had two new patients come in.

154
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,401
We have one lady
complaining of a kidney stone

155
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,252
and an elderly woman with
an altered mental status.

156
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,956
Paul, you got the Queen
Mother. We got the kidney stone.

157
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:20,101
Wait, hold on... uh,
this isn't one of those

158
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:21,519

- You're a beautiful dancer.

312
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,012
Do you know how to rumba?

313
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,015
See what I mean? Here are her things.

314
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,416
I'll be checking in.

315
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:57,020
Mother, I'll be back in a few hours.

316
00:10:57,326 --> 00:11:01,491
Uh, this way, please. After you.

317
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,837
Mm, soft as a baby.

318
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,528
Gwen: What are you doing, cruising Tinder?

319
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,193
Yeah, I'm trying to get in
touch with Chloe's fiancé,

320
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:08,933
but I keep getting his voicemail.

321
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,283
I'm gonna have to get one of the nurses

322
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,608
to track him down for her.

323
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:13,020
Hey, let me do it.

324
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:15,103
They're still working.
I just got off my shift.

325
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,559
You don't want to go home?

326
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,007
To an empty apartment?

327
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,677
I'd rather stay and help the pregnant girl.

328
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,517
Nice to know someone
who's getting laid, huh?

329
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:24,614
- All right, thank
you. - Mm-hmm.

330
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,035
All right, now I would like
you to follow my finger, okay?

331
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:33,906
All right, and now... 
a-and repeat after me.

332
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:36,075
"No ifs, ands, or buts."

333
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,012
No ifs, and you have a nice butt.

334
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,212
[both laugh] Okay, all right.

335
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:44,850
Let's, uh... let's try
and focus, all right? Okay.

336
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,685
Um, name as many animals as you can

337
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,120
in 30 seconds, all right?

338
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,955
And... Go.

339
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,290
- Zebra.
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,092
Coyote. Coyote.

341
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:57,329
I suppose you're too young
to remember Wile E. Coyote.

342
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:58,530
No, I'm actually... I-I...

343
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:01,200
always trying to catch
that damn roadrunner,

344
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,903
but he never could.

345
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,638
Beep, beep! That's the
sound Road Runner made.

346
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:06,939
- Beep, beep!
- [laughs]

347
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:08,610
- Beep, beep!
- All right. No, I... no, I get it.

348
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,073
- I... that's sweet. Yeah.
- Oh, but I like it.

349
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,510
How's it going teaching Ragosa?

350
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:14,351
Ohh, if it was any other
physician's assistant,

351
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:15,588
I wouldn't mind babysitting.

352
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,069
But that guy, he's always
been such a pain in our asses.

353
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,456
Oh, come on. He's not that bad.

354
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,353
You just have to get to know him.

355
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,355
Yeah, that's right on
the top of my to-do list.

356
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:24,866
Hey, Jordan?

357
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,556
So, that cell number that Chloe gave us

358
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:29,726
is still going to voicemail.

359
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,276
I left a message to call,
but there's also no record

360
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,066
of Chloe's fiancé ever being at Ramstein.

361
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:34,901
Never heard of him.

362
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,251
Well, maybe the guy wanted
out, so he just lied.

363
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:39,007
Wouldn't be the first
time someone got scared off

364
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,845
by a baby or lied about
ending a relationship.

365
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:45,829
My gut tells me that's not the case.

366
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,611
Uh, why don't you try calling
Fort Hood and see if...

367
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,080
If he was deployed in the Middle East.

368
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:49,893
I know right where you're headed.

369
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,417
- Thank you.
- [clicks tongue]

370
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,468
Hey, Scott.

371
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:55,328
- Hmm?
- Uh, do we need to talk?

372
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,946
'Cause I feel like you're taking
these not-so-subtle jabs at me.

373
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,157
No. No, no, no. Not at all.

374
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:02,036
No, no, I was...

375
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:05,326
I was talking about Chloe
and her situation, not ours.

376
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,639
Look, was I pissed at first? Yes, I was.

377
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,158
Was I hurt? Yeah.

378
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,871
But trust me, I am more than fine

379
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,736
with how everything's worked out, okay?

380
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,104
- Okay.
- Okay.

381
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,646
I'll go page OB for you.

382
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:18,490
Thank you.

383
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,096
- [monitor beeping]
- [sighing]

384
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,762
Hey. Look who's awake.

385
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:26,620
How are you feeling?

386
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,563
Terrible. How's my wife, Taylor?

387
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:33,278
You wife is getting some tests.

388
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,013
And just so you know,
your parents are here.

389
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,048
And her dad.

390
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,925
Nobody seemed particularly happy.

391
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:40,193
- Her dad?
- Yeah.

392
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,954
He just hates me because we're rich.

393
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,238
Well, I don't think your marriage

394
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,891
is gonna do your case any favors.

395
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,159
[door opens]

396
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,161
- Is this Ryan Harrison?
- Yeah.

397
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,996
Yeah, he's stable. You can talk to him.

398
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,080
[police radio chatter] Just
for a few minutes, though.

399
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,967
Uh, Officer, this is my son.

400
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,526
It was my car that he wrecked in the crash.

401
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:58,588
Uh, here's our insurance
card. Anything else you need?

402
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,505
I'm not here about the car.

403
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,671
Ryan Harrison, you are under arrest
for the sexual assault of a minor.

404
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:04,664
Get those off my boy.

405
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,564
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Get those off me. You can't arrest me.

406
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,251
- We're married. It's not illegal.
- Anything you do say can and will be used

407
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,944
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hang on.
- against you in the court of law.

408
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,499
- What's going on?
- Dad, help me! Get these off me!

409
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,585
You have a right to an attorney. If you
cannot afford an attorney, one will be

410
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:13,853
provided to you. Do you understand
these rights as I have read them to you?

411
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,659
Please! Dad, she's my wife! Help me.

412
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:19,500
- Ow! Ow! My baby!
- What happened?

413
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:20,681
I'm not sure. I found her like this.

414
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:23,081
It's my stomach! [Crying]

415
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:24,787
Hey, Kenny, start her on morphine.

416
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,257
Chloe? Chloe, these are contractions.

417
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:29,145
- You're in labor.
- No, no, no!

418
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:30,977
It's not... it's not time.
It's too early for the baby.

419
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,895
We can try to slow the contractions down.

420
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,838
But, honey, worst case,

421
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,839
your baby's far enough along to be viable.

422
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,033
- No.
- All right, morphine's in.

423
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,509
- Thank you.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

424
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,016
- Why is this happening?
- Okay.

425
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,078
Look, I promised my dad

426
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,521
I'd be married before I had the baby.

427
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:44,869
I'm sure he'll understand.

428
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,331
No! He died last month!

429
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,362
Look, I can't break my promise to him!

430
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:50,862
Please, it would crush my mom!

431
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:53,730
Chloe, I am so sorry.

432
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,809
Honey, the best thing you can do right now

433
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,467
is try to focus on staying calm,

434
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,436
'cause that's what's best
for you and your baby.

435
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,027
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay?

436
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:03,106
- Kenny, start a mag sulfate infusion.
- On it.

437
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:04,845
[crying] I don't want to do this alone.

438
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:07,077
You're gonna be great. It's okay.

439
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:09,892
Now, Deputy, you don't need
to escalate this, all right?

440
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,823
He just wants to know what's
happening with his son.

441
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,605
He's an 18-year-old having
sex with a 15-year-old.

442
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:14,660
She's 16.

443
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,666
Oh, and that makes it okay for you?

444
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,435
You son of a bitch. You
did this, didn't you?

445
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:18,411
You're damn right I did.

446
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:21,018
I told you to keep your
son away from my daughter.

447
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,155
And you wouldn't, so I will.

448
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,067
- This will ruin Ryan's life.
- His life?

449
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:27,129
His life is set! He's got
a BMW and a trust fund.

450
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,813
My Taylor was at the top of
her class until she started

451
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,263
- running around with your son.
- Whoa, whoa, <i>she's</i> chasing <i>him!</i>

452
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,370
And he quit the baseball team
'cause of your little gold digger.

453
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:34,885
- Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- [indistinct shouting]

454
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,623
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

455
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:37,530
- Hey, hey!
- Cool it.

456
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:40,246
Okay, okay, fighting is not
gonna make your kids any better.

457
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,024
Topher: This is the second
ruckus you guys have started.

458
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,386
If it happens again, I'm
booting you both. You understand?

459
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:45,992
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
and this is gonna end.

460
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:47,618
You've gone too far, Sawyer. You're done!

461
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,661
Your money's not gonna
help you this time, dick.

462
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,693
Okay, Mr Sawyer, I
understand why you're upset.

463
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:54,461
Do you have a daughter?

464
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,629
No.

465
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,297
- But...
- Then you have no idea.

466
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,999
She's all I have left.

467
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,204
Mr Sawyer.

468
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,506
Why don't you wait in the waiting room?

469
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,342
- That sounded intense.
- Yeah.

470
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,811
- Young love, Texas style.
- All right.

471
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,479
Hey, do you have a minute to do me a favor?

472
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,647
Yeah, sure. What's up?

473
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,587
Well, my pregnant
patient is so stressed-out

474
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:17,118
about having her baby before she's married

475
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,485
that her BP is off the charts,

476
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,287
which just complicated premature labor.

477
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:21,788
- Yeah, that's not good.
- No.

478
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:24,247
And Gwen found out that her fiancé lied

479
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:25,592
about being stationed in Germany

480
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,594
and he's really in Afghanistan.

481
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,396
He told her that so she wouldn't worry.

482
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,236
- Sound familiar?
- No.

483
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:33,400
I mean, I was gonna tell you eventually...

484
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:34,409
When I got back.

485
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,685
And I figured out where you
were in less than a week.

486
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:38,906
- Anyway... oh, thank you.
- Here's the list.

487
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,854
Uh, we've managed to track down his unit,

488
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,648
but we've been unable to reach him.

489
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,366
So I was wondering if maybe you could ask

490
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:45,836
one of your army buddies to help out.

491
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,136
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tee?

492
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,248
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah.

493
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,918
Yeah, yeah. Coming.
Uh, yeah, I can do that.

494
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,466
Thank you. I owe you one.

495
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,429
Yeah. What you got, Toph?

496
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,726
Oh, having seconds thoughts?

497
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:02,062
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

498
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,508
I just didn't know that he
was seeing someone so soon.

499
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:07,820
Really? Oh, by the way, your mom called me.

500
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,646
She wanted to know the real
reason why you guys broke up.

501
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,138
Well, what did you tell her?

502
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:12,973
The truth.

503
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,108
Herpes.

504
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,366
I didn't say who had it.

505
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,834
- [chuckles]
- You're a horrible friend.

506
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:20,681
You know that, right?

507
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,983
Topher: Mr Sawyer, the
sheriff called me himself,

508
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:25,196
telling me to remove the cuffs immediately

509
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,542
and... and to apologize.

510
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,827
That deputy who did this
is being reprimanded.

511
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:29,908
He was enforcing the law.

512
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:31,892
He was enforcing your revenge.

513
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,308
Apparently, in Texas,

514
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:35,182
there's something called
The Romeo and Juliet Law,

515
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,251
which allows for consensual intercourse

516
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:38,826
with a minor within three years of age.

517
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,163
It's... it's not illegal.

518
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:41,769
TC: We heard the deputy was your buddy,

519
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,794
and that's why you did it.

520
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,422
He did it because we served together.

521
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:46,222
We'd do anything for each other.

522
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:48,040
Look, I get that.

523
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,958
With all due respect, boys...

524
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,319
Hey, I did three tours in the sandbox.

525
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,798
Rangers. Doctor Zia here did two.

526
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,734
I thought you were just doctors.

527
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,068
You sound like
my mother-in-law.

528
00:17:58,104 --> 00:17:59,779
Where were you?

529
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,115
[sighs] Paktika, Helmand, Gawardesh.

530
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:04,398
[scoffs]

531
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,366
I spent some time in
Helmand I'd like to forget.

532
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,269
Two... two long deployments, you know.

533
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,170
I come back the second time...

534
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,406
my daughter is living with friends.

535
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,074
My wife, gone.

536
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,709
Didn't want to be a wife anymore,

537
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:18,400
or a mom, or... just gone.

538
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,955
I'm sorry. That's... that's rough.

539
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,129
You know, sometimes, it's, uh...

540
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,138
it's harder coming back
than it is being there.

541
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,406
Yeah, yeah. [Sniffles]

542
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,345
That's true. Yeah.

543
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:31,779
And... and now I work
these two crap jobs to...

544
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:35,264
just to keep her in that
school so she's got a future.

545
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,702
I'm not gonna let that punk ruin it.

546
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,022
Why don't we get some coffee?

547
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,587
And I'll... I'll get an update
on your daughter's scans.

548
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,311
- We can talk it out.
- Great, right. Thanks, doc.

549
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:49,505
Right.

550
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,746
Drew: So, what's your assessment?

551
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,849
32-year-old female
with colicky flank pain

552
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,226
and large blood in her urinalysis,

553
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,371
which indeed points to a kidney stone.

554
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,154
I ordered her a CT, some IV fluids,

555
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,256
and I was gonna give her
pain meds for the discomfort.

556
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,526
How about a band-aid?

557
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:08,020
- Band-aid? - Your
finger, please.

558
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:10,558
The other finger.

559
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,001
She pricks her finger,
puts a few drops of blood

560
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:16,455
in the urine sample to make it look like

561
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:18,180
a kidney stone so she can get narcotics.

562
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:21,599
I cut this on a magazine. I saw you
in here last month trying to same gag,

563
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
and I remember you 'cause you
were wearing a Lakers T-shirt

564
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,554
and I hate the Lakers.

565
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,112
Stop wasting our time. You understand me?

566
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:29,287
We got real patients. Get some help.

567
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:30,887
If you had checked the chart,
you would have found she's been

568
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:33,137
in here a ton of times
trying to get narcotics.

569
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,569
Things often aren't what they seem.

570
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:39,069
So, my brother... and
he's a platoon leader.

571
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,062
So he... he yells up, "hey, hey, I got him!

572
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:42,438
I smoked... I smoked his ass!"

573
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:45,138
So we run down there, right,
just making sure it's all clear.

574
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,828
And he smoked him, all right,
except it wasn't Taliban.

575
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,379
No? It was a cow.

576
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:50,593
A cow? Yeah.

577
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,949
It was the first steak we
had in about six months.

578
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,240
And after that, Thad was
forever known as "Smoke."

579
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,253
"Lord Smoke."

580
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,132
[both laugh]

581
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,513
Yeah.

582
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,650
How's your brother doing?

583
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:02,640
- Is he... is he still in?
- No, no.

584
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,094
No. No, no. No, no. H-he was KIA.

585
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:09,065
- [sighs]
- I'm sorry.

586
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,868
Nah. [Scoffs] It's cool.

587
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,559
Were you over there when that happened?

588
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,671
Yeah, yeah.

589
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:17,674
I... I was about 15 feet
from him when it happened.

590
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,477
[chuckles]

591
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,844
- What are you gonna do?
- Oh, my God.

592
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:23,881
[sighs]

593
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,686
Let me ask you something.

594
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,415
How are you so together?

595
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,842
Nah, I'm not together,
man. It's still a struggle.

596
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:36,010
- [chuckles]
- Ah. You got a good job, right?

597
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:36,960
You got a good woman?

598
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,900
Yeah, the best.

599
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,300
You marry her?

600
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:42,050
Almost. Almost.

601
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,518
I-I planned on asking her
when I got back from the war,

602
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,661
and then everything went to hell.

603
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,640
I'd say you got it pretty well together.

604
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,965
Me? I-I'm back two years.

605
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:55,428
I... I can't seem to get ahead.

606
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:56,528
Like quicksand, you know.

607
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,703
I get myself out and, uh, you
know, I'm right back in it.

608
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:04,328
Over there, I was a leader of men.

609
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,987
- Yeah.
- I was kicking down doors, taking names.

610
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:12,824
I wore the uniform proud, you know?

611
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:15,487
I mean, look at the uniform I wear now.

612
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,140
I'm a joke.

613
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:17,862
No.

614
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,812
It took me a few years to get where I'm at.

615
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:24,473
I was a mess.

616
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:25,808
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

617
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,976
And the only thing that turned it around

618
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:30,145
was... was me asking for help.

619
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,945
Well... Who am I gonna ask, you know?

620
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:38,787
I mean, Taylor, I can't talk
to her. She's just a kid.

621
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,790
There's a lot of programs that can help.

622
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,692
You got to turn it around, man.

623

But <i> you </i> got to ask for it.

628

And then, I-if they offer
it, you got to take it.

629
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm offering.

630
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:13,956
So just... just take it.

631
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,759
Okay.

632
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,027

00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,771
- Okay. Have you heard anything?
- About Ryan?

638
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:33,367
Yeah, he's resting comfortably.
He's no longer under arrest.

639
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,244
And, yes, he's been asking about you.

- Head CT looked good.

Her others scans are coming up shortly.

- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:42,364
I don't want to talk to you.

Taylor, I love you. I'm
trying to protect you.

It looks like a heart attack.

Her aorta's tearing in half.

00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,262
You saw an old lady

780
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,795
and never thought of the possibility,

781
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,299
though I was exhibiting
all of the behavior.

782
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,802
Look, I-I-I need
to tell your son.

783
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,285
He's been all over me
about what's wrong with you.

784
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:58,512
There's nothing wrong with me.

785
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:00,200
A little advice, Paul.

786
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:03,407
Don't try to so hard to please everybody.

787
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:09,300
You know, you'll only end up with regrets.

788
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:18,886
W... hey, hey, you... you can't do that.

789
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:19,836
Not here.

790
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,679
Why do you think I wanted privacy?

791
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,722
Besides, you gonna stop me?

792
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:30,291
You want a hit?

793
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,241
N-no, thank you.

794
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:33,442
Go ahead.

795
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:36,044
Your father would be very disappointed.

796
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,880
- Wait, what? How do... how do you... 
- Know your father?

797
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,115
What do you think?

798
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,853
Called me last year about your internship.

799
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,522
He... he got me in here?

800
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,762
Actually, he wanted us to keep you out.

801
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:01,623
You know, h-he still
calls me once a month,

802
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:03,775
trying to get me to quit ER.

803
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,382
He says one day I can join

804
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:07,251
him and my brother's practice in Chicago.

805
00:29:07,252 --> 00:29:08,969
And why don't you?

806
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,503
'Cause I don't want to follow anybody.

807
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:13,037
The real reason.

808
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:18,707
[sniffs]

809
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:23,379
Uh, what if... what if
I'm... I'm not good enough?

810
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:27,611
Maybe... maybe I'm Peyton Manning, right?

811
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:31,205
But maybe I'm Jeffrey Jordan.

812
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:32,562
Th-those are the sons of...

813
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:33,824
I know who they are.

814
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:35,057
Okay.

815
00:29:35,227 --> 00:29:36,969
Now, look, I know I'm buzzed,

816
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,863
but I'm gonna give you
one last piece of advice.

817
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:46,545
Now, even though I was the
black sheep of the family,

818
00:29:46,546 --> 00:29:48,619
I still never followed my heart.

819
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,410
I did what they wanted me to.

820
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:58,276
So you figure out what you want to do.

821
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:02,362
Not from fear, but for the right reasons.

822
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:08,375
And they can go to hell
if they get in your way.

823
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:10,737
[chuckles]

824
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:15,204
[inhales deeply] Thank you.

825
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:18,349
I will.

826
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:24,278
Now... Here's what we're gonna tell my son.

827
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,152
[flatline] Ragosa: Hey, you paged me?

828
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:27,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

829
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,091
I'm not falling for this
crap again, okay, Drew?

830
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:31,085
This is real. You want to learn something?

831
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:33,685
Grab that crash cart. This is Mr Simpson.

832
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:36,546
He came in with a heart
attack, went into v-fib arrest.

833
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:38,598
Now, hit "power." Set the voltage to 360.

834
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:40,467
- [beep]
- Press "charge."

835
00:30:40,502 --> 00:30:42,135
Okay.

836
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:44,471
- [paddles whine]
- This is all you.

837
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:45,799
B-but I've never done this before.

838
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,058
Then it's gonna be a hell of
a good time to learn, isn't it?

839
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,002
Set the paddles at 10:00 and 5:00.

840
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:52,384
Okay. Okay, like this?

841
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:53,893
Yeah, everybody clear.

842
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,028
- Go.
- [thump]

843
00:30:57,432 --> 00:30:58,431
- Still v-fib.
- [flatline]

844
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,599
What are you gonna do?

845
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,968
Okay, uh, charging again.

846
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:03,269
[paddles whine]

847
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:04,804
- [beeping]
- Clear.

848
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,973
[thump]

849
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,509
- [monitor beeping]
- Oh, man, that's sinus.

850
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,813
- I can feel a pulse.
- Yes, it is.

851
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:16,649
Hang an amiodarone drip.
Get him to the cath lab.

852
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:18,952
Woman: Okay, right away.

853
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:20,534
Oh, holy cow.

854
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:21,903
- That man was... 
- ... dead.

855
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:23,859
And now he isn't.

856
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,927
Congratulations. You just saved his life.

857
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:30,563
Thanks.

858
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,399
It turns out she just had low blood sugar.

859
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,707
I-I gave her IV dextrose.

860
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,419
And here's a list of dietary adjustments.

861
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:37,645
That's all? I mean, she was...

862
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,272
Get the car.

863
00:31:39,301 --> 00:31:41,125
- Doctor Zia?
- Topher: Yes, Ma'am?

864
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:43,750
Are you aware of what a remarkable

865
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:45,359
young doctor you have here?

866
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,982
I expect him to be made
an attending physician

867
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:51,651
at this institution one day very soon

868
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:54,888
in whatever specialty he pursues.

869
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,434
How did you pull that off?

870
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:11,604
Uh, it must be my wonderful
bedside manner, I-I guess.

871
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,941
[monitor beeping]

872
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,110
I love you, baby. [Chuckles]

873
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,779
<i>You look so beautiful.</i>

874
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,781
Hey. You paged me?

875
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,117
Uh, yeah. We're all set here.

876
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,953
We just need an in-person
proxy groom to read the vows.

877
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,455
- [chuckles]
- You game?

878
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,824
Sure. Why not? I got a few minutes.

879
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:31,891
- Good man.
- Thank you.

880
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:34,963
Of course. Tom, I'm Doctor Callahan.

881
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:36,729
It is an honor to stand
in for you, Sergeant.

882
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,763
<i>The honor's mine. I
can't thank you enough</i>

883
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,333
<i>for making this wedding
happen, Doctors.</i>

884
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:42,123
Can't get married without a bouquet.

885
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:43,636
[laughing] Why, thank you.

886
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:45,972
Are you ready?

887
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,141
Yes, I'm ready.

888
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,809
Dearly beloved,

889
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,136
we are gathered together
here in the sight of God

890
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,555
- to join together in holy matrimony... 
- [gasping]

891
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,949
- ... Chloe and Tom.
- [rapid beeping]

892
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:57,181
Jordan: Baby's having accelerations.

893
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,844
- I'm feeling short of breath.
- All right, that's it.

894
00:32:58,845 --> 00:32:59,651
We're getting her to the OR.

895
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:01,988
- <i>What's happening? Chloe?</i>
- Sorry, Daddy. Baby, I'm sorry.

896
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,066
This ain't over yet,
sweetie. Okay, somebody

897
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,429
- tell the OB we're on our way.
- <i>Okay, what is... </i>

898
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,891
- <i>w-where are you taking her?</i>
- Reverend, skip to the good stuff

899
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,053
- and try to keep up.
- <i>Somebody talk to me.</i>

900
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,437
I've never done anything like this.

901
00:33:09,438 --> 00:33:11,387
Move it along, Padre.
You got about 15 seconds.

902
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:12,650
- <i>Chloe, are you okay?</i>
- Do you take this woman to be your

903
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:13,707
- wedded wife?
- I do.

904
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,099
Do you take this man to
be your wedded husband?

905
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,046
- I do.
- <i>Chloe?</i>

906
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:17,471
- She does.
- Then I pronounce you man and wife.

907
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:18,772
BP's down to 40 systolic.

908
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:19,907
<i>Chloe, I love you.</i>

909
00:33:20,222 --> 00:33:22,189
- Gwen: Jordan!
- She's hemorrhaging!

910
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,176
We can't get her to the OR
we got to do it down here.

911
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,870
Trauma One. Let's go.

912
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,119
The baby's heart rate is still down.

913
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:32,596
Opening the peritoneum.

914
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:36,165
Two units of blood are in.

915
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:38,546
Well, this is a hell of a honeymoon.

916
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,139
Any word from OB? Scalpel.

917
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,508
She has her hands full with
a uterine rupture upstairs.

918
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:43,473
Glad we got started.

919
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:45,341
Incising the uterus.

920
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:48,320
Hey, setting up the Skype
with the father in 15 minutes.

921
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:49,189
Anything I can tell him?

922
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,013
Yeah, I'll have the story
for him in about five seconds.

923
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:52,982
- You want to watch?
- Yeah.

924
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,106
There we go.

925
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:57,487
Here she comes.

926
00:33:57,522 --> 00:34:00,310
[baby crying]

927
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:02,158
All right.

928
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:04,286
You tell them, sweetie.

929
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,845
Topher: Cutting the cord.

930
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:14,796
My... my... how's my baby girl?

931
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:18,771
She's beautiful, just like
her mother and her doctor.

932
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,278
I think he was talking about himself.

933
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,645
Yeah, I'm sure he was.

934
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:23,013
[laughter]

935
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:25,401
[voice breaking] Sorry, I just love babies.

936
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:27,818
- And weddings.
- [chuckles]
