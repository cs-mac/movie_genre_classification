That's not a trumpet.

That's not a trumpet.

Boys. Time to get up. Come on.

33
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,500
It's Saturday. We've got to get going.

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,020
- Where are we going?
- We're going to see my uncle Joe.

35
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,580
What? I don't want to go to Uncle Joe's!

36
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,660
- Come here!
- I don't wanna go!

37
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,860
No, I want to watch my cartoons!
It's Saturday!

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,300
You can't make us! We don't wanna go!

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
- Stop it!
- No, we don't wanna go!

40
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,340
We'll be good! We'll eat anything.
We'll clean our room. But no Uncle Joe.

41
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,340
Come on.We don't have time for this.

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,380
- Leave us alone!
- You wouldn't hurt Daddy.

43
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,100
- It's still pretty early, Carl.
- I want to get there first.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,540
If we dont  get there first, whoever does gets
there first talks about you before u get there
until there's no point you even being there.

45
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,980
Which reminds me. Try to bring up
my cousin Tina's drinking.

46
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,780
- She's your cousin.
- You're better at it, more subtle.

Carl and Nora McTeague.

Welcome to hell.

50
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,380
- Are we first, Douglas?
- Indeed, sir.

51
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,300
No one else had the presence of mind
to be three hours early.

52
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,180
- May I take your bird, madam?
- No, thank you Douglas, we'll give it to him ourselves.

53
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,620
- Would u care to wait in the drawing-room?
- Thank u.

54
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,380
- There was another car out front. Who...?
- Dr Hemmel is with your uncle.

55
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,980
Ooh, anything wrong?

56
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,060
Your uncle has some congestion and
he was coughing most of the night, sir.

57
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,020
What kind of cough? Was it dry or liquidy?
I mean...

58
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,500
It was just a cough, sir.
Next time I'll save you a sample.

[plopping sound]

He'll really like the bird I think.

61
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,580
- It cost us $400, Carl.
- You have to spend money to make money.

62
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,100
- Oh, my heavens!
- Yolanda, what's wrong?

63
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,620
He's dead!

64
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,100
One minute the doctor was examining him
and he say he was fine, and then...

65
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,260
- He's dead.
- Come quickly!

66
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,020
Yes!

67
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,340
- [boy] Are we rich?
- [Carl] Maybe.

Yolanda, go clean something.

Stop that!

72
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,500
It's Dr Hemmel!

73
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,060
Of course it's Dr Hemmel.

74
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,020
He used to brag how he got up at 5am
to play racket-ball at 71 years old.

75
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,500
You don't hear him bragging now.

[Uncle Joe chuckles]

77
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,220
Truth be known, we are so relieved.

78
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,060
When Yolanda came in screaming,
we thought...

79
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,660
Well, all I can say is we're glad
you're still with us, Uncle Joe.

80
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,700
- You look thrilled.
- We are. Especially the boys. Joe and Joe.

81
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,340
Look, another little Joe in the oven.
Here's a doctor's note to prove it.

82
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,660
- You look nice, Nora.
- Thanks, Uncle Joe. So do you.

83
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,380
- Why don't we just cut the cable?
- It's too thick. Come on.

84
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,180
Did you hear that? He said you look nice.

85
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,180
- I think that's a good sign. Dont u?
- I don't know what to think.

86
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,980
Carl, I want a girl, honey.

87
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,340
All right. I swear, after he's dead
we'll have a girl, I promise. OK?

88
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,700
Uncle Joe?
Wanted to tell you about something.

89
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,380
You should see how Big Joe...our Big Joe,

90
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,500
what a head for business he has
at nine years old.

91
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,740
He organised a lawn-mowing company
with fourth-graders.

92
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,300
He's preparing himself in case he has to
take over a big business some day.

93
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,460
So you're interested in money, huh?

94
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,140
Uh-huh. Made ten bucks just coming here.

95
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,740
I get another 20 if I kiss you.

96

I'm thinking about it.

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,020
All right.

98
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,140
That's it.

99
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,860
- What happened? Is he...?
- Coronary. He died instantly.

100
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,700
- Really? You mean just...?
- And he left everything to you, sis.

101
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,500
- Really?
- It wasn't him. It was Dr Hemmel.

102
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,060
You son of a bitch.

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,700

- I did. Now I wish it was you.

- How are your girls, Ed?
- Yes, we have girls. You know why?

105
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,220
We wouldn't put Ed's sperm in a centrifuge
to separate the X's from the Y's!

Excuse me brother, no matter how much
Uncle Joe is worth,

Make me.

- Are you retarded?
- Not according to the tests.

He didn't want you to get sick.

119
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,300
Ed, your girls knocked over some milk.

120
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,180
Well, Uncle Joe, I guess
you'll have to find a new doctor.

121
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,940
What for? Doctors, medicine.
Who needs 'em, huh uncle Joe!

122
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,380
You know who you should talk to
about this? Glen.

123
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,140
This man keeps himself in shape. It's discipline.

124
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,900
I exercise for a couple of weeks, that's it.
I cant stick with it, I admire you Glen.

125
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,060
Well, you know...

126
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,820
Will you be able to fit all your exercise equipment
into your new apartment?

127
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,100
Frank!

128
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,700
- What new apartment?
- Glen and Muriel are separa...

129
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,060
You're keeping that a secret. I feel horrible.

130
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,620
- I could cut out my tongue.
- Here's a knife.

131
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,140
- No, really, I'm...
- You split up?

132
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,300
No.

133
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,740
- No!
- No!

134
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,980
- Then why...?
- It's...

135
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,140
You know I'm starting that new business?
Well, it takes a lot of time and energy,

136
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,980
and when I'm with J... Muriel, I just...

137
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,980
I am so crazy about her
that all I can think about is...

138
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,740
- You know.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,580
So I thought I'd move out for a while
and I'd be able to get some work done.

140
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,980
[flatulence sounds]

141
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,820
Anyway Glen it's nobody's business what you two do.
I mean you have no kids. You're both barren.

142
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,340
Frank, I almost forgot to ask you.
How is Tina's hit-and-run case coming?

143
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,580
- Hit-and-run case?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,180
You remember when Tina got drunk
and ploughed into that school bus?

145
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,220
Ploughed? She just scraped paint off it.

146
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,580
The brakes failed. Everyone was fine.
The kids, the nuns.

147
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,940
I just thank God she wasn't in one of
those little sports cars like your girlfriend's.

148
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,580
- They're death-traps.
- What?

149
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,540
His girlfriend drives a Chrysler.
Big blue one.

150
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,460
She's not my girlfriend!

151
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,580
She's an instructor at the gym. I met...

152
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,260
I left my gym bag at the gym
and she was bringing it back to me.

153
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,620
I guess you have time to notice
these things Ed now that you're not working.

154
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,620
What happened?

155
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,500
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

156
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,460
There was sort of a little cutback at Ed's place.

157
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,460
They let go of some of the employees
that were...

158
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,940
Selling company secrets and selling them
to competitors. Pass the butter, please.

159
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,020
That's a lie and I'll prove it in court!

160
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,060
- This Friday, right?
- We got a continuance.

161
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,460
The court dockets were too filled
with drunk-driving cases.

162
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,660
I skidded on a wet spot!

163
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,940
- Somebody get her a drink.
- A drink? Somebody get her a barrel.

164
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,260
Please everyone. Why must this happen
every time we get together?

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,460
Can't this man have peace?
Hasn't he earned it?

166
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,780
Delivering newspapers when he was four years old,
his little toes frozen because he didnt have any shoes.

167
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,860
- It's all right.
- No, its not alright. It's like we've lost our sense of values.

168
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,340
Maybe it's not mine to say, but
Nora and I... Come up here, sweetie...

169
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,740
and Joseph and Jonas and little Josiah
on the way...we lead a simple life.

170
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,820
We have each other,
and I ask u what the heck else is there?

171
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,300
Joe-Joe, I'm just going to the market.

172
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,460
Oh!

173
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,260
Molly! Come here.

174
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,180
These are my nieces and nephews.
Everyone, this is Molly.

175
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,820
- Hi!
- Hi.

176
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,460
- Douglas said you wanted to see me?
- If you're going to the market we are out of Oreos?

177
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,540
We wouldn't be out of Oreos
if somebody hadn't eaten the insides

178
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,660
and tossed the rest away,
you naughty boy.

179
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,700
I'm old and rich.
I'll eat whatever parts I want.

180
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,900
- If I want to eat the goddamn box, I will eat the goddamn box.
- Who wound you up today?

181
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,180
- Better give me some money, then.
- Here.

182
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,620
Take an extra hundred.
You might see something you want.

183
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,900
You are such a dear.

184
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,900
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

185
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,060
Toodles!

186
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,540
These are good melons. Yeah.

187
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,660
Sweet, juicy.

188
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,220
- Uncle Joe?
- Mm?

189
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,100
- Who...?
- Mm?

190
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,700
- Who...?
- Oh, that's Molly. She's living here.

191
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,180
Housekeeper? Secretary?

192
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,140
Well, not exactly. She's sort of...my nurse.

193
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,820
- Nurse?
- Yeah. I decided I wanted a nurse.

194
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,980
Someone to ease my suffering.

195
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,860
An agency sent her?

196
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,220
No, she delivered a pizza one night
and we got to talking.

197
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,220
Turns out she'd like to be a nurse, so...
Yeah, she helps out in various ways.

198
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,260
She's become very special to me.

199
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,620
[cheering]

200
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,300
Yeah!

201
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,420
[inaudible]

202
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,100
Good...

203
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,540
See u later.

204
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,500
Thank you, Fred.
Hello, everyone. I'm Chris Schenkel.

205
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,100
Thank you. Thank you very much.

206
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,260
On behalf of the Pro Bowlers Tour,

207
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,900
we'd like to thank all the good people
of Milwaukee for their support.

208
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,740
The top five qualifiers tomorrow
will begin play at 2.30.

209
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,420
Shit.

210
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,940
[female] You do this every time!
You ruin every vacation we have evr been on.

211
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,780
- [male] Shut up!
- [female] It's always the same ''Let's drive a little further.''

212
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,580
[female] Then there's no place to stay
and we wind up in a shithole like this!

213
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,580
This is...this is unbelievable.

214
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,740
Everywhere I stay, I'm next to this couple.

215
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,300
[crockery smashes]

216
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,060
Not literally them,
but people just like them.

217
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,180
- It's like a franchise.
- [male] You made my life a living hell!

218
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,420
- [female] Kiss my ass!
- [male] That would take all night!

219
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,580
[door slams]

220
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,460
Oh, God.

221
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,260
You know, this is really stupid.

222
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,180
ABC gives me a suite at the Marriott
and we're at the Bates Motel.

223
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,660
Let's get out of here.

224
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,220
Honey, you know
I get embarrassed at your hotel.

225
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,940
Everyone always says, ''How's a schlep
like McTeague afford a room at the Marriott?''

226
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,340
''Oh dont you know he sleeps with Robin Hunter,
the producer of the telecast.''

227
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,420
''Really? He must screw better
than he bowls.''

228
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,900
I do, don't I?

229
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,540
I can't take it, Robin. I can't do it any more.

230
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,820
What?

231
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,780
- I'm giving up bowling.
- Why?

232
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,340
My wrist. It's a pre-arthritic condition
and it's not going to get better.

233
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,540
- You saw a doctor?
- No, Al the janitor at the bowling alley examined it.

234
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,620
He seemed to know what he was talking about
and took me right away.

235
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,340
Of course I saw a doctor!

236
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,460
I don't know. Cincinnati's
the last tournament of the season.

237
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,860
I'm just going to bowl there and...that's it.

238
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Sweetheart.

239
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,260
I'm sorry.

240
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,980
I just wish for once
I could've finished in the top five,

241
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,940
gotten on the national telecast just once.

242
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,100
That would have been nice.

243
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,900
- What are you going to do?
- Well...

244
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,420
some guys offered to make me a partner
in this new bowling centre.

245
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,700
They offered me 25% interest
for a 10% investment, 'cause I'd run it.

246
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,300
It's a good deal.

247
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,740
- It's great.
- Only I don't have the cash.

248
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,380
- They want 300,000.
- Phew!

249
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,100
So then I thought
maybe I'd be happy teaching.

250
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,580
Yeah?

251
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,900
Only, then you'd always
make more money than me.

252
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,980
Who cares about crap like that?
If you're happy being a teacher,

253
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,500
then that makes me happy.
That's it. That's all there is.

254
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,580
Her name is Molly Richardson.
She's 24 years old. She's English.

255
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,580
She came over here two years ago
as a nanny for a couple named Holcomb.

256
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,580
When Mrs Holcomb eventually fired her,
Mr Holcomb attempted to kill himself.

257
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,060
Oh God.

258
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,060
She bounced from job to job:
bikini model, physical therapist...

259
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,260
- We're dead.
- ..until she started delivering pizzas.

260
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,740
It pays to have skills.

261
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,900
She moved in with Joe about three weeks
ago and she's been there ever since.

262
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,540
As a nurse?

263
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,780
She seems to spend
most of her time swimming.

264
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,140
- In the nude. Here are some pictures.
- What?

265
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,980
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

266
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,580
- Are they having sex?
- Grow up. What do you think?

267
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,940
She's going to get everything.

268
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,140
That's the way these old guys are.
Tough as nail biggest son of a bitch in the world:

269
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,060
she touches his shrivel old noodle
and his brains turn to frozen yoghurt.

270
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,540
You would know.

271
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,900
She'll marry him, screw him six feet
into the ground and get everything.

272
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,980
That's our money, damn it and no English whore bitches
is gonna screw us out of it.

273
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,780
Are they sleeping together?
Is there proof?

274
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,140
- I need more time.
- They're humping too quick to get pictures?

275
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,580
- Let's get a better detective.
- How do we know you're any good?

276
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,900
She wass good enough to find out you were fired
and that Glen left Muriel.

277
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,780
Listen. My guy knew about Tina's accident
while the car was still spinning.

278
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,660
Yeah? Look at these pictures she got
of Glen and that gym instructor.

279
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,300
Yeah.

280
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,220
That's not me.

281
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,420
It looks like you
and that's all that matters.

282
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,940
- Use your gun!
- Glen, cut it out! Come here. Stop it.

283
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,700
Stop it!
Don't you see what's happening here?

284
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,780
Yeah, you're out of Scotch.

285
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,620
Oh, Tina, go lie down.

286
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,340
We caused this. All the backbiting
and the greed and the detectives.

287
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,700
We've made each other look filthy.
Now it's come home to roost.

288
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,420
Not one of us has the credibility

289
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,980
to convince Uncle Joe that this girl
is just after his money.

290
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,220
It's not our fault! It's his.
Sweet old Uncle Joe.

291
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,700
We were all decent people
till he got his hooks into us.

292
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,100
Except for Frank.
Frank was always a son of a bitch.

293
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,900
It's true. Uncle Joe does this to us.
He pulls our strings and makes us dance.

294
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,500
He's the devil.

295
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,340
Every time you draw a line in the dirt
and say, ''No farther,''

296
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,780
he draws one an inch farther
and you say, ''Why not?''

297
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,940
''I've come this far already.''

298
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,260
Then you look back
and can't even see where you started.

299
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,100
Why don't we all stop here?
Let this bimbo have his money.

300
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,780
Isn't our self-respect
worth more than any inheritance?

301
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,940
No.

302
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,940
Ed, we're just people. Nobody could
walk away from that much money.

303
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,780
Daniel did.

304
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,140
Who's Daniel?

305
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,420
- Our cousin.
- What happened to him?

306
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,700
He called Uncle Joe a mean, greedy, cruel,
grasping, evil, manipulative old man.

307
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,340
- We all did.
- But Daniel said it to his face.

308
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,780
Grapes.

309
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,740
- What?
- They were having grapes.

310
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,460
Daniel started screaming
about oppressed migrant workers.

311
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,340
Joe said the workers could
go screw themselves in Macy's window

312
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,740
and Daniel let him have it.

313
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,380
I'll never forget it. Remember the look
on the old man's face?

314
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,740
He died a little that night.

315
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,020
Daniel went away. He just went away.
Took his wife and son and...

316
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,500
Man, did we hate his son.

317
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,420
- How come?
- He was so cute, you know?

318
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,180
You wanted to smash his little face in.

319
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,980
- Where is he now?
- In Brazil or somewhere,

320
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,420
saving the rainforest or shit like that.

321
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,980
His wife died a few years ago,
and young Daniel's some kind of athlete.

322
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,220
- A bowler, I think.
- Could we find him?

323
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,340
[crowd cheering]

324
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,500
Excuse me.

325
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,860
Wayne, come here. What's happening?

326
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,780
I've never seen him like this.
He's in the zone.

327
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,940
- Where does he stand? What's...?
- Right now, fifth.

328
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,900
- You mean he could be on TV tomorrow?
- Looks that way.

329
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,900
- Yeah.
- I am on fire!

330
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,580
- You're fifth.
- I know!

331
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,140
If I tell you something,
will you be nervous?

332
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,020
- No way. I'm in the zone.
- OK.

333
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,700
I can turn the telecast
into an enormous break for you.

334
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,500
I can build a whole show around you.
''Cinderella Man''.

335
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,740
Even if you lose the first match.

336
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,620
Chris will interview you,
you'll be funny, charming...

337
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,980
Next year you could be wearing
an ABC blazer.

338
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,740
Ooh, I got a chubby.

339
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,900
You've got to finish no worse than fifth.

340
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,740
I'm in the zone. I'm up.

341
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,060
[girl in crowd] Come on, Danny!

342
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,140
Ha!

343
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,100
[crowd goes wild]

344
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,300
Yes!

345
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,740
[crowd] Oh!

346
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,740
- [man] Come on!
- [man] What's he doing?

347
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,420
- Danny.
- It's nothing. I just lost my line a little.

348
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,620
- Petraglia just finished with a 289.
- What? So?

349
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,420
So you're still OK.
You're still fifth, but it's close.

350
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,020
- All right. So what do I need?
- OK, last frame.

351
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,380
- You need a mark and a three count.
- Strike or a spare?

352
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,700
- And a three count.
- OK, I got it. I got it. It's OK.

353
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,540
Get 'em, Danny.

354
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,980
He seem nervous to you?

355
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,780
You couldn't pull a pin out of his ass
with a tractor.

356
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,820
[crowd] Oh!

357
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,500
When they lose this long,
they don't know how to win.

358
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,660
Come on, Danny!

359
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,900
[hushed crowd]

360
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,980
Yeah!

361
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,580
[man in crowd] Damn, baby!
That's what I'm talking about! All right.

362
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,940
All right. Just three more pins.

363
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,620
- Yeah. I'll be...
- Danny.

364
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,540
I'll be right back. Then we'll celebrate.

365
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Urgh!

366
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,220
[crowd gasps]

367
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,060
Oh, my God!

368
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,780
[Danny] Aw!

369
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,260
Feeling better?

370
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,660
- I'm going out to get some more liquor.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

371
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,420
Really? I think it's a great idea.

372
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:31,460
- You're in your underwear!
- So now I can't go out in my underwear?

373
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,420
- Danny...
- What?

374
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,820
Just because you're very succesful and I'm
a miserable failure,you think you can tell me what to do?

375
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,180
Let me tell you,
Miss High-Powered Network Big Shot

376
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,100
Don't I Look Hot In My ABC Blazer,
I am still a man!

377
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,900
And if I want to go out in my underwear,
I am going out in my underwear!

378
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,620
If I want to go out with no underwear,
I'm going out with no underwear.

379
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,700
- You got that?
- Go ahead.

380
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,780
OK, I guess we know who's boss, huh?

381
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,900
- Honey I think you need a doctor.
- Why don't you just say it?

382
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,580
- Say what?
- You know. ''Danny, you blew it.''

383
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,460
''You choked u gagged You had it and you lost it!
It wasnt your wrist Danny. You just never had the  guts to win!''

384
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,820
- What a shitty thing to say!
- I didn't say it.

385
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,060
- You're thinking it.
- Well, yeah, I'm thinking it!

386
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,180
You hit a car.
You could have killed somebody.

387
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,420
The way I bowl?

388
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,540
You know,

389
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,940
I never regretted a moment until tonight.

390
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:01,540
All those years of losing...this was
the first time I've felt like a loser.

391
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,060
Come here.

392
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,780
Come on.

393
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,860
OK.

394
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,900
Great. Now I'm impotent.

395
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,060
- We just kissed for two seconds.
- Usually we're showering by now.

396
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,780
[knock]

397
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,940
That's probably the manager.

398
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,740
Who are you?

399
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,780
- Daniel McTeague?
- No shit. That's my name, too.

400
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,060
No. I'm Laura Dinsmore.
I'm a private detective.

401
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,180
You're a detective?
Great. Help me find my pants.

402
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,500
- Mr McTeague.
- Just a minute.

403
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,740
Do you have any pictures where
she's leaning over a saddle looking coy?

404
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,580
Is your father still in Brazil?

405
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,820
- Dad?
- Yeah.

406
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,100
No, that was years ago.

407
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,220
He's been in Ethiopia, Chile, Uruguay.
He was with the Kurds for a while.

408
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,740
Wherever there's injustice,
you can find my dad.

409
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,940
You see, you two have never met him.
He's a great man, but he...

410
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,340
When I was a kid, he gave away
my toys to the poorer kids.

411
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,700
Not just the broken toys,
I mean the good toys.

412
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,660
Then he'd want me to be happy about it.

413
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,700
The family was thinking, if your dad
would come back try to make up with Joe...

414
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,100
Look, my dad hated these people.

415
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,340
He said they worshipped money
above all things, especially Uncle Joe.

416
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,900
- They're just...
- Why don't you go back?

417
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,620
If you could help in the situation, and you'd share
the inheritance, with whichever relative got it.

418
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,620
Oh, please.
What, I'm going to become like them?

419
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,260
Kiss up to my uncle and wait for him to die?

420
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,500
No, I'd rather run naked into Limey chick
that got the money. Sorry.

421
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,300
No. It's nice to meet an honest man.

422
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,660
Especially in your family.

423
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,420
Oh. Sorry about your car.

424
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,460
That's all right, it's a rental.
If you change your mind, give me a call.

425
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,860
- Night.
- Goodnight.

426
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,580
- You coming inside?
- He taught me how to bowl.

427
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,740
Who did?

428
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,180
- Uncle Joe.
- Really?

429
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,740
What do you think, honey?
Should I go back there?

430
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,460
- Well, I mean, if you hate him anyway...
- No, I don't hate him.

431
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,460
No, my dad hated him.
I was just a kid. He was really nice to me.

432
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,900
Well...

433
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,780
Who am I kidding?

434
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,060
I was thinking of going back
to see my uncle because I...

435
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,740
I thought he might loan me money
for that bowling alley.

436
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,540
People borrow money
from relatives all the time.

437
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,660
- But my family...
- You know you're a decent person.

438
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,340
Just decide what you want to do
and don't beat yourself up over it. OK?

439
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,420
Maybe my relatives have changed.
Maybe they're not so ridiculous any more.

440
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,140
# Happy birthday to you

441
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,980
# Happy birthday to you

442
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,180
# Happy birthday, Uncle Joe

443
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,220
# Happy birthday to you #

444
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,820
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Blow 'em out...

445
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,460
Where are my presents! I like presents,
especially from people who love me.

446
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,500
And who would that be?

447
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,700
We've got something very special for you.

448
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,620
- I said cut the crap!
- Come on.

449
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,740
- I can see your panties!
- Stop it. Right now. Come on.

450
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,820
- Get off!
- Cool it!

451
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,900
- Why don't you listen to me? Shithead.
- Stop it. Both of you.

452
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,180
A movie? I haven't liked a movie
since De Mille died.

453
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,260
- You'll like this one.
- Yeah?

454
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,660
- Should the kids leave the room?
- No, no. I'll get the lights.

455
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,500
- Leave it alone!
- Would you stop it?

456
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Come on, guys, sit down.

457
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,700
- See, I told you.
- Shut up!

458
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,900
Tell me more. Tell me
about what's happening in Asia.

459
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,940
Remember this party? You hired
those people to come in and film it?

460
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,700
We shouldn't have advisers there.
We'll get into a full Asian land war.

461
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,380
You're such a beatnik, Daniel.
Sandals and white socks, that's you.

462
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,780
The French, they knew when to get out.

463
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,100
Hitler swapped them a bottle of wine
for their country.

464
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,700
They took it. They...
Why are you filming this?

465
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,380
l'm not paying you to film this. You...

466
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,900
Where's my special boy?

467
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,300
- Where's Uncle Joe's special boy?
- Here l am, Uncle Joe.

468
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,500
Carl, get in touch with reality.
Where's Little Danny?

469
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,860
Where's my special little boy?

470
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,420
l'm right here.

471
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,420
There you are.

472
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,860
Here, film this. This is why l hired you.
You gonna do Durante?

473
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,060
- Yeah.
- Good boy. Come on.

474
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,260
[as Durante] # lnka dinka doo
A dinka dee a dinka doo

# Oh, what a tune for croonin'

476
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,220
# lnka dinka doo a dinka dee a dinka doo

# lt's got the whole world...swoonin'

478
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,700
# Eskimo belles up in...

479
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,780
[ as Durante] Stop the musicl Stop the music.

480
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,020
Folks, l want to welcome you
to my Great-Uncle Joe's 50th birthday party.

481
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,460
Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha

482
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,700
Remember, Uncle Joe...

483
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,700
# Start off each day with a song

484
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,020
# Even when things go wrong

485
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,700
# You'll feel better, you'll even look better

486
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,740
# l'm here to tell you you got to be go-getter

487
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,540
# 'Cause you know that you can't go wrong

488
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,500
# When you start off each day with a song #

489
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,940
- Yeah.
- Yeahl

490
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,020
Good boy.

491
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,580
Uncle Joe,

492
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,820
here's our present.

493
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,260
- Who the hell is this?
- It's Danny.

494
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,740
Danny Junior. We found him for you
for your birthday.

495
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,620
- Danny?
- Uncle Joe. Happy birthday.

496
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,140
Little Danny!

497
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,620
Hug him. Go hug him.

498
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,300
Stop the music, huh?

499
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,420
- Hey!
- Hey.

500
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,900
What a present!

501
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,180
- Is your...?
- What?

502
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,580
- Are you alone?
- Oh, yeah.

503
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,660
Yeah.

504
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,260
Well, let's go break the pinata.

505
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,820
You can do it! Come on, get him!
Hit the pig!

506
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,540
Douglas looks the same as he did
25 years ago.

507
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,420
This is his son.

508
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,940
- Come on, Douglas! You can do it!
- [Uncle Joe] Keep going.

509
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,780
So your cousins found you and brought you here, huh?

510
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,180
Yeah, it was their idea.

511
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,460
I wonder what made them
suddenly decide to do that.

512
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,340
Don't know, huh?

513
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,500
- I couldn't...
- They tell you about Molly?

514
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,860
Yeah.

515
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,580
- Yeah, they did.
- [Molly] Come on, you can do better than that.

516
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,100
She's your new nurse, right?

517
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,900
She's more than a nurse.
She's a...companion.

518
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,940
- What do you think about that?
- Hey. You worked hard. You're entitled.

519
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,900
What do you really think?

520
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,980
I think it's ridiculous. I mean, I'm watching
you, you can barely wear your hat.

521
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,460
Douglas, stop playing around
and fetch me a beer.

522
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,740
My pleasure, sir.

523
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,940
What are you two talking about?

524
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,260
I was telling Danny about Molly.
How important she's become to me.

525
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,060
I've been thinking that she's the person
in the world who's become closest to me.

526
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,860
The person I'd most like to see have
some happiness, some good fortune.

527
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,860
But seeing Little Daniel again
has made me think about...family.

528
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,220
After all is said and done,
maybe family comes first, mm?

529
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,740
Molly! What do you think?
Does family come first?

530
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,580
I suppose it depends on the family, really.

531
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,060
How wise.

532
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,700
How deep, how pithy.

533
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,820
Family, friends...who can choose?

534
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,260
- Know what I'd like?
- [all] What?

535
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,020
I'd like Danny to do Jimmy Durante for me.

536
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,020
- Yes!
- Yeah, come on!

537
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,380
- That would be just so happy-making.
- Yeah.

538
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,100
No.

539
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,180
Jesus! This is pathetic.

540
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,700
- Shut up and do Durante.
- You do Durante! This is demented.

541
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,700
This wasn't such a good present after all.
Molly, honey. Let's go inside.

542
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,900
Your family's here.
They all want to be with you.

543
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,700
But I'd rather just be with you.

544
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,180
All right, then.
First let me get some sweeties.

545
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,860
- Danny, are you married?
- No.

546
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,340
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

547
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,300
Bring her around tomorrow. Two o'clock.
We'll go swimming.

548
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,660
Swimming. Great.

549
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,980
I feel like a goddamn tea bag.

550
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,500
Sorry, sir.

551
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,740
- Let me ask you, Robin.
- Yes, sir.

552
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,780
- Do you ever produce basketball games?
- I will, next season.

553
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,740
You know what I hate?

554
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,700
When the camera's on the stands
on some moron

555
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,460
and his face is painted blue and white,
and I miss a basket.

556
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,500
- So do I.
- Danny. And you?

557
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,180
You going to bowl the rest of your life?
Hit the senior tours?

558
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,260
Actually, I've given up bowling.
I have this injury.

559
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,140
Oh, yeah, it's a rough sport.

560
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,260
I was going to go back to college.
You know, get a teaching degree.

561
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,820
You'll never make
the same money as Robin.

562
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,660
We've decided that that's not important.

563
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,260
Right.

564
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,980
- Douglas!
- Yes, sir?

565
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,300
Much obliged, sir.
May I go and change now, sir?

566
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,100
- You can go dance the hully-gully for all I care.
- Thank you, sir.

567
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,100
Yeah, I know, teaching's
a wondertul thing. Very noble.

568
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,140
You've been bowling ten years,
that leads to nothing?

569
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,660
- You just throw those ten years away?
- Well, I...

570
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,180
What?

571
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,860
I have this opportunity to invest
in a bowling centre. It's an excellent deal.

572
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,220
- But I'm...
- Short of money.

573
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,500
Yeah.

574
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,300
- How much?
- It's $300,000.

575
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,260
[whistles Durante tune]

576
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,300
Danny, come in the pool.

577
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,740
Ah... Just...

578
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,180
Ph! Pah!

579
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,100
- Is this salt water?
- Yeah. Helps me float.

580
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,540
This belt's not enough.
I can't use my legs.

581
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,660
Tell you what,
I'll wrestIe you for the money.

582
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,100
- What?
- I'll wrestle you.

583
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,460
If you win, I'll give you $300,000.
If I win, you owe me nothing.

584
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,460
[nervous laugh]

585
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,460
Show that girlfriend of yours
what you're made of.

586
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,940
Yeah, definitely. I'm gonna beat up
an elderly crippled man

587
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,500
and she's gonna say, ''What a catch!''

588
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,180
- Can your feet touch?
- No.

589
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,140
Good.

590
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,020
[cries out]

591
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,340
- Danny?
- Come on, bowler!

592
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,740
- Help me! Oh, man!
- Joe-Joe, that's enough. Let him up.

593
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,060
Help!

594
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,540
[Uncle Joe screams then Danny joins in]

595
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,900
- I win the first round. Two out of three.
- No!

596
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,060
You heard him. He quit.

597
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,540
Where is he?

598
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,460
- You OK?
- Get me out, honey.

599
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,340
Jesus! You got the grip of a bear!

600
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,100
40 years of lifting scrap metal.

601
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,220
And I like to win.

602
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah, well.

603
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,580
I'll give you the money.

604
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,300
300,000. It's yours.

605
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,220
- You mean like a loan?
- No, no, no. It's yours. A gift.

606
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,340
You're different from the others.
You're better.

607
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,820
And for all the times you made me laugh.

608
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,700
# lnka dinka dinka dinka dink #

609
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,340
Uncle Joe, this is... I don't...

610
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,260
- Still see your father?
- What? Oh, yeah, sure.

611
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,860
I bail him out of jail, we make a day of it.

612
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,780
- Strange man.
- Well, yeah, strange, sure.

613
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,620
But with principles he believes in.

614
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,500
I want you to call him from here.

615
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,220
- Really?
- Yeah.

616
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,180
That's really great. Because it's been
too many years, and it's silly...

617
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,100
Tell him you came to me for money
and I'm giving it to you.

618
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,940
You realise he was wrong and I was right.

619
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,020
And you need what I've got
more than what he's got.

620
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,380
Tell him and I'll give you the money.

621
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,340
Robin, we're leaving.

622
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,460
You know there's something
sicker about you than your legs?

623
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,020
How about you, Molly?

624
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,100
Wanna wrestle?

625
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,580
Douglas!

626
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,140
[thunder]

627
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,740
- You had us worried.
- About what?

628
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,220
Well, we put Uncle Joe to bed
and we realised how late it was,

629
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,380
and we got concerned about you.

630
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,860
Monday nights l go to this news-stand
to get the new TV Guide for Joe.

631
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,380
He likes to get it early so he can
circle everything he wants to watch.

632
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,740
Does he circle your ass?

633
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,020
You really are a stupid sod, aren't you?
l'm going to bed.

634
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,180
Uncle Joe was sprawled out up there.
You might want to push him to one side.

635
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,700
- You think l'm bonking the old gent.
- Yeah, we do.

636
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,900
Let me tell you something, handsome.

637
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,220
lf l were having sex with your Uncle Joe,
he'd be dead by now.

638
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,220
Yeah, that's right. You're just his nurse. Huh!

639
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,420
Yeah, l believe that. Excuse me a second.
Ha-ha-ha!

640
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,420
l'm no more a nurse
than you are a human being.

641
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,660
l'm here because l'm fun.
And l'm fun to look at.

642
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,500
l don't mind, because l like it here.

643
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,620
l like the car, l like the house, l like the comfort.
My life hasn't always been very comfortable.

644
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,860
Also, l like your Uncle Joe.
He's tough, he's funny and he's nice to me.

645
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,100
But l'm not a whore.

646
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,740
And if he asked me to sleep with him,
l'd leave. Goodnight.

647
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,500
lt took you one day to get rid of Danny.
one day, thats pretty lmpressive, but that is not our last move!

648
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,420
Move?

649
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,100
You mean Danny's part of you?

650
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,660
- Up until now we've been nice.
- But these are the finals, honey.

651
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,020
- We're diving for every ball.
- What?

652
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,220
l didn't like the Beatles and l don't like you.

653
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,340
- You know, you're insane.
- Listen! People have accidents.

654
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,260
- What?
- Frank, what are you saying?

655
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,620
l'm saying people have accidents,
that's all.

656
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,860
- Got you, boss.
- OK.

657
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,500
Here.

658
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,620
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.

659
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,860
- You still work here.
- l love this place.

660
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,580
Who wouldn't?

661
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,820
Well I am here. What do you want to see me about?

662
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,340
Okay short and sweet. l figured you came back
sucking around for money,

663
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,220
that you were like the others.
Maybe you're not.

664
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,460
So l apologise. OK?

665
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,340
Go home now.

666
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,860
God, that was lovely.
l'm getting a little weepy.

667
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,700
You're still a funny kid.
Not as cute as you used to be, though.

668
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,980
Yeah, well, you're no Monet yourself.

669
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:09,780
Well, l lived in the streets till l was 20. What do
you expect? l was homeless before it was popular.

670
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,820
Can we go inside a second?

671
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,860
l'm sorry that after all these years
l even brought up the subject of money.

672
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,220
l didn't mean to.

673
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,100
Maybe l did. But anyway, l'm sorry l did.

674
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,420
Still want the money?

675
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,140
Jesus, you don't let up.

676
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,500
Look, money's money, OK?
l need it just like everybody else.

677
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:40,180
But money is not going to turn me into
a sycophantic ass-licking wacko.

678
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,740
l have work to do.
Thanks for coming over.

679
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,820
Before you go,
could you get me a cup of water?

680
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,220
lt's hot in here.

681
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,700
Yeah, OK.

682
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,500
Hello? Long lsland Hauling?
l got a load sitting out here for a week.

683
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,860
Fieldstone 855...

684
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,580
What?

685
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,300
What do you mean, they're out of business
25 years? l call them every day.

686
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,060
Joe?

687
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,100
- Joe?
- 25 years.

688
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,540
Should l go get someone? Are you...?

689
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,220
- l'm going to get someone.
- Danny!

690
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,820
- Stay here.
- Are you all right?

691
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,780
l have gaps. Lapses. l...

692
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,300
- How often?
- More lately. l'm hurting the business.

693
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,980
What? No, l mean, l'm sure...

694
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,900
lf your cousins find out,
they'll take me to court.

695
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,860
They'll declare me incompetent.
They'll pick me clean like buzzards.

696
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,140
They'll put me away.

697
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,820
l have an idea. Lock the door.

698
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,300
Quick!

699
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,580
Get a chair. Come on.

700
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,340
- lt's really my lawyer's idea.
- OK.

701
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,300
He says that l can turn all my affairs,
give everything over to one person now,

702
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,860
before this gets worse, which it will.

703
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,860
Someone l trust who'll take care of me,
who'll take care of the business.

704
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,740
You understand?

705
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,940
Yeah.

706
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,140
l don't want to go into a home.

707
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,740
l wouldn't let that happen.

708
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,500
- You wouldn't?
- No.

709
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,620
You understand? This person
gets control of my money now.

710
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,340
Not when l'm dead. Now. All of it.

711
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,140
Yes.

712
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,740
l'll do it. l'm going to call my lawyers,
set up a meeting for next week.

713
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,300
l'm going to sign these
and turn everything over to Molly.

714
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,620
Right. Because l...

715
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,700
- To Molly?
- Yes.

716
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,580
She's been so kind to me.
Nobody's ever been so kind.

717
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,260
- You're giving everything to Molly?
- Yeah. Who did you think l meant?

718
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,500
You thought l meant you.

719
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,140
No! No.

720
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,740
- But Molly?
- You think it's a mistake.

721
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,420
l don't know, l...

722
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,620
l want to make love to her.

723
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,580
- Joe.
- lf l did this, she...

724
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,180
she'd make love to me. Don't you think?

725
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,340
Joe, look.

726
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,100
A lot of women will make love to you
for a lot less of money.

727
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,620
No. l want her.

728
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,180
This doesn't sound so good to me.

729
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,460
l just don't think that you're being...

730
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,340
l just don't think that you've had time
to think this through.

731
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:38,020
l'm so tired of thinking, ''Who should
l trust? Who's not just after my money?''

732
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,460
Danny, help me. l'm exhausted. l...

733
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,060
Maybe l should leave all the money to you.

734
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,620
Well, why don't...?

735
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:57,140
Why don't we talk about this later? OK?

736
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,660
All right.

737
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,140
ln the meantime, l think it would be best
if you just don't do anything.

738
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,860
All right.

739
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,740
l'm so tired.
Get Douglas to take me home.

740
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,180
l'll be right back.

741
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,420
[commentator]
Throws and shoots...and scores!

742
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,540
Gimme the guy in the stands
with the blue and white face.

743
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,060
That's good. Hold it. Take it.

744
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:40,180
lt was the saddest thing you ever saw.
This tough old guy just so shrivelled up.

745
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,820
Dick, get ready to throw to a commercial.
Honey, l'm concentrating.

746
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,300
- Coe scores!
- You missed the basket!

747
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,380
Dick, sign off and go to commercial.

748
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,340
- Music!
- [assistant] We're a minute under.

749
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,260
You missed the basket
for the guy with the painted face.

750
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,540
Wait a minute. Who's directing this,
you or me? Let me check.

751
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,100
That's my ass!
That's my ass in the director's chair!

752
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,380
Shit! l must be the director!

753
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:11,820
- Stan, we're back in 20.
- No, it's OK. This guy'll do it. Here you go.

754
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,180
Slide right in here, slugger.

755
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,540
Get me a wide shot, then zoom in.

756
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,380
Get outta here!

757
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,820
l'm just getting the hang of this.

758
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,700
- lt was nice meeting you and your ass!
- That's nice.

759
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,580
Give me another shot of the painted face.

760
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,220
What a pinhead.

761
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,900
l have to work with that pinhead,
so l'll meet you at...

762
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:38,420
l just wanted to tell you that
l'm moving in with Uncle Joe for a while.

763
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,620
Really?

764
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,100
Honey, l gotta keep an eye on him.
He's not all there.

765
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,540
He's thinking of giving
that naked pizza girl $20 million.

766
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,780
Yeah, that does seem wrong.

767
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,660
But who should get it? Your cousins?
God, what a crew. Klingons.

768
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,820
Well, he sort of mentioned that he might...

769
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,340
- What?
- That he might give it to me.

770
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,900
l'm not taking it that seriously.
That's not why l'm going over there.

771
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,540
l'm just... l'm worried about him.

772
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:16,780
Still, it's a funny idea, isn't it?

773
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,460
You, me. Married.

774
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,980
Living in that big house.

775
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,220
Yeah, it's funny.

776
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:32,300
[# Steve Wood:
Money Slips Through My Fingers]

777
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,540
Don't forget, you owe me a dollar
for the shoes.

778
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,660
Anyway, as l was saying,

779
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,540
my lawyer says l can turn
all my money, everything,

780
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,780
over to one person. Now.

781
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,740
- You understand?
- Yes.

782
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,220
- l don't want to end up in a home.
- You won't.

783
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,820
l'm gonna call my lawyer and
l'll set up a meeting for next week

784
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,740
and l'm gonna turn
everything over to Danny.

785
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,620
Danny?

786
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,460
lt was his idea. Who did you think l...?

787
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,780
You thought l meant you.

788
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:26,300
- No. No, l just...
- Molly, what would people say?

789
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,580
How would it look?

790
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,220
What do you really know about this bloke?
You haven't seen him in 25 years.

791
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,700
He shows up here
wanting money for a bowling alley.

792
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,100
l don't know. l don't know who to trust.

793
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,300
Maybe l should leave all my money to you.

794
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,580
Joe-Joe.

795
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,180
Yes!

796
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,180
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

797
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,700
Excuse me. You have a call
from Washington DC, sir.

798
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,660
l'll take it upstairs.

799
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,500
You stay here with Danny.
Talk. Enjoy yourself.

800
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,220
Let's go, Douglas.

801
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,660
You're working for your cousins,
aren't you?

802
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,940
Wait a minute. How? Who?

803
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:34,620
They let it slip out the other night
before they threatened to kill me.

804
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,020
They did what?

805
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,100
Tell your cousins l'm not afraid of them.

806
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,660
And you leave Joe alone.

807
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,940
You keep your breasts off his eyebrows.

808
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,180
- Hey, you little...
- Get off!

809
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,100
- Come on!
- Mommy!

810
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,220
lt's good.

811
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,260
What's happening, Wonder Boy?
l mean, look at this.

812
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,540
Her tongue is practically in his wallet.

813
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,300
What are you drinking?

814
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,540
lt's a 7-Up. l'm not much of a drinker.

815
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,300
You will be.

816
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,100
There's something l wanted to ask you.

817
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,940
- Did you go and see Molly and...?
- No.

818
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,980
Let me finish. All right?

819
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:39,940
Did you go and see Molly
and threaten to kill her?

820
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,340
What? You see how evil she is?
You see what we're dealing with?

821
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:52,500
Why, we... We went to her to ask her
if Joe's taking his medication.

822
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,980
You know, for his...circulation.

823
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:59,820
She said, ''That's for me to know
and for you to worry about.''

824
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,220
She said that?

825
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:06,340
Then l said, ''l could kill you for that.''
OK, now you know the truth.

826
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:11,100
God. First couple of days l was here,
she seemed so nice.

827
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,780
That's before she saw you as a threat.

828
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,460
We should have him declared incompetent.
Throw him in a home.

829
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:21,620
- A home?
- You know, for his own protection.

830
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:26,380
l hear things at the scrapyard.
There is something wrong with him.

831
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:30,940
He screws things up, he makes crazy deals.
He forgets deals he's made.

832
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:37,100
Danny have you noticed anything, anything
we could use to put the old man away?

833
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,740
No.

834
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,980
Keep your eyes open. And for God's sake
do something! That's what you're here for.

835
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,020
Joe? Joe!

836
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,940
Joe.

837
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,460
Here, have some water.

838
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,700
Cough it up.

839
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,700
Joe, drink some water!

840
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,620
[Molly] Joe.

841
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,100
That's it.

842
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,180
Piece of fruit.

843
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:22,020
She tried to kill him. She knows he has
a narrow gullet. All the McTeagues do!

844
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,900
Shut your mouth.
She's the only one who helped me.

845
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,540
l tried to help you, Uncle Joe,
but Carl stopped me!

846
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,740
- Liar!
- Happy birthday, Uncle Joe!

847
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,380
That was last week.

848
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,620
You people are...

849
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:44,180
Come on, Molly. l've lost my appetite.

850
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,540
l've made a decision.

851
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,020
Here l am, Uncle Joe.

- Stop the music! Stop the music.

860

Everybody wants to get into the act!

861
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,340
Remember, Uncle Joe...

You're something.

Robin. Hey. Where you going?

876
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,340
l'm just a little ''lnka-dinka-do'd'' out.

877
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,620
What, do you think l enjoyed that?

878
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,660
A week ago, you said it was pathetic.

879
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:43,260
Now you're singing, dancing
and sliding down a banister?

880
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:47,260
Honey, she's a vixen.
She's not giving him his medicine,

881
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,460
she's gonna get his money
and dump him in a home. l know this.

882
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,860
So it's not the money, it's your uncle.

883
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:58,500
Exactly. He's opened up his heart to me,
you know.

884
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:03,060
We've rekindled something
that we haven't had since l was a kid.

885
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:06,860
l mean, we got a bond growing here.

886
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:10,500
Danny, l love you and l believe in you.

887
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:16,420
But isn't everything you're telling me
a big crock of bubbling shit?

888
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,060
- No.
- lt's just the money.

889
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,900
- lt's not.
- Mr Daniel.

890
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,300
Your uncle has requested another chorus.

891
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,340
- Come with me. Just leave.
- All my stuff's here.

892
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,740
- All my clothes.
- l've seen your clothes. Just leave.

893
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,740
Shall l tell him you're coming, sir?

894
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,860
lt's not the money.

[Danny as Durante]
He's back! Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

896
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,260
- More wine, sir?
- No, thank you, Douglas.

897
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,980
- ls the chicken Kiev satisfactory?
- lt's excellent.

898
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:18,500
Could you tell the cook that tomorrow
l'd like to have broiled salmon again?

899
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:23,100
- Very good, sir.
- ls my uncle going to swim today?

900
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,660
He's not at home, sir.
He took the shuttle to Washington.

901
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:30,580
- Business trip.
- Yes and no, sir.

902
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,940
- What does that mean?
- He took Miss Molly along.

903
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:36,940
He did?

904
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,620
Yes. He had me book
the honeymoon suite at the Coolidge Hotel.

905
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,300
Honeymoon?

906
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,780
More wine, sir?

907
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:58,660
This is a matter of life or death.
These are Mr McTeague's pills.

908
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:04,580
l have to get them to him in two minutes
and 45 seconds. l need the room number!

909
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,620
l'm sorry, sir.
Mr McTeague was very specific.

910
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,860
No one is to have his room number.

911
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,220
- l'll see to it that he gets the pills and...
- No!

912
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,900
No! No, you don't understand.

913
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:25,100
These pills only work if l give them to him
myself. lt's a very rare condition.

914
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:29,580
Excuse me, sir.
Does this say ''moron''?

915
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:36,060
l will leave him your message.
Would you like a room?

916
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,940
l'm his nephew.

917
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:41,780
- Oh, his nephew.
- Yes.

918
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:47,980
Because he gave specific instructions
not to give his room number to relatives.

919
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:55,500
What's the matter with you? Do you
not care about this hotel's reputation?

920
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,300
There is an old man shacked up here
with a very young girl.

921
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:04,700
Sir, most of these rooms have old men
with young girls. This is Washington.

922
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:10,020
All right, listen, pal. Just give me...

923
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,740
..a room. A cheap one.

924
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,900
Of course.

925
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,700
[Uncle Joe] Come on, Molly. Drink up.

926
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,660
[knocking]

927
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:49,220
Yeah, come in. lt's open.

928
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,780
Right there.

929
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:56,340
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

930
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,980
- Where's Molly?
- She's taking a walk.

931
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,740
We had a fight.

932
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,820
Nothing serious, l hope.

933
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,700
Be honest. Do you think Molly
would even like me if l wasn't rich?

934
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,380
Look, l don't want to say
anything against her.

935
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,700
But like you say, let's be honest.

936
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,220
How many girls like that
are with poor old guys?

937
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:29,260
- Take some towels.
- What?

938
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,620
Take some towels for the money
they charge here, you should take everything.

939
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:36,940
l'm trying to figure out a way
to get the bed out of here.

940
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,420
You are some piece of work,
do you know that?

941
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,620
She's a good kid.

942
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,220
That's why she can't...

943
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:53,300
She can't...
can't just get herself to... You know.

944
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,180
You mean you two didn't...?

945
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,700
No.

946
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:08,580
You know, l never believed
that anyone could love me for me.

947
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,060
How could l,
when my own mother didn't?

948
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,380
She didn't?

949
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,420
She left me and my brother at a...

950
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,140
..at a home in Albany when l was three.

951
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:31,100
No note, no nothing.
Never asked about us.

952
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,660
Never said, ''l'm sorry.''

953
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,780
Your mother has to love you.

954
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,980
Right Danny?

955
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:48,260
So even if no one else does,
she has to, doesn't she?

956
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,220
Well, if my own mother
couldn't love me, l...

957
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,620
I...

958
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,220
l love you, Uncle Joe.

959
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,220
You do?

960
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,740
Yeah, l do.

961
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,380
Take me home, Danny.

962
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,980
[Robin] Danny what do you mean
he's throwing her out of the house?

963
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,100
Honey, just wait a second, will you?

964
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:39,780
- Danny!
- Honey, l had no choice.

965
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,820
It was an emergancy, she wasn't going to bring him back
till she got what she wanted.

966
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,460
You mean until she got what you wanted.

967
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,860
Honey, it's not like that.

968
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:54,420
Look, Uncle Joe and l, we talked.
l mean, we really talked.

969
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,980
He's been in Washington.
Some military contract.

970
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:03,380
- Oh, yeah?
- I brought him back today and
we're going to go and see his attorneys.

971
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:06,900
From now on, honey,
l'm going to be responsible for him.

972
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:11,220
l'm gonna be here with him,
and...you know.

973
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,220
Rich.

974
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:21,300
- What about your cousins, you made deal?
- My cousins are animals!

975
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,300
They would put him in a home
if they could.

976
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,660
l'll take care of their children,

977
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:30,180
you know, give each kid
like a scholarship or something,

978
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,740
but my cousins forget it, don't deserve anything.

979
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,980
- You bastard!
- Frank what are you doing?
- Frank, no!

980
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,340
- Whatever happened to ''Hello''?
- We heard every word.

981
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,900
- What did you do? Listen outside my door?
- Always.

982
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,180
- l had no idea how sick you guys were.
- Come spend a day with us.

983
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,180
- l'd rather shove this up my ass.
- l'll do it.

984
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:55,420
- You're playing a lone hand, huh? Are you double crossing us?
- First of all, l never agreed to anything with you.

985
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,340
l only said was I'll visit my uncle, see
how things were and let me tell u something.

986
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,060
l saw, and it made me sick.

987
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,700
- You bastard.
- l like it better when she said that. I think it's the accent or something.

988
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,060
- l thought l'd find you here together.
- We're not all together.

989
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,220
Right.

990
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:18,100
Do you know, l thought
you were different than the others.

991
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,540
But you're no different, you're exactly the same.

992
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,420
l am looking out for my uncle, OK?
l am looking out for his welfare.

993
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,580
Bullshit. They were willing
to wait until he died.

994
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,860
But not you, you're going to eat him raw.

995
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,900
- Wait a minute. Danny is not like that.
- Try to remember something, OK?

996
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,460
ln the long run, nobody likes a tease.

997
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,700
You are a cheap,
chiselling, low-life hustler.

998
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,300
- [Carl] You said it!
- Well, it takes one to spot one.

999
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,700
- Stop it!
- Great!

1000
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,820
Now you stop it,
after she gets in a shot.

1001
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:01,940
l'll give you half a million dollars to leave.
Cash. Soon as l get the money.

1002
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,940
Better than delivering pizza,
even in a good year.

1003
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:10,060
She gets half a million dollars and we get a couple
of lousy scholarships? That's not fair!

1004
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:14,060
No, l will give you half a million dollars
and you leave.

1005
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,300
You'll give me half a million?
l'm getting it all!

1006
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,140
He sees right through you.
You're a walking fish-tank, baby.

1007
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:25,060
- You and your tan tushy can...
- l'll sleep with him.

1008
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,540
What?

1009
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:33,660
- What, you're...you're gonna...?
- As soon as he gets back from work.

1010
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,460
l'll give him a right good one.

1011
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,740
You... See, it wouldn't...

1012
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,660
He wouldn't be interested in that.
lt wouldn't even matter.

1013
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,500
lt'll matter. l'll make it matter.

1014
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,540
# Inka dinka doo #

1015
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,780
Molly.

1016
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,540
Do you know that both of my daughters
are named Molly?

1017
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,860
Oh, God.

1018
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,060
Oh, God.

1019
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:17,620
Oh, God. You think she'll do it?

1020
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,020
Yes, l do.

1021
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,980
You've given her no choice.
She'll do it just to beat you.

1022
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,980
Oh, Jesus. You think it'll work?

1023
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,940
A young girl with a body like that?

1024
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,340
There'll be nothing left of him
but a smile and an old hat.

1025
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,980
Welcome home, Joe.

1026
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,500
Hello, Molly.

1027
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,500
[inaudible]

1028
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,900
l'm tired. l'm going upstairs.

1029
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,700
Uncle Joe!

1030
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,740
Wait!

1031
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,540
Sir, will you need my assistance?

1032
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,980
No, Molly will assist me.

1033
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,700
Oh, l see. Very good, sir.

1034
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,060
Let's go.

1035
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,420
Sir? May l ask for a reference
before you go upstairs?

1036
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,620
Not now, Douglas.

1037
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,220
Goodbye, sir.

1038
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,260
Uncle Joe, wait! Please wait.

1039
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,660
- l have a surprise for you.
- Danny, don't.

1040
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,420
Up we go.

1041
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,260
His face! Did you see it?

1042
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,220
l've never been in one of these before.

1043
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,660
[Uncle Joe] Hang on!

1044
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,500
Molly, let me say something.

1045
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,340
No. Don't say anything.

1046
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,860
- A little young for you, ain't she, Joe?
- Who's there?

1047
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,060
Hi, Joe. lt's been a long time.

1048
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,980
- lt's Daniel.
- Daniel?

1049
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:48,620
- What are you...? You got so old.
- You're no Monet yourself.

1050
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,540
Molly, this is my cousin Daniel.
Danny's father.

1051
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,500
Danny asked me to come.
He's got a real regard for you.

1052
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:04,900
He made me think that maybe things
are different than the way l remember them.

1053
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,540
But they're not, are they?
lt's still the same.

1054
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:13,060
God, this place still stinks from greed.

1055
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,540
Those who have it...

1056
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,780
and those who want it.

1057
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,380
Dad!

1058
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:33,500
- Hello, Daniel.
- You came! That was great of you.

1059
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,700
- l'm leaving.
- What?

1060
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,780
God. They're all still here.

1061
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:44,660
First your parents, now you. He'll outlive
your children and leave them nothing.

1062
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,380
You wanna lighten up?

1063
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,740
You know who ruins this world?
The greedy. That's it.

1064
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,580
They have it. l want it.
l have it. l want more.

1065
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:58,980
That's the real pollution. Greed.

1066
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,740
You know who l think ruins the world?

1067
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:09,180
Pompous, self-righteous, holier-than-thou
middle-aged fanatics in pony-tails

1068
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,180
who give away their kids' toys!

1069
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:17,940
- He's got you too, huh?
- No, he doesn't have me.

1070
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:21,340
- Can't the truth be in between?
- No!

1071
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,220
One way is all right,
one way is all wrong.

1072
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,700
His way or my way. Pick.

1073
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,220
- Dad.
- Pick!

1074
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,500
- You are just so...
- Pick!

1075
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,500
All right, then l pick him.

1076
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:47,740
At least he doesn't take himself
so goddamn seriously.

1077
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,380
l'm leaving.

1078
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:23,100
Why?

1079
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:29,220
l can't believe l was almost
going to screw the old boy for money.

1080
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:33,820
l suppose maybe l've always
been here for the money.

1081
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,780
Christ, l make myself sick.

1082
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,220
l have to get out of here.

1083
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,900
l understand.

1084
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,500
You'll take care of him, won't you?

1085
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,900
Of course.

1086
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,820
You're not going to put him in a home?

1087
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,060
Never.

1088
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,380
Bye.

1089
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,700
Hey. You OK?

1090
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,380
Yeah.

1091
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:22,980
God, that was some scene
with your father. l just...

1092
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,060
What?

1093
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,660
That wasn't my father.

1094
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:35,260
What?

1095
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:39,860
That was an actor.
My father wouldn't come here on a bet.

1096
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:45,220
- So you just...?
- lt was my only shot, honey.

1097
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:48,900
He wanted me to pick him over my father.

1098
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,660
Yes, and you said you never would.

1099
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:55,540
l didn't. l picked him over an actor.

1100
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,100
- Don't touch me.
- What?

1101
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,260
- Hey. Come on. What's the matter?
- Danny.

1102
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,500
You dropped your compass in the woods
and you're lost.

1103
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,260
l'm not lost.

1104
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,660
- You don't see how sick this is?
- No!

1105
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:17,740
- Who got hurt?
- The truth got hurt. OK?

1106
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:21,780
lntegrity, self-respect,
decent human behaviour got hurt.

1107
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,980
l will be good to him.
Tell me who else will be as good.

1108
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,540
- That's not the point.
- No, that is the point.

1109
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:35,020
We've been through a lot together
and l think l've been pretty loyal.

1110
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,620
Honey, you've been great.

1111
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:42,620
But if you touch one cent
of your uncle's money, we're through.

1112
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,420
- What are you, crazy?
- l mean it.

1113
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:51,100
lf you take any of that money,
l will have no respect for you.

1114
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,740
Jesus! You sound like my father.

1115
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,500
No, l sound like the actor
who played your father. Enjoy your money.

1116
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:08,060
- Daniel McTeague Junior.
- Here.

1117
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,020
Your great-uncle has chosen,
for reasons l assume he's explained,

1118
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,300
to transfer to you all his assets,

1119
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:23,540
including full control of his commercial,
personal and financial affairs.

1120
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:26,500
My boy. My good boy.

1121
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:32,540
l would like to give you a full picture
of your great-uncle's holdings.

1122
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:36,860
The McTeague Scrap Metal Company,
comprising scrapyards, trucking...

1123
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,660
Excuse me.

1124
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:44,700
Uncle Joe, there's something
l'd like to explain to you.

1125
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:50,420
First of all, when l came
to your birthday party that time,

1126
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:55,740
l had no idea this was going to happen.
l wasn't after your money.

1127
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,700
l know that. That's why l love you.

1128
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,860
Joe. l have to tell you something.

1129
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:09,380
What?

1130
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,700
l'm...

1131
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:17,020
going to take such good care of you.

1132
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,220
You're a good boy.

1133
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,500
ls that it?

1134
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,820
- Yeah.
- Well, that was lovely.

1135
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,660
As l was saying, the McTeague
Scrap Metal Company, comprising...

1136
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,420
- Stop! Sign nothing!
- What the hell is this?

1137
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,540
Oh, my, my, my.

1138
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,100
lf deceit has a name, it's his name!

1139
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:54,020
Daniel, is it true? ls everything
these gerbils have been telling me true?

1140
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,860
Dad.

1141
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,020
Dad?

1142
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:04,660
Yes, Dad. Daniel McTeague Senior, his father.

1143
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:09,660
His real father, not the actor he hired
to come to your house last night.

1144
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,460
Danny.

1145
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,780
They told me that, Daniel.

1146
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,300
ls it true?

1147
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,380
Yeah. lt's true.

1148
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:34,860
You hired an actor to pretend he was me,
and then pretended to fight with him?

1149
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:38,660
And told him
you preferred Uncle Joe to me?

1150
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:42,500
Well, when you put it like that,
it sounds kind of bad.

1151
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:47,340
l know we've had our differences.
And l know you think l'm strange.

1152
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,420
No. No, Dad.

1153
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,300
l am. But l've always respected you,
Daniel. Always.

1154
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,300
l've always felt you had real character.

1155
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,700
Ha-ha!

1156
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,100
- Does money mean this much to you?
- No.

1157
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,260
l didn't go and see Uncle Joe
for the money.

1158
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:11,780
We made a deal. lf he kept the money
in the family, he'd get a cut. Right?

1159
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:14,420
- Yes, but...
- Then he double-crossed us.

1160
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:17,580
Because they're scum! They're greedy!

1161
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:21,140
We're greedy? We were willing to share.

1162
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,780
Dad.

1163
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:30,020
l don't know what happened.
l just got...sucked in.

1164
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:34,260
First one thing didn't seem wrong,
then another, until...

1165
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,780
Nothing seemed wrong.

1166
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:39,780
l know. That's why l left.

1167
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:57,300
- How are you, Joe?
- l'm still eating grapes.

1168
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,820
- Uncle Joe.
- Save it.

1169
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:29,380
OK, Joe. Bare knuckles, toe to toe.
We've spent 20 years eating your shit

1170
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:33,500
and saying, ''Mm! Delicious.. what a cook.''
No more. We've hired attorneys.

1171
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,220
lf we don't get our share,
we'll get you declared incompetent.

1172
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,940
And we'll win,
because we found out things.

1173
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,100
You've got toys in the attic. Broken toys.

1174
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:47,780
And we'll hammer on you
until you cave in. Understand?

1175
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:51,100
- Or is your mind already gone?
- All right!

1176
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,780
Sit down. All of you.

1177
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,620
- Uncle Joe...
- Quiet.

1178
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,860
Go ahead.

1179
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:15,100
As l was about to say before the circus came to town,

1180
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,380
your uncle's holdings at their peak

1181
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:22,660
held a net - net, mind you -
financial value of just under $25 million.

1182
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:30,220
At the moment, however,
he is $95,000 in debt.

1183
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:43,620
- Wait a minute. He's...?
- ln debt beyond the value of his assets.

1184
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:51,220
The room, is it doing this?

1185
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,220
l fear this has come as a shock to you.

1186
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:01,540
No. Shitting a sailboat, that's a shock.
This is a fucking catastrophe!

1187
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,780
The trip to Washington
was not for a military contract.

1188
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:10,620
lt was to work out an arrangement
with the lRS to keep Joe out of jail.

1189
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:14,940
That has been accomplished,
but everything is lost.

1190
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:19,140
Plus some arrangement
must be made for the 95,000.

1191
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,620
How the hell do you lose $25 million?

1192
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,220
lt's easier than you think.

1193
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:33,940
l overextended, made loans,
some claims the government wouldn't allow.

1194
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:37,660
- The penalties were...
- Hold it. l don't believe this.

1195
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:40,580
lt's another one of his tricks.
A little test!

1196
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:43,300
l will put you in touch with the lRS.

1197
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:47,820
They'll give you a full accounting
as well as the lovely brochure for the auction.

1198
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:52,060
- Auction?
- They're taking my home.

1199
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:55,100
Damn it! Stupid, stupid!

1200
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:59,380
We played along!
We should've stepped in five years ago!

1201
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,580
Two would have been enough.

1202
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:04,500
You stupid, pathetic old man.

1203
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:07,220
Goddamn it Frank! One more word out of you,

1204
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:11,580
l'll kick your ass so high up
you'll take off your shirt to shit!

1205
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,620
Come on.

1206
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,100
Come on, bowling boy!

1207
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,420
Stop it!

1208
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,580
Frank, cut it out!

1209
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:33,140
- Stop! l've got a metal plate in my head.
- You do?

1210
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,100
No!

1211
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:40,460
- That's enough.
- Get security to the conference room.

1212
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,580
That's enough. Get over here.

1213
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,500
Meathead!

1214
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:49,140
You're insane, you know that?

1215
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:53,180
Me? For five years, l begged you,
let's put him in a home!

1216
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:58,420
No, you didn't want to. You didn't have
the balls! None of you have any balls!

1217
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,100
Frank?

1218
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:03,980
l've been waiting to do this a long time.

1219
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,020
Stop it.

1220
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:13,820
Come on.

1221
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:17,180
- l want them out of here!
- lt's all right!

1222
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:24,020
We were...

1223
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,780
We were just leaving, anyway.

1224
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,140
- What do we do now?
- Nothing!

1225
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:33,540
We wait around and dance at his funeral.

1226
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,260
You're still here.

1227
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,820
How long have you known you were broke?

1228
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,460
About a year.

1229
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:08,220
A year.

1230
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:14,700
So this whole time you were...what?
Schmucking with me? Every second.

1231
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,940
Danny, please, l had to find out,

1232
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:21,700
I had to know who'd take care of me
when they found out l had nothing.

1233
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,860
And care will be required.
Your uncle's condition is degenerative,

1234
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,900
and whoever assumes control
over his finances

1235
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,460
must oversee the liquidation of his assets,

1236
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,260
be responsible
for the outstanding balance,

1237
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,820
and, of course, there's our bill.

1238
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:41,700
We will need you to sign these papers.

1239
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,220
lf you'd just told me the truth.

1240
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:50,420
l mean, l'm not saying
l'm a perfect guy or anything,

1241
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:56,020
but then maybe l could have felt
some compassion, some responsibility.

1242
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,380
Just the truth!

1243
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:04,020
The truth is, l'm an old guy.
l'm broke. l need help.

1244
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:06,860
Not now! Then.

1245
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,060
Now's no good.

1246
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,900
Now's too late.

1247
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,180
l crawled. l begged.

1248
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,540
l lost my girlfriend.

1249
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,380
l hate that you did this.

1250
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:29,460
Danny, l had to.
l had to find out who loved me.

1251
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:33,460
- Who...
- Nobody. Nobody loved you.

1252
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:36,540
Why should they?

1253
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:44,540
What's there to love?
What about you is there to love?

1254
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:08,180
l want a camera on the kid's father
when the kid's shooting the free throws.

1255
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:12,340
lf he misses, the expression
on the dad's face is another Emmy.

1256
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,500
Find the dad.

1257
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:20,180
- Mike, go back.
- Hey!

1258
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,140
- Stop!
- Girlie, if you don't sit down...

1259
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,820
Will you shut up a second?

1260
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,860
[man] l'll meet you over there.

1261
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,180
What happened?

1262
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,580
Uncle Joe was broke.

1263
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:52,260
- Come on.
- Broke.

1264
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:56,660
No, not just broke. ln debt.

1265
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:01,540
Everybody pushing and shoving,
and all the time the trough was empty.

1266
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,060
When did l get so obsessed with money?

1267
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,500
When did that happen?

1268
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,940
l mean, you've known me for years.
l was never like that.

1269
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,900
Was l?

1270
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,900
No.

1271
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,980
- What's going to happen to him?
- Uncle Joe?

1272
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,140
l assume my cousins will hang him.

1273
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,140
No, really.

1274
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:36,660
Really.

1275
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,980
l don't know. l don't care.

1276
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,380
You don't?

1277
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,900
Allow me to face up to it.
l wasn't there for him.

1278
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,380
l was there for the money, boom.

1279
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:55,260
That time when you told me about the scrap yard,
he told you how scared he was to go into a home?

1280
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:58,540
You told me you felt sorry for him.

1281
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:00,620
l did.

1282
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:05,140
But don't you see? lt was an act.
He was putting on an act.

1283
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:08,860
- Anybody would have felt sorry for him.
- Even your cousins?

1284
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,820
[workman] Make sure you get
plenty of padding on there!

1285
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,220
Put it in last.

1286
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:27,620
Douglas. Douglas.

1287
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,900
Where's Uncle Joe?

1288
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:34,900
l couldn't say, sir.
l'm no longer in your uncle's employ.

1289
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:38,020
- What are you talking about?
- He can no longer pay my wages.

1290
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:42,100
Wages?
Don't you care what happens to him?

1291
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,460
Very droll, sir. Most amusing, sir.

1292
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:50,860
- Watch your back. Coming through.
- Where is he, in a nursing home?

1293
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,500
Out of the question. He can't afford it.

1294
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:57,820
Hey. What...? What's he going to do?

1295
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,780
He can go dance the hully-gully
for all l care. Good day, sir.

1296
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:31,780
[doctor being paged over tannoy]

1297
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,340
Where's your hat?

1298
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,700
Went in the auction. A buck's a buck.

1299
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:50,140
Your lawyer told me you were here.
What are you doing in the hospital?

1300
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,660
l didn't feel good, stupid.
Why else do u go to a hospital.

1301
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:56,380
- But a county ward?
- lt's all l can afford.

1302
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:02,740
lronic, huh?
l'm right back where my mother left me.

1303
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:07,620
You call me stupid. Work your way up
from nothing, from the street,

1304
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:10,700
you piss it all away.

1305
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,780
Did you just come to cheer me up, or what?

1306
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:18,140
- Come on. Where's all your crap?
- Huh?

1307
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:21,820
Your crap. Your stuff.. Your cloths.
They didn't bring you in naked, did they?

1308
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,300
- ln my bag.
- All right, come on, let's go.

1309
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:30,700
- Where?
- What, suddenly you're particular?

1310
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,900
You're coming with me.

1311
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,980
Robin and l are getting married.
We decided to adopt you.

1312
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,060
- You and Robin...?
- We wanted to start a family anyway.

1313
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:54,140
At least this way
we know what we're getting.

1314
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:01,940
Signed you up for Little League.
Don't embarrass me.

1315
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,980
My son.

1316
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,100
Okey-doke. Watch your fingers.

1317
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,340
Hi, honey, l'm home!
Look what the stork brought us.

1318
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,980
- Hi, Uncle Joe.
- Hello, Robin.

1319
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:52,340
Danny bought me a hat.

1320
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:54,500
Smart choice.

1321
01:39:55,540 --> 01:40:00,300
Well, this is my place,
and l think we'll all be very comfortable here.

1322
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,340
- Would you like to see your room?
- Sure.

1323
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:07,220
- Great.
- Here we go.

1324
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:19,060
There's a bed coming, and furniture.
We can squeeze this stuff into our room.

1325
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:23,580
- What do you think?
- l don't like it.

1326
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:28,140
- Robin went to a lot of trouble here.
- Sorry. l don't like it.

1327
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:34,540
Well...we could trade rooms.

1328
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,780
Come here.

1329
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:50,580
Danny and l will stay in there
and you can have this room. How about that?

1330
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,620
l don't like it.

1331
01:40:56,820 --> 01:41:00,820
lt's probably temporary.
ln a year or so, Danny and l will buy a house.

1332
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,460
l won't like it.

1333
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,660
He's great, isn't he?

1334
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:09,500
He's like corn
that gets stuck in your teeth.

1335
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:12,940
You keep sucking on it to get it out
but you can't!

1336
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:20,460
l'd like to go back to my mansion.
l love my mansion.

1337
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,700
Oh, God.

1338
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,860
Try to understand, OK?

1339
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:33,260
lt's gone.

1340
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:38,220
Everything is gone.

1341
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:42,820
You don't have your house.
You don't have your money.

1342
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:47,580
You don't have the scrapyard.
You don't even have your hat.

1343
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,460
Look out the window.

1344
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,620
Go ahead.

1345
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:33,180
- You're not broke, are you, Uncle Joe?
- l am richer than shit.

1346
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:42,060
Your attorneys, them hauling
your furniture out of your house...you sitting in that ward?

1347
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:47,220
You put on a show for me.
The lawyers and l put on a show for you.

1348
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,580
l knew that guy wasn't your father.
Think l'm an idiot?

1349
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:54,340
And do you think l'm stupid enough
to lose my money?

1350
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:58,140
But why? l mean, why would you
make something like that up?

1351
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:02,860
l had to know who really loves me, huh?

1352
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:08,460
l found Molly. l like her, she's a nice kid.

1353
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:11,700
Well, shall we go?

1354
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,340
l want you two to live with me.

1355
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:19,380
Not just live with me.
Whatever l own, you own.

1356
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,580
What's mine is yours. Ready?

1357
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,700
- l don't know what to say. lt's...
- No. No, wait, no!

1358
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,820
You can't do this to people.

1359
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:35,780
You can't lie and fake and manipulate.
l won't accept that.

1360
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:40,020
- So you don't want to live with me?
