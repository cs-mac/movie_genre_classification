<i>[PLEASE COME BACK, MISTER]</i>

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,500
Get out of here right now!

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,800
Why? I thought you said
that you were lonely!

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,290
I'll make sure that you
never feel lonely again!

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,510
Live with me. Okay?

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,300
Let's live together.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,910
Do you think I came back here
just to get my payment?

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm the Branch Manager
at Sunjin Department Store.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,610
Also, I'm not sure if you're aware,
but I'm Chairman Cha's son

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,510
who he's been keeping hidden.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,580
Wow, Mr. Young Soo
was such a wonderful guy!

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,270
To think that he'd keep my existence
a secret from his family, too!

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,180
For me, who's lived
as a loner all my life.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,870
Mr. Young Soo's family was
pretty much what I'd always wanted!

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,470
I was always so jealous of him for that.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,480
Oh, so that's why you couldn't call
your father or brother by those titles.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,870
Yes, Father!
That's why I had to treat.

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,080
Mr. Young Soo's family affairs
as if they were my own.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,580
I can have a place to stay comfortably,
and you don't have to sell your home!

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,580
It's a win-win situation!

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,080
Go to a hotel since you have
so much money!

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,300
Since I'm the Branch Manager

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,780
I need to set an example
for others and not spend frivolously.

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,970
I'm completely against it.

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,470
The fact that a stranger is in my
home makes me uncomfortable

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,670
and I don't want to have to deal
with you at home, too.

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,670
No can do. No way.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,280
No. If I'm satisfied with your service,
I can throw in a bonus.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,670
If I feel satisfied here,
I'll give you more for rent.

30
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,170
Or I'll take some money off your debt.

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,170
Then, we don't have to move
and I don't have to transfer schools!

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,670
Right? Right, Mom?

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,280
I like it!

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,760
But... won't satisfaction
be quite subjective?

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,780
I'm not one who is
stingy with compliments.

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,370
Oh!

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,370
Every time you feel satisfied, you
can put a sticker of praise here.

38
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,720
- Right?
- All right.

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,030
If this whole sheet is filled up

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,570
I'll render all your interest null
and void, and pay you rent!

41
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,470
I'm not someone who's obsessed
with asking for money, you know.

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,970
Mommy... please?

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,280
Fine. But in exchange, you're leaving
this house when that sheet is filled up!

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm quite picky when it comes
to food, so just cook as you usually do.

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,570
Also, treat me like I'm family.
That's all I want.

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,180
Here.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,180
What are you doing? Take it already!

48
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,570
What's this?

49
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,370
My rent for two months,
in advance.

50
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,070
Use this to pay back your debt.

51
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,370
There needs to be a house
if I'm going to be staying here!

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,510
Um...

53
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,180
Thanks, at any rate.

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,370
And what's with this
"at any rate" business, huh?

55
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,280
If you're thankful, can you
make me a cup of coffee?

56
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,020
<i>[EPISODE 9]</i>

57
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,780
And what are you doing?

58
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,280
Oh, good thing you're here!

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,580
Don't worry about anything,
and just come at me.

60
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,970
Come at me!

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,470
I heard you went to Cha Jae Gook's house.

62
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,780
Please, stop messing around.

63
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
No, you stop messing around.

64
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,470
You're the one who handed Yoo Hyuk
over to Na Suk Chul, right?

65
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,960
Don't worry about it.

66
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,080
Yoo Hyuk said he'd live righteously
but you dragged him into a life of sin.

67
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,580
Do you really feel okay with
yourself after having done that?

68
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,380
I want to tell you to go your own way

69
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,780
but then I'd be worried for
Song Lee Yeon without you around.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,780
It's a bit complicated now,
but just wait for a bit.

71
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,700
I'll get your store back
for you guys, too.

72
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,580
What the hell? Do you and your brother
take pride in being nosy?

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,470
Leave.

74
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,170
Don't worry. I'm going to leave
in a month even if you beg me not to.

75
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,170
Well, that's good.

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,380
What the heck? Why are they so quiet?

77
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,470
How motherly of her.

78
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,080
Ah, this is nice.

79
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,080
Ah, this feels so nice.

I missed these sounds.

Excuse me. Excuse me!

88
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,280
I really can't deal with this anymore.

89
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,670
Oh, Honey! I had a crazy
dream last night!

90

In my dream, I died, but...

91
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Are... are you okay?

92
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,280
<i>I feel like this scary dream in which
you don't recognize me will never end.</i>

93
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,380
<i>Because I'm dead.</i>

94
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,780
Seriously?

95
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,170
Did someone ask you to prepare
something extravagant?

96
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,170
I told you to just prepare
what you usually do!

97
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,670
This is how we usually eat.

98
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,380
As if! The table's legs look like
they'll break from the pressure!

99
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,570
Are you really going to
continue acting this way?

100
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,380
You know, she's been preparing all
this since really early in the morning.

101
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,430
Just let her off the hook.

102
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,980
Exactly, Father! Why do you
keep treating me like an outsider?

103
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Would family be treating
each other like this?

104
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,240
Happy?

105
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,070
Mister... what about the grape stickers?

106
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,280
Grape stickers?
As if!

107
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,670
When have beef and fish ever been on
the same table together in this house?

108
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,280
You shouldn't treat people
like they're strangers!

109
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,260
Whoa! Is this your car, Mister?

110
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,880
- Of course! Get in!
- Awesome! Yay!

- This is so fun!
- Yay!

"I gained five kilograms, so here."

That's what you said
when you gave them to me.

116
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,880
What, do you want them back?

117
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,280
Take them off.

118
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,480
Wow, you're so pretty, Thunder Girl!

119
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,480
Switch with me.

Wow!

121
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,670
But, you know, this place is familiar.

122
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,880
What?

123
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,380
What the hell?

Branch Manager? I think you've
misunderstood something about me.

130
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,480
I've never received a bribe
in my entire life.

131
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,070
Because my family lives abroad
and I'm the sole breadwinner

132
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,170
I may have received
a teeny, tiny one, just once...

Why not save those excuses
for President Cha instead?

134
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,880
Well, he's the type to say that our

All right! Play, all of you! Play!

No... um, I mean, yes.

Sir, retail workers cannot be sitting!

No, sir.

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,070
Take care of yourself.
Your legs hurt? Sit down!

157
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,570
Hungry? Eat!
Sleepy? Sleep.

158
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,080
What's up with him?

159
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,170
I heard that he was using a dead
person to try and be President, but...

160
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,280
What are you saying? He's the savior
of the wronged! A lion of justice!

161
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,570
He's totally my type!

162
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,170
He's the first superior I've had
who worried about my hip!

163
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,380
Are you still mad at me?

164
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,070
Ms. Wang Joo Yeon.

165
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,570
If you have time to be doing this,
spend more time honing your craft

166
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,070
instead of stumbling over
your lines again!

167
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:52,070
You have a special guest
here today. Come and see.

168
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,670
Hello, Director!

169
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,160
Oh, Ms. Song. Is this minor
role really okay with you?

170
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,690
Of course! I've been
a star since my debut

171
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,170
so I've always wanted to try
taking on a minor role like this.

172
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,880
But is it really okay, especially
at this department store?

173
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,580
I'm okay. That's okay!
I'm fine, really!

174
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,770
Me too!

175
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,970
Why is this woman so late, damn it?

176
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,580
Branch Manager, I've
brought the products.

177
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,080
We're late.
We're late! Come here!

178
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,380
- But where are we going?
- Just get in!

179
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,380
I'm buying you
an amazing lunch today.

180
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,770
But if we're late, they'll
be no spots, so let's hurry.

181
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,580
What are you doing? Come on.

182
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,270
Welcome.

183
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,880
Is this the spot where you
ate with Manager Jung?

184
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,770
What did you eat?
Order the same thing you two did.

185
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,970
What are you doing?

186
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,510
I'm not here to play. You need to know
my tastes so you can adjust accordingly.

187
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,270
Understand?
Excuse me.

188
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,580
- Please enjoy.
- Let's eat.

189
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,670
It's been so long since just
the two of us have had a meal.

190
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,080
This is the first time, though.

191
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,080
There was always someone
who'd watch over me when I ate.

192
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,080
Give me meat.

193
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:15,104

From now on, let's have
meals together often.

195
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,270
What's with this shoddy look?

196
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,260
You're going to walk around my
department store dressed like that?

197
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,770
What's wrong with my look?

198
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,080
Do I look too beautiful?

199
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,380
I guess you have no shred
of pride or refinement left now, huh?

200
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,080
I never threw away my refinement.

201
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,270
What are you so damn confident about?

202
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,470
All right, good work!
I'm the Branch Manager!

203
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,580
Han!

204
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,880
Oh, you're here. So, how is it
living at the house? Is it doable?

205
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,170
Well, you know. Kind of, yeah.

206
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,770
What, are you being kept up all night?

207
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,320
I've progressed a bit.
We just had lunch together.

208
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,080
Oh, nice! What did you have?

209
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,670
Spicy beef soup!

210
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,470
- Geez! You idiot.
- What?

211
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,470
She said that she likes it!

212
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,670
Do I need to beat some sense
into you? Get over here!

213
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,970
- You idiot!
- No, stop!

214
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,080
- No, stop! Ow!
- You punk!

215
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,770
The kid is watching!

216
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,620
Where did you leave the kid
while you're prancing about like this?

217
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,970
Dad!

218
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,970
Oh, uh, Cha Young Chan!

219
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,270
Um, what's going on?

220
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,580
Young Chan came to see Mommy
working at Daddy's company!

221
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,770
Uncle gave me this. This.

222
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,270
<i>[HEART SIGN]</i>

223
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,770
Oh, really? Wow, he made
you such a great thing!

224
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,580
I'll have a good shoot and go,
so don't worry about me.

225
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,880
Let's go.

226
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,770
Let's leave our families
out of this, shall we?

227
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,880
Did someone who knows the importance
of family do that to Kim Young Soo?

228
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,380
All right. Ready, action!

229
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,270
Give me just one chance.

230
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,970
Looks nice. Those clothes
really do suit you.

231
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,270
Don't be depressed, and
live your life as best as you can.

232
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,880
And don't ever appear
before me ever again.

233
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,970
Why, I ought to...

234
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,470
And just what kind of trouble are
you planning to cause this time?

235
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,080
Let go, damn it!

236
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,670
Those clothes really do suit you.

237
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,880
Don't be depressed, and
live your life as best as you can.

238
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,970
Huh? What is this?
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

239
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,470
Move back! I said, move back!

240
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,080
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

241
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,180
Ms. Song! You're beautiful!

242
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,580
Good luck! You're beautiful!

243
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,470
All right. Ready? Action!

244
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,880
- Director!
- Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

245
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,470
- Hey, come to your senses!
- Yes, sorry, sir.

246
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,080
Wow, you're totally stealing the show!

247
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,040
- Right?
- What are you talking about?

248
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,380
You're so much prettier
than the main character!

249
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,320
You're sexy, adorable,
elegant, and confident!

250
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,170
You're the best. Seriously!
Oh, you're so pretty.

251
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,470
Should I put a stop to the shoot?

252
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,770
No, just leave them as they are.

253
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,670
- Over here.
- Here?

Ma'am. What's for dinner tonight?

257
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,080
Branch Manager,
what are you talking about?

258
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,770
Should we go home together today?

259
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,440
No, sir. That's fine.

260
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,270
Won't it be scary, going home
alone? Won't you be lonely?

261
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,580
Can't this be construed
as sexual harassment?

262
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,580
- What did you say?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

263
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,170
Follow me.

264
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,380
Um, fine.

265
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,670
- Hey. Lee Hae Joon.
- Y-yes, ma'am?

266
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,020
Do I look like a pushover to you?

267
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,080
Is that why you're following me
around and being annoying?

268
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Being... annoying?

269
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,880
Yeah, being annoying.
I was trying to let you off the hook

270
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,380
because I need to get by,
but I can't take it anymore.

271
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,670
Is being an asshole a
prerequisite for being affluent?

272
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,770
My husband is the one who
has a debt to you, not me!

273
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,380
I don't owe you anything.

274
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,670
Dissatisfied? Then fire me.
Or get out of my house!

275
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,470
No, ma'am.

276
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,580
Also, how old are you?

277
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,580
A teensy bit younger than you...

278
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,080
You don't even look that old, and
yet you keep talking down to me?

279
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,380
Watch yourself, punk.

280
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,670
Oh, get out of my way!
I'm leaving.

281
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,880
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry.

282
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,470
Wow, she's so passionate...
No, no! Stop!

283
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,380
Good job, Shin Da Hye. You have to
show him that you're not a pushover!

284
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,670
But, he won't fire me, will he?

285
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,170
Ow!

286
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,670
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

287
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,380
- Then, excuse me!
- Ah, yes. You too.

288
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,100
To be called out to the department
store... this is a real honor. sir.

289
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,880
What's with that girl, Hong Nan?

290
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,770
What's her relationship with Lee Hae Joon
that she and Song Lee Yeon

291
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,660
hang out together all the time?

292
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,680
Actually, I have a guy who
used to work for Han Gi Tak...

293
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,770
- Han Gi Tak?
- Yes.

294
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,940
He said that that's his younger sister.
They grew up at the orphanage together.

295
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,380
I'll look into it more carefully, sir.

296
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,270
But, sir. Is the selling of the
department store going well?

297
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,470
I don't think that's a question
that's proper for you to be asking me.

298
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,970
But still, it's good for me
if you're doing well!

299
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,670
And there's the franchise agreement
that you promised me.

300
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,580
Our business started
as a construction business

301
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,670
so we have a very
strongly established foundation...

302
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,380
Save that spiel for
your other thug buddies.

303
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,270
Also, if you have time to try and
aggravate me by talking about such things

304
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:02,580
manage your men better.
What a joke.

305
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,880
See you again, sir.

306
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,770
Oh yeah, also, don't just
appear out of nowhere.

307
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,880
I thought you were a discarded newspaper,
and almost walked all over you.

309
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,770
Wow, he's stepping all over me
oh so nicely today, too.

310
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,270
What do you mean, a newspaper?

311
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,270
I'm a refrigerator box,
at the very least.

312
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,470
That bastard.
He sure is charismatic.

313
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,470
All right, here!

314
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,970
It's my first time eating
spicy rice cakes at a place like this!

315
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,970
Wow, they're so good!
Here, Young Chan!

316
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,580
How is it?

317
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,770
- It's so good!
- Really?

318
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,580
Eat up, my child!

319
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,080
It doesn't take much to get
you two excited, does it?

320
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:18,870
You worked so hard today,
Ms. Song! Here, eat up!

321
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,170
Eat! Here, have some more!
Here! Say "ah!"

322
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,880
- Oh, so pretty!
- Stop feeding me!

323
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,970
Here's some for our Seung Jae,
too! Here, say "ah"!

324
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,770
Say "ah", punk!

325
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,670
Oh, Manager.

326
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,470
Sit down.

327
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,170
Just a minute, okay?

328
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,670
The incident with Han Na's dad
has caused you a lot of grief, right?

329
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:38,170
It was my mistake. If I caused
a misunderstanding, I'm sorry.

330
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,570
She was totally getting
the Cinderella treatment!

331
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,170
<i>So did you just turn around
like an idiot, Kim Young Soo?</i>

332
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,270
What was I supposed to do?

333
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:02,970
You know, that day 10 years ago
when Lee Yeon ran off to that bastard...

334
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,870
Is it good, honey?

335
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,170
I still regret it, and wonder

336
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:12,270
what would've happened if
I'd been a less cowardly man?

337
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,270
Hey! Are you going to lose her to another
guy and shed tears of blood, like me?

338
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,980
What do you mean,
lose her to another guy?

339
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Go get her, like a real man! At least
you're not stuck in a woman's body!

340
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,480
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

341
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,570
Yeah. I'm not Kim Young Soo
anymore. I'm Lee Hae Joon now.

342
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,480
Ms. Shin Da Hye.

343
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,570
Why is that guy here?

344
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,270
- Listen closely to what I'm saying.
- Sure, sure.

345
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,480
I'm planning to prepare
a nice grassy meal for dinner.

346
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,670
I won't just wait for you
to look at me anymore.

347
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,270
Don't wait. I'm not going
home with you.

348
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:08,370
- Ms. Shin Da Hye.
- I'm begging you.

349
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,170
Leave me alone.

350
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,620
If I were going to do that,
I wouldn't have bothered to come here.

351
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:54,770
Are you okay?
Ow! Ow!

352
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,980
- Let go! Ow!
- Ow!

353
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,910
That's not what I meant to do!

354
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,670
Here, here!

355
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,770
Just why are you doing this to me?

356
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Wasn't it nice?

357
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,170
You crazy bastard.

358
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,570
Hey! You cursed at me! Hey!

359
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,370
Damn it, I'm going to go crazy!

360
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Han! I did what you said
and dislocated my wife's hip!

361
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,170
I told you to do it like a man.
I never told you to dislocate her hip!

362
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,980
Really? So, what should I do?

363
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,070
You don't have time to
do things step by step.

364
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,870
Do everything that you
couldn't do for her before.

365
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,370
It's just a dream,
but it still tastes so great.

366
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,270
Good morning!

367
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,770
What is all this?

368
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,170
A present for you! The store is closed
today, so don't worry and just relax.

369
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,770
All right, you cook, and you clean!

370
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,870
Let's get going, people!
Oh, put this in the living room.

371
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,870
Wait, there's no space.
Second floor it is, then!

372
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,170
All right, move, move, move!

373
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,570
All right, when your hip hurts,
come upstairs and do this.

374
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,480
Sit here, and settle in.

375
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,770
Ah, ah, feels so nice.

376
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,480
Father, feel free to come upstairs
whenever your hip hurts, too!

377
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,670
Hey! I don't like other people barging
in and disturbing the order of my home!

378
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,170
Send all these people out, right now!

379
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,210
- Um...
- All right.

380
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,600
We'll do everything ourselves,
so just sit back and relax.

381
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,270
Yes, child. We'll take care of it!

382
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,170
Wow, it's all finished!

383

384
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,370
- It's a bit bland.
- No, no!

385
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,370
- It won't be salty!
- No, no more!

386
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:24,270
All right, time to put
Han Na in now! Let's go!

387
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,870
All right!

388
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,980
Hey, spar with me! Come on!

389
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,980
You scared? Huh? Taste my fists of steel!

390
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Help me with these.

391
00:40:54,370 --> 00:41:00,410
Hey, Honey! What? You put
mayonnaise in fermented soybean stew

392
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,370
and you want to know how
to make it good again?

393
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,620
What the hell... that's the kiss
of death for that stew.

394
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,500
There's no way you can make that taste
good even if Ms. Maya intervened.

395
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,350
You weren't satisfied
with putting out her hip

396
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,570
so you want to rid her
of her sense of taste, too?

397
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,070
Oh, whatever.
I'll take care of it for you.

398
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,370
I'll be right there.

399
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:21,070
Are you crazy? You're going to some
person's place to make them food?

400
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,980
No! You can't hang out
with the Cha family.

401
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,370
No, that's not it. I have to save
an idiot from utter culinary failure.

402
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,170
I guess you can call it loyalty.

403
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,570
Loyalty, my ass.

404
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:39,270
That won't do. I need to see what kind
of person he is with my own two eyes.

405
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,340
Wait, where are you two going? Hey!

406
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,670
- Hello, Father!
- Oh, yes.

407
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,480
This is the nationally famous
actress, Ms. Song Lee Yeon.

408
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,570
- You know of her, correct?
- Hello.

409
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,980
Oh, yes! Yes!

410
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,670
This is, um, really not a stranger.
How do I put this...

411
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,670
Er, um, she's a friend
who's like family to me!

412
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,070
- She's my only friend.
- Yes!

413
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,870
Yes, Missus! We're just friends.

414
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,170
I did well, right, honey?

415
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,870
- Ta-da!
- She doesn't like flowers.

416
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,870
- Wow, they're so pretty!
- Oh, so she does like them!

417
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,480
All right, then. Shall I go
and assess the situation?

418
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,570
Where's the kitchen?

419
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,480
Wow, you're so fast!

420
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,870
I actually used to be a chef...

421
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,170
I mean, I have the blood
of a chef in me! Yeah!

422
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,370
- Right?
- But, um...

423
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,270
Why do you live here, Branch Manager?

424
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,480
- That's because...
- He's a loan shark.

425
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,270
He's afraid we're going to sell
the house and run off so he moved in.

426
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,370
That entire family is like that.

427
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:57,570
You know, I know this guy
quite well, and he's really...

428
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,370
No second chances, all right?

429
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,670
Yes, sir.

430
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:07,670
He has tons of good traits!
For example, um... um! Um!

431
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,170
Oh yeah. He's really good-looking.

432
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:20,170
And he's so tall. And on top of that,
he has chocolate abs!

433
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,270
And the most important thing is that
this place right here, is, you know...

434
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,770
is a total weapon of mass destruction...

435
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,370
What is wrong with you?

436
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,370
And this is the bird's name.

437
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,270
Goose, crested ibis, pigeon

438
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,980
seagull, woodpecker, and... huh?

439
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,670
Brown-eared bulbul?

440
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,070
Food is all about that
handmade taste!

441
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,980
- Say "ah"!
- Ah!

442
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,830
Wow, you're shooting a melodramatic
movie at someone else's house, huh?

443
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,870
Mom, what's a brown-eared bulbul?

444
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:03,270
- What do I do?
- Brown-eared bulbul!

445
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,170
What did you say?

446
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,480
A brown-eared bulbul is a
close friend of sparrows!

447
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,980
Oh, men....

448
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,170
No, no, you can't!

449
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,870
No! Share them before you delete them!

450
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,480
No! This is my own private affair!

451
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,270
- Whatever!
- No! No!

452
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,670
- No!
- Get out of my way!

453
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,170
Not this! No!

454
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,670
You bastard!

455
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:59,980
Wow, how could you use
this sort of strategy?

456
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,370
Um, what are they doing in there?

457
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,480
Honey, want to have a drink with me?

458
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,170
You can't, ma'am.

459
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,980
Huh? What are those noises?

460
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,270
- Ah, Roxie!
- Ah!

461
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:49,270
Don't do it. Don't erase it.

462
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,070
Why are you doing this again?

463
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,270
Share it with me.

464
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,770
Don't do this to me. I'm spoken for!

465
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,480
- Want to be friends with me?
- Excuse me?

466
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,670
You don't have any friends, right?
I don't have any, either.

467
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,980
Oh, sure.

468
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,910
<i>[WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE THIS FOLDER?]</i>
I just want to watch it with you!

469
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,480
Is that so hard? Huh?

470
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,670
No!

471
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,980
That's something that I really needed.

472
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,480
I keep questioning my own identity.

473
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:37,370
Look at me. I'm on the brink of insanity!

474
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,770
I'll get you something
else, I promise. Don't cry.

475
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,670
Who's crying?

476
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:15,870
18 plus 5 is?

477
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,670
23!

478
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,870
- Wow, Young Chan!
- That's correct!

479
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,370
Wow, you're so good at playing
with younger kids, Han Na!

480
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:30,670
Young Chan is so cute! I wanted
a younger sibling just like him.

481
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,980
My dad said that it was okay if
I didn't have younger siblings.

482
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,980
He said he didn't want to share the
love he had for me with another child.

483
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,170
He said that he just needed me.

484
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:53,370
I see. So, you can be his big sister.

485
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,480
Really? Is that really okay?

486
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,770
Of course. You'd like that
too, right, Young Chan?

487
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,770
Yes.

488
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,570
Time to eat! Let's eat!

489
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:09,480
- Father, take this.
- Ah, yes. Thanks.

490
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,670
Have some of this, Han Na.

491
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,370
- Eat up.
- Okay.

492
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,070
Is it good?

493
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,980
And here's some chicken.

494
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,670
Eat up and get big and strong, okay?

495
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,070
Does that taste good?

496
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:47,570
- Eat up, Mister!
- Oh, thanks!

497
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,170
What? You don't like carrots?

498
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:02,170
No, I'm really good at eating them!
Here, Han Na. You eat up, too.

499
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:08,270
Okay! Wow, it tastes so good!

500
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,980
Father, have some of this.

501
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,670
Oh, Han Na should be the one
to eat something so delicious!

502
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,480
Here, eat up. You like fish, after all.

503
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,670
Okay. Mom, eat up since your hip hurts.

504
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:38,270
Oh, what a cutie you are.
No, you have it, Han Na!

505
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,370
No, you have it, Mom!

506
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:46,480
What are you doing, not eating?
You still have a lot of growing to do!

507
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,980
Hurry and eat up!

508
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,370
Uh, yes.

509
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,980
Oh, Father, if he grows any more,
he'll shoot through the ceiling!

510
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,770
Well, we can just use him as
a telephone pole, then!

511
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:07,370
Then I'll leave him behind,
so you can use him as a telephone pole!

512
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,870
Eat up, all of you!

513
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:28,480
Um, did your husband work
at Sunjin, by any chance?

514
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,070
Yes.

515
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,170
He's the only one who treated me kindly

516
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,370
when I was a star and
also when I was a divorcee.

517
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,770
Well, I guess there's one
other person who did, too.

518
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,870
Mr. Lee Hae Joon.

519
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,980
Yes, like that. Yep, just like that.

520
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,170
Good job, my Han Na! Yep, just like that.

521
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,370
No, you cut that one too short.

522
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,270
One more time. Good! Here, too.

523
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,770
Wow, good job!

524
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,670
Um, I'll bid you farewell
here and go now.

525
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:19,980
Those weren't empty words.
We're really friends now, okay?

526
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,370
Please come over again!

527
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,670
See you again, Missus!

528
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,480
What do you mean, see you again?

529
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,100
Let's go.

530
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,410
- Have a safe trip home.
- Yes.

531
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,270
- Get some rest.
- Goodbye!

532
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,070
Let's go back home, too...

533
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,570
Let's have a drink somewhere
before we go back home.

534
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,070
Don't worry about Han Na and Father.

535
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,370
They're the type to fall
asleep quickly, anyway.

536
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,670
I don't want to eat alone.

537
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,570
Then I'll choose what we eat.

538
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,980
Sure.

539
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,270
You know, about Mr. Pathetic...
He seems like a nice guy.

540
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:15,170
Right? He really is an okay fellow.

541
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,070
- But not him.
- What do you mean?

542
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,870
Don't get involved
with the people at Sunjin.

543
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,570
I don't want to see you get
tangled up with them too...

544
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,170
Me, together with Mr. Pathetic? Never.

545
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,370
Then, what is it?

546
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:38,670
Does he like that woman?

547
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:45,370
In truth, he was quite close
with her deceased husband.

548
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,370
Is this "My Mother and
Her Guest", or something?

549
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:04,070
Mister, do you like
hard boiled eggs, too?

550
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,170
I like hard-boiled eggs, too.

551
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,770
How about I hold you tight
for the first time in a while?

552
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,480
Mister, I think that my rib broke.

553
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,980
Let's date, honey.

554
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,170
Oh, you're so cool!

555
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,770
This Big Bro of yours
will hold you tight.

556
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,480
Oh my!

557
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,570
Come over here! I'll hold you
so tight that your ribs break!

558
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:49,980
Get over here!

559
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,570
They make a really good
pork cartilage dish here.

560
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:59,480
- I don't like pork.
- But you like pork belly.

561
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,270
Pork belly? My husband liked it.
I didn't really like it.

562
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,570
- Can I get chicken feet?
- Yes.

563
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,980
Do you keep in touch with your family?

564
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,270
My mother passed away
when I was very young

565
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:46,480
and I do have a father,
but I can't call him that.

566
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,980
What about a person that you love?

567
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,070
I did have one.

568
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,270
I thought that this person and I went
well together, for about 10 years.

569
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:02,370
But I don't think it was
the case for the other person.

570
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:09,870
If everything I knew was a lie,
what becomes of my love?

571
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,980
The other person just did whatever
they could to satisfy you, is all.

572
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:18,370
Wouldn't it have been hard on them,
if it was that way for 10 years?

573
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,170
You're different from
what I heard about you, too.

574
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,870
What did he say about me?

575
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,370
That you couldn't hold your liquor.

576
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,870
It's not that I can't.
It's just that I didn't drink.

577
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,870
Three glasses do the trick
when I can't fall asleep, though.

578
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,980
Ow, that hurts!

579
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:59,980
Despite what he said,
please don't bother us

580
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,170
when we're getting
our lives back together.

581
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,170
I'm sure that you'll be happy
after playing hero for a bit

582
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,870
but for us, this is our everyday life.

583
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,870
We are the people who have
to live on without Young Soo.

584
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,480
And who will take his place?

585
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,370
- That's none of your...
- Can't I take his place?

586
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:29,170
Can't... I like you, ma'am?

587
