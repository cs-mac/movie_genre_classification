1
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,281
...A subordinate adverbial clause

2
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,561
of condition.

3
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,441
How do we express a condition?

4
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,441
Know what a condition is?

5
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:43,641
Yes, the conditional.

6
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,841
No...they're not the same at all.

7
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,721
French can be illogical,
as we'll see.

8
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,161
Let's take a simple example:

9
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:55,561
You want to go bicycle riding.
There's a condition.

10
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,801
For example, on condition
the weather's nice. OK?

11
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,121
Nice weather is
a condition of the outing.

12
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:07,401
So what would you say?
"I'll go riding..."

13
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,041
Complete the sentence.

14
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,641
"On condition it's nice."

15
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,681
Good. Very good.

16
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:16,681
That's called
a "conjunctional phrase".

17
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,601
It's a bit complicated.

18
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:24,401
We prefer to use
a very simple conjunction,

19
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:29,641
a two-letter word.
See what I mean? "We'll go riding...?

20
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:30,601
"If it's nice".

21
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,361
Very good. Very, very good.

22
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,481
Nice work!

23
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,601
"If it's nice".

24
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:41,401
That's what we call
a subordinate adverbial clause,

25
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:45,481
and subordinate adverbial
clauses usually begin with...?

26
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,241
- If!
- Nice work!

27
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,761
<i>CHAPTER I.</i>

28
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:53,161
<i>If, on the eve of the local elections,</i>

29
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,281
<i>the President's majority
hadn't become a minority...</i>

30
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,161
Because...

31
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,881
the vast importance
of the work you're doing

32
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,161
in a slightly underground
but thoroughly visible way

33
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:31,361
through your newspaper

34
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:35,081
has to be deciphered,
read between the lines,

35
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:39,161
interpreted according to the intent,

36
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:42,441
or perhaps the lack of intent
of your work.

37
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:47,241
At the same time,
events will be decisive.

38
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:51,881
We'll see what the President does,
what the party does,

39
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,961
and there's the intangible...

40
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,401
There are no intangibles...

41
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:01,001
Your "intangible"
is the secret service...

42
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,601
France is conservative.

43
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:05,281
Luckily. If not, where would we be?

44
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,801
Our socialist President
is a far rightist, in my view...

45
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,121
That's your opinion, and...

46
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,921
And not yours?

47
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:16,521
You know it's not.
Let's be serious.

48
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:21,441
We're serious.
Our meeting is serious.

49
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:26,201
Who knows if
it wasn't...predetermined.

50
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:28,081
I read your letter...

51
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,161
Hello, Mrs. Blanchet.

52
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,681
Hello, Mayor.

53
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,161
- How are you this morning?
- Fine.

54
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,161
<i>CHAPTER II</i>

55
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,801
<i>If Julien, after his defeat,</i>

56
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:59,241
<i>had not suddenly fallen
for novelist Berenice Beaurivage...</i>

57
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,121
You're wasting your time here.

58
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:14,681
If you want to be
our Member of Parliament

59
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,441
you know it's no use
operating here,

60
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,161
That's why you're
so busy in Paris, right?

61
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,481
- Yes.
- Paris first.

62
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,601
True, more so than I'd prefer.

63
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:27,521
Unfortunately,
I must also attain national status.

64
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,681
But to go national, I must

65
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,961
first acquire a local base.
That's what I've done.

66
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,361
Then don't hang around here,
do your scheming in Paris.

67
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:48,241
I hate to scheme. I'd rather
woo my voters than the party bosses.

68
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,361
And if the party rejects you?

69
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:53,441
It won't if I'm strong,
and my strength is here.

70
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:56,961
My standing is way up.
I know how to make allies.

71
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,641
- The ecologists?
- Yes.

72
00:04:58,801 --> 00:04:59,561
Watch out!

73
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,561
They're good people,
whatever you think!

74
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,481
Sure, everyone loves them.

75
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,041
If I lose the first time,
I'll win next time.

76
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,961
I'd rather fight
while doing what I enjoy,

77
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:15,361
breathing clean air,
in a place I like, with people I respect

78
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,881
instead of doing things
that bore me, with people

79
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,481
I don't even like!

80
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:23,521
If the bosses heard you!

81
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,921
I don't just mean
the bosses and eggheads,

82
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,201
I mean politicians in general,
friends or foes.

83
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:33,761
I'm not in politics
to be like everyone else.

84
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,441
The day of the party hack is over.

85
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:41,081
People are sick of
wheeler-dealers and fancy oratory.

86
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,361
What's funny?

87
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:50,641
Because...such ideas...
You ever tried growing a beard?

88
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,761
What's that got to do With it?

89
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,361
Nothing...

90
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:59,041
It just came to mind.

91
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:01,761
A beard's a good test:

92
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:06,081
if you're a con artist,
it makes you look like Bluebeard.

93
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:07,921
But it makes an idealist

94
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:10,601
look like Christ.

95
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:14,001
And me?

96
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:15,681
Well...

97
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:23,681
Look! They're wonderful!

98
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:29,281
Don't run. Want me to imitate
a turkey call?

99
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,281
Amazing! .

100
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,961
They're well trained.
Let me try it.

101
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,001
Those white flowers!

102
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,121
Pretty, eh? They're clematis.

103
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:57,721
That's an Armandi clematis,
the longest-lasting.

104
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,281
Apple trees!

105
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,801
They're pear trees, doll.

106
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,001
No pears?

107
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,641
Not yet. In late July.

108
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,441
No apples or pears
on any of the trees?

109
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:13,561
Of course not. Use your head:

110
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:16,041
They're not even in full bloom yet.

111
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,721
But you can buy pears all year round.

112
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:21,481
They're hothouse pears.

113
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,681
Lettuce!

114
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,681
I've never seen one growing.

115
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,161
I see them in cellophane
at the store.

116
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:34,321
I'm going to plant
them along that wall.

117
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,321
What's that?

118
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,761
Madonna lilies. Pretty, huh?

119
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,521
30 pretty!

120
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,241
I'd like to wear them
in my hair in the evening.

121
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,241
Gorgeous!

122
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,121
You'd look cute that way.

123
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,281
Smell. It's sage.

124
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,081
And those?

125
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:57,001
Those are lupines, this is sage,
over there is sorrel.

126
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,361
Sorrel?

127
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,601
- Pretty, eh?
- You seldom eat it.

128
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,801
Strawberries.

129
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,441
They're fabulous!

130
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,761
Look at that! Incredible!

131
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:17,161
They're bull calves. We'll give them...
know what this is? Corn.

132
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:21,761
It's like touching
prehistoric beasts.

133
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:23,921
Really!

134
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,081
I brought some parsley.

135
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,961
- They'll eat it.
- They love it.

136
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,001
Here.

137
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:30,841
Here, baby.

138
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,161
He has tiny horns.
It's funny.

139
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,601
Their horns are
burned off at birth.

140
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:40,401
This one was badly done.

141
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,681
Number 280

142
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,921
is the parsley-lover.

143
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,721
Sheep!

144
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:52,001
They're darling! The little one!

145
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,641
We didn't bring any bread.

146
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,041
Oh, the little one!

147
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,081
Mr. Pillaud!

148
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,281
Hello, Mr. Pillaud.

149
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,121
They're going in early.

150
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:07,961
Yes. They'll go up to
the farmyard. They're used to it.

151
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,561
They do it for a while
every evening.

152
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,361
And down in the morning?

153
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:15,641
They won't go in for...another hour.

154
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,481
They'd rather stay in the field.

155
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,961
No, they eat better by the roads...

156
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:24,361
There's more grass.

157
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,481
It's better along
the roads than in the fields.

158
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,481
Yes, they eat better there.

159
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,041
The fields are
all plowed up, anyway.

160
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,441
Look at the flowers!

161
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,321
Mauve.

162
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,521
They're toad lilies, or snake's heads.

163
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,121
Can we make a bouquet?

164
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,761
You mustn't touch!
They're a protected species.

165
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,841
There's even a government order

166
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,601
that bans picking them.

167
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,201
It applies to three
places in France...

168
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,001
special soil.

169
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:02,481
As mayor,
I could have you arrested.

170
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:05,001
What's so special about them?

171
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,001
They're very rare.

172
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:08,561
Like orchids?

173
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,881
You can buy orchids
in supermarkets.

174
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:11,801
It's pretty.

175
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:18,521
You see, you like the country.

176
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,641
I love it.
It's restful, beautiful.

177
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,881
But like everyone,
I get bored after 3 or 4 days.

178
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,921
Because you do nothing!

179
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:33,561
I do nothing at the beach
and I'm not bored. I don't even write.

180
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,561
Come here to write.

181
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:37,321
Impossible.

182
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,401
<i>Weed...</i>

183
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:43,441
noise, movement, excitement.

184
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,961
The lack of life here
turns off my brain.

185
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,281
There's lots of life here,
there's nothing but.

186
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,361
Sure, cows and birds,

187
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,081
frogs...

188
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:05,521
Admit it, you'd be bored too
without politics.

189
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,841
Your daughter's bored.
She'd rather be at the beach.

190
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,321
She's always going
to the beach with her mother.

191
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,801
Come this way.

192
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:18,921
She's bored because
her girlfriend left. She'll find another.

193
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:23,281
It won't be easy here.

194
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,641
Maybe some little farm girl.

195
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:32,921
They're not yokels anymore.
You don't know what farming is now.

196
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:34,161
Do you?

197
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,241
I'm in my element here,
cultivating...

198
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,521
Cultivating votes, you mean.

199
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:44,641
You're a Parisian
to your fingertips.

200
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:48,081
In your voice, gestures,
outlook, clothes,

201
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,361
you're a super-Parisian.

202
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:55,041
I'm a man of the soil.

203
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,081
My family's owned land
for generations.

204
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,881
The land is meaningless now.

205
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:07,761
It confers no name,
no power, no wealth.

206
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:11,681
Forgive me, but people
who think they belong on the land,

207
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:14,161
who think their roots are there,

208
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,641
are usually arch-reactionaries.

209
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,841
They see everything
from a local angle,

210
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,641
a view from the steeple.

211
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:26,921
Modern men should have
broader horizons,

212
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,601
blend all cultures, live in capitals,

213
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,641
be citizens of the world.

214
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:37,361
And put pins in their buttonholes
marked "Made in USA"?

215
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:41,721
These are standardized,
asepticized men.

216
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,441
The worst role models

217
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,961
80 % of city dwellers

218
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:50,081
have country grandparents
with rural roots.

219
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,721
And do all they can to forget them.

220
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:55,481
With their first <i>2</i> cents,
what do they do?

221
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:00,801
They go far away,
to Greece or the Caribbean.

222
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,281
Take a tip from me, Julien,

223
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:06,561
sell your beloved land,

224
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,961
and buy a house on
the northwest coast.

225
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:14,081
A house on the sea
is the height of vulgarity.

226
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,641
You're such a snob!

227
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:17,881
Me, a snob?

228
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,041
The biggest snob I know.

229
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,921
The people here don't think so.

230
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,521
I shouldn't have said "snob".

231
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,001
I should have said you're a dandy.

232
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:32,281
<i>Because snob comes from
sine nobilitate,</i>

233
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:35,321
meaning lacking in nobility.

234
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,681
I'm not noble.

235
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:40,721
Yes, you are. You took
the handle off your name

236
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,121
to appear more ordinary.

237
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,401
Very clever.
My great-grandfather

238
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:49,201
opted to write Dechaumes
in two words.

239
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,801
I hated that, and changed it back.
It was ridiculous.

240
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:57,401
Isn't fear of ridicule snobbish?

241
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,041
The problem is this:

242
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:08,881
France, which was mainly
agricultural until the 20th century,

243
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,841
is becoming almost wholly industrial.

244
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,401
The countryside's empty.

245
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:19,721
Everyone can have a country home.
So democratic!

246
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:23,721
The number of
vacation homes is dropping.

247
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:28,721
More and more people
are moving to the country for good.

248
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:33,161
In 50 years, most city folk
will live in the country.

249
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,921
Then they won't be city folk.

250
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:39,601
But they'll have city jobs,

251
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,601
that can only be done in a city.

252
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:44,481
Few villagers are farmers anymore.

253
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,921
They're masons,
carpenters, gardeners,

254
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,601
or they work for firms nearby.

255
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:53,881
We're surrounded by fields.
They have to be farmed.

256
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,961
They'll soon disappear.

257
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,561
There are 36 farms here now.

258
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:02,881
In 5 or 6 years there'll only be 8 left.

259
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:04,961
How creepy!

260
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,081
It's possible that in 10 or 20 years

261
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,681
there'll be no craftsmen left,

262
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,761
only service and high-tech jobs.

263
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:31,721
With video, faxes, computers,

264
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:36,681
office work can be done at home.
You'd never have to leave, see?

265
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:43,081
You could run a Paris firm
with factories everywhere.

266
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:48,161
Or design an airplane engine
or an atomic plant at home.

267
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:51,321
Yes, why not?

268
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:58,281
It's pretty. Looks good enough
to eat, like marzipan.

269
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:03,241
Don't, it's poisonous:
polyurethane resin.

270
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:07,721
This new job pattern
is the only way to slow

271
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:12,081
the runaway growth of
the cities and the rural exodus.

272
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:17,121
Population distribution will be

273
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,161
more harmonious,

274
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:22,881
eliminating the city-country split.

275
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,361
You don't agree?

276
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,921
It's Utopian, it won't work.

277
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:34,081
I foresee nature
returning to the city:

278
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:36,961
parks, botanical gardens, and so on.

279
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,281
I don't see going "back to the country",
even your way.

280
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:44,721
It won't work.
The city is a stronger magnet.

281
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,481
Much less than before.

282
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:50,081
For you, maybe,
but not for most people.

283
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,921
They're in the city
because that's where the jobs are.

284
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,601
Not just for that.

285
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,281
The city is fascinating.

286
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:04,841
People like the infinite
possibilities to meet people.

287
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:09,361
They like the city,
even if they meet no one.

288
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:12,481
The charm of passersby,

289
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,441
the crowds,

290
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,801
humanity's variety:
big, small, black, young, old,

291
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:23,561
their beauty, their ugliness,
charm, absurdity.

292
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,841
It reassures them,
fascinates them.

293
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:27,841
Don't you see?

294
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,961
Endless possibilities.

295
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:33,401
If rural kids want some fun,
what do they do?

296
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:37,001
Play the pinball machine
in the village cafe.

297
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:41,801
Or go to a Saturday night dance,
same crowd, same music.

298
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:46,961
In Paris, life is more complicated,
maybe harder,

299
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,721
less leisure, maybe,

300
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:53,521
but there's excitement,
a million things to do,

301
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:58,361
many neighborhoods, movies,
art shows, restaurants, parties.

302
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:02,241
You know that in the capital,
anything can happen.

303
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,841
But here...

304
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:09,361
You're a Parisian, and a novelist.
You think you're Balzac.

305
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,201
No. Ask them.

306
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,601
I do ask them.

307
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,121
You asked the kids
what they'd like?

308
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:18,361
Just so, I asked the kids.

309
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,961
They're not bored.
They don't want to go to the city.

310
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,921
They want to stay here.

311
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,561
You look at it all from outside,

312
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:31,721
which makes everything
here seem dull and lifeless.

313
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:34,641
Paris is terrifically lively,

314
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:39,601
but deep down in people's hearts,

315
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,401
what's the real, dominant feeling?

316
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,361
Excitement.

317
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,361
- No.
- The city!

318
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,281
It's not excitement at all,

319
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,641
it's loneliness.

320
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,641
I'd rather be anonymous...

321
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,921
I'd rather be alone dreaming
of countless new faces,

322
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:02,601
than be stuck here
with the same people,

323
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,281
crones peeking
through the curtains...

324
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,161
Believe it or not,

325
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:12,121
city people's circles
are smaller than ours.

326
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:15,601
Nonsense. In Paris
I can change my circle.

327
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:19,681
Now you're talking nonsense.
Listen,

328
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:21,521
whatever you think,

329
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:26,921
meeting new people is easier here
than in a big city.

330
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:28,881
You're not stuck here.

331
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,881
You go to dances and parties
for 20 miles around.

332
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,041
That's nothing new.

333
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:40,241
Historians say the prospects
in the country, in the old days,

334
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:41,681
for finding a spouse

335
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,841
were more ample
than in a city now.

336
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,521
Because festivals, fairs,

337
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:52,681
pilgrimages brought widely
separated people into contact.

338
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:54,561
Maybe you're right.

339
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:57,281
But once they meet,
what do they do?

340
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,561
They have fun.

341
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,161
First they work,
they love their work.

342
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:07,201
Everyone has an interesting job.
They know how to have fun.

343
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,761
Let's all drink...

344
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:11,241
St. Juire wine.

345
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,561
Too bad it isn't...

346
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:13,961
- To the Mayor!
- Thanks.

347
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,041
Too bad it isn't
to my victory,

348
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,521
but that's for next year's
parliamentary election.

349
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,361
Let's hope!

350
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,881
Sure, the local vote is reactionary,

351
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,721
but the district as a whole
is leftist, it's for progress.

352
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,121
That won't change.

353
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,201
You scored well locally.

354
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,041
A good showing.

355
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,681
To us all, and to you.

356
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,921
Here's to next year...

357
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,841
And the Mayor!

358
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:56,721
The land we'll build on
is in a restricted zone.

359
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:01,081
Building is banned except
in the public interest,

360
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,921
and even that needs
government authorization,

361
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:09,801
which it got for its excellence
and good environmental impact.

362
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:13,001
We have masons and carpenters

363
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:18,041
who work in the old way
and who are anxious for work.

364
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:21,521
We'll mainly use them

365
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,281
rather than workmen from outside.

366
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:26,841
The building will stir a demand,

367
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:30,601
not just locally,
but even regionally,

368
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:32,521
for building methods

369
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:36,401
that have not been forgotten
and can be revived.

370
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,081
Private projects
of this type exist in France,

371
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:44,801
but a public operation
would set an example.

372
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,321
You see,

373
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,241
we'll build the new library here.

374
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,401
We'll call it a media library:

375
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:01,641
it will include video
and disc libraries,

376
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,161
an art gallery,

377
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:07,041
with an open-air theater
and swimming pool behind.

378
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,201
"'8 huge!

379
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,921
An ambitious project.

380
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,361
It's handsome. It will hide
the whole village.

381
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:15,361
No it won't.

382
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:18,761
It's no high-rise.
It will only be...

383
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,561
maybe two stories.

384
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,001
We'd have to check the plans.

385
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:25,441
It will be built of local stone,

386
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:30,641
so it will fit in
with the local style,

387
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,681
but it'll be a modern building.

388
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:35,881
With a stone facing?

389
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:37,841
I don't know...

390
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:42,961
That's handsome because
it's a real farm, with fine proportions,

391
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,321
and a real barn, but...

392
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:47,721
It could look artificial.

393
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:49,721
Slapped on, slightly fake...

394
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:54,841
You can't put up a steel building
beside a 13th-century church!

395
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,201
I don't mean that,
maybe you have to find a way,

396
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:02,801
but slapping stones
on artificially like that...

397
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,881
I question if it's a good idea.

398
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,641
<i>CHAPTER Ill</i>

399
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,001
<i>If the willow on the village green</i>

400
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:13,441
<i>hadn't miraculously
withstood the rigors of time...</i>

401
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:25,241
Hear ye, hear ye!

402
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:30,161
The jury for the contest
for the cultural-sports center,

403
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:35,121
comprising a disc library,
pool and open-air theater,

404
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:39,441
has chosen the proposal
by Mr Antoine Pergola.

405
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:43,521
His plan will be on display
in the town hall as of Monday

406
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:46,841
for public inspection.

407
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,601
By order of Mayor Julien Dechaumes.

408
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,681
Lovely!

409
00:23:58,481 --> 00:23:59,761
It's so lovely!

410
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,641
They want to destroy this!

411
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,561
Have they gone mad?

412
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:09,641
Or am I the madman?

413
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,201
What'll I do with my photo?

414
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:15,281
Look at it after this is gone?
I couldn't bear it.

415
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:17,001
It's like a snapshot

416
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:18,321
of someone dying.

417
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:21,801
My God, what's got into them?

418
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,561
What's got into you?
You're so violent!

419
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:29,401
I'm seldom violent,
but this time I'm furious!

420
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,201
I'm capable of anything.
It's my pet hate!

421
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:35,081
I could even kill!

422
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:39,481
Some guys shoot kids who bawl.
With me, it's architects.

423
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:44,481
If I had a machine-gun
when the workmen first show up...

424
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:45,481
SHUT up!

425
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:48,361
Scared?
But I don't have a machine-gun.

426
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,001
Don't say such things.

427
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:54,521
Someone said:
"We must abolish the death penalty

428
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,441
"except for architects".

429
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,561
Blame the mayor, not the architect.

430
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:04,201
The mayor's just a politician.
An architect should have taste.

431
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:09,081
Wait and see, the plan probably
respects the environment.

432
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,081
"Respect", you said the word!

433
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:14,001
They can do anything
if they're "respectful",

434
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:16,841
justify any vandalism!

435
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:20,681
I'd rather they build
a concrete tower, a steel shed!

436
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,801
People should have rebelled.

437
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,441
But it's "respectful"

438
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:28,361
so you can't do or say anything,
it's the lesser evil!

439
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,161
Why evil? Why not

440
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,361
the greater good?

441
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,921
The evil is the mayor's idea.

442
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,881
OK, but what shocks me most,

443
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,521
is that architects,
who went to art school,

444
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:42,401
who studied painting,

445
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:47,041
failed to see this site
is untouchable!

446
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:53,161
They wouldn't touch
a Ruysdael painting for fear

447
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,001
of chipping the paint,

448
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,721
but they'll bulldoze
a landscape that is worthy,

449
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:04,201
and I mean this, of the greatest
Dutch masterpieces!

450
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:07,561
It's so lovely! Do you realize?

451
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:10,121
How dare they mess with it?

452
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,921
It's not a work of art.

453
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:15,121
Yes, a landscape is a work of art.

454
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:20,641
Maybe not in the past:
there was great scenery at every bend,

455
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:24,361
but it's rare now
and we must preserve it all.

456
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,041
I mean all!

457
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,441
This landscape with its meadow,
its brook,

458
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:34,361
the tree, the village
and church in the background,

459
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:37,601
is the work of both nature and man.

460
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:39,721
Those who arranged this land,

461
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:42,201
those houses, this tree,

462
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:46,241
may not be listed in books,
but they were artists.

463
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:49,361
In the old days, farmers were artists.

464
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:53,241
Better artists than our fancy architect!

465
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,481
In principle, this tree remains.

466
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,601
My foot! Trees keep vanishing.

467
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:03,921
We're told a tree will remain,
then it's suddenly cut down!

468
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,001
There's always a pretext:

469
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:10,761
access, the conduits, power lines,
or it's blocking the view,

470
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,201
as if a tree
weren't the best view.

471
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:16,641
Even if the tree remains,
as I hope,

472
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,161
it's old,
it will have to be cut down.

473
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,721
Another will replace it.

474
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:24,161
In the old days,
they scheduled trees in advance,

475
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,361
for future generations.

476
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,281
As in La Fontaine's fable:

477
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:33,921
"For an old man, better
to plant trees than build...

478
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:37,241
No, I goofed:
"Better to build than plant trees..."

479
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:39,201
No, I know what will happen.

480
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:42,041
Assume the building's acceptable.

481
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:44,201
"Respectful", as you say.

482
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:47,121
Assume it fits into the landscape.

483
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,801
What we're seeing is
the tip of the iceberg.

484
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,521
They're silent about
the construction it will entail,

485
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,001
which will be far more visible.

486
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,201
Access roads?

487
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:02,001
Precisely. The access roads.

488
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:05,401
To the freeways, the parking lots,

489
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,721
the elevators. France is scarred
with access roads!

490
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:13,601
200 cars a night
without parking space? No way!

491
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:17,361
It won't be 200,
and it won't be every night.

492
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:21,121
The mayor wants to bring Paris
theater troupes here!

493
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:24,441
It'll be a flop,
but they'll build for 200 cars.

494
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:27,001
They'll plan for it!

495
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:31,841
So space will have to be found.
They will plan what is...

496
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,641
euphemistically...

497
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:36,521
called a car "park"

498
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,321
on a protected site.

499
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:40,001
Underground, at first.

500
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:43,121
They'll cut down
the tree to provide access.

501
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,961
Then they'll see
the ground is too soft,

502
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:50,721
so they'll build a parking lot,

503
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:53,281
an open-air parking lot,

504
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:58,561
maybe with a few scrawny shrubs
planted in rows

505
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:00,561
and, most horrid of all,

506
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,801
stunted red trees,

507
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:05,601
you know, those...

508
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:09,761
sort of plum trees, not even red,

509
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:11,081
a spooky purple,

510
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:12,281
like a corpse.

511
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,121
As if death fascinated
these people.

512
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:18,201
It's death they're
giving us...my death!

513
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:21,921
If I don't see my tree
every morning, I'll leave.

514
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,961
I couldn't live here
anymore, I'd leave. What?

515
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:26,241
I'm yelling. I know,

516
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,881
but if people are deaf,
you have to shout!

517
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,761
But nobody's listening.

518
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:32,521
Where should I yell?

519
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:36,601
I don't know, not here.
Besides, you need to act, not yell.

520
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:40,081
Act? You're dreaming.

521
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:43,041
How can a mere teacher
fight a decision

522
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:46,041
involving powerful
political interests?

523
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,761
The mayor's boss here,
his party's still in power.

524
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,961
So run in the elections.

525
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:57,201
Which? For Parliament?
I'll only get one vote:

526
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,241
my own.

527
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,601
And mine...maybe.

528
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:02,841
Thanks.

529
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:06,361
Politics...The mayor
even wooed the ecologists.

530
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,601
In that case, stop yelling.

531
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:10,121
Zoe, no...

532
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:12,321
Let her alone, I love her.

533
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:15,001
I can see her in
Parliament someday.

534
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,361
Why not? It won't be long.

535
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:23,441
Not the next election,
or the one after, but the third..

536
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:25,961
I'll be 21.

537
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:28,081
I see you have it all planned.

538
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:31,961
You'll be in college then,
in the city.

539
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:37,241
You won't want to bury yourself here
to solve our little problems.

540
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:38,641
You did.

541
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,361
I'm a city boy, so I wanted
to be in the country.

542
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:45,921
Anyway, in 10 years,
the country will be the city,

543
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:49,601
with all its drawbacks
and without its few advantages.

544
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,601
You're too pessimistic.

545
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:56,641
The country-city argument
will become obsolete,

546
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,201
but not your way.

547
00:30:58,361 --> 00:30:59,641
How, then?

548
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:02,161
I'll explain my theory.

549
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,361
Let's hear it.

550
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:08,921
Not yet. I haven't worked it all out.

551
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,521
A pretty model...
that's where we were

552
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:20,641
the other day, behind the school.
There's the tree...

553
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:23,241
You sculpted it beautifully.

554
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:25,601
With the church and steeple.

555
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,841
- And all the houses.
- Terrific.

556
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:32,561
- The scale is right?
- Yes, it's accurate.

557
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:34,641
Then that's the swimming pool?

558
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,241
Yes, at top of the plot,

559
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:42,921
with the buildings
climbing the hill, which faces west.

560
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:44,041
So the pool

561
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:47,041
is at the top, with
the big and small basins.

562
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,241
- It's open-air?
- That's right.

563
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:51,761
There's a solarium

564
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:54,121
on the east end.

565
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,961
A short season, then,
<i>2</i> or 3 months a year.

566
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:00,241
Short? No, you can swim...
5 months a year.

567
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:03,041
Anyway, they asked
for an open-air pool.

568
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,921
Sure, it has its own micro-climate.

569
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,561
That's the parking lot?

570
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:12,561
There's several:
one higher, one lower.

571
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:16,681
You have the pool on top,
and just below it,

572
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,081
the theater, as you can see here.

573
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:25,081
There's the view from...

574
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,081
the theatre,

575
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:29,041
the entrance
to the media library,

576
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:31,361
and the big tree below.

577
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:34,401
The seats are concrete?

578
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:36,281
That's right.

579
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,401
Is all this concrete, too?

580
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:41,521
No, the stage is concrete.

581
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:45,521
This area can be planted
in grass or stay in concrete.

582
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:48,921
We don't know. We're still
in a big-picture phase.

583
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:51,761
We'll fill in the details later.

584
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,801
I see you have small trees drawn in.

585
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:58,081
In 15 years they'll grow...

586
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,201
I'm not sure I'm for them.

587
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,281
I don't know how you feel,

588
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:03,561
putting trees there.

589
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:07,761
We're in a village
surrounded by greenery,

590
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,441
centuries-old trees.

591
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,081
Then we suddenly shift
to a modern mode,

592
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,921
where small trees aren't very useful.

593
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:19,041
You see the stone, Berenice...

594
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:20,601
I'll show you

595
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:21,601
a photo.

596
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:27,561
The trees are small,
they're just saplings, but...

597
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:30,161
They'll mask the parking lot.

598
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,961
Look at the stone.

599
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,881
In 10 years they'll mask
the parking lot.

600
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,681
It'll take a few years.

601
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:40,761
It's local stone.
The whole front will be faced

602
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,521
with it. Beautiful, eh?

603
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,001
Beautiful.

604
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:47,641
The whole facade on the school side.

605
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:52,441
The theater can only function
in nice weather, right?

606
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:55,681
Yes, it's an open-air theater...

607
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,841
In winter it'll be snowed under.

608
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,321
It's not likely.

609
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,481
It doesn't snow much.

610
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,281
It can be covered.

611
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:07,801
I've seen freezing winters here.

612
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:10,721
If you've made it to scale,

613
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:14,361
the ceilings are pretty low.

614
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:15,801
- The building?
- Yes.

615
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:19,561
The building's 20 feet high,
as programmed.

616
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:23,281
Must the parking lot be there?

617
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:24,401
We need it.

618
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:28,681
This hideous expanse,
with all those ugly cars on it?

619
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:31,001
Not all cars are ugly...

620
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,361
They're very ugly,

621
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,241
especially massed
on concrete like that.

622
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:39,161
When it's empty it's crummy,
and full it's even crummier.

623
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:40,561
You have to park.

624
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:45,241
To go to a show, or swim,
you must park your car...

625
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:48,081
Can't those ugly things
be underground?

626
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,441
There are limits.

627
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:53,321
The budget may not
permit underground parking.

628
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:57,761
If there's one important
thing in the budget,

629
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,321
it's to hide those awful cars.

630
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:03,241
It'll be ugly, dead space...

631
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,241
In Paris cars park
before every house.

632
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:10,161
They're scattered.
But big parking lots...

633
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:14,121
No one likes them.
Will tourists visit them? No.

634
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:21,481
Two small parking lots,
one on top, for 70 cars,

635
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:25,561
with another 2O below.
That may not be enough.

636
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:28,201
You must find a way.
It's horrible.

637
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:31,121
It ruins the beauty
of your complex,

638
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:34,081
which is, if I may say so,

639
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,081
a bit too functional.

640
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:39,601
There's no fantasy element...

641
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:41,201
It's utilitarian.

642
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:43,841
Fantasy? What for?

643
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:47,001
You want ornaments, statues?
Or what?

644
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:51,441
I don't say statues.
But when you visit a medieval abbey,

645
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:56,801
the lofty ceilings, the space
were not designed for function.

646
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:58,961
Here it's all functional.

647
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:02,921
The abbeys certainly
were designed for function,

648
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:07,841
in terms of sound for the chanting,
and the space needed...

649
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,121
...for church services.

650
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:13,561
- Spirituality's fine, but...
- This isn't a church.

651
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:18,241
It's for culture,
which should inspire you, it's a symbol...

652
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:24,881
Spirituality is
in the design here, a closed space,

653
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,241
the theater facing the library,

654
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:31,881
on the pattern of antique theaters,

655
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:37,241
like a Roman theater,
with the entry facing the amphitheater.

656
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:38,961
The open-air theater...

657
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:43,521
Actors can use
the catwalks around the building,

658
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:48,361
we wanted the inside
to be stripped down,

659
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,281
not much local stone...

660
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:55,281
just in the doorway,
a few side angles,

661
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,841
some vistas over the village.

662
00:36:58,121 --> 00:37:00,801
There's a beautiful vista...

663
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,961
You had no desire

664
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:07,641
to create a place
without a purpose?

665
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:14,441
Every place has a purpose...
And it's the taxpayers' money...

666
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:17,681
That's what modernity is,

667
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:19,441
too functional...

668
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:24,401
In private homes,
useless can be beautiful...

669
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:28,721
The strict minimum,
no wasted space, no long walls...

670
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:33,361
There's a lot of wasted space.
This here is useless...

671
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,561
So are your parking lots!

672
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:41,041
I like the way it fits
in our landscape.

673
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:43,401
I'm crazy about this complex.

674
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,201
<i>CHAPTER IV</i>

675
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:48,961
<i>If Blandine Lenoir,
at the monthly "Tomorrow",</i>

676
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:53,881
<i>had not, while recording
a cultural broadcast, inadvertently</i>

677
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,401
<i>unplugged her answering machine...</i>

678
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:51,321
<i>...this can be explained
by several trends</i>

679
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:53,201
<i>that are more or less evident,</i>

680
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,761
<i>then something shifts again,</i>

681
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:57,401
<i>that we'll call "chance".</i>

682
00:38:57,561 --> 00:39:01,161
<i>This gives rise to
a new kind of evolution,</i>

683
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:03,001
<i>a new quality of evolution</i>

684
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,841
<i>that in history we call chance:</i>

685
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:11,641
a <i>casual conjunction
of</i> a <i>series of necessities,</i>

686
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:17,121
<i>of various kinds, economic,
social and political,</i>

687
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:20,881
<i>and this unexpected
conjunction of compulsions,</i>

688
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,161
<i>when they meet,</i>

689
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:25,641
<i>produce an event.</i>

690
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,441
<i>We'll call this event...</i>

691
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,401
<i>we'll identify it</i>

692
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,281
<i>with this concept of chance.</i>

693
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:36,001
<i>It is obvious that,
stated this way,</i>

694
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,201
<i>it doesn't really explain
what happened,</i>

695
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:43,801
<i>it just explains the result
of certain conditions</i>

696
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:48,401
<i>that don't confirm what is
and lead to a posterior explanation.</i>

697
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:53,481
<i>We can never probe deeply
into historical chance,</i>

698
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,121
<i>it's a virtually useless notion,</i>

699
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:59,241
<i>raised and instantly dismissed,</i>

700
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,841
<i>as we tend to explain things</i>

701
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:05,361
<i>after the fact. That's
always the problem.</i>

702
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:10,041
<i>Can we speak of the imponderable?
Does that still have meaning?</i>

703
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,801
<i>Absolutely.</i>

704
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:17,881
<i>I think the imponderable exists...</i>

705
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,321
<i>Why ignore it?</i>

706
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:23,201
<i>What's really amazing
when you read history</i>

707
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:26,361
<i>is the evacuation of the imponderable.</i>

708
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:31,201
<i>The imponderable makes us
experience history,</i>

709
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,801
<i>experience it intensely,</i>

710
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:36,641
<i>but it's absent from
historical discourse,</i>

711
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,801
<i>probably because we don't want
to imagine or admit it.</i>

712
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,201
<i>We live with the imponderable,</i>

713
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:46,441
<i>but we don't think about it</i>

714
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,721
<i>or know how to think about it.</i>

715
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:53,201
<i>That's why this dimension
is never found</i>

716
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:55,081
<i>in a historical paper.</i>

717
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:58,321
<i>The imponderable is gone
from history books</i>

718
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:01,881
<i>because introducing or keeping it</i>

719
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,441
<i>might become a philosophy of history,</i>

720
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,881
<i>a particular philosophy,</i>

721
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:12,361
<i>which to a historian means
taking liberties</i>

722
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:14,761
<i>he might relate to science fiction...</i>

723
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:16,321
<i>The contrast is striking...</i>

724
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:18,881
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

725
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:23,361
<i>between knowing that
the imponderable exists...</i>

726
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:47,481
PARLIAMENT

727
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:03,801
Hi, how are you?

728
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,721
We tried to reach you.

729
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:08,601
I forgot to plug in
the answering machine.

730
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:12,161
I only found out when
I called it just now. What's up?

731
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:16,921
Sorry, Blandine, there's a mix-up,
I had a previous appointment.

732
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:20,601
You're the second person
to stand me up today!

733
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:24,761
Tomorrow, same time, OK?
We must get together. Can you?

734
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:27,641
- I'm very busy.
- I know.

735
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:29,441
That OK?

736
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:31,321
- Tomorrow, 5 PM.
- Alright.

737
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:34,881
Dammit, I'm doing these people
a favor seeing them

738
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,121
and on top of it
they're late.

739
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:42,161
My sister-in-law's cousin wants me
to meet his girlfriend,

740
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,681
Berenice Beaurivage,
the novelist.

741
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:45,561
Know her?

742
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:48,721
Wants to write a book with
a newspaper setting.

743
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:52,681
I'm the guinea pig,
but I'll throw her for a loop.

744
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:56,561
I hate talking about my work.
What's there to say?

745
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,401
You don't believe that?

746
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:00,681
Neither do I.

747
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:03,241
Generalities are silly.

748
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:04,681
OK, I'm off.

749
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,001
No, please,

750
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:08,281
stay five minutes more.

751
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:11,241
If they don't show by then,
they can wait.

752
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:13,761
I don't mind coming back tomorrow.

753
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:16,001
You have something to do? Stay.

754
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,681
I can't stand
three-cornered appointments.

755
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:21,001
I mean it! So...

756
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:24,081
Don't talk. Just sit in,
that's enough.

757
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:25,121
Charming!

758
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,801
You might like it,
a unique opportunity...

759
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:31,601
The cousin-in-law is one of the group

760
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:34,641
of young, stay-at-home reformers,

761
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:38,161
We wanted more leftist Young Turks.

762
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:43,041
He has vast political ambitions
that I don't think he's up to.

763
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:44,681
Observe him.

764
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:49,641
He's the mayor and lord
of the manor of his village.

765
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:54,281
He lost a local election,
but he's running for Parliament.

766
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:55,321
Observe him.

767
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:57,601
What's this rarity's name?

768
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:02,241
His name's unknown and
always will be: Julien Dechaumes.

769
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:05,161
They're here.

770
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:08,601
- Julien!
- Hello, Regis.

771
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:11,321
Berenice Beaurivage.

772
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,841
How do you do?

773
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:18,681
Blandine. She'll sit in, alright?
She's our best free-lancer.

774
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:20,041
Of course.

775
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:24,161
Expert on political sociology.
Come into my office.

776
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:40,081
Never mind the local election.

777
00:44:40,241 --> 00:44:42,361
You'll win next time.
You can build

778
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:43,601
on a failure.

779
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,721
That's true. If they want me.

780
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:50,121
Who's "they"? The party?

781
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:53,481
I haven't been nominated yet.
But I'm confident.

782
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:56,321
In my area, the majority belongs

783
00:44:56,481 --> 00:45:01,001
to a nationwide minority wing
of the party.

784
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:04,401
The hard-liners?

785
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,841
Sure. I'm young,
so I'm with the young.

786
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:14,121
But the national bosses snub
the names our people propose.

787
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:17,681
They want to force their own on us.
It's a real brawl.

788
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,681
- So?
- So, I'm waiting.

789
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:24,001
I'm waiting for them
to see they're wrong. If outsiders run,

790
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:28,241
a conservative will carry
this Socialist stronghold.

791
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:29,241
You popular?

792
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:31,881
Of course! I'm a local boy!

793
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,601
That's very important in my district...

794
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:36,401
They're royalists.

795
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:41,521
But you're a royalist.

796
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:45,921
He runs as a Socialist,
but he's an arch-royalist.

797
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:47,201
Cut it out!

798
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,601
Admit you're a royalist.

799
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:51,601
He wants to be a great lord,

800
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:54,961
with first-night rights
over the farmers' daughters.

801
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:57,801
Anyone would,
if they're pretty.

802
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,081
Stop the nonsense!

803
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:01,521
But they're plain,
so he behaves!

804
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:06,081
He loves folks to bow
and scrape to him and listen

805
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:09,121
when he patronizes them.

806
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:14,241
It's fiction.
I'm absolutely simple with people.

807
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,841
Spoken like a great lord!

808
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:18,281
Stop it.

809
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:24,241
I'll shut up,
he's taking it badly.

810
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:27,521
A royalist? What's
insulting about that?

811
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:30,721
It's not incompatible with socialism.

812
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:35,201
In the countries with kings,
Norway, Denmark, Sweden,

813
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:37,801
Spain, Belgium, Holland,

814
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,761
the governments are usually Socialist.

815
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:42,361
It works very well.

816
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:43,801
I forgot Britain,

817
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:46,481
where Labor will come back someday.

818
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:48,281
Why not in your area, too?

819
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:50,721
Maybe in the north,
but not the south.

820
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:54,641
Sorry, but you clearly
don't know its history or geography.

821
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,161
It's a common error.

822
00:46:56,321 --> 00:46:59,401
The south, my area,
has always been republican.

823
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:02,241
It marked
the royalist-revolutionary border.

824
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:05,801
My great-grandfather,
a commoner and trader,

825
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:08,961
bought the manor during
the Revolution,

826
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:12,401
which the state took over.
So I ask you,

827
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:15,001
where's my "royalist tradition"?

828
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:19,121
If you're nominated,
have you a chance to win?

829
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:23,401
It'll be rough.
I've by no means convinced the party.

830
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:26,881
I'm in no hurry,
I know times are tough now.

831
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,881
That's why the party needs new faces.

832
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:34,761
To spite the right.
The farmers there are angry.

833
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:37,281
That will help the rightists.

834
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:39,561
The ecologists, too, luckily.

835
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:40,961
Luckily?

836
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,441
Better a liberal vote,
even if it's not for us.

837
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:46,921
But the ecologists, the Greens,

838
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,321
are awful reactionaries!
They've never been liberals!

839
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:51,881
You think so?

840
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:56,401
I agree. He's letting them
gnaw at his vote.

841
00:47:56,721 --> 00:48:00,761
In a way, they're allies
of the far right,

842
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,601
but certainly not his.

843
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:06,481
That's absurd!
Sorry, but what you're saying

844
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,961
is total nonsense.

845
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:14,041
In the last election, I talked
to the Greens' leaders for 4 hours.

846
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:18,361
They said, "We're all
for what you've done as mayor,

847
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:22,241
"in both ecology and welfare policy".

848
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:24,281
They even go farther than I do.

849
00:48:24,441 --> 00:48:27,761
For example, they think a cut

850
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:32,001
in the work week should
mean an overall pay cut.

851
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:35,121
That's Utopian,
I wouldn't go that far.

852
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:36,601
Hard to push through.

853
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:39,481
Leftist Utopia,
like the '68 student revolt.

854
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:42,761
The most dangerous kind:
Maoist, totalitarian.

855
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:46,681
All totalitarian regimes
meet at the extremes.

856
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:50,081
I say the Greens have
no political talent.

857
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:54,001
They should stick
to reforestation and clean rivers.

858
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:56,521
I need ecology.

859
00:48:56,681 --> 00:48:59,761
I have a house down south
that's threatened

860
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:02,681
by a gas plant on one side

861
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:04,961
and a new freeway on the other.

862
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:08,081
The Highway Service owns France.

863
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:13,241
While world auto sales are dropping,

864
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:16,361
we go all out building freeways!

865
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:20,361
It's mad! France is run
by Highway Service

866
00:49:20,521 --> 00:49:21,641
engineers.

867
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:25,601
They are defacing
the country!

868
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,561
Even worse,

869
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:29,041
sorry, Julien,

870
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:30,921
are the mayors.

871
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:33,721
Decentralized government
is OK on paper,

872
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:36,721
but the vast power
it gives the mayors

873
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:39,361
allows them to vandalize France.

874
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:43,481
So my house will be surrounded

875
00:49:43,641 --> 00:49:46,401
by a gas-pumping plant

876
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:50,241
and a useless freeway feeder.

877
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:54,761
Around my lovely village,
as around all our villages,

878
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:58,561
prefab houses are going up on land

879
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:02,601
owned by friends
of the mayor or his council,

880
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:05,641
who get rich on it.
That's decentralization!

881
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:07,321
I know that's not your case.

882
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:10,401
No, it isn't.
I had my village protected.

883
00:50:10,561 --> 00:50:15,161
Our new project is the work
of one of today's great architects,

884
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:17,161
an environmentalist.

885
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:21,281
- What are you building?
- A sports and cultural center.

886
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:24,841
- You have the money?
- Yes. It wasn't easy, but I got it.

887
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:27,321
Nice work, you can operate.

888
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:30,801
Grandeur is out of fashion
in the sticks these days.

889
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,281
This isn't really grand. It's minimal.

890
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:38,361
A Minimum Cultural Guarantee?
The ecologists approve?

891
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:39,521
Of course.

892
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:41,841
Sure, it's so timid...

893
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:44,281
It's not timid, it's respectful.

894
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:48,081
Respectful timidity

895
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:50,161
or timid respect...

896
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:53,441
I'd build a big glass bubble.

897
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,481
It would respect the environment more.

898
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:58,241
Are you serious?

899
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,321
Where were we?

900
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,961
To get back to generalities:

901
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:08,041
political ecology is dangerous

902
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:11,921
because it's conservative,
basically reactionary.

903
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:14,761
The Greens' ideal is a static world,

904
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:17,761
even a return to
the world of 100 years ago.

905
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:23,081
The formation of the universe
began a process of evolution

906
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:25,201
no one has a right to stop.

907
00:51:25,361 --> 00:51:26,561
It's a basic fact,

908
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:31,721
in the evolution
of living things, a truism

909
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,481
everyone should agree on.
But oh, no!

910
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,681
What if evolution is
going the wrong way?

911
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:40,361
What are the "right"
and "wrong" ways?

912
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:44,161
Suppose the planet blows up,
or goes radioactive,

913
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:46,841
you can't say
it's going the right way.

914
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:48,361
We're not there yet.

915
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:49,921
We could get to it.

916
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:54,161
Listen...if we have to die, let's die!

917
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:57,361
If life never changes,

918
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,561
it's not worth living.

919
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:04,041
I refuse to live just
to assure my survival.

920
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:06,441
Survival, what a horrid word!

921
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:09,921
If survival is
the only idea we're offered,

922
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:12,681
then let's die now,
hurrah for suicide!

923
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,401
Suicide has beauty,

924
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:19,361
but survival has a mean,
degrading side to it.

925
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:20,721
It's dreadful.

926
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:25,161
But I don't believe
the prophets of doom.

927
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:28,121
Mankind is not a totally failed species.

928
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,801
The world will live on,

929
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:35,401
it will change and develop
in the right way.

930
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:36,681
Absolutely.

931
00:52:36,841 --> 00:52:41,761
All living creatures have
always adapted to their environment.

932
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:46,001
Man will adapt to carbon dioxide,
maybe even radiation.

933
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:50,001
Just as fish took to water.

934
00:52:50,161 --> 00:52:52,481
Aren't you confusing two things?

935
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:55,121
One is the natural evolution
of the universe,

936
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:58,361
the other is pollution caused by man,

937
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:00,161
who adds a new dimension:

938
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:03,761
his will, basically
if unwillingly perverse.

939
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:09,121
Perhaps, meaning that
technology overcomes natural law.

940
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:12,561
I say the remedy to technology

941
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:15,881
is more technology.

942
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:17,921
I know that argument,

943
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:21,801
but I'm not quite convinced.
Isn't it a bit simplistic?

944
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:24,721
Nothing is simple, of course.

945
00:53:24,881 --> 00:53:29,001
The ecologists simplify things
with amazing dishonesty.

946
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:32,721
We know that natural cataclysms

947
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:36,481
are far more pollutive
than manmade catastrophes.

948
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:40,081
Nature can trigger
its own defenses.

949
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,081
- Not always.
- What do you mean?

950
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:45,481
In prehistoric times

951
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:48,841
there were volcanoes,
earthquakes, floods,

952
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:50,841
and meteor collisions

953
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:54,921
that were far more pollutive

954
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:58,361
than, for example...Chernobyl.

955
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:01,041
The problem is again

956
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:03,721
that man blocks nature's defenses.

957
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:06,041
What does he do? Cut down forests.

958
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:10,601
There's more forest now
than two centuries ago.

959
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:12,081
Not in the Amazon.

960
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:18,041
Sure, sure, the Amazon.
I'm all for the Amazon,

961
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:21,561
the Indians, primitive life, snakes,

962
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:25,361
spiders, crocodiles, piranhas.
I'm for all of it.

963
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:30,961
But to say that the Amazon
is the world's green lung

964
00:54:31,121 --> 00:54:31,881
is wrong.

965
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:36,161
Chlorophyll eliminates at night
the carbon dioxide

966
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:38,321
it absorbs during the day.

967
00:54:38,481 --> 00:54:43,161
Not entirely. Part of the carbon
absorbed is retained.

968
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:48,161
It helps form the plant matter
later found in the earth

969
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:51,321
as coal or carbohydrate.

970
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:52,721
I'm pretty good, eh?

971
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:55,921
Very little of it does.

972
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:57,441
Very little?

973
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:01,121
If we burned all the coal
and oil the earth ever held,

974
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:05,241
it would return to
its primitive state, surrounded

975
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:08,841
by an atmospheric belt
of carbon dioxide,

976
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:11,881
C + ()2 = CO2, as we learned in class.

977
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:14,681
There's another fixative of carbon:

978
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:16,521
calcium.

979
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:18,081
What is limestone

980
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:19,201
composed of?

981
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:23,241
An age-old accumulation
of marine animals' shells.

982
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:26,681
To return to the earth's
primitive atmosphere,

983
00:55:26,841 --> 00:55:29,761
you must extract the CO2

984
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,241
from the calcium carbonate

985
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:35,881
in the earth's crust.

986
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:38,081
You scientists have lost me.

987
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:44,681
We're wasting your time
with our bar chat.

988
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:49,041
Sorry, but I haven't
much time to give you.

989
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,721
Want a quick tour of the premises?

990
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,961
I'm in no hurry.
I can take them around.

991
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:56,641
That would be nice.

992
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:58,001
You don't mind?

993
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,641
It won't take long. It's nice of you.

994
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,121
What about the castle?

995
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:08,761
These are houses.

996
00:56:08,921 --> 00:56:10,721
They're not houses,

997
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:13,961
you can see
they're the castle windows.

998
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,241
You begin.

999
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,601
I'm sorry, can we put off
our meeting again?

1000
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:27,041
Again?

1001
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,401
Alright, Monday...OK.

1002
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:33,841
Not at all.

1003
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:36,841
No, it went fine.
We had a drink afterward.

1004
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:42,401
If you want a specimen
of the new political class, he's it.

1005
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,721
I'd like to do my story on Julien.

1006
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:50,201
Julien's a nice guy,
but a lightweight.

1007
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:54,681
I don't agree. He interests me.

1008
00:56:57,361 --> 00:56:59,681
Nothing...that's just it...

1009
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:04,121
There are plenty of
brilliant men, good talkers,

1010
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:05,961
who know all the answers.

1011
00:57:06,481 --> 00:57:09,321
He's no great talker,
he fumbles for words.

1012
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:11,681
Not much of a phrase-maker.

1013
00:57:11,841 --> 00:57:16,001
What he says may seem watered-down,

1014
00:57:16,161 --> 00:57:18,081
but at least it's thoughtful.

1015
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:24,401
Most politicians ring false,
their words are hollow.

1016
00:57:24,561 --> 00:57:29,641
There's mystery in him.
A hidden gravity.

1017
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:33,481
That's good!

1018
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:37,481
He's persuasive,
and for a politician, that's an asset.

1019
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:40,321
He told me a lot about his village...

1020
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:42,961
really made me want to see it.

1021
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:46,401
I bet the place is exemplary
in a lot of ways.

1022
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:51,401
Come off it...

1023
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:56,041
They're not in love...
It's just for show.

1024
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:58,121
She's not his type.

1025
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,681
I hope you won't feel

1026
00:58:20,841 --> 00:58:23,361
my first question is hostile.

1027
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:24,801
Wouldn't the money

1028
00:58:24,961 --> 00:58:26,961
for building the media library

1029
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:29,681
be better used for something else?

1030
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:35,241
A cultural program
doesn't seem vital for a village

1031
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:36,881
of a few hundred people.

1032
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:39,801
Aren't there more urgent issues?

1033
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:43,401
You're stating it backwards.

1034
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:47,321
I got the money
for a cultural program,

1035
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:48,441
nothing else.

1036
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:51,561
I'm on good terms
with the Culture Ministry

1037
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:55,681
and I got a subsidy that is, let us say,

1038
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:57,281
unusual

1039
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,961
You can quote me.
It wasn't a favor to me,

1040
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,241
but deliberate policy.

1041
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:07,761
Up north, the conservatives
wave the banner of culture

1042
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:11,481
that is traditional,
local, even monarchist.

1043
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:16,441
The government wanted a reply
from the republican south.

1044
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:18,881
Another kind of culture,

1045
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:22,521
less traditional and local,
more up-to-date.

1046
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:27,361
Tradition must be alive,
must move, evolve, create.

1047
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:30,121
Otherwise it's folklore
for tourists.

1048
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:33,161
Let's get back to finances.

1049
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:37,441
You got a hefty sum
from the government.

1050
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:42,241
Doesn't the village have to kick in?
What do the taxpayers say?

1051
00:59:42,521 --> 00:59:44,081
They pay nothing.

1052
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:46,921
We made a profitable deal

1053
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:50,441
when a firm bought
into a new industrial area

1054
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,761
on land bequeathed to the town.

1055
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:54,041
Didn't you buy

1056
00:59:54,201 --> 00:59:55,721
land for your project?

1057
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:57,561
It was dirt cheap.

1058
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,641
It's all connected:

1059
00:59:59,801 --> 01:00:02,241
Industry only moves in

1060
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:07,561
if there's cultural activity
along with business and sports.

1061
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:12,961
Now people won't have to go
to the city to see a show, or swim.

1062
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:18,041
City people will come to
the village for specific shows.

1063
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:23,041
Our program is aimed
at holding folks here

1064
01:00:23,201 --> 01:00:25,481
and attracting new residents.

1065
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:29,641
We must save the countryside
from emptying out.

1066
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:31,961
You sound like the ecologists.

1067
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:35,321
I share many of their ideas.

1068
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:37,761
Why not join the Greens,

1069
01:00:37,921 --> 01:00:41,801
or your friends in other
conservationist parties?

1070
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:45,361
Their reasons for joining
may not be mine.

1071
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:48,761
If I went in with them,
I'd be doubly disloyal:

1072
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:51,641
to my party, to which
I owe my career,

1073
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:55,921
and to the Greens,
who gave me generous support

1074
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:57,561
in the local voting.

1075
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:00,961
If I ran as a conservationist

1076
01:01:02,801 --> 01:01:06,161
I'd be sabotaging them and myself.

1077
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:08,641
Then the Right
would be a shoo-in.

1078
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:12,001
Ecology is a concern
all parties should share...

1079
01:01:12,161 --> 01:01:15,441
It can't be a political trademark.

1080
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:20,521
It's negative, all prohibitions
and nothing constructive.

1081
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:23,921
Ecologists can't have any platform,

1082
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,721
political, economic or cultural.

1083
01:01:26,881 --> 01:01:31,881
Their leaders are offering
more concrete answers to big issues:

1084
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:35,641
unemployment, crime, immigration...

1085
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:38,561
They're vague, or Utopian.

1086
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:40,961
You need some realism in politics.

1087
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:43,521
Now you talk about realism.

1088
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:46,561
That's how conservatives talk.

1089
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:50,441
Rightists now are less realistic
than the liberals.

1090
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:54,681
Because the Left has been
edging to the Right.

1091
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:58,681
I'll be the devil's advocate.

1092
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:04,281
There's a paradox in what you say.

1093
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:10,321
You seem to be a hard-core liberal,

1094
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:15,841
yet you defend realism.

1095
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:19,921
You preach traditional,
back-to-the-land values.

1096
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:23,881
Even your humanism allies you

1097
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,361
with the conservative dissidents.

1098
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:30,841
Since the Right-Left
distinction is now blurred,

1099
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:34,041
and has been more middle-of-the-road,

1100
01:02:34,281 --> 01:02:38,041
why are you so intent
on being known as Leftist?

1101
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:41,681
A diabolical question,

1102
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:44,161
but not troublesome.

1103
01:02:44,321 --> 01:02:48,561
The Right-Left distinction
may need readjusting,

1104
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:50,401
but it's still valid.

1105
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:54,241
I was raised on liberal ideals,

1106
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:56,721
that's where I'm a traditionalist,

1107
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:58,201
so to speak.

1108
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:01,161
If ever I'm a dissident in my party,

1109
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:04,121
it will be on the hard-core side,

1110
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,921
not toward the middle.
Moderation was

1111
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:12,041
a betrayal and a tactical mistake.
Look where it's got us!

1112
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:16,801
Left-Right conflict
is not outmoded, as some say,

1113
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,161
merely blurred

1114
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:23,801
because some liberal traits,
the original virtues of the Left

1115
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:25,921
are now claimed by the Right.

1116
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:31,281
In this century, sectarianism
and dogmatism...

1117
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,321
not just the communists...

1118
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:37,881
have shifted some Leftist
virtues to the Right,

1119
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:40,961
like civic spirit, equity, tolerance

1120
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:44,361
now claimed by the pseudo-liberals.

1121
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:49,281
They long ago appropriated
democracy and the republic.

1122
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:53,681
But democracy, the republic,
liberty, equality and fraternity,

1123
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:56,281
the Nation,
were not invented by the Right,

1124
01:03:56,961 --> 01:03:59,321
they're the Revolution's heritage.

1125
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:03,841
The Right shouldn't use
these words as if they owned them.

1126
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:06,321
What is it?

1127
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,281
Can I play the piano?

1128
01:04:08,601 --> 01:04:09,681
Alright.

1129
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:13,921
Your problem is: the Right
won't call itself the Right.

1130
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:16,241
It mustn't call itself the Left

1131
01:04:16,401 --> 01:04:17,801
even if it wants to.

1132
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:23,161
If democracy is no longer
social--I mean, socialist--

1133
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:27,121
it's no longer democracy!
My mind's made up on that!

1134
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:32,041
How long have you lived here?

1135
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,921
20 years, come August.

1136
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:37,481
The village has changed, eh?

1137
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,561
Yes. For the better...

1138
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:40,961
For the better?

1139
01:04:42,561 --> 01:04:46,081
All along the line, the atmosphere,

1140
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:47,521
the changes...

1141
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:50,161
to nature, everything...

1142
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:54,441
Is your clientele changing?

1143
01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:55,761
Not much,

1144
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:58,761
we have the same old customers.

1145
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:01,401
A few die off, alas,

1146
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:04,481
so there's always some change.

1147
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:07,161
Are people who come now
different...

1148
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:10,841
for example,
a lot must own summer homes...

1149
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:14,881
from those who live here?
Is there a difference for you?

1150
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:16,641
- Not for us.
- Not at all?

1151
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:22,121
Are you satisfied with the library,
all the cultural changes?

1152
01:05:22,281 --> 01:05:23,761
Why not?

1153
01:05:24,361 --> 01:05:26,641
Do you want something bigger?

1154
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:31,921
Theater, for example, or movies?

1155
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:34,281
I'd like the region to progress.

1156
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:36,081
Are there things you need?

1157
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:42,001
Need? No, but I'd like activities
that get people together.

1158
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,201
Get together?

1159
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,521
Together...there are activities...

1160
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:49,001
by people getting together, I mean

1161
01:05:49,881 --> 01:05:51,881
we can have little parties...

1162
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:55,481
associations...

1163
01:05:55,641 --> 01:06:00,321
A clubhouse where you can
meet, and so on.

1164
01:06:00,921 --> 01:06:03,721
Do you plan to spend your life here?

1165
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:04,881
Absolutely.

1166
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:09,961
We may have to develop
it more than we're doing...

1167
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:12,281
Who knows what the future holds?

1168
01:06:12,441 --> 01:06:17,161
We don't have to stay rooted
and static

1169
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,561
in this charming village.

1170
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:22,361
You're a conscientious objector,

1171
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:27,401
doing your service in the town hall.
Then what?

1172
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:30,361
I plan to teach English.

1173
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:33,521
That means many things.

1174
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:39,241
I'd be transferred around,
so it may not be suited

1175
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:41,321
to living in a village.

1176
01:06:41,601 --> 01:06:44,441
Any chance of teaching English here?

1177
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,321
That's what I do:

1178
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:50,801
teach English to adults and
to kids in the village school.

1179
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:53,121
They're luckier...

1180
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:54,681
than Paris kids...

1181
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:56,961
This is a pilot school.

1182
01:06:57,241 --> 01:07:00,361
Talking to you before,

1183
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:05,641
I noticed you were also aware
of the farmers' problem,

1184
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:06,961
which is real.

1185
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,801
It's a real problem, alright.

1186
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:13,041
Our farmers will surely
have a terrible time

1187
01:07:13,201 --> 01:07:14,801
in the next 5 or 6 years.

1188
01:07:14,961 --> 01:07:16,441
Yes, but why?

1189
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:21,321
Around here there's a big problem
of drained land.

1190
01:07:21,481 --> 01:07:24,321
Farmers are forced to over-irrigate

1191
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:26,881
in a completely crazy way,

1192
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:29,401
it's absolutely nuts.

1193
01:07:30,321 --> 01:07:34,121
So the farmers invest heavily,

1194
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:37,961
then prices drop because
they overproduce.

1195
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:42,081
They grow both corn and wheat,
which is absurd.

1196
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:44,601
The land's not suited for that.

1197
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,401
Do you see a solution?

1198
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:49,561
It's for them to try to find

1199
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:53,281
markets for special crops,

1200
01:07:53,441 --> 01:07:55,761
and everyone do his own thing.

1201
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:57,641
Is that feasible?

1202
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:01,761
Yes, but here again, they need help,

1203
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:06,841
to avoid doing wild things
like planting zucchini.

1204
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:10,281
We've had examples here recently.

1205
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:13,801
You've always lived here?

1206
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:16,401
In the village. I was born here.

1207
01:08:16,561 --> 01:08:22,041
Anything you've missed out on,
or wanted to see?

1208
01:08:22,441 --> 01:08:25,641
I don't know what to say...

1209
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,481
For example, there's a lot of talk

1210
01:08:28,801 --> 01:08:32,801
about culture, a library,
a record library...

1211
01:08:32,961 --> 01:08:37,121
That never said much to us.

1212
01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:40,281
In the old days
we had no time, we worked.

1213
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:43,201
In the evening we just
wanted to rest.

1214
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:44,241
The days were too long...

1215
01:08:44,401 --> 01:08:47,081
Yep, we didn't have
enough hours in the day.

1216
01:08:50,081 --> 01:08:51,641
Is redistribution

1217
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:53,201
of land a good thing?

1218
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:56,001
In some ways,

1219
01:08:56,281 --> 01:09:00,081
to enlarge tracts of land, yes,

1220
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:05,761
other places they should
have left in pasture,

1221
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:07,801
where it was needed.

1222
01:09:07,961 --> 01:09:11,521
Do you favor, for example,
growing corn to feed

1223
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,081
cattle instead of grazing them?

1224
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:16,361
It's costly,

1225
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:21,161
but they're better off eating
fresh, natural things.

1226
01:09:21,481 --> 01:09:22,921
For better meat.

1227
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:26,401
Yes, and the milk and butter, too.

1228
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:30,801
When they eat fresh,
green fodder

1229
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:34,161
it's so much better.
They process it for us.

1230
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:38,121
Then why do we do
the senseless things we do?

1231
01:09:38,281 --> 01:09:41,081
It's progress, of course,
evolution.

1232
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:44,401
It'll end someday, maybe,
I don't know.

1233
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,961
Progress hasn't brought any benefits?

1234
01:09:48,121 --> 01:09:49,801
Not to me, really.

1235
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:54,641
I'm old-fashioned, you see?
I'm not modern.

1236
01:09:56,081 --> 01:09:58,041
You have pasture, too?

1237
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:02,161
- A lot of it?
- 30 acres.

1238
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:04,721
You have livestock?

1239
01:10:04,921 --> 01:10:05,681
Really?

1240
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:08,561
There aren't many left, eh?

1241
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:11,281
Fewer and fewer,
but I've still got some.

1242
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,441
Really?

1243
01:10:12,601 --> 01:10:14,801
Will you show them to me?

1244
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:17,921
I'd love to see and talk
about them. Is it far?

1245
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:19,921
- No, it's not far.
- Meaning?

1246
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:22,361
- Around half a mile.
- Half a mile?

1247
01:10:26,441 --> 01:10:28,521
They wonder what's happening.

1248
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:33,481
- Not used to visiting journalists?
- Guess not.

1249
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,801
Thanks for showing them to me.

1250
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:41,201
I'll tell them
they're in the news...

1251
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:45,161
You're the only one
who still has cattle?

1252
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:47,241
And you graze them?

1253
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:50,801
Can you continue to...

1254
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:55,481
So far, yes, but
for the future, I dunno.

1255
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:59,481
How do you see the future?
What are your problems?

1256
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:01,881
There are all kinds of them.

1257
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:05,761
Things have changed
in 10 years, it's awful.

1258
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:10,761
First of all, folks
aren't so friendly anymore.

1259
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:16,801
And farming is disappearing,
especially small spreads.

1260
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:22,361
I have 90 acres
and you can't live on 90 acres.

1261
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:25,121
My wife found a job a month ago.

1262
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:30,361
We once grew tobacco.
Without it, we couldn't go on farming.

1263
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:36,281
Is large-scale,
low-yield farming the problem?

1264
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:40,841
Costs are too high.
It's not like before.

1265
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:45,841
People lived better 2O years ago.

1266
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:48,881
Some farms had only <i>2</i> or 3 cows.

1267
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:54,161
Now on the few farms left,
the cows never get out.

1268
01:11:54,321 --> 01:11:58,561
Which means that after
5-6 years they're no good anymore.

1269
01:11:58,761 --> 01:12:00,921
Some of mine are 10 and 12 years old.

1270
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:04,121
Still in great shape.

1271
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,201
They eat grass, they eat good things.

1272
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:09,921
You like your cows to be happy, eh?

1273
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:18,121
What's the future of a village

1274
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:22,801
where all the trades have disappeared?

1275
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:26,601
What's happening in St. Juire,
how do people live?

1276
01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:29,801
The atmosphere has changed.

1277
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:31,241
How was it before?

1278
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:34,721
You saw more people,
to start with.

1279
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:38,121
Now, with tractors,
everyone uses the road.

1280
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:42,281
In the old days,
folks would stop at our fountain.

1281
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:46,241
Tons of them,
sometimes 10, 15 a day.

1282
01:12:46,401 --> 01:12:51,041
They had oxen, then,
or horses, it depended...

1283
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:55,521
Often they'd go to the house,
chat a bit.

1284
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:58,041
Now they're on tractors, so...

1285
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:00,601
- There's no time to chat?
- No time left.

1286
01:13:00,801 --> 01:13:02,921
That's terrible.

1287
01:13:03,201 --> 01:13:05,681
There was a baker.
There's none now.

1288
01:13:06,401 --> 01:13:10,041
How do you get bread?
Vans come through selling it?

1289
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:13,121
They come in a van,
from Sainte-Hermine.

1290
01:13:13,961 --> 01:13:15,721
Or Saint-Martin...

1291
01:13:19,641 --> 01:13:22,441
That's all past now.

1292
01:13:23,241 --> 01:13:25,201
What do you think?

1293
01:13:25,361 --> 01:13:30,281
How do you keep a village alive?

1294
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:33,761
What has to be done?
Any ideas?

1295
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:34,801
Nope.

1296
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:43,081
They're not putting up
a building

1297
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:46,801
for the 15 readers
who now use the library.

1298
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,081
The old one

1299
01:13:48,241 --> 01:13:49,201
was big enough.

1300
01:13:49,361 --> 01:13:53,241
If it got too small,
they could move it to one

1301
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:57,081
of the village farms
that are on sale cheap.

1302
01:13:57,241 --> 01:13:58,841
They're not interested

1303
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:03,201
in meeting the "cultural"
needs of the locals,

1304
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,281
but in drawing new people.

1305
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:08,641
Who? From where?

1306
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:11,481
That's all vague.

1307
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:17,601
But maybe not so vague, after all.
I have my suspicions.

1308
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:18,361
Namely?

1309
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:21,801
It's His Honor the Mayor's policy,

1310
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:25,361
who is backed
by the Culture Minister,

1311
01:14:25,521 --> 01:14:28,401
who is backed
by the President of France:

1312
01:14:29,601 --> 01:14:33,281
we must at all costs
liven up the rural districts.

1313
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:35,521
Liven them up!

1314
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:39,481
To city people,
the countryside is "inanimate".

1315
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:41,241
We must be revived.

1316
01:14:41,721 --> 01:14:45,001
This is socialism's
truly perverse effect.

1317
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:48,481
Even in socialism
it's an obsolete idea.

1318
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:52,681
It's the perverse state
robbing people of responsibility,

1319
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:55,721
so they look to it for everything.

1320
01:14:55,881 --> 01:14:59,041
They become welfare
clients dependent on decisions

1321
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:01,921
that eliminate them as individuals.

1322
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,361
You think I'm off the subject?

1323
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,281
- You'll cut this.
- Maybe not.

1324
01:15:07,441 --> 01:15:09,161
I'm sure you will.

1325
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:14,161
Now I'll tell you something
that's relevant, but general.

1326
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:19,401
You'll cut that, too.
A pity: the idea deserves an airing.

1327
01:15:21,441 --> 01:15:22,641
Alright...

1328
01:15:23,521 --> 01:15:28,361
Whether this building
ever goes up or not,

1329
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:31,041
and I still hope it won't,

1330
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:35,281
isn't just a smokescreen before
the voters, which is serious.

1331
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:40,441
It's part of a policy to urbanize
the village insidiously.

1332
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:44,481
The mayor expects
that in up to 50 years

1333
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:47,241
all the farmers will disappear.

1334
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:52,321
This will be an urban area,
a distant suburb of a small city

1335
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:55,081
that will be a suburb
of a bigger city,

1336
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:56,041
itself a suburb

1337
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:58,201
of a no-longer-so-remote Paris.

1338
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:00,881
The mayor isn't scaring farmers away.

1339
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:03,401
It's an undeniable fact.

1340
01:16:04,841 --> 01:16:06,921
I'm not so sure.

1341
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:09,241
What will happen in 40 years?

1342
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:15,721
Were the world events of
the past 3 years anticipated?

1343
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:19,001
In politics, no, I agree.

1344
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:22,161
Forecasts are easier in economics.

1345
01:16:22,321 --> 01:16:24,481
Not really.

1346
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:27,641
We've made mistakes and always will.

1347
01:16:27,801 --> 01:16:29,401
I assure you.

1348
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:33,121
Did we foresee the ravages
of single-crop farming?

1349
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:35,201
Of uprooting hedgerows?

1350
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:38,681
Of chemical fertilizers?

1351
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:45,641
Will the Third World go on sending us
cheap raw materials?

1352
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:51,721
Why do we buy pears in New Zealand
when they're better here?

1353
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:54,241
To spur the transport industry,

1354
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:57,121
send up planes to pollute the air,

1355
01:16:57,281 --> 01:17:00,201
promote trains that
burn atomic energy,

1356
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:06,921
build roads that
now cover 58 % of the planet.

1357
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:10,321
9O % of the modern world's ills result

1358
01:17:10,481 --> 01:17:15,041
from our mad insistence
on moving men and merchandise.

1359
01:17:15,201 --> 01:17:18,641
If we don't farm the countryside,
it won't be country.

1360
01:17:19,321 --> 01:17:21,281
Why do folks go to the country?

1361
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:25,041
If it becomes the city,
they won't come anymore.

1362
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:26,361
I surely won't.

1363
01:17:26,521 --> 01:17:29,441
If that building goes up,
I'll get a transfer.

1364
01:17:31,281 --> 01:17:35,361
Despite what he says,
the mayor's a city man.

1365
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:38,721
If he were really a country man,

1366
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:43,801
he'd live here the year round
and farm his own land.

1367
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,961
His manor is just a country home.

1368
01:17:48,481 --> 01:17:54,201
Most village mayors own country homes.

1369
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,881
Is that proper?

1370
01:17:58,081 --> 01:18:00,241
It's like the days of Louis XVI,

1371
01:18:00,721 --> 01:18:05,841
when a noble had a country manor,
and a town house in Versailles!

1372
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:11,041
I've been really begged to run
for the local council.

1373
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:12,401
I've always said no.

1374
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:14,801
Why? Because I like my tranquillity?

1375
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:16,201
Not just for that.

1376
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:20,561
No, honestly, it's because
I wasn't born here.

1377
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:24,081
The natives have more rights than I

1378
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:27,241
to manage their town.

1379
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:32,601
But having lived
and worked here for 10 years,

1380
01:18:32,761 --> 01:18:35,001
shared the lives of people here,

1381
01:18:35,161 --> 01:18:38,921
I have more of a right
to run than Dechaumes.

1382
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,081
So run.

1383
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:43,921
Why not?

1384
01:18:44,441 --> 01:18:48,041
It'd be good to have
a teacher on the council.

1385
01:18:48,481 --> 01:18:51,161
I wouldn't win. I hate politics.
I won't run.

1386
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:53,641
Someone in my family may,
but not me.

1387
01:18:53,801 --> 01:18:55,881
Who? Your wife?

1388
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:58,761
My daughter. She's 10 years old.

1389
01:18:58,921 --> 01:19:02,281
I'm joking, but she's
a born politician.

1390
01:19:24,401 --> 01:19:26,001
<i>CHAPTER V</i>

1391
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:28,841
<i>If, just as the issue
was going to press,</i>

1392
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:33,441
<i>Blandine hadn't gone with
a UNICEF mission to Somalia...</i>

1393
01:20:04,321 --> 01:20:05,761
- Things OK?
- Fine.

1394
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,401
Take this...

1395
01:20:16,841 --> 01:20:18,121
I'm worn out.

1396
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:20,641
- So how'd it go?
- Fine.

1397
01:20:20,801 --> 01:20:22,921
- Was he good?
- Very. He's asleep.

1398
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:25,481
No! You have a party, or what?

1399
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:32,761
How are you,

1400
01:20:32,921 --> 01:20:33,881
little rascal?

1401
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,881
You OK? Did you have fun?

1402
01:20:36,681 --> 01:20:38,641
I bet Manuela let you run wild.

1403
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:39,721
No, she didn't.

1404
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:41,001
She didn't, eh?

1405
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:45,161
What's this? Did you make it?

1406
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:20,041
Sorry, did I wake you?

1407
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:24,961
I just got home, had a great trip,

1408
01:21:25,121 --> 01:21:26,241
I'm calling to...

1409
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:28,121
Seen the issue?

1410
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,281
And you're furious.

1411
01:21:36,081 --> 01:21:39,281
It figures...I'll explain...

1412
01:21:40,281 --> 01:21:43,241
I don't see why you cut it so much.

1413
01:21:43,601 --> 01:21:47,201
I had to, it was too long.
You weren't here...

1414
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:50,001
I had to make decisions...

1415
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:53,361
You cut the heart out
and left the hull.

1416
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:57,681
Our subject was the new politicians.

1417
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:01,641
At first, but that wasn't
the tack to take with Julien.

1418
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:03,641
It was recited by rote.

1419
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:05,681
The teacher was more amusing.

1420
01:22:06,281 --> 01:22:07,601
Sure, he was clowning.

1421
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:09,921
He's touching, even pathetic.

1422
01:22:10,081 --> 01:22:12,361
I'm in love with his tree, too.

1423
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:16,961
You're plunging
into ecological trendiness.

1424
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:21,401
Why give the ecologists
a monopoly on ecology?

1425
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:24,881
This month we covered smoking,

1426
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,761
pollution in Uzbekistan, the tree,

1427
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:31,041
it all made a good,
ecology-slanted issue.

1428
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:36,641
A tree on the cover
of a political monthly is gutsy.

1429
01:22:40,361 --> 01:22:42,881
He's my cousin, not yours.

1430
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:46,761
Don't worry, I'll square it with him.

1431
01:22:51,521 --> 01:22:55,001
Our trade's honor doesn't rest
on your frail shoulders.

1432
01:22:56,481 --> 01:22:59,161
Blame it on me, I can talk to him.

1433
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:02,121
I'm doing him a favor.

1434
01:23:02,481 --> 01:23:06,481
What he said wouldn't please
the powers in Paris.

1435
01:23:29,961 --> 01:23:30,921
Julien!

1436
01:23:41,001 --> 01:23:42,761
The article! Is it good?

1437
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:44,401
Shocking!

1438
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:46,481
Seen the cover?

1439
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:51,241
The tree.
We made the cover, so why not?

1440
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,001
But the headline!

1441
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:59,281
"The Teacher Prefers the Tree
to the Library".

1442
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,921
That's his problem, not mine.

1443
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,801
It is yours: you're not
in the article at all.

1444
01:24:06,961 --> 01:24:08,561
You kidding?

1445
01:24:08,721 --> 01:24:09,841
You read it through?

1446
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:11,641
Both pages.

1447
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:15,681
Only two pages? There must be a jump.

1448
01:24:15,841 --> 01:24:17,481
I assure you, I looked.

1449
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:18,681
It's two pages.

1450
01:24:18,841 --> 01:24:20,241
Let me read that.

1451
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:24,561
"Mayor Julien Dechaumes seems
like a gentleman farmer

1452

01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:48,321
"By helping to create jobs,

1460
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:52,321
"Paris architect Antoine Pergola

"But school principal Marc Rossignol

1462
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:08,961
Incredible, it's all about him!

1463
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:11,921
We talked for two hours!

1464
01:25:12,081 --> 01:25:15,281
I knew she'd cut, but not everything.
What's left?

1465
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:17,761
James Fenimore Cooper.

1466
01:25:18,801 --> 01:25:20,641
I didn't trust that woman.

1467
01:25:21,081 --> 01:25:22,441
Read the rest of it.

1468
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:25,801
I don't want to.
I know his damned tree!

1469
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:27,721
Sure it's pretty. I like trees too.

1470
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:29,201
His tree's rotten!

1471
01:25:30,321 --> 01:25:35,201
It won't live 3 more years.
Main branches keep falling off.

1472
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:38,041
I'm furious!

1473
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:42,081
She's a typical modern journalist:

1474
01:25:42,241 --> 01:25:43,041
sly'

1475
01:25:43,881 --> 01:25:45,281
manipulating...

1476
01:25:45,721 --> 01:25:47,881
that, yes!

1477
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:50,441
You should put her in your novel.

1478
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:52,561
You bet I will.

1479
01:25:55,961 --> 01:26:00,641
And he's a typical
scandal-sheet editor,

1480
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:02,281
unscrupulous,

1481
01:26:02,441 --> 01:26:05,921
up to any dirty trick for a scoop,

1482
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:08,881
a sensational photo or headline.

1483
01:26:09,161 --> 01:26:10,201
It's true!

1484
01:26:11,481 --> 01:26:15,521
All in the benign guise
of a veteran newsman.

1485
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,601
I see several explanations.

1486
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:24,241
First, and I tend to doubt this,

1487
01:26:24,881 --> 01:26:29,601
is that the teacher
is secretly loyal to a clique,

1488
01:26:30,121 --> 01:26:33,201
an agent for the some
or all of the Socialists,

1489
01:26:33,361 --> 01:26:36,081
and he's hiding
behind the ecologists.

1490
01:26:36,241 --> 01:26:40,041
That's fantasy,
it's most unlikely.

1491
01:26:40,681 --> 01:26:43,001
For my novel
it must be more probable.

1492
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:46,561
A second possibility,
which you're welcome to use:

1493
01:26:48,281 --> 01:26:50,041
he's jockeying for position.

1494
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:54,001
With the Socialists down,
he's using the ecologists

1495
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:59,441
to satisfy some personal ambition.

1496
01:26:59,601 --> 01:27:02,081
That's more like it.

1497
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:07,281
I suspect he's flattering
the ecologists for the moment

1498
01:27:07,441 --> 01:27:09,321
for personal reasons.

1499
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:13,201
He owns property
that's threatened by a freeway.

1500
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:16,201
So he told us.
He was funny about it.

1501
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:19,121
He's being an opportunist.

1502
01:27:20,481 --> 01:27:25,441
The third possibility
is the pettiest:

1503
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:30,001
he once said
I had no gift for politics,

1504
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,561
and now he won't back off.

1505
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:36,241
I was too trusting,
it's a lesson to me.

1506
01:27:36,401 --> 01:27:39,561
At least the teacher's pleased.

1507
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,881
Well, I can use what he says,

1508
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:46,681
because he's so reactionary

1509
01:27:47,121 --> 01:27:51,721
that by contrast I really
stand out as a liberal.

1510
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:56,801
And since you still need
to seem liberal...

1511
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:58,281
it's perfect.

1512
01:28:01,081 --> 01:28:02,721
<i>CHAPTER VI</i>

1513
01:28:02,881 --> 01:28:06,841
<i>If Vega, the mayor's daughter,
hadn't sent her balloon</i>

1514
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:11,201

the teacher's daughter...</i>

1515
01:28:34,241 --> 01:28:35,721
You live here?

1516
01:28:36,081 --> 01:28:37,961
You Mr Dechaume's daughter?

1517
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:39,361
Yes. And you?

1518
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:43,241
My Dad's Mr Rossignol,
the school principal.

1519
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:45,241
Mine's the mayor.

1520
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:47,881
Your Dad's a mare?

1521
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:50,881
No, mayor, "yo" no "e".

1522
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:54,721
I know, I'm not stupid.
What's your name?

1523
01:28:55,441 --> 01:28:57,081
Vega. And yours?

1524
01:28:57,241 --> 01:29:00,321
Zoe. You alone here?

1525
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:02,921
Yes, I mean, I'm with my Dad.

1526
01:29:03,321 --> 01:29:04,281
And your Mom?

1527
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:06,201
She doesn't live here.

1528
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,121
Are they...divorced?

1529
01:29:09,881 --> 01:29:10,721
Yes, but...

1530
01:29:10,881 --> 01:29:12,601
I'm only here for vacations.

1531
01:29:12,761 --> 01:29:17,041
Monday I'm going back to Mother.

1532
01:29:17,921 --> 01:29:19,481
You got any friends?

1533
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:21,001
Not here.

1534
01:29:21,521 --> 01:29:24,281
I can introduce you.
I have plenty.

1535
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:27,881
Playing with your ball alone?

1536
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:30,281
Yes, I'm alone.

1537
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,121
I can play with you.
I'm in no hurry.

1538
01:29:35,201 --> 01:29:38,321
I can even show you
the vegetable garden.

1539
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:44,441
There are cherries over there,

1540
01:29:44,601 --> 01:29:46,561
but they're better here.

1541
01:29:46,721 --> 01:29:47,961
Let's go.

1542
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:54,041
Like that, see?

1543
01:29:54,201 --> 01:29:56,161
I don't know what it's for, but...

1544
01:29:56,761 --> 01:30:00,081
It's a big here.
What's behind there?

1545
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:03,401
Strawberries,

1546
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:06,681
wild strawberries, flowers,

1547
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:07,681
and lettuce.

1548
01:30:07,841 --> 01:30:09,641
How far does it go?

1549
01:30:12,161 --> 01:30:15,721
It starts there, then you go
all the way around...

1550
01:30:16,721 --> 01:30:17,561
It's very big.

1551
01:30:21,441 --> 01:30:23,001
Do you like this color?

1552
01:30:23,201 --> 01:30:26,041
It's pretty. Do you?

1553
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:28,281
I dunno, I think...

1554
01:30:28,761 --> 01:30:31,321
I hate it! Horrible!

1555
01:30:37,961 --> 01:30:40,321
This is the biggest cedar in France.

1556
01:30:40,481 --> 01:30:43,321
It's not. I saw the biggest on TV.

1557
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:46,721
They'll say anything on TV.

1558
01:30:47,601 --> 01:30:51,681
What's that tower?

1559
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:53,961
A dovecote. Want to see?

1560
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:55,401
I'd love to.

1561
01:30:58,001 --> 01:30:59,961

1562
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,001
I win!

1563
01:31:10,401 --> 01:31:11,441
Daddy!

1564
01:31:13,721 --> 01:31:14,921
You OK?

1565
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:16,241
Found a friend?

1566
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:17,601
Yep, her name's Zoe.

1567
01:31:17,761 --> 01:31:19,001
Zoe Rossignol..

1568
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:21,961
Your Dad's Mr Rossignol,
the principal?

1569
01:31:22,121 --> 01:31:22,761
That's right.

1570
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:24,681
How did you meet?

1571
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:26,801
She was riding by on a bike.

1572
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:29,681
Well, have fun. See you later.

1573
01:31:29,841 --> 01:31:32,281
Sir, can I say something?

1574
01:31:33,641 --> 01:31:34,321
Of course, what?

1575
01:31:34,481 --> 01:31:36,161
About your project.

1576
01:31:38,121 --> 01:31:40,441
The media library?

1577
01:31:40,961 --> 01:31:43,401
I read that your Dad's against it.

1578
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:47,721
That's his opinion, and that's fine.

1579
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:51,361
I'm all for discussion.
You tell him that.

1580
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:52,801
Did he send you to...?

1581
01:31:52,961 --> 01:31:54,241
No, he didn't.

1582
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:56,841
He ought to contact me directly.

1583
01:31:57,001 --> 01:32:00,281
I repeat,
I'm entirely at his disposal.

1584
01:32:00,561 --> 01:32:01,881
He doesn't want to.

1585
01:32:02,481 --> 01:32:05,961
He doesn't want to talk?
Don't say he's scared of me.

1586
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:08,161
He says it's pointless.

1587
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:13,161
Talking? I'm for discussion.

1588
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:17,121
A teacher should be, too,
don't you think?

1589
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:21,121
He has his opinion, he won't change,
he's said his piece.

1590
01:32:21,281 --> 01:32:25,121
But I'm for saying
it face to face. Right?

1591
01:32:25,281 --> 01:32:27,441
In the magazine story
he was cut a lot.

1592
01:32:27,601 --> 01:32:31,001
I was cut a lot, too!

1593
01:32:31,161 --> 01:32:34,521
But I won't change my mind,
I said what I had to say.

1594
01:32:34,921 --> 01:32:36,241
He won't discuss it.

1595
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:39,361
If he won't, that's that!

1596
01:32:39,521 --> 01:32:41,521
But I'd like to talk!

1597
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:43,321
For him?

1598
01:32:43,481 --> 01:32:45,481
For him and myself.

1599
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:50,041
You want to speak for yourself?

1600
01:32:50,281 --> 01:32:52,841
Let's sit down.
What have you to say, Miss?

1601
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:56,481
I don't entirely agree with Dad.

1602
01:32:58,401 --> 01:33:01,041
He's too pessimistic.

1603
01:33:01,281 --> 01:33:04,681
That means you're
for the project?

1604
01:33:05,241 --> 01:33:06,201
Less than he is.

1605
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:08,641
Less? How? He's dead against it.

1606
01:33:08,801 --> 01:33:12,081
He talks, but won't act.
I want to fight.

1607
01:33:12,681 --> 01:33:13,441
Fight me?

1608
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:16,081
Fight everyone and no one.

1609
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:18,321
How?

1610
01:33:18,481 --> 01:33:22,561
By discussion. You say you're willing.
You in a hurry?

1611
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:25,081
I've a few minutes.
It won't take hours.

1612
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:26,801
We'll be brief.

1613
01:33:26,961 --> 01:33:27,841
OK, shoot.

1614
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:30,681
Your center isn't really needed.

1615
01:33:30,841 --> 01:33:32,441
Stop right there.

1616
01:33:33,081 --> 01:33:36,041
It'd be great to have
a pool near your home.

1617
01:33:36,201 --> 01:33:39,121
You won't have to go miles for a swim.

1618
01:33:39,321 --> 01:33:43,041
It's a short bicycle ride,
I don't need it closer.

1619
01:33:43,681 --> 01:33:45,801
The library doesn't speak to you?

1620
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:49,121
It's too big, and it's so ugly.

1621
01:33:49,681 --> 01:33:54,161
The video library, with 10 TV screens?
Films you can't see on TV?

1622
01:33:54,801 --> 01:33:57,041
It's stupid to ruin...

1623
01:33:58,241 --> 01:34:01,161
the field for a thing
you could put elsewhere.

1624
01:34:01,321 --> 01:34:04,281
There are village houses
for sale cheap.

1625
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:08,201
I'll tell you something
I'm sure you don't know.

1626
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:13,321
It's easier to raise money
for a new building

1627
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,681
than to restore an old one.

1628
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:18,801
I got funding for a full program.

1629
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:22,681
I wouldn't have for
a random operation.

1630
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:25,641
For reasons we can't go into now,

1631
01:34:25,801 --> 01:34:28,561
the Culture Ministry backed me

1632
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:31,921
as part of its consolidation policy.

1633
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:34,961
I'm opposed. The Ministry is wrong.

1634
01:34:35,121 --> 01:34:38,921
It's dumb to group everything
all the time. Useless, too.

1635
01:34:39,081 --> 01:34:43,361
And why a theater?
We have a community hall.

1636
01:34:43,521 --> 01:34:44,561
It's just a shed.

1637
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:46,361
It can be fixed up.

1638
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:48,561
Costly, if it's done right.

1639
01:34:48,761 --> 01:34:50,841
You want Paris theater troupes

1640
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:54,961
to come to a comfortable place
with good acoustics.

1641
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:56,201
Outdoors is better?

1642
01:34:56,361 --> 01:34:59,601
There's no echo.
It's like a Roman theater.

1643
01:34:59,761 --> 01:35:02,081
Like in Aries and Orange.

1644
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:03,281
What if it rains?

1645
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:04,841
It can't rain all the time.

1646
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:06,961
It rains a lot here.

1647
01:35:07,121 --> 01:35:10,041
You're so pessimistic!

1648
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:13,241
No, but it's stupid
to ruin a field

1649
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:15,681
when you don't have to.

1650
01:35:16,121 --> 01:35:19,121
The field was given to us.
We have to use it.

1651
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:24,001
The cows will be gone next year.
What would you put there?

1652
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:28,041
I have a theory.
But you wouldn't understand.

1653
01:35:28,561 --> 01:35:30,401
Really? Why?

1654
01:35:30,761 --> 01:35:35,281
There's something the village needs
more than the library.

1655
01:35:35,721 --> 01:35:36,601
What's that?

1656
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:39,041
Parks.

1657
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:44,041
Parks? There's greenery everywhere.

1658
01:35:44,201 --> 01:35:47,081
This is the country,
we're surrounded by it.

1659
01:35:47,561 --> 01:35:50,721
Cities have parks, but not the country.

1660
01:35:50,881 --> 01:35:55,761
Your house has grounds, but others
only have their little gardens.

1661
01:35:56,201 --> 01:36:00,401
When I read history,
I see that kids played in the fields.

1662
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:05,201
They could pick flowers,
hunt butterflies and ladybugs.

1663
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:08,161
Now it's all shut off with barbed wire.

1664
01:36:08,321 --> 01:36:10,761
If you do find a way in,

1665
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,441
dogs chase you.

1666
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:16,921
So why would people
with kids go to the country?

1667
01:36:17,081 --> 01:36:19,761
Without fields or meadows or woods,

1668
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:21,441
there's nothing left.

1669
01:36:23,521 --> 01:36:28,121
What you say
isn't so silly, Miss, not at all.

1670
01:36:28,601 --> 01:36:31,081
There are woods near here.

1671
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:33,281
It's three miles!

1672
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:35,121
A nice little bike ride.

1673
01:36:36,201 --> 01:36:38,841
No, I don't want to tease you,

1674
01:36:39,001 --> 01:36:41,961
but what's done is done.

1675
01:36:42,121 --> 01:36:44,721
We'll build the library,
it's underway.

1676
01:36:44,881 --> 01:36:47,561
Overall, however, your objection

1677
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:51,041
is well taken.

1678
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:55,801
Thanks for thinking of something
we tend to ignore.

1679
01:36:56,001 --> 01:37:00,561
If the fields and meadows
disappear in the future,

1680
01:37:00,721 --> 01:37:05,241
we'll have to create playing fields.

1681
01:37:05,961 --> 01:37:08,961
Optimism is vital.
The future's moving your way.

1682
01:37:09,121 --> 01:37:12,761
Meadows will soon
be selling for a song.

1683
01:37:12,921 --> 01:37:17,241
Then we can make
a leisure area for young and old.

1684
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:20,121
Anyway, I'm grateful
for your suggestion.

1685
01:37:20,281 --> 01:37:24,481
It doesn't confirm my stand,
but it coincides with the project.

1686
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:26,841
It completes it.

1687
01:37:27,361 --> 01:37:28,401
It's the next step.

1688
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:30,561
Anyway, I'm glad you weren't

1689
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:33,041
scared to discuss it with me.

1690
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:35,121
- How old are you?
- Ten.

1691
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:40,121
I hadn't such ideas at ten.
Nor could I air them to a grownup.

1692
01:37:40,361 --> 01:37:42,361
- What'll you do later on?
- I dunno.

1693
01:37:42,521 --> 01:37:43,641
You have time.

1694
01:37:43,801 --> 01:37:47,801
If you see your Dad,
tell him I'm at his disposal

1695
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:52,241
to discuss the library,
the pool, the tree.

1696
01:37:54,841 --> 01:37:55,921
I'll be off now.

1697
01:37:57,881 --> 01:37:59,521
<i>CHAPTER VII</i>

1698
01:37:59,681 --> 01:38:02,961
<i>If a bureaucrat,
out of routine or by order,</i>

1699
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:05,121
<i>hadn't been overzealous...</i>

1700
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:10,441
Hey. Mayor!

1701
01:38:11,681 --> 01:38:13,681
- Remember me?
- Yes, how are you?

1702
01:38:13,841 --> 01:38:15,281
Fine, thanks.

1703
01:38:15,441 --> 01:38:17,561
I'm sorry about that article.

1704
01:38:18,081 --> 01:38:19,761
I know, it's Regis's fault.

1705
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:21,921
How do you know? What did he say?

1706
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:23,801
I haven't seen him. I guessed.

1707
01:38:24,361 --> 01:38:27,681
I haven't seen him either,
I quit. Now I'm at UNESCO.

1708
01:38:27,841 --> 01:38:28,401
Fine.

1709
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:30,841
What's become of your project?

1710
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:32,201
It's in a hole.

1711
01:38:32,361 --> 01:38:33,481
The article?

1712
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:38,281
It didn't help. But the engine was
racing and it jammed.

1713
01:38:38,441 --> 01:38:41,521
- You lost the subsidy?
- No, but they might as well have.

1714
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:44,681
A bureaucrat in the planning office

1715
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:47,601
said the ground wasn't safe.

1716
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:49,161
Didn't you test it?

1717
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:52,321
Sure, it's dry and hard as rock.

1718
01:38:52,601 --> 01:38:57,761
There's a subsoil water trap
that the farmers pumped dry.

1719
01:38:57,921 --> 01:39:00,081
It'd take 1000 years
to fill up.

1720
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:03,281
But there's a hole,
we must bolster the foundations.

1721
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:04,561
Will it cost a lot?

1722
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:06,321
Under 5% of the estimate.

1723
01:39:06,481 --> 01:39:10,521
But I don't have it.
I have to raise it.

1724
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:11,761
The Ministry?

1725
01:39:11,921 --> 01:39:14,281
Out of the question.

1726
01:39:15,401 --> 01:39:18,201
They already regret I got so much.

1727
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:20,681
They're glad the project's dying.

1728
01:39:20,841 --> 01:39:24,001
I even thought of raising the money

1729
01:39:24,161 --> 01:39:27,481
by selling some of my land
for a loan to the town,

1730
01:39:27,641 --> 01:39:30,641
to be repaid at leisure.

1731
01:39:30,801 --> 01:39:33,201
But I found no buyers

1732
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:37,681
except a shady Briton who wanted
to build a golf course.

1733
01:39:37,841 --> 01:39:39,801
I'd have lost all my land.

1734
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:44,081
And it didn't fit my idea
of a people's playground.

1735
01:39:44,241 --> 01:39:46,361
You mustn't ruin yourself.

1736
01:39:46,921 --> 01:39:48,241
Ruin myself!

1737
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:52,441
If it had served any purpose,
I'd have done it.

1738
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:55,281
But a politician

1739
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:56,961
must be realistic...

1740
01:39:57,121 --> 01:39:59,201
He's no Quixote, he's a pioneer.

1741
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:01,081
Pioneers must be followed.

1742
01:40:01,241 --> 01:40:04,321
They must be guided
so they can guide, too.

1743
01:40:04,481 --> 01:40:06,641
But no one's following me.

1744
01:40:06,801 --> 01:40:08,161
Let's have a drink.

1745
01:40:17,841 --> 01:40:21,121
Zoe, get my geography book, please.

1746
01:40:49,641 --> 01:40:51,161
A letter for your Dad.

1747
01:41:09,841 --> 01:41:11,521
The mayor's office!

1748
01:41:16,761 --> 01:41:20,001
"Dear friends, the town council

1749
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:23,361
"has canceled plans for a cultural center

1750
01:41:23,521 --> 01:41:26,081
"for lack of funds.

1751
01:41:26,641 --> 01:41:31,241
"The district planning office,
for safety reasons, insists

1752
01:41:31,401 --> 01:41:36,121
"on changes that
are well beyond our budget."

1753
01:41:36,441 --> 01:41:38,681
I knew it!

1754
01:41:39,321 --> 01:41:41,761
If I hadn't talked to him...

1755
01:41:42,481 --> 01:41:43,601
Well done!

1756
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:46,121
You'll be a Deputy!

1757
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:47,321
Give her a hand.

1758
01:41:52,201 --> 01:41:57,601
"Now the countryside will bloom,
"Swallows will have lots of room.

1759
01:41:57,761 --> 01:42:04,441
"Fields covered with flowers bright,
"For the ladybugs' delight!

1760
01:42:04,681 --> 01:42:09,481
"No more insecticides,
"No more pesticides,

1761
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:14,481
"No more diesel oil,
"No roads the view to spoil,

1762
01:42:14,641 --> 01:42:19,201
"We'll breathe in oxygen,
"instead of kerosene.

1763
01:42:19,361 --> 01:42:23,241
"No garbage dumps that tower,
"No more atomic power,

1764
01:42:23,401 --> 01:42:28,961
"No holes in the old ozone,
"No zones...

1765
01:42:29,161 --> 01:42:31,841
"Of planning bureaucratic...

1766
01:42:32,241 --> 01:42:37,161
"No more media library,
"And the lending library...

1767
01:42:37,321 --> 01:42:39,521
"...in an old attic.

1768
01:42:39,681 --> 01:42:44,521
"The video collection
in a disused mill.

1769
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:50,201
"The discs will sound sweller
in the cellar."

1770
01:43:00,441 --> 01:43:02,961
"We will all live in the country,

1771
01:43:03,281 --> 01:43:05,601
"Among the meadows and the fields,

1772
01:43:06,081 --> 01:43:08,401
"We can live like landed gentry

1773
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:11,161
"On whatever the soil yields.

1774
01:43:11,481 --> 01:43:14,041
"If you're a most important clerk,

1775
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:16,921
"accountant or data brain,

01:43:17,081 --> 01:43:19,681
"There'll be no need to go to work

1777
01:43:19,921 --> 01:43:22,921
"In an auto, or by train.

01:43:23,081 --> 01:43:25,961
"We'll be on permanent vacation

1779

"In agricultural elation.

"What luck!

"We've found the best solution

01:43:36,401 --> 01:43:39,241
"For the coming generation.

"In that case, for the weekend

"And for all holidays,
