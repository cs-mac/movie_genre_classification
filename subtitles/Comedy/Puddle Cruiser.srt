00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:12,875
Met a girl, thought she was grand

3
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:17,016
fell in love, found out first hand

4
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:21,493
went well for a week or two

5
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:26,072
then it all came unglued

6
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:30,280
In a trap, trip I can't grip

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,095
never thought I'd be the one who'd slip

8
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:39,246
then I started to realize

9
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:42,958
I was living one big lie

10
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:44,634
She fucking hates me

11
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,797
trust
she fucking hates me

12
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,013
la la la love

13
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:54,342
I tried too hard

14
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:57,839
and she tore my feelings like I had none

15
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:00,922
and ripped them away

16
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:05,568
She was queen for about an hour

17
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:09,636
after that shit got sour

18
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:13,493
she took all I ever had

19
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,160
no sign of guilt

20
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,928
no feeling of bad, no

21
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,325
In a trap, trip I can't grip

22
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:27,128
never thought I'd be the one who'd slip

23
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:31,403
then I started to realize

24
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:35,070
I was living one big lie

25
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,804
She fucking hates me

26
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:42,045
trust
she fucking hates me

27
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:44,284
la la la love

28
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:46,365
I tried too hard

29
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,089
and she tore my feelings like I had none

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,363
and ripped them away

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,601
that's my story, as you see

32
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:18,808
learned my lesson and so did she

33
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:23,060
now it's over and I'm glad

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,414
'cause I'm a fool for all I've said

35
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,326
She fucking hates me

36
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,007
trust
she fucking hates me

37
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,549
la la la love

38
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,450
I tried too hard

39
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,264
and she tore my feelings like I had none

40
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,786
and ripped them away

41
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:49,093
la la la la la la la la la love

42
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:53,537
Trust
la la la la la la la la la love

43
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:59,298
Trust
and she tore my feelings like I had none

44
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:06,237
she fucking hates me

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:21,000
