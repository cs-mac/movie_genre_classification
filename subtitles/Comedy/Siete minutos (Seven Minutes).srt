1
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:56,125
Look at me.

2
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,543
Look at the kite.

3
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,353
Jack..

4
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,092
Oh, I've seen that outfit before.

5
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,469
I can't remember when.

6
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:15,264
- Last night.
- Last night!

7
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,183
These things do return.

8
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:22,146
God, my head is still pounding
like a drum.

9
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,772
You party hard.

10
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,192
Yeah, well, you don't look
worse than I am.

11
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:29,236
I didn't drink as much as you.

12
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,196
History of my life, Sara.

13
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,908
Psychiatrist by day,
party animal by night.

14
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:37,536
I thought you've told me
you weren't a lawyer.

15
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,413
I'm not, yet.

16
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,667
Excuse me.

17
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,421
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jack. It's Shelly.

18
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,758
- I've been calling all morning. You ok?
- I'm ok. What's up?

19
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:51,759
I was worried.

20
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,511
You worry too much, Shelly.
What's going on?

21
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:57,181
Frank Parks is been calling.
He needs to speak with you immediately.

22
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,932
Patch him through.

23
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:04,396
I had fun last night,
Miss. Pollard.

24
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:05,939
Me too.

25
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,734
Thanks for the wine-tasting,
Dr. Gramm.

26
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,319
Jack.

27
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,698
Hey, Jack, I've got Frank Parks.
Go ahead.

28
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,784
- Hey, Frank.
- Jack.

29
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:19,370
We got another one.

30
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,455
Oh, no. The same?

31
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:22,581
Every detail.

32
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,084
Right down
to the lateral laceration.

33
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:31,006
It's the Seattle slayer again.

34
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,217
- Where are you now?
- Look, Jack.

35
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,219
There's a tape.

36
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:37,221
You're gonna wanna see it.

37
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,975
Jack, are you still there?

38
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,894
Yeah.

39
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,818
Meet me at my office, okay?

40
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,486
Sure, Jack.

41
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,093
Where to?

42
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,721
114 Western, please.
Quickly.

43
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,646
Welcome back, Seattle.

44
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,733
We're continuing our interview
with John Forster..

45
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:34,320
Who was convicted for the death
of Janie Kay, nine years ago..

46
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:38,657
Based on the eyewitness testimony
of her twin sister, Janie Kay.

47
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,077
John Forster was dated to die at
midnight, at Walla Walla Penitentiary.

48
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,829
- Do you mind changing it?
- John Forster.

49
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,622
What's your reaction
to the State..

50
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,543
Thank you.

51
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,013
Idiot!

52
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,923
Congratulations!

53
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,884
For what?

54
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,304
I was referring to the hottie that
you left with the party last night.

55
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:43,806
She was a quite piece of ass.

56
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,600
- Remember her name?
- Yes, I do.

57
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,143
Sara Pollard.

58
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,605
Is that a cut on your nose?
You didn't have that before I left.

59
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,358
I fell out of the bed.
FBI hit here yet?

60
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,403
- Yeah, 2 minutes in the conference room.
- Okay.

61
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,279
Any calls?

62
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,532
New York Times, Washington times,
Newsweek.

63
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,952
They all wanna know if you have a quote
about Forster's execution.

64
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,955
- What else is new?
- Kim Cummings called twice.

65
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,624
- She was worried about you too.
- Kim knows this procedure.

66
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,335
Apparently not.
She's in your office.

67
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,963
Jack Gramm Associates.

68
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,091
I put those case reports
you wanna me to look at on your desk.

69
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:23,012
I thought Lauren and Leeza showed
real insight and ability.

70
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,097
The others were pretty much
working the math.

71
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,307
Yeah.

72
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,938
Don't you have Federal Agents
waiting for you?

73
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:35,858
Yeah.

74
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,818
I' see you in class.

75
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,696
I'll take them trough today's work
if you run late.

76
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,197
Thanks.

77
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,283
- Thank you, Kim.
- Bye.

78
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:50,456
Janie Keith came by
to give you a present.

79
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,207
Dr. Gramm.

80
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,501
I'm sorry.
I don't know if this is appropriate..

81
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,003
I just wanted to..

82
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,839
I just wanted to mark the day.

83
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,215
Thank you, Janie.

84
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:04,553
I'm glad that my sister Janie
hasn't been forgotten. Thank you.

85
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,931
For everything.
You went out of your way.

86
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,769
You are busy, so I'm just..
I'm gonna get out of here.

87
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,606
We did good, Janie.
We did good.

88
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:16,940
All right.

89
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,400
Thanks.

90
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,073
Can I help you?

91
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,866
You are one of my students?

92
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:27,368
Hi.

93
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,411
- Jack.
- Yeah.

94
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,332
I'd like to introduce you to Jeremy
Goober, with attorney general office.

95
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,585
Jeremy is in charge
of the Seattle slayer task force.

96
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:40,589
Dr. Gramm, it's so good to meet you.
This is a really big honor for me.

97
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:41,924
Sorry about the..

98
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,009
Oh, this is such a beautiful
conference room too.

99
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,720
And this special agent
MacTire from the FBI.

100
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,013
Dr. Gramm.

101
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,224
Pleasure. Have a seat.

102
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:53,686
Hey, big fellow?

103
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:54,937
Yes.

104
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,773
Jeremy.

105
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:02,611
Seattle slayer task force.

106
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:06,949
Well, okay.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

107
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:11,662
I'll do the best I can to answer them,
but first I..

108
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,875
No. First I think we should all
have a cookie.

109
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:22,089
These are from Janie Kay, whose sister,
Janie was murdered by John Forster.

110
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,009
- Jeremy?
- Sure, thank you.

111
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,555
- Frank?
- No, thanks, Jack.

112
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,056
No?

113
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,017
Mr. MacTire?

114
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,603
You are a good sport, Jeremy.

115
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,565
A little milk maybe,
what do you think?

116
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:47,156
Shelley, we got milk, don't we?
Bring in three glasses.

117
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,033
Nothing for me, Jack.

118
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,951
All right, make that two.

119
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,536
No, make it three.

120
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,205
Maybe you have a change of heart.

121
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,292
So, let's see..

122
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,211
I can assume..

123
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:04,506
That last night crime scene..

124
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,885
Was very much like
Forster's previous crime scene, right?

125
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,262
- They totally match, yeah.
- What totally matches?

126
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,932
I have in here..

127
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,691
- Halothane on the breath.
- Subdued by Halothane.

128
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,443
- Rape.
- Yeah.

129
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:26,820
The body was hung up side down.

130
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:27,821
Yes.

131
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,073
And..

132
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:33,410
Slashed throat.

133
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,915
- And where this takes us?
- Looks like a copy cat.

134
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,126
- It could be. Maybe
- Could be? Maybe?

135
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:44,463
- Maybe.
- It's a stage scene. Maybe what?

136
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:47,132
Maybe,
and this might be far-fetched..

137
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,260
But what if the perp
worked with Forster..

138
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:54,682
And these stage scenes were intended to
throw some doubts on his guilty verdict?

139
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,184
- Go with it.
- Possibly providing him..

140
00:11:57,267 --> 00:12:00,729
With a stay of execution
or even a new trial.

141
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:04,566
Goal star, Jeremy.
Big goal star.

142
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,319
I mean, that's exactly what I think
is happening here.

143
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,739
No, I'm sticking with copy cat.

144
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,409
Of course there is
another possibility.

145
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,536
- Yeah?
- Forster is innocent.

146
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,246
- Wrongly convicted.
- No!

147
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,081
The task force is aware..

148
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,292
That your expert opinion
was critical in convicting Forster.

149
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,294
But then why he walked
his first trial?

150
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,671
Procedural error.

151
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:28,882
Why is he never been tried in any
of the other five pending murderers..

152
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,926
That you've attributed to him?

153
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:35,264
You realize that it is the dude of my
office to ensure that an innocent man..

154
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:38,309
Is not executed tonight.
You do understand that?

155
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,855
Look, Jack. If you have any
reconsideration of testimony..

156
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,441
Or anything new you wanna lay
on the table..

157
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,026
Now it would be the time.

158
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:48,736
Would you say it was fair
to characterize..

159
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,154
Your attitude towards
John Forster..

160
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:54,491
- As a personal vendetta?
- If we're been fair, yeah, sure.

161
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:58,078
It's a personal vendetta. I have a
personal vendetta against Ted Bundy..

162
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:01,915
And Gacy and about 10 or 15
other serial murders..

163
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:04,209
- That are on the streets right now.
- Jack, please.

164
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,544
That's helpful.

165
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,881
There is one other issue
that we need to address.

166
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,591
Milk maid.

167
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,734
What's going on here?

168
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:31,904
Do you know a woman named
Dale Morris?

169
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:33,530
Yes.

170
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:35,240
How?

171
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,702
- She's a student of mine.
- She's just a student of yours?

172
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:42,956
Dr. Gramm, we're federal agency here.
You don't wanna be lying here.

173
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:46,669
- We had a relationship.
- You've been very cryptic right now?

174
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:51,048
He had a professional relationship,
not a sexual relationship.

175
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:54,802
About a year ago her father died.
She was very troubled.

176
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:58,013
I treated her as psychiatrist.

177
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,058
I don't sleep with my students,
Mr. Goober.

178
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,519
Neither I sleep with my patients.

179
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:08,816
Now what does this have to do
with anything? Anyway.

180
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,567
Jack.

181
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,404
Dale Morris was murdered
last night.

182
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,698
She's the third and latest victim.

183
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,286
When was the last time
you saw Dale?

184
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,831
Well..

185
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,791
I saw..

186
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,755
I saw her last night.

187
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,760
To our impossibly
difficult professor.

188
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,471
We say thank you..

189
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,891
For making our lives miserable.

190
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:45,352
The pleasure is all mine.

191
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,237
We're celebrating.

192
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,448
You're celebrating
Forster's pending execution?

193
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:04,163
No, we're celebrating his conviction,
not his execution.

194
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:08,667
It was an overturn so we're happy
about that. We worked hard on this case.

195
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,795
We have a tape
that was left on the crime scene.

196
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,449
We're gonna play it for you now.

197
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:20,471
This message is for
Dr. Jack Gramm.

198
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,392
You got the wrong man.

199
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:27,019
Forster is innocent.

200
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,480
Please, don't hurt me anymore.

201
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:31,899
Don't hurt me anymore.

202
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,277
You gonna let me go, right?

203
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,532
You said you'd let me go.
I've read what you want me and..

204
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,963
Jack, it goes like that for about
an hour, before she dies.

205
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:58,300
Why do you think she was reading you
that message, Dr. Gramm?

206
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:06,266
Dr. Gramm?

207
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,060
Dr. Gramm?

208
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:09,979
In Dr. Gramm own words..

209
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:12,314
He analyzes a mental puzzle.

210
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:15,359
So they're no actual tangible pieces
per say.

211
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,070
He made a guess based on what
happened to Kate.

212
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:21,824
A guess based on his intuition,
a personal bias, ego.

213
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:25,577
And he sold that fiction lock, stock
and barrel to the jury.

214
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:29,832
What is it?

215
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,841
The girl that was killed
last night..

216
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,844
- Was Dale Morris.
- Dale?

217
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,306
Oh, my God.

218
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:49,310
Okay, let's see..

219
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:52,688
We have our investigators coordinated
with the FBI..

220
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:58,152
I wanna know everything Dale Morris did
on the last 24 hours.

221
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,529
I wanna know where she went,
who she talked to.

222
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:03,407
Can you please have Dr. Gramm's car
ready, please. Thank you.

223
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:07,411
Thank you, Shelley.

224
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:08,954
For what?

225
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:13,459
- I don't know. For everything.
- I hate when you do this, Jack.

226
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,211
Every time you o this,
I think you gonna end up dead.

227
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:21,050
Just don't ask me to marry you
again.

228
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,926
Why not?
We're perfect for each other.

229
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,014
Yeah, yeah. Except that I'm gay
and you're commitment phobe.

230
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,224
That's why we're perfect.

231
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,811
Thanks, baby.

232
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:38,651
Dr. Gramm is a world known expert
in forensic psychiatry.

233
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,570
What is forensic psychiatry?

234
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,074
I mean, is not the same profession
that destroyed MacMorton's life..

235
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:47,993
By conjuring up images
of child molestation?

236
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,497
None of the charges were ever proved.
And the accused, though innocent..

237
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:52,831
Was public crucified.

238
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:20,150
Jack, look. Look at the kite.

239
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,655
Jack, come here.

240
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:16,999
Yeah?

241
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,376
Hello?

242
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,547
Hello?

243
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,050
You have 88 minutes to live.

244
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:26,967
What?

245
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,428
You know how long 88 minutes can be,
don't you?

246
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,847
- That's 11:45 am.
- Who is this?

247
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,849
- Tic-tac.
- Who the hell is this?

248
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,476
Tic-tac.

249
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,062
What were you saying?

250
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,788
- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley?

251
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:58,248
I want you to set a trap and
and a trace on my cell.

252
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,166
What's going on?

253
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:02,378
I want you to contact
a wireless carrier..

254
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,963
And have them find out who made
that last phone call to me.

255
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,007
- Jack, I could be more helpful if..
- Just do it.

256
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,592
Just do it. I need it, all right?

257
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,678
And call me when you get it.

258
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:16,600
John Forster was an Eagle Scout, which
counts for his facility with ropes.

259
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,019
He also worked
in a veterinary office..

260
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:22,398
Where he had experience using
the animal tranquilizer Halothane..

261
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:24,149
Witch he's used to subdue
his victims.

262
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:28,904
Halothane. Sorry, I'm late again.
Thank you, Kim.

263
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:33,742
I see that the size of our class
is dwindling once again.

264
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:36,036
It could be because
you keep booting everyone.

265
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:39,164
My favorite student, Mike Stempt.

266
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:46,672
Okay. The legal distinction between
sanity and insanity rests upon what?

267
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:50,009
- Free will.
- The concept of the free will.

268
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:53,262
And what is
the most important thing..

269
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:55,764
One should remember
when entering a court-room?

270
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:59,977
That insanity it's a legal concept.
It's not a medical or psychiatric term.

271
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,229
But despite the fact that insanity
is a legal concept..

272
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:03,939
It doesn't mean
that someone is not sick.

273
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:04,982
Yes, Lauren.

274
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,319
Of all the serial killers
that I've interviewed and studied..

275
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:12,448
Witch include our boy Bundy,
Dahmer, Gacy..

276
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,950
None of them was legally insane.

277
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:17,077
This is not saying
that they were normal.

278
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:18,996
I could argue that
they couldn't help themselves..

279
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,622
Precisely because of
their mental disorder.

280
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:22,958
Well, if you wanna argue, Mike..

281
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,960
School of law is across campus.

282
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:26,587
Come on, Dr. Gramm.

283
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:29,965
It's ingenuous to pretend that
our presentations are not arguments.

284
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:32,343
We create a narrative of the crime
and the criminal.

285
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:35,179
Narrative is based on facts.
Based on logic.

286
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,557
We don't walk into a court-room
and advocate set scenes, do we?

287
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:42,978
We don't take sides.
We check our views at the door.

288
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:45,522
You mean you want us to pretend
we don't have an opinion?

289
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,317
We have opinions, Lauren,
but we just keep them to ourselves.

290
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,694
Share them with your dog,
if you have to.

291
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:53,197
Not with your parrot,
because it talks back.

292
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:57,201
It is that kind of logic that's gonna
get you in a law school across campus.

293
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:58,577
I've been there. I've done that.

294
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:00,788
Well, my condolences.

295
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,041
So, where is..

296
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,378
Dale Morris? She's absent.
I don't see her.

297
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:11,799
That's her first.

298
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,221
I didn't take her for a quitter.

299
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:23,143
Anyone who has her phone number,
please, contact me after class.

300
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:28,649
Okay.

301
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:30,901
Excuse me.

302
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:34,488
Shelley.

303
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:38,826
Tick-Tack, doc.
You have 83 minutes to live, Dr. Gramm.

304
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,870
Tick-Tack, doc.

305
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:55,175
So where was I?

306
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:57,219
Bundy versus Forster.

307
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,638
- What?
- Bundy versus Forster.

308
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:02,016
Thank you, Lauren.

309
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:06,353
You're welcome.

310
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:13,736
What we're gonna explore today is
the similarities and dissimilarities..

311
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:19,158
Say, from Ted Bundy's motives,
let's compared them to John Forster's.

312
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,082
Dr. Gramm,
your phone is ringing.

313
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,925
- Jack, are you there?
- Shelley. What's going on?

314
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:38,719
The call was made
from a cell phone.

315
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:40,888
One of those you buy
and pay minutes for it.

316
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,097
Registered to whom?

317
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:45,225
- Look, I know you're in class, but..
- Yes, who is registered to it?

318
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:48,520
A Kate Gramm.

319
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:55,861
Jack, it's a common name.
It doesn't have to be your sister.

320
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:56,904
It's just a coincidence.

321
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,240
It's not a coincidence.

322
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,205
- It's not a coincidence.
- Jack, I'm loosing you.

323
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:08,082
Shelley?
Goddamn it!

324
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,583
Shelley?

325
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:12,544
Have you found out who my phone
is registered to by now?

326
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:16,298
Poor Kate. If it was Kate,
you'd like to call her?

327
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:18,926
I'm gonna find you, you here that,
you son-of-a-bitch?

328
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,637
You're barking up the wrong tree
on this one.

329
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,222
I'm gonna find you.

330
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,557
She suffered
for such a long time.

331
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,310
You remember how long,
don't you?

332
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:30,813
You still feel guilty about her?

333
00:24:31,522 --> 00:24:34,525
You feel guilty about
falsifying the evidence?

334
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:36,777
For lying under oath?

335
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:40,572
Tic-tac, doc.
You have 79 minutes to live.

336
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,731
Do you find this funny, Albert?

337
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:15,733
Who were you calling on
your phone?

338
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:18,694
Let me see your phone.

339
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:20,404
I was just..

340
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,031
Let me see that goddamn it phone.

341
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:23,532
I was just checking
the Mariners score.

342
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,701
- You were what?
- I was checking the Mariners score.

343
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:27,619
Okay, what is the score?

344
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:30,205
The score.

345
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,166
What's the damn score?

346
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,670
It's 3 x 1 Mariners.
B1.

347
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:13,374
- Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
- What does it mean? What's the problem?

348
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:14,792
Look.

349
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,751
What?

350
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:17,670
What's going on here?

351
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,631
It says that Dale Morris was murdered
last night.

352
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,926
- Is that true, Dr. Gramm?
- Yeah.

353
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:27,262
You knew it?
You knew it and you didn't tell us?

354
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:30,516
- You knew and asked for Dale's number?
- Is it the slayer?

355
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,643
- It could be.
- It could be?

356
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,020
Well, the police haven't released
any information yet.

357
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,648
- Are we all in danger?
- I can't believe you didn't tell us.

358
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:40,317
- Dr. Gramm?
- Lynn Johnson.

359
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:42,111
Someone just called
a bomb threat.

360
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,447
Everyone is to evacuate the building
immediately. Thank you.

361
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,700
Come on.
Grab your stuff.

362
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:50,536
I'll get your papers
of presentation, Tom.

363
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,454
I got the slides, Kim.

364
00:26:56,125 --> 00:27:00,546
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

365
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:03,841
I repeat.
Everyone must evacuate the building.

366
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:17,104
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

367
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:20,524
I repeat.
Everyone must evacuate the building.

368
00:27:23,986 --> 00:27:26,864
Please,
remain calm e do not run.

369
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:29,867
Proceed to the door
to the end of the campus.

370
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:33,537
I repeat.
We must evacuate the building.

371
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:37,499
Jack? What are you doing?
Get going.

372
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:44,048
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

373
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,967
What was that on the screen?

374
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:51,388
Some student playing a joke
or something.

375
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:55,184
You of all people know that it breaks
school laws to proceed by a threat..

376
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:58,354
You need to report this
to the campus security immediately.

377
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,399
Carol. I get threat like this,
three or four times a year.

378
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:05,444
Your incredible arrogance
will slap the shit of you, Jack.

379
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:08,030
I wish you'd disclosure
your true feelings about me..

380
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:09,448
Before we became
such good friends.

381
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:12,201
Maybe you should stop hiding behind
your assessments about other people..

382
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,327
And start assessing yourself..

383
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,371
Cause you need to get over your past
and go on with your life..

384
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,331
Cause what you're living
isn't one.

385
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,625
It is not what you tell
your patients?

386
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,753
- Gum?
- Thank you.

387
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:25,422
I'll call campus security and let
them know you're on your way.

388
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,925
Where did you go last night?
When you left the bar.

389
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:31,553
Home.

390
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,681
Were you alone?

391
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:36,392
Screw you.

392
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,453
Roger.
We're on it.

393
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:07,840
Yeah.

394
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,551
The press got a hold of Dale's name.
It's all over the news.

395
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:12,636
Yeah, I know that.

396
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,391
And Forster's attorney is going
to the court and try a stay.

397
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:19,852
A stay?
On what grounds?

398
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:21,478
They're claiming that these..

399
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:24,106
Murders prove that the real killer
have never been brought to justice.

400
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:27,401
Nonsense. They're just trying
to buy time. They're desperate.

401
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:31,155
They're also claiming that you falsify
testimony and concealed evidences.

402
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:33,782
Well, it's all loose.
Goddamn it.

403
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:36,577
Who is that guy?

404
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:43,125
What about Dale Morris?
Did we find anymore of her?

405
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:46,670
She was murdered
in her apartment..

406
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:48,630
Between the hours of two
and six am.

407
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,341
- Any sign of force entry?
- No.

408
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:54,303
Does Forster still have that group
visiting him on prison?

409
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,348
He's like a goddamn rock star.
Website and all.

410
00:29:57,598 --> 00:30:00,476
I want you to pull a background check
on all my students..

411
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,227
And get back to me.

412
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:04,813
Damn.

413
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:09,568
Oh, no.

414
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:54,071
Okay.

415
00:31:52,254 --> 00:31:54,590
Kim?
What are you doing here?

416
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,425
I'm getting my car,
it's parked here..

417
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,719
Like it's every day
I come to the campus.

418
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:03,932
That was really horrible.
Just horrible what you did in class..

419
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:06,268
- It's was little low for you.
- I was looking for potential suspects.

420
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:09,605
That's what I was doing. What did you do
after you left the party last night?

421
00:32:09,813 --> 00:32:12,733
I didn't end up drunk in bed
with an strange like you.

422
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:16,820
You left the party with Dale Morris,
the girl that was murdered, didn't you?

423
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,866
- Yes, I did.
- So what did you do? Where did you go?

424
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:24,286
You're not seriously
considering..

425
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:26,580
Where did you go?

426
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,416
We went to the Hickory Stick.
We had a drink, two drinks.

427
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,419
- And then?
- And then I went home alone.

428
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:36,757
- You have anyone that can verify that?
- No. No-one can verify it.

429
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,384
Come on. I've been your
teaching assistant for two years.

430
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:41,428
I'm your friend.
I'm here to help you, if you let me.

431
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:42,972
Follow me.

432
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:47,768
Follow me.

433
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:53,023
Who did that?

434
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,693
What does that mean?

435
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,778
According to a anonymous
phone call..

436
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:00,906
That means I have
72 minutes left to live.

437
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:03,283
Can I borrow your cell phone?

438
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:04,952
I've broke mine.

439
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:07,162
These are my car keys.

440
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,707
Can you take that around front
and meet me there in ten minutes?

441
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,960
- I have to go to the campus security.
- Okay.

442
00:33:13,043 --> 00:33:14,837
Call me on my Blackberry
if you run late.

443
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:16,296
Okay.

444
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:21,510
Shelley. You gonna have to reach me
on Kim's cell phone.

445
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,553
What happened to yours?

446
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,430
- I broke it.
- What?

447
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:25,848
You have her number, don't you?

448
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:26,974
Yeah, I do.

449
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:31,979
Listen, just forward all the calls,
okay, to Kim's cell.

450
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:34,189
Please, thanks.

451
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,941
Dr. Gramm.

452
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:37,359
Hey, Mike.

453
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:42,031
Everyone is pretty upset
about Dale.

454
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:46,076
Yeah, well, that's understandable.
Considering the circumstances.

455
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:48,370
I have a question about
John Forster.

456
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:50,372
Yeah? What?

457
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,752
Well, I've been going through the trial
transcripts in Kate's history..

458
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,420
Why would you do that?

459
00:33:56,503 --> 00:34:00,299
To understand your process better.
How you come to your conclusions.

460
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:02,343
And?

461
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:04,345
What?

462
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:08,265
Is it possible that Forster
is innocent?

463
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:09,266
No.

464
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:11,685
You won't even consider
the possibility?

465
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:12,728
No.

466
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:16,690
You're completely convinced the scenario
you put together is the only one?

467
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:19,443
First of all,
I didn't put together a scenario.

468
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:22,237
I recreated the crime scene.
Second..

469
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:24,615
I didn't convict Forster.
A jury did.

470
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:26,283
But the evidence
was circumstantial.

471
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,160
No DNA, no murder weapon.

472
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:31,830
Nothing directly linking Forster
to the crime, except your narrative..

473
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:34,583
- And Janie Kay's testimony.
- What's your point?

474
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:37,169
Just that your testimony
was very convincing.

475
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:39,088
That's my job.

476
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,839
To be convincing.

477
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,135
I thought it was to be right.

478
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,441
Help!

479
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:03,070
Somebody, please!

480
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:08,283
Help!

481
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:09,827
Help!

482
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:15,290
- Lauren.
- Dr. Gramm.

483
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:16,291
What happened to you?

484
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:18,127
He's wearing a leather jacket.
He's out there.

485
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:21,338
I bit his hand, it's bleeding.
If his hand is bloody, you can get him.

486
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:24,675
- You're okay?
- Go get him now! I'm fine!

487
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:59,001
- Watch my car!
- It's a police action!

488
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:00,169
There's been an assault.

489
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,837
- I wanna see your hands.
- Back off!

490
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:03,589
- Roll the window down.
- No!

491
00:36:03,756 --> 00:36:07,009
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI. Here.

492
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:08,802
Okay?
Open the window now.

493
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:11,472
- Yeah.
- See? Well, roll down the window..

494
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,475
And let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.

495
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:17,019
If you have nothing to hide,
you can show me.

496
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:19,104
Look, I'm trying to go home.
What?

497
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,899
Okay, sorry.

498
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,657
Excuse me.

499
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,201
There's been an assault.
I wanna see your hand.

500
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,335
Okay. Be cool now!

501
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,672
There's been an assault.
I gotta check your hands.

502
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:47,758
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI.

503
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:05,567
Sorry.

504
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:15,786
I couldn't find him.

505
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:17,746
Here.

506
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:20,582
This is stupid.

507
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,459
I'm so stupid.

508
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:25,754
- How I could be so weak? Such a wimp.
- It's not your fault. Come on.

509
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:28,757
I can't believe I let him get away
like that. I should've fought back more.

510
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:31,093
Stop beating yourself up?
What exactly happened?

511
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:34,596
He came from behind. He put this rag
over my mouth and I bit his hand.

512
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,474
- The rag had an odor?
- Something sweet..

513
00:37:38,642 --> 00:37:39,935
It's Halothane, right?

514
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,271
- Yeah.
- He's the one.

515
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:43,897
Probably.

516
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:45,733
I let Dale's murderer get away.

517
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:48,235
Stop beating yourself up
and tell me something.

518
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,071
Tell me something. Could you
identify him if you saw him again?

519
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,949
He came from behind,
I didn't see him.

520
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:59,246
Let's go to the campus security,
you'll tell the everything.

521
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:08,797
Hello.

522
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:11,091
This woman has just been attacked.

523
00:38:11,342 --> 00:38:12,843
Are you okay?

524
00:38:13,052 --> 00:38:14,178
I think so.

525
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:15,721
What's your name?

526
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,432
Lauren Douglas.

527
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:20,142
And who are you?

528
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:21,685
Jack Gramm.

529
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,188
The famous Dr. Jack Gramm?

530
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,190
Then Johnson Fonsen
have you be coming in.

531
00:38:26,273 --> 00:38:29,401
Is there someone to interview
Miss Douglas now, please?

532
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,278
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

533
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:33,572
- You wanna check out this girl?
- Wait a minute.

534
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,240
Right this way.

535
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:42,665
What's going on here?

536
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,250
The person who attacked her
may still be on the campus.

537
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,293
What the hell you guys doing?

538
00:38:46,377 --> 00:38:48,962
We got all these guys out
on the bomb squad.

539
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:51,590
Excuse me for one moment.
It's a little crazy around here.

540
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:54,385
Jimmy, get off the phone
and interview Miss. Douglas, please.

541
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:55,928
I'll be right there.

542
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:00,307
Why won't you seat here?

543
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:05,604
Okay, you okay?

544
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:10,693
- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley? Get Frank..

545
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:12,528
- And pass him through when you get him.
- Okay.

546
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:13,529
Okay, thank you.

547
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:18,117
I don't want you going back to your
apartment until the locks are changed.

548
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:20,244
I don't have anywhere else to go.

549
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:24,540
After you talk
to the officer here..

550
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:28,210
Go back to my office.
Shelley will find a place to stay.

551
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:29,086
Okay.

552
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:32,798
- Come on. It's gonna be all right.
- Sorry for all the troubles I caused.

553
00:39:36,593 --> 00:39:38,387
Miss. Douglas. Right this way.

554
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,598
- Right in here.
- I'm sorry.

555
00:39:43,434 --> 00:39:46,186
- Yeah?
- I left a word for Frank.

556
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:48,814
Okay.
There's been another incident.

557
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:51,358
The Forster's case it's your thing,
right?

558
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:53,027
Wrong, it's not my thing.

559
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:56,071
I saw your testimony
on Court TV.

560
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:57,156
Yeah, right?

561
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:58,741
Fill those out.

562
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:03,412
Yeah, I follow
the big crime cases.

563
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,705
They fascinate me.

564
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:07,875
When Dr. Jack Gramm
takes the stand.

565
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,544
You come up with things
I didn't think off.

566
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:17,926
- This here, this is just a job until..
- Until you pass the police's exam.

567
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:20,095
See? How did you know that?

568
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:21,597
Just a guess.

569
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:23,098
That's the thing about you.

570
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:25,392
You know how to put two plus two
and you make it four.

571
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:26,894
Or five.

572
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:29,271
There are times that you know.

573
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,775
I'm not gonna be a campus cop
to a bunch of snob-nosed rich kids.

574
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:34,109
Especially these rich bitches..

575
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:38,280
My car was vandalized.
The window was smashed.

576
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:41,450
There's a number on the body.
Look into it.

577
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:43,369
Dr. Gramm?

578
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,207
Dr. Gramm?

579
00:40:52,503 --> 00:40:54,922
This is Johnny D'Franco,
from campus security.

580
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:57,257
Can you get me Lynn Johnson?

581
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:59,885
- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley?

582
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,805
- Did you find Frank?
- No, not yet. What the hell is going on?

583
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:07,977
Well, I received a threaten phone call
saying I have 88 minutes to live.

584
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:11,105
11:45h this morning,
and my time is up.

585
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,524
Pull out my risk assessment file.

586
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,943
Anybody rating "e" and above..

587
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,487
I want you to cross reference
against Forster.

588
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:20,864
And when you find Frank..

589
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:25,452
Ask him if Sara Pollard or any of my
students ever visit Forster in prison.

590
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:27,621
Sara Pollard?

591
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,582
She's the girl I met at the party
last night.

592
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,293
Call Wong Lee..

593
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,754
And have him make a list
of all the phone numbers..

594
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:37,798
Forster called
on the last 72 hours.

595
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:39,508
Where should fax the list?

596
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:41,343
My apartment.

597
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:43,679
And run a check on Kim.

598
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:46,015
Kim?

599
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:49,893
Yeah, just do it, okay?
Hello.

600
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:51,103
Jack.

601
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:54,189
- Damn it.
- The car is out front.

602
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:56,025
- Drive Squaid.
- Good.

603
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:57,651
You're okay?
You look a little freaked out.

604
00:41:57,735 --> 00:41:58,652
Yeah. You have..

605
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:00,696
- A battery for your phone?
- Yeah, I do.

606
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:06,702
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing?

607
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,079
Goddamn it, what is this?

608
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,539
What are you doing with a gun
in your purse?

609
00:42:10,622 --> 00:42:12,249
Jesus, why don't you just announce
to the world?

610
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,501
I don't think they've heard you
in English Department.

611
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,462
- Why the gun, Kim?
- For protection.

612
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:19,715
- Where did you get it?
- I have a permit. My dad is a cop.

613
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:23,135
- Why you need a gun?
- I don't. My dad thinks I do.

614
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:24,511
Why?

615
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:26,889
I have a crazy ex boyfriend,
okay, Jack?

616
00:42:26,972 --> 00:42:28,265
Oh. Jesus. God.

617
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:31,226
Yeah, I really know how to pick one
or what?

618
00:42:31,268 --> 00:42:33,520
The judge said if he threats anyone
he goes back to jail.

619
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:35,939
Back to jail? What jail?

620
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,942
Prison, actually.
Walla Walla.

621
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:43,405
That's where Forster is.

622
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:46,659
Come on, let's go.

623
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:49,328
Special Agent Parks.

624
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:50,621
Frank, it's Jack.

625
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:54,166
I'm at the university campus.
We got a problem here.

626
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:57,711
Someone attacked one of my students
and tried to knock her out with Halothane.

627
00:42:57,961 --> 00:43:01,382
- That's the Seattle slayer.
- I know, hold on.

628
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:02,925
Give me a second.

629
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:08,555
Yeah. There's a security guard
on this campus, his name is D'Franco.

630
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:10,724
I don't like him.
He's suspicious.

631
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,935
I want you to take him in
for questioning, okay?

632
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:15,771
Also get a warrant
and search his place.

633
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:16,939
Jesus Christ, Jack.

634
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:19,775
You know I can't just get a warrant
without sufficient grounds.

635
00:43:19,984 --> 00:43:21,986
Just get a warrant, Frank,
come on.

636
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,779
Do you think he is the slayer?

637
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:27,241
- To link Forster on the outside?
- It's possible.

638
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:31,286
Listen, I checked the names
that Shelley, of the students.

639
00:43:31,578 --> 00:43:35,290
And there's no record of Lauren Douglas,
Kim Cummings or Sara Pollard..

640
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:36,417
But you gonna love this.

641
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:41,296
Mike Stempt visit Forster four times
over the last six weeks.

642
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:43,632
Mike Stempt. What was his reason?

643
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:46,051
Research.
He had written permission.

644
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,304
No, no, no.
I didn't give him any permission.

645
00:43:48,554 --> 00:43:49,972
Written or otherwise.

646
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:53,392
Well, it's your signature, Jack.
I got a copy right here.

647
00:43:54,643 --> 00:43:56,186
Hold on.
That.. Hold on a second.

648
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:58,522
That ex boyfriend of yours.
What is his name?

649
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:00,149
Guy LaForge.

650
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:03,068
Run a check on a parole
named Guy LaForge.

651
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:06,071
He served time at Walla Walla
with Forster.

652
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:08,907
And I'll call you back
when I get to my apartment.

653
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,659
All right.

654
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:13,912
Do you think that Frank is working
with Forster?

655
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,414
Someone is.

656
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:17,499
- I got you Johnson.
- Yeah.

657
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,127
They've found a backpack
in your lecture hall.

658
00:44:20,502 --> 00:44:22,004
What? With a bomb in it?

659
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:26,342
No. A photo, dynamite,
and a time with a note addressed to you.

660
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:27,468
What did it say?

661
00:44:27,676 --> 00:44:28,886
Tic-tac.

662
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:31,597
What does it mean, Jack?

663
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:33,474
I call you back.

664
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:00,042
- You are okay?
- Yeah.

665
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,044
What the hell was that?

666
00:45:03,587 --> 00:45:05,756
Probably somebody
trying to scare us.

667
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:08,384
Who do you think would do
something like that?

668
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:11,845
Does your boyfriend drive
a motorcycle?

669
00:45:12,096 --> 00:45:13,389
Yeah.

670
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:16,183
Except he's not my boyfriend
anymore.

671
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:17,685
Yeah.

672
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:20,771
How does it feel to know you
won't live through another night?

673
00:45:20,938 --> 00:45:22,106
56 minutes.

674
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,400
Tic-tac, doc.

675
00:45:26,151 --> 00:45:27,361
Let's go.

676
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:16,827
Guy LaForge.

677
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:19,163
He isn't a boyfriend, is he?

678
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:24,668
The only thing that got me out of
Texas was my books marks.

679
00:46:25,794 --> 00:46:29,214
And when I left for college,
I had that, but not much else.

680
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:32,801
So I tried to fit in.
I drank too much.

681
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:36,055
Thought too little.

682
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:38,474
And I met Guy.

683
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:44,021
And he was this English..

684
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:47,149
Working class rock star
wanna be.

685
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:49,109
And I fell for him.

686
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:52,196
And I married him..

687
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:53,864
When I graduated.

688
00:46:55,366 --> 00:46:59,495
He didn't take to well to my aspirations
for higher education.

689
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:03,582
In fact he didn't really want me to leave
the house. And when I disobeyed..

690
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:06,710
He got filthy drunk
and he beat me.

691
00:47:07,211 --> 00:47:09,546
That's when he got arrested
and I divorced him.

692
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:12,800
I've been trying to make up
for lost time ever since.

693
00:47:18,222 --> 00:47:21,350
- You know, Forster is trying to kill me.
- Forster is in prison.

694
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:24,311
Yeah, I know. He's got someone
on the outside trying to..

695
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,897
To do the job.

696
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:31,568
He's gonna kill me.

697
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:35,072
If I don't get him first.

698
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:43,205
Whoever is working with Forster
must be close to you.

699
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:46,750
- A friend even.
- I don't have many friends.

700
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:48,043
That's a plus.

701
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:51,380
It's a real pleasure to look at everyone
you know as your would be murderer.

702
00:47:51,588 --> 00:47:54,049
Paranoia is a normal state of mind,
huh?

703
00:47:55,718 --> 00:47:56,802
Where is Errol?

704
00:47:56,885 --> 00:47:59,763
I don't know. I'm a temp.
The agency sent me.

705
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:01,890
Dr. Gramm?

706
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:04,101
There's a package for you.

707
00:48:07,604 --> 00:48:09,106
How did you know my name?

708
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:11,817
I don't.
It was a question.

709
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:14,611
Yeah.

710
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:17,906
- There's no return address on this?
- No.

711
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:20,909
Who delivered it?

712
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:24,246
A courier. But there was another
person here at the same time..

713
00:48:24,413 --> 00:48:26,582
- looking for you.
- Who?

714
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:29,084
- What was his name?
- No, I didn't get it.

715
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:31,628
When he walked in I was on
the phone with the plumber.

716
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:36,967
- He said he would be right back.
- Okay.

717
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:38,636
You want me to pull the
surveillance tapes for you?

718
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,221
That shouldn't take more than an hour
to get someone up here with the keys.

719
00:48:43,474 --> 00:48:45,184
- I don't have an hour.
- No?

720
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:50,230
Hey, you know, he was also wearing
leathers. He had a motorcycle helmet.

721
00:48:50,439 --> 00:48:52,608
That's Guy. He was here.

722
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:57,321
If he comes back,
don't send him up to my apartment.

723
00:48:57,988 --> 00:48:59,239
Yeah.

724
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:01,992
- Hi, Dr. Gramm.
- Hi, Eva.

725
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:13,128
How did Guy know
we're going to be here?

726
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:15,130
How does even know
where you live?

727
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:17,299
Oh, Walther P99.

728
00:49:17,508 --> 00:49:19,677
That would blow a hole
through anything.

729
00:49:21,387 --> 00:49:23,639
What?
I grew up around guns.

730
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:27,142
Maybe he didn't know I was gonna be
here, maybe that's why he showed up.

731
00:49:28,018 --> 00:49:31,105
I'll verify where he went after
the party last night.

732
00:49:32,356 --> 00:49:35,025
There's a Lauren Douglas to see you.
Should I send her up?

733
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:37,069
Okay, send her up.

734
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:42,116
He got that right, didn't he?

735
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,909
Hey, what's that?

736
00:49:44,576 --> 00:49:45,828
This?

737
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,122
It's a chemical detector.

738
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:52,793
It sniffs out vapors.
Custom agencies are using it.

739
00:49:53,544 --> 00:49:54,795
And?

740
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:01,844
It's not a bomb.

741
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:03,304
That's good.

742
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,180
Yeah.

743
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,861
- Hi.
- Hi.

744
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:21,864
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm better, thank you.

745
00:50:24,408 --> 00:50:27,244
- What do you have?
- I went to see Shelley like you said.

746
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:30,289
She tried to fax you over some papers,
but the machine was down.

747
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:34,001
So I said I'd bring the risk assessment
profiles over myself.

748
00:50:34,918 --> 00:50:37,463
I didn't know you had company.

749
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,050
Dale told me how good you're with her
when her dad died.

750
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,594
She was so grateful.

751
00:50:45,012 --> 00:50:46,597
Dr. Gramm?

752
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:47,806
Yeah?

753
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:50,601
If there's anything I can do
to help you find Dale's murderer..

754
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:53,270
- Will you let me know?
- Of course, yes.

755
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:55,606
Thank you.

756
00:50:56,774 --> 00:50:59,360
Can I call you a cab
or something?

757
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:02,154
No, Mike is gonna give me
a ride.

758
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:03,656
- Okay.
- Thanks for these..

759
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:05,115
Bye.

760
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:11,664
All those people
have threatened you?

761
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,625
Well, you know,
it comes with the territory.

762
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,544
How come you never mention that
in class?

763
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:22,466
How many students end up going
into this field anyway?

764
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:26,387
Not very many
with you booting all of them.

765
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:28,305
Yeah.

766
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:39,066
Can I ask you
a personal question?

767
00:51:39,274 --> 00:51:40,442
No.

768
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:43,070
How come you never
got married?

769
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,614
I mean,
you're a pretty good prospect.

770
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,283
You obviously make a shit load
of money.

771
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,451
Why would I get married?

772
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:51,912
I'm a target for any nut
with a grudge.

773
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:56,458
I can't afford emotional
attachments.

774
00:51:56,709 --> 00:51:58,043
Yeah, but don't you want kids?

775
00:51:58,502 --> 00:52:00,004
Don't you want a family?

776
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:01,839
I'm too old for kids.

777
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:07,386
You're too young for me, Kim.

778
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:14,393
If you want me to leave, Jack, all
you've got to do is say it & I'm gone.

779
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:16,603
No, I don't want you to leave.

780
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:18,480
I need you, Kim.

781
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:20,691
You are smart
and you are important to me.

782
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:22,609
Really, you are.

783
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:26,488
Okay.

784
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:47,176
- Yeah.
- Jack, it's Shelley.

785
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:48,719
What the hell happened to you?
Where have you been

786
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,972
Making calls for you, four lines
simultaneously. The fax is down.

787
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:54,391
I know, Lauren Douglas came over
and brought some papers with her.

788
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:56,310
Jack, you better turn on MS-NBC.

789
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:57,227
Why?

790
00:52:57,311 --> 00:52:59,980
Forster got a judge to grant
his request for an interview.

791
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:01,106
He's on, live.

792
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:03,499
This is gonna heat things up

793
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,584
When looking for a home..

794
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:07,045
A real estate agent is really important
in you life. You need someone..

795
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:10,460
Shelley. Listen to me.

796
00:53:10,669 --> 00:53:13,964
I want you to send some of the boys
to my apartment, all right?

797
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:17,717
There may be someone down at my lobby
in biker leathers when they get there.

798
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:18,760
Okay?

799
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:22,222
- You got a name?
- Yes, his name is Guy LaForge.

800
00:53:22,597 --> 00:53:26,977
Put a photo
on the FBI wire, okay?

801
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:29,354
If you are not granted
another stay of the execution..

802
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:30,939
Are you prepared to die?

803
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:32,148
You want me to call the police?

804
00:53:32,232 --> 00:53:35,151
No, no, let Frank handle it.
He'll know what to do.

805
00:53:35,235 --> 00:53:37,404
As prepared as any man can be
to pay for something he didn't do.

806
00:53:37,487 --> 00:53:38,572
Listen.

807
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,367
You didn't message over a package
to my apartment, did you?

808
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:43,243
No.

809
00:53:43,493 --> 00:53:45,912
There is a lot of people out there
that believe in your innocence.

810
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:46,913
And I'm grateful.

811
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:48,415
You know anyone that might have?

812
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:50,417
- No.
- I'm grateful for their prayers.

813
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:52,836
- Everything goes to your office.
- And support.

814
00:53:52,919 --> 00:53:54,796
What about Pollard.
Find anything on her?

815
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,174
You didn't actually paid her,
did you, Jack?

816
00:53:57,382 --> 00:54:00,051
- Pay her, what do you mean?
- She works for a escort service.

817
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,720
Escort service?

818
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:03,722
You didn't know?

819
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:05,390
No, I didn't know.

820
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:11,438
What? She told me she was a lawyer.
A student lawyer.

821
00:54:11,938 --> 00:54:13,940
What are your thoughts
this time?

822
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:16,568
Well, Stephanie, that's one thing
I don't have a lot of..

823
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,778
You got a number for her?

824
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:21,448
Yeah, a phone number
and the address.

825
00:54:21,615 --> 00:54:22,991
I know the address.

826
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:24,743
Let me have the number.

827
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:27,078
If Dr. Gramm was with us right now,
what would you say to him?

828
00:54:27,162 --> 00:54:29,956
555-1352.

829
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,958
He knows that I didn't do this.

830
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:33,627
- There's only one..
- Thanks.

831
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:37,797
Other person in this world
who knows I've been framed.

832
00:54:38,048 --> 00:54:42,177
That it was a set up.
That I'm totally innocent.

833
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:46,973
And that would be the forensic
psychiatric Dr. Jack Gramm.

834
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:51,019
I guess what I'd say to Jack Gramm..
I'd say, "Why me"?

835
00:54:52,896 --> 00:54:55,941
I understand that you've suffered
a great loss with your sister.

836
00:54:56,399 --> 00:54:58,860
I feel your pain, Dr. Gramm.

837
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:01,112
- Pick it up, damn it.
- But that doesn't exonerate you..

838
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:05,659
From false accusing me of things that
you know I did not, could not have done.

839
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:06,952
Pick up, Sara.

840
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:10,247
If I can be convicted
of this voodoo forensic science..

841
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,832
Think about it.. Who is safe?

842
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:16,253
Shelley?

843
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:18,755
Shelley?
I want you to get MS-NBC.

844
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,758
- I want to talk to that son-of-bitch.
- I would be the last.

845
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:23,510
Jack, I really don't think
that's a good idea.

846
00:55:23,802 --> 00:55:26,930
It's a good idea. Just get them and
when you get them call me back, ok?

847
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:30,684
But I find hard to believe that
Dr. Jack Gramm can be out there..

848
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:34,604
Psycho battling innocent people
into the death chamber.

849
00:55:35,105 --> 00:55:36,982
Who is the murder now, Jack?

850
00:55:37,858 --> 00:55:38,692
Yeah?

851
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:40,694
Who is the murder now?

852
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:42,529
Jack?

853
00:55:42,821 --> 00:55:45,156
We got D'Franco in custody.

854
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,908
I got the warrant.

855
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:49,244
The guys are on the way
over to his place.

856
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:51,079
Did he say anything about Forster?

857
00:55:51,288 --> 00:55:53,248
A quite bit, but nothing useful.

858
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:55,000
What about Guy LaForge?

859
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:58,545
He hasn't checked in with
his parole office in six weeks.

860
00:55:58,795 --> 00:56:01,923
Well, he was at my apartment building
less than an hour ago.

861
00:56:02,132 --> 00:56:03,800
And he said he's coming back.

862
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:06,553
Listen, Frank.

863
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:08,889
I got a call
a little while ago..

864
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:10,974
Saying I have 88 minutes
to live.

865
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:13,977
Jesus, Jack.
Why 88 minutes?

866
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:20,817
I don't know.

867
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,237
You have any idea
who this caller is?

868
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:31,745
You better find Guy LaForge
before he gets here, okay?

869
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:33,788
Listen, let me call you back.

870
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:35,040
Jack?

871
00:56:36,124 --> 00:56:36,833
Shit.

872
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:55,602
Mom.

873
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:57,395
Dad.

874
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:58,855
Jack.

875
00:56:59,564 --> 00:57:00,982
There's someone in here.

876
00:57:01,149 --> 00:57:03,109
And he wants to talk to you.

877
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,153
Where are you?

878
00:57:05,237 --> 00:57:07,364
Please, come home quickly!

879
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:09,533
I'm here with a man.

880
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:11,993
It is not what
you want me to say..

881
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:16,623
Jack, come here now!
Help me. Help me.

882
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:31,304
Jack, what is that?

883
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:34,266
My sister.

884
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,518
Oh, my God!

885
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:40,897
That's horrible.
Who would send that to you?

886
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,152
There's only two copies
of this tape in the world.

887
00:57:46,236 --> 00:57:47,612
One is..

888
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:50,824
locked up in custody of NYPD.

889
00:57:50,866 --> 00:57:52,242
And the other..

890
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:57,664
Is in a restricted access room..

891
00:57:57,831 --> 00:57:59,916
In my office file cabinet..

892
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:04,171
With the highest
security measures.

893
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:06,047
So you're thinking it was stolen.

894
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:08,425
Of course it was stolen.

895
00:58:15,557 --> 00:58:16,933
You think I stole it?

896
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:20,395
You think I stole it?

897
00:58:20,604 --> 00:58:22,480
You left the bar yesterday night
with Dale.

898
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:25,817
One of the last people to see
her alive. Maybe the last.

899
00:58:26,026 --> 00:58:30,280
Jack, you think I stole the tape
and killed Dale?

900
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:31,823
Have you lost your mind?

901
00:58:32,073 --> 00:58:34,910
I don't have clearance
to your restricted access room.

902
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:36,995
Why Guy LaForge was at the bar
last night?

903
00:58:39,122 --> 00:58:41,124
He was trying to protect me.

904
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,751
From what?

905
00:58:44,211 --> 00:58:46,838
- From you.
- From me? He knows about me?

906
00:58:47,005 --> 00:58:48,507
- Yes.
- What does he know about me?

907
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:51,885
He knows I have
a silly girlish crush on you.

908
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:54,554
Jack. Hold on a second.

909
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:57,516
I just got an email
from Mike Stempt, okay?

910
00:58:57,766 --> 00:59:00,560
He saw Guy at Darby's Club
last night.

911
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:03,230
When Mike left at 3 am,
Guy was still sitting there..

912
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:05,315
And they've bounced a beer
until 6 am.

913
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:08,860
So there's no way that Guy
could have killed Dale Morris.

914
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,247
- Yeah?
- Did you listen to the tape, Dr. Gramm?

915
00:59:20,413 --> 00:59:22,833
Why did you leave the little Katie
all alone?

916
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:24,459
Why, Dr. Gramm?

917
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:28,922
She'd still be alive today if you
hadn't left her all alone to die.

918
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:33,760
Now it's your turn.
In a glaze of glory!

919
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,554
Tic-tac, doc.

920
00:59:35,762 --> 00:59:37,013
You have 37 minutes.

921
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:51,111
Yeah?

922
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:54,406
Hey, Jack, I got MS-NBC on the line.
I'll patch you through the prison.

923
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:57,450
- You're sure you wanna do this?
- Shelley.

924
00:59:58,368 --> 01:00:02,664
There's been a breach in my place,
in my most secure area.

925
01:00:03,123 --> 01:00:06,918
Did you ever give anyone clearance
to go into my secure files?

926
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:08,128
Jack, what are you saying?

927
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:11,798
Did you ever let
an unauthorized person..

928
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:13,842
Into my secure files area?

929
01:00:14,092 --> 01:00:16,803
No, never.
To anyone.

930
01:00:17,012 --> 01:00:17,762
Ever.

931
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:19,181
Okay.

932
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:22,767
Now put me through the MS-NBC.

933
01:00:28,356 --> 01:00:29,649
Frank?

934
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:33,028
- Yeah.
- Yeah, turn on the MSN-BC.

935
01:00:33,236 --> 01:00:36,489
They've granted Forster
a live interview.

936
01:00:36,698 --> 01:00:38,325
I can't, Jack,
I'm in the car.

937
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:42,829
It's all right. They also will cast.
You just turn on 750 AM.

938
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:44,331
I'm phoning in.

939
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:47,876
Wait a second. You think is such
a good idea? With all the court actions?

940
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:51,296
I think he's behind everything. I think
he's behind the phone calls, threats..

941
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:54,216
I'm gonna try to get inside his head.
Make him crack.

942
01:00:54,424 --> 01:00:56,259
Okay?
You wanna stay on the line, please?

943
01:00:57,552 --> 01:00:59,179
- Dr. Gramm?
- Yeah.

944
01:00:59,262 --> 01:00:59,846
You're on the air.

945
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:03,850
I've been told that we have Dr. Gramm
joining us by phone.

946
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:06,228
- Dr. Gramm, are you there?
- I'm here.

947
01:01:06,478 --> 01:01:08,021
Have you been watching
the interview?

948
01:01:08,104 --> 01:01:10,482
- Is that what you call it?
- What would you call it?

949
01:01:10,732 --> 01:01:13,193
I don't know, I don't call it an
interview. I call it an entertainment.

950
01:01:13,276 --> 01:01:15,195
I call it a performance, maybe.

951
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:17,489
You must have got something to say
or you wouldn't have called in.

952
01:01:17,697 --> 01:01:21,368
Oh, yeah, I think it's very interesting
that Forster talks about forgiveness.

953
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:24,621
I just want him to know that
his victims have not forgiven him.

954
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:26,873
Look, you've lied under oath,
Dr. Gramm, and you know it.

955
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:29,960
This is not about me.
This about the women you've raped..

956
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,711
And tortured and murdered.

957
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,006
- Women like Janie Kay.
- I have nothing to do with her death..

958
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,883
- And you know it.
- Nothing to do with her death?

959
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:40,512
There was an eyewitness,
a twin sister who identified you.

960
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,514
She was at the scene
and identified you.

961
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:44,307
She was drugged
and beaten so badly..

962
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:46,351
She said that she couldn't
be sure, but you..

963
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:48,228
You bereaved her until she said
it was me.

964
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:49,980
Interesting that you didn't say
that you're innocent.

965
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:53,066
- I had nothing to do with the death..
- No, I don't. I know you're convicted.

966
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:54,943
You're convicted by a jury.

967
01:01:55,026 --> 01:01:56,945
You were trialed and convicted,
that's what I know.

968
01:01:56,987 --> 01:01:59,072
Trial? That wasn't a trial,
that was an inquisition.

969
01:01:59,155 --> 01:02:00,240
And the jury believed your lies.

970
01:02:00,323 --> 01:02:04,452
You had to cause pain, suffer and death,
so you could feel alive.

971
01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:05,370
Wait a second.

972
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:07,914
Pain and suffer is something that you,
forensics, know how to inflict.

973
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:12,252
Even your idol, Ted Bundy,
ultimately, identified his victims.

974
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,088
How about, man,
identify your victims?

975
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:15,922
How about?

976
01:02:16,006 --> 01:02:21,595
The bodies of Terry Hines, Alicia Smith,
Samantha Green. Where are they, man?

977
01:02:21,803 --> 01:02:22,762
Come on, where are they?

978
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:26,766
Give these people's families closure,
man! Give them closure.

979
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:30,061
You're on national television now!
Millions of people are watching you.

980
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:30,687
Come on!

981
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,814
How about your colleague in London,
in the Clark case?

982
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:37,527
Putting in an innocent mother
for murdering her baby? Well done!

983
01:02:37,736 --> 01:02:41,198
Well done, doctor. You must be so proud
of being part of an elite fortunate.

984
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,284
Fortunately for her,
her conviction was overturned..

985
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:47,746
When the doctor's testimony
turned out to be an absurd.

986
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:49,206
Quack, quack, Dr. Gramm?

987
01:02:49,456 --> 01:02:50,790
You now what?

988
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:53,293
Why don't you take a good look
at your watch?

989
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:54,878
A good look.

990
01:02:55,587 --> 01:02:59,716
Now imagine what it'd be like to be
minutes away from your own death.

991
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:02,010
To hear the ticking of a clock..

992
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:05,222
And know that your time on earth
is drying to a close.

993
01:03:06,973 --> 01:03:08,266
Thank you.

994
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:13,063
There's another package for you,
Dr. Gramm. Should I send it up?

995
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:15,148
This has just got in.

996
01:03:15,398 --> 01:03:18,902
A three judge panel of the Nine Circuit
has just granted John Forster..

997
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,529
A stay of the execution.

998
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:23,448
What?

999
01:03:26,743 --> 01:03:27,911
Are you serious?

1000
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,417
You hear that, Frank?

1001
01:03:34,709 --> 01:03:35,961
Yeah, I heard.

1002
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:37,838
Forster got the stay.

1003
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:41,383
I got him going, didn't I?
No cigar.

1004
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,719
Why did you send me
on a wild goose chase, Jack?

1005
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:46,012
What do you mean,
wild goose chase?

1006
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:48,932
D'Franco is not a serial killer,
he's a serial groupie.

1007
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:51,351
So he's a groupie so what?
What's the big deal?

1008
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,312
I've just got a call from Jeremy Guber
from attorney general office.

1009
01:03:54,521 --> 01:03:57,399
You are wanted for questioning
on the murder of Dale Morris.

1010
01:03:57,732 --> 01:03:59,818
What?
What are you talking about?

1011
01:04:00,068 --> 01:04:03,738
They've found physical evidence at
her apartment that implicates you, Jack.

1012
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:04,865
What evidence?

1013
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:05,949
Jack..

1014
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:08,201
You know I can't say.

1015
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:11,037
What you mean, you can't say?
What does that mean?

1016
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:14,374
- Frank?
- There's someone to see you..

1017
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:16,126
Mister, you can't go up there.

1018
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:18,628
You told the doorman
to don't let anyone up.

1019
01:04:18,712 --> 01:04:21,423
It's all right, don't worry.
Don't worry, no-one is getting in.

1020
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,434
The state attorney general
has just announced that his appealing..

1021
01:04:32,517 --> 01:04:34,519
Is taken to the State Supreme Court
immediately.

1022
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:35,896
Jack. There's smoke.

1023
01:04:35,937 --> 01:04:38,440
We'll keep you informed
with further developments.

1024
01:04:41,484 --> 01:04:43,236
There's smoke here too.

1025
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:01,087
It's your boyfriend.

1026
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,506
Let Kim go.

1027
01:05:02,714 --> 01:05:04,132
Let her go now
and no-one will get hurt.

1028
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:07,302
Guy, I'm fine.
There's no problem here.

1029
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,930
The building is on fire.
That's a problem.

1030
01:05:10,138 --> 01:05:11,890
- He's got a gun.
- Okay. Listen to me.

1031
01:05:12,182 --> 01:05:14,643
I know this man and I know
he's not gonna hurt me again.

1032
01:05:14,726 --> 01:05:16,770
You have to trust me, Jack.
Please, open the door.

1033
01:05:16,937 --> 01:05:19,314
- Do it quickly. There's smoke up here.
- Kim.

1034
01:05:19,523 --> 01:05:23,068
Guy, I'm coming out.
We can calm things down, okay?

1035
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:27,489
Guy, look at me.
I'm fine. There's no problem here.

1036
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:31,284
- What are you doing with him?
- I'm okay. There's no problem.

1037
01:05:33,537 --> 01:05:36,206
Guy has been shot.
No!

1038
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,843
On the roof there's a fire escape.
Okay?

1039
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:51,012
- When I say "go", follow me.
- Okay.

1040
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,824
Do you think he is dead?

1041
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:14,077
- He doesn't look good.
- We should go back up there.

1042
01:06:14,703 --> 01:06:16,621
I gotta go back there
and help him.

1043
01:06:17,038 --> 01:06:19,833
No. You can't go up there.
Man.

1044
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:22,878
- Yeah?
- Jack, I need to talk to you.

1045
01:06:23,044 --> 01:06:25,046
I need two minutes to clarify
something?

1046
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:26,631
Shelley, I can't talk now.

1047
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,384
I'll talk to you
when I get to Sara Pollard apartment.

1048
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:35,432
Miss. Lewinsky.
Are you okay?

1049
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,684
- I'm just a little bit dizzy.
- Come.

1050
01:06:41,313 --> 01:06:43,857
Because I didn't see
a device with a timer.

1051
01:06:44,065 --> 01:06:46,067
Get the bomb squad,
this is the second one.

1052
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:47,277
Go.

1053
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,782
- Get her some oxygen.
- All right. We got her, sir.

1054
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,868
Let's go outside.
You gonna be all right.

1055
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:05,295
Jack, I don't see the shooter,
do you?

1056
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:07,380
Jack.

1057
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:09,716
- He's got a gun.
- Where?

1058
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:11,676
Where the hell is he?

1059
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:13,345
- Where?
- Jack!

1060
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:15,096
Get down!

1061
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:21,561
- Kim!
- Keep moving!

1062
01:07:21,645 --> 01:07:22,896
Kim, where are you?

1063
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,414
Go, go, go!

1064
01:07:41,748 --> 01:07:43,250
Move back!

1065
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,628
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna live.

1066
01:07:47,337 --> 01:07:48,922
Here, let's go.

1067
01:07:49,256 --> 01:07:50,423
Where are we going?

1068
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:53,134
To Sara Pollard house.

1069
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,595
She's the girl I was with
last night.

1070
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,015
That's funny.
It worked in the garage.

1071
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:05,814
Why did you do that?

1072
01:08:06,022 --> 01:08:08,108
I don't know.
I had a feeling..

1073
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:27,752
Are you okay?

1074
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:33,258
What next?

1075
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:35,677
I don't know.

1076
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,975
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

1077
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,151
- Is that your cab?
- Yeah.

1078
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,403
Okay.
I give you a hundred bucks..

1079
01:08:53,486 --> 01:08:55,822
You let me drive it.
I'm just going across town.

1080
01:08:55,906 --> 01:08:57,073
A hundred bucks?

1081
01:08:57,616 --> 01:09:00,410
A hundred bucks plus tip.
How is that?

1082
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,828
All right.

1083
01:09:15,091 --> 01:09:17,177
I can not believe that.

1084
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:19,179
Guy is dead.

1085
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:21,181
He is. He is dead.

1086
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:24,851
Shit.

1087
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:31,733
You have not to say, huh?

1088
01:09:31,816 --> 01:09:34,945
It's just another day
in the life of Jack Gramm.

1089
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:44,329
Okay.

1090
01:09:46,122 --> 01:09:48,208
Can you wait outside the cab
for a minute?

1091
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:51,002
- You bet.
- Thanks.

1092
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,218
You asked me about
my kid sister.

1093
01:09:58,385 --> 01:10:00,303
Okay. It was a long time ago.

1094
01:10:00,554 --> 01:10:03,098
She was staying at my apartment
in New York City.

1095
01:10:03,306 --> 01:10:05,725
She was 12, I was 28.

1096
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:08,895
And I was late for a meeting.
Very important meeting.

1097
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,231
A meeting
that was gonna change my life.

1098
01:10:11,314 --> 01:10:14,109
It was gonna make me
into somebody important.

1099
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:17,779
Make all my dreams come true,
so..

1100
01:10:17,988 --> 01:10:20,574
I went to this meeting
on my dissertation.

1101
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:23,910
And I left her there by herself.

1102
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:27,789
I could have taken her with me.
I could have left her with friends.

1103
01:10:27,873 --> 01:10:30,500
I could have postpone
the meeting.

1104
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,879
But I chose not to,
because I was in a hurry.

1105
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:36,173
Anyway, I left her there alone.

1106
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:38,925
At that time I was working
in a case..

1107
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:41,887
And this guy had strangled
six women.

1108
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,598
We were very close to nail him.

1109
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,351
He was upset
and he wanted to get back at me.

1110
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,355
So he came to my apartment,
only I wasn't there.

1111
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:56,151
And that time I wasn't concerned
with security.

1112
01:10:57,068 --> 01:10:59,571
I was careless so..

1113
01:11:02,073 --> 01:11:03,992
He broke the door down..

1114
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:05,619
And he went in.

1115
01:11:07,412 --> 01:11:08,622
And did..

1116
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:10,957
Things..

1117
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:13,376
To my baby sister.

1118
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,755
Katheryn, was her name.

1119
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,298
Katy.

1120
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:22,636
He did things that you wouldn't do
to an animal..

1121
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,971
That was bred for slaughter.

1122
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,310
Anyway..

1123
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:35,273
When they caught him..

1124
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:37,567
He laughed..

1125
01:11:39,027 --> 01:11:40,362
And said..

1126
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:44,157
It took him 88 minutes..

1127
01:11:56,878 --> 01:12:00,006
It took him 88 minutes
to have my sister dead.

1128
01:12:00,048 --> 01:12:01,299
Jack..

1129
01:12:04,177 --> 01:12:06,137
He is in prison now.

1130
01:12:09,349 --> 01:12:12,060
Coming up for
his fifth parole hearing.

1131
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,230
I left New York.

1132
01:12:15,438 --> 01:12:18,650
Left all that behind me
and came here, to Seattle.

1133
01:12:19,192 --> 01:12:22,279
You know,
it seemed the perfect place.

1134
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:25,448
It's on the far off corner..

1135
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,910
Of the continent of USA.

1136
01:12:29,286 --> 01:12:31,955
To see if I had
a second hanged in me.

1137
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,210
Whoever stole that tape..

1138
01:12:38,044 --> 01:12:40,380
Knows the meaning of 88 minutes.

1139
01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:47,554
Is that enough?

1140
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:52,475
Let's go.

1141
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,863
If Sara is not home,
we don't have a search warrant.

1142
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:07,490
Well, we don't need a search warrant.
We're not gonna arrest anybody.

1143
01:13:07,574 --> 01:13:09,367
We're just breaking in.

1144
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:15,916
Not a good sign.

1145
01:13:19,085 --> 01:13:21,046
You can't say
I've never give you anything.

1146
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,965
This looks familiar.
When did you take it?

1147
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:26,843
I guess it doesn't matter,
does it?

1148
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:28,470
It just might.

1149
01:13:32,682 --> 01:13:34,768
- Okay, check out that way.
- Okay.

1150
01:14:17,143 --> 01:14:17,894
Oh, Jesus.

1151
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:23,733
What is it?

1152
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,736
Oh, my God.

1153
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:28,822
Oh, my God!

1154
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:30,949
Calm, Kim.

1155
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:34,077
- Calm, Kim.
- Oh, my God. She is dead.

1156
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:35,787
It's okay.

1157
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:39,249
- Who would do that? Why?
- Calm, Kim.

1158
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,127
- Who could torture someone like that?
- Just, breathe.

1159
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,422
- Breathe, breathe.
- Okay.

1160
01:14:46,131 --> 01:14:47,757
- Breathe.
- Oh, God.

1161
01:14:47,841 --> 01:14:50,051
- Control. Take control.
- Okay.

1162
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:52,679
I'm in control.

1163
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,182
- Are you in control?
- Yeah.

1164
01:14:55,348 --> 01:14:57,642
- Okay, good. Let me show you something.
- Okay.

1165
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:00,604
That is my signature.

1166
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:04,482
Forged.
Credit card receipt.

1167
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:07,152
This whole place
is filled with my DNA.

1168
01:15:07,485 --> 01:15:09,321
The police is gonna come here.

1169
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,574
They gonna know I was with Sara.
They gonna think that I killed her.

1170
01:15:14,451 --> 01:15:15,577
- Your phone.
- Yeah.

1171
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,120
Answer, Jack.

1172
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,957
Yeah.

1173
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:23,043
- Jack?
- Carol?

1174
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:24,753
Carol?

1175
01:15:25,003 --> 01:15:27,964
Did you here the tape with
your sister's 88 minutes of suffering?

1176
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:30,717
I sent it to your apartment.

1177
01:15:31,676 --> 01:15:33,929
What are you saying, Carol?
What is this?

1178
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:36,056
The Porsche was a close call.

1179
01:15:37,474 --> 01:15:40,393
I called Frank and told him
you murdered Sara after you killed Dale.

1180
01:15:43,396 --> 01:15:45,065
Think you are so smart..

1181
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:47,400
Invincible and unbeatable.

1182
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:51,947
John Forster is giving you a death
sentence and he is about to be free.

1183
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,074
How ironic.

1184
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:57,410
You've got 18 minutes left.

1185
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,704
Meet me at your office alone.

1186
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:01,456
Tic-tac.

1187
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:04,960
What is it?

1188
01:16:05,043 --> 01:16:06,503
It's Carol.

1189
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:11,258
She wants to meet me at the university,
at my office.

1190
01:16:12,592 --> 01:16:13,718
Let's go.

1191
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:15,595
- Come on.
- Okay.

1192
01:16:33,864 --> 01:16:36,283
Shelley? What the hell
are you doing in here?

1193
01:16:37,284 --> 01:16:38,952
I need to talk to you.

1194
01:16:41,872 --> 01:16:44,958
That poor girl.
That poor.. poor girl.

1195
01:16:47,627 --> 01:16:49,296
- It was me.
- Sit, sit.

1196
01:16:49,379 --> 01:16:52,048
- It was me.
- Shelley, sit down.

1197
01:16:53,466 --> 01:16:56,511
I broke the security protocol.

1198
01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:00,473
Why?

1199
01:17:02,767 --> 01:17:04,603
Well, about six weeks ago..

1200
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:08,732
I had a drink in your office
with a student of yours.

1201
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:10,442
A couple of drinks, actually.

1202
01:17:10,942 --> 01:17:15,071
And she made an advance,
and..

1203
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:20,035
It was late, but the office was
jammed with people working still.

1204
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,541
And when we woke up she left.
She didn't have a briefcase..

1205
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,710
She didn't have anything
she could put the tape in, but..

1206
01:17:28,793 --> 01:17:30,754
But somebody else must have.

1207
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:33,882
Somebody else did,
while we're sleeping.

1208
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:36,968
Who was this girl?
What's her name?

1209
01:17:39,012 --> 01:17:40,263
It was Lauren.

1210
01:17:41,431 --> 01:17:42,974
Lauren Douglas.

1211
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:47,979
And here is the..

1212
01:17:49,105 --> 01:17:50,649
It's a picture
from the security cameras.

1213
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:53,652
This is the person that must have
rifle through my files..

1214
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,488
And found the combination
to your vault and took the tape.

1215
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,907
That's not a person, Shelly.
It's a hat and a coat.

1216
01:17:59,157 --> 01:18:04,579
And this the photo ID of everyone that
has visited Forster on the last month.

1217
01:18:06,206 --> 01:18:07,249
Oh..

1218
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,877
Can you ever forgive me?

1219
01:18:13,964 --> 01:18:16,007
If I can't forgive you, Shelley..

1220
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:18,635
I don't deserve you.

1221
01:18:19,553 --> 01:18:20,804
Understand?

1222
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:27,060
I want you to call Carol
and patch her through to me.

1223
01:18:27,143 --> 01:18:28,854
- Okay?
- Okay.

1224
01:18:30,146 --> 01:18:31,314
Kim?

1225
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,029
Kim?

1226
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:43,243
Hi, can you transfer me
to Lynn Johnson office, please?

1227
01:18:45,745 --> 01:18:46,997
Kim?

1228
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:50,542
Kim?

1229
01:19:07,601 --> 01:19:08,810
Kim?

1230
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,735
Where are you going in such a hurry,
Jack?

1231
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:19,404
Is there something upstairs
that you don't want me to see?

1232
01:19:20,113 --> 01:19:23,366
There's a woman named Sara Pollard
upstairs very dead.

1233
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:24,618
You can see her, if you'd like.

1234
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,287
Look, I'm a straight shooter,
right, Jack?

1235
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:29,206
- Yeah.
- And you'd never screw me over, right?

1236
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,248
Oh, come on.

1237
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,627
Why are your finger prints all over
Dale Morris apartment?

1238
01:19:34,878 --> 01:19:36,296
- They are?
- Yeah.

1239
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:39,508
And you were right about the Halothane
on the blood stream.

1240
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:43,762
What you failed to mention is the fact
that your semen is in her vagina cavity.

1241
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,139
Is your semen in Sara Pollard?

1242
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,683
Where the hell are you going
with this, Frank?

1243
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,769
Can't you see this is a frame?

1244
01:19:50,977 --> 01:19:53,813
Forster is coordinating
this whole thing from prison.

1245
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,690
- Can't you see that?
- Yeah, right.

1246
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:59,027
It is Forster's semen on Sara Pollard
it's yours, Jack?

1247
01:19:59,236 --> 01:20:03,365
Somebody hired Sara Pollard
to be with me last night..

1248
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:05,033
Then killed her..

1249
01:20:05,408 --> 01:20:09,496
Took my semen
and deposit into Dale Morris.

1250
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,623
Do you have any idea
how absurd that sounds?

1251
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:12,624
No, it's not absurd.

1252
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,376
I don't have time to explain,
Frank.

1253
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,044
Carol isn't answering.

1254
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:17,462
What? What?

1255
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:18,922
Carol isn't answering.

1256
01:20:20,006 --> 01:20:23,468
Get the names of all the women lawyers
who work for Forster.

1257
01:20:23,677 --> 01:20:24,970
I want their names and ages.

1258
01:20:25,178 --> 01:20:27,514
- Look, I know how you operate, Jack.
- What the hell are you doing?

1259
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,599
I know how you use people.

1260
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:32,686
It's no secret you're a womanizer,
you drink too much.

1261
01:20:32,936 --> 01:20:35,564
How do I know that you haven't gone
completely over the edge?

1262
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:37,190
- Oh, man, I can't believe it!
- How do I know?

1263
01:20:37,274 --> 01:20:39,025
- I don't know what you do anymore.
- What did I do, Frank?

1264
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:41,319
Did I send myself a tape?

1265
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,698
Did I blow up my car?
Did I set my apartment on fire?

1266
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:46,700
Did I fire bullets at myself?

1267
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,869
For God sakes, Frank, wake up!

1268
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,622
- What the hell.. What are you doing?
- I have no idea who you're anymore.

1269
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,541
You don't?

1270
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,294
- I got Gramm. I'm bringing him in.
- No, you're not gonna do this.

1271
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:00,714
Frank. Frank.
Just give me some time.

1272
01:21:00,839 --> 01:21:03,508
Just give me some time.
I can untangle this. okay?

1273
01:21:03,717 --> 01:21:05,552
Just give me..
Here, give me some time.

1274
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,889
Don't move
or I'll blow your head off.

1275
01:21:11,808 --> 01:21:14,060
Don't point a gun at me, Frank.

1276
01:21:14,644 --> 01:21:17,731
Don't point a gun at me.
Please.

1277
01:21:26,364 --> 01:21:29,075
I wanted to sync up our watches,
that's all.

1278
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,627
All right, Jack.

1279
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,546
What do you need?

1280
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:44,966
I need time.
I need ten minutes. okay?

1281
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:46,927
Here, let's sync up now.

1282
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,681
At 11:40, meet me at my office
at the university.

1283
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:07,239
Kim? What happened?

1284
01:22:07,781 --> 01:22:11,535
I know you're only trying to help me,
but don't go to my office on campus.

1285
01:22:11,743 --> 01:22:14,788
You understand? It's dangerous.
Don't be a hero.

1286
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,416
When you get this message,
call me back A.S.A.P.

1287
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,876
You understand? It's Jack.

1288
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,130
Yeah.

1289
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:26,633
There's still no answer
at Johnson's office.

1290
01:22:26,716 --> 01:22:28,802
Hold on. Yeah.

1291
01:22:29,052 --> 01:22:30,053
- Jack?
- Kim..

1292
01:22:30,136 --> 01:22:33,265
Whatever you do, don't go to my office
on the campus. Do you understand?

1293
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,016
You have 14 minutes.

1294
01:22:36,142 --> 01:22:37,143
What?

1295
01:22:37,227 --> 01:22:39,312
It was me, Jack.
I set you up.

1296
01:22:40,063 --> 01:22:42,190
I had a computer dialing service
call you up..

1297
01:22:42,274 --> 01:22:44,901
Rearranging times,
using electronic altered voice.

1298
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,487
Kim, this is no time to joke.

1299
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,031
Meet me in your office
in ten minutes, Jack.

1300
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,200
11:40. Don't be late.

1301
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,451
Kim!

1302
01:22:54,828 --> 01:22:55,829
Kim!

1303
01:23:31,323 --> 01:23:32,699
Oh, shit.

1304
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,206
Man..

1305
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:47,214
Yeah.

1306
01:23:47,297 --> 01:23:50,217
Hey, Jack, I got the names
of the women on Forster's legal team.

1307
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:51,718
They were three.

1308
01:23:51,843 --> 01:23:56,556
Hannah Baker, 53.
Rosane Caputto, 47, and..

1309
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,016
Lydia Doherty, 28.

1310
01:23:58,308 --> 01:24:00,560
And Lydia Doherty, 28.
How did you know?

1311
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,812
Cause her name is on the signature sheet
you gave me.

1312
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,357
I want you to do a search
on Lydia Doherty.

1313
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,609
I want you to get all the information
you can.

1314
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:11,279
Fax it to my office on campus.
Okay? Do it now.

1315
01:24:31,424 --> 01:24:33,218
Hey, another hundred bucks
and I'll wait.

1316
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,137
What the hell
are you doing in here?

1317
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:21,266
This is Lauren Douglas bag.

1318
01:25:22,392 --> 01:25:24,936
It was stolen today.
I found it in your desk.

1319
01:25:26,897 --> 01:25:28,190
Halothane.

1320
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:30,483
What is it doing here?

1321
01:25:30,817 --> 01:25:32,277
What are you doing in here?

1322
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,196
This is what you used
to kill Dale and Sara?

1323
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:36,406
Or do you have no idea
about this too?

1324
01:25:37,324 --> 01:25:38,283
Oh, sure I do.

1325
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,786
I left all this stuff in my desk
so you'd come along and find it.

1326
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:43,747
You convinced the jury
that Forster was guilty.

1327
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:45,373
How do I know you didn't kill
these women too?

1328
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:46,416
Who sent you here?

1329
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,503
Yeah.
I'd like to report a suspect..

1330
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,087
- In the Seattle Slayer case.
- What the hell..

1331
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:52,672
- Dr. Jack Gramm.
- Put down the goddamn phone!

1332
01:25:52,756 --> 01:25:54,633
What's the matter with you?
Who sent you here?

1333
01:25:54,799 --> 01:25:56,510
You think I'm too dumb
to figure it out from myself?

1334
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:57,511
Yes, I do.

1335
01:25:57,594 --> 01:26:01,848
Because whoever sent you here is deeply
involved in the Slayer killings.

1336
01:26:02,098 --> 01:26:03,266
Lydia Doherty.

1337
01:26:03,683 --> 01:26:05,977
- Lydia Doherty.
- What the hell is that?

1338
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:10,315
Yeah?

1339
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:11,816
Come to the Stern Building now.

1340
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,860
Corner office, seventh floor.

1341
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:15,529
Alone.

1342
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:19,491
You have five minutes, Jack.

1343
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:23,578
- What are you doing?
- I'm not moving.

1344
01:26:24,538 --> 01:26:27,624
I don't have time to explain this.

1345
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:29,000
Get away from the door.

1346
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:30,460
- Come on!
- You're gonna shoot me?

1347
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:36,800
Yeah.

1348
01:26:39,094 --> 01:26:40,595
I'm a bad shot.

1349
01:26:43,473 --> 01:26:46,434
Frank, when you get this message
I'm gonna be at the Stern Building..

1350
01:26:46,476 --> 01:26:49,187
On the seventh floor.
Get there as soon as you can.

1351
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,349
Oh, God.

1352
01:28:50,642 --> 01:28:52,644
Punctual, Dr. Gramm.

1353
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:57,065
I'm gonna give you a B+
for effort.

1354
01:28:57,357 --> 01:29:00,652
Lynn Johnson is indisposed, but
I'm sure she'd say hello, if she could.

1355
01:29:00,861 --> 01:29:04,197
As for your old friend, Kim,
she didn't quite make the grade.

1356
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,824
- Lydia.
- You got the name right.

1357
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,869
Lydia Doherty.
Copy cat murderer.

1358
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,371
God, I wish Forster
could see your face.

1359
01:29:11,454 --> 01:29:13,290
You look so totally clueless.

1360
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:19,629
I hope that's not a gun
you're holding.

1361
01:29:20,589 --> 01:29:22,799
Is that a gun, Dr. Gramm?

1362
01:29:23,425 --> 01:29:24,509
What do you want?

1363
01:29:24,801 --> 01:29:26,219
Is that a gun?

1364
01:29:27,053 --> 01:29:29,514
- I have a gun.
- Then do this.

1365
01:29:31,016 --> 01:29:32,559
Put it on the floor..

1366
01:29:33,435 --> 01:29:35,145
And slide it to me.

1367
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:38,732
To me.

1368
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:43,361
Okay.

1369
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:49,201
Okay.

1370
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,495
You slide it.

1371
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,132
One more time, slide it to me.

1372
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:10,555
Slowly.

1373
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,266
And move back.

1374
01:30:19,773 --> 01:30:20,607
Better.

1375
01:30:43,797 --> 01:30:46,007
I'd like to talk to John Forster,
please.

1376
01:30:46,091 --> 01:30:47,968
This is his appeal attorney,
Lydia Doherty.

1377
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,846
They monitor his calls.

1378
01:30:52,222 --> 01:30:54,558
- You gonna implicate him.
- The brilliant Dr. Gramm..

1379
01:30:54,641 --> 01:30:56,601
And his psycho gamble,
is that it?

1380
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:01,690
Sorry for the trouble I caused,
Dr. Gram.

1381
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:05,026
You know that I did, Dr. Gramm,
with honors.

1382
01:31:05,277 --> 01:31:08,655
Dale told me how good you're
with her when her dad died.

1383
01:31:08,905 --> 01:31:10,282
She was so grateful.

1384
01:31:10,866 --> 01:31:13,159
But despite the fact that insanity
is a legal concept..

1385
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:15,620
It doesn't mean
that someone is not sick.

1386
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:29,885
Have him call me on my cell.

1387
01:31:31,136 --> 01:31:32,679
He knows the number.

1388
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:37,976
- What do you want?
- What about you start with a confession?

1389
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:41,188
- I confess.
- To what?

1390
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:43,356
To what? To everything.

1391
01:31:44,024 --> 01:31:45,609
I confess.

1392
01:31:52,991 --> 01:31:55,702
I want you to speak clearly
and I want the truth.

1393
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,370
Where do I start?

1394
01:31:57,579 --> 01:31:59,748
- Janie Kay.
- Janie Kay?

1395
01:31:59,956 --> 01:32:01,416
I coached her.

1396
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:03,793
Shut it off.

1397
01:32:05,462 --> 01:32:07,672
- Shut it off.
- I am.

1398
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:11,885
Go again.

1399
01:32:12,636 --> 01:32:15,222
I coached Janie Kay.

1400
01:32:15,514 --> 01:32:17,682
- In what trial?
- I coached Janie Kay..

1401
01:32:17,766 --> 01:32:21,978
In John Forster's trial. I coached her.
She perjured herself.

1402
01:32:22,437 --> 01:32:24,356
I gave false testimony.

1403
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,026
And John Forster was convicted.

1404
01:32:28,235 --> 01:32:30,403
Based on an unlawful testimony.

1405
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,072
Based on an unlawful testimony.

1406
01:32:34,699 --> 01:32:36,660
It's my little present for John.

1407
01:32:36,868 --> 01:32:37,827
Thank you.

1408
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:43,625
What are you doing?

1409
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:45,544
Are you assessing me?

1410
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:50,090
Are you looking for a weakness,
Dr. Gramm?

1411
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:53,343
I'm just wondering what is next.

1412
01:32:56,429 --> 01:32:58,557
Aren't you gonna offer
to make me a deal?

1413
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:01,434
Sacrifice yourself
for Kim and Carol?

1414
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:04,104
Be the hero.

1415
01:33:04,521 --> 01:33:08,066
Well, that wouldn't fly out, would it?
I'd offer, but it wouldn't fly.

1416
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:09,109
Rejected.

1417
01:33:10,068 --> 01:33:11,820
Have any other moves?

1418
01:33:13,363 --> 01:33:15,782
Or you spent so quickly..

1419
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:20,745
I could move my eyes, like this,
e look behind you.

1420
01:33:22,164 --> 01:33:24,541
To see if there is someone there
with a gun pointed to your head.

1421
01:33:27,627 --> 01:33:30,088
- How much time I got left?
- You have about a minute.

1422
01:33:31,756 --> 01:33:32,632
Jack.

1423
01:33:32,883 --> 01:33:35,594
Enough time for your last words.
I'm not gonna deny you those.

1424
01:33:37,095 --> 01:33:39,306
All this torture,
all this torment..

1425
01:33:40,765 --> 01:33:41,892
For an infatuation?

1426
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:44,102
It's not an infatuation,
don't demean me.

1427
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:47,480
Well, if it's not an infatuation,
what is it?

1428
01:33:49,733 --> 01:33:51,109
Stop, please!

1429
01:34:07,918 --> 01:34:10,587
I went through great lengths
to pull this off.

1430
01:34:12,005 --> 01:34:14,466
John really appreciates
the quality of my work.

1431
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:16,218
Timing the phone calls..

1432
01:34:16,593 --> 01:34:19,638
Perfecting the ropes and plus
implicating everyone close to you.

1433
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:21,848
Coaching Carol and Kim.

1434
01:34:22,807 --> 01:34:24,518
All the while staying invisible.

1435
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:26,478
It was me, Jack. I set you up.

1436
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:28,522
You know what I don't understand?

1437
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:32,984
How, in God's name,
does anybody give up their free will?

1438
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,736
How you do that?

1439
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:36,988
- 45 seconds.
- I saw you.

1440
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:39,908
You came to my class,
I remember you.

1441
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:42,744
You were intelligent.
An individual.

1442
01:34:43,036 --> 01:34:44,287
You challenged things.

1443
01:34:44,371 --> 01:34:46,873
You challenged me.
You challenged ideas.

1444
01:34:47,374 --> 01:34:49,000
You're your own person.

1445
01:34:49,251 --> 01:34:54,214
How could you ever allowed yourself
to be so manipulated by this guy?

1446
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:55,423
30 seconds.

1447
01:34:55,465 --> 01:34:57,008
You're gonna take the fall
for this guy?

1448
01:34:57,175 --> 01:34:59,719
If that's what he wants,
so be it.

1449
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:01,888
You see, Jacko..

1450
01:35:02,472 --> 01:35:03,682
I'm a true believer.

1451
01:35:03,765 --> 01:35:06,059
You better believe
that's an FBI agent..

1452
01:35:06,101 --> 01:35:08,436
With a gun pointed right
into your head..

1453
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,563
At this moment.

1454
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:11,439
Believe it.

1455
01:35:11,648 --> 01:35:14,067
- No more kidding.
- Believe it.

1456
01:35:15,485 --> 01:35:17,279
- Believe it.
- I believe your time is up..

1457
01:35:17,362 --> 01:35:18,822
Dr. Gramm.

1458
01:35:33,587 --> 01:35:34,921
God.

1459
01:35:36,548 --> 01:35:37,841
Jack!

1460
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:41,303
Jack!

1461
01:35:41,386 --> 01:35:42,345
No!

1462
01:35:46,016 --> 01:35:47,100
Jack!

1463
01:35:47,392 --> 01:35:48,602
Jack!

1464
01:35:55,192 --> 01:35:56,401
No!

1465
01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:57,694
Jack!

1466
01:35:57,986 --> 01:35:59,070
No!

1467
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:00,530
Jack!

1468
01:36:01,448 --> 01:36:02,616
No!

1469
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:07,245
No!

1470
01:36:43,823 --> 01:36:44,908
Again!

1471
01:36:55,043 --> 01:36:56,962
I got you. I got you.

1472
01:36:57,379 --> 01:36:58,463
It's okay.

1473
01:36:58,547 --> 01:36:59,673
It's okay, sweetheart.

1474
01:37:02,968 --> 01:37:04,970
Requesting immediately MT help.

1475
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:08,223
At the UNW Campus,
Stern Building.

1476
01:37:08,682 --> 01:37:09,933
I repeat.

1477
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:13,061
Immediately emergency
medical technician.

1478
01:37:13,645 --> 01:37:15,564
Multiple stab wounds.

1479
01:37:18,775 --> 01:37:19,943
There you go.

1480
01:37:21,611 --> 01:37:23,822
That's okay.
Don't move.

1481
01:37:40,755 --> 01:37:41,381
Yeah.

1482
01:37:41,464 --> 01:37:44,509
This is officer Finnegan
from the State Penitentiary Walla Walla.

1483
01:37:44,676 --> 01:37:47,679
I'm placing a call from John Forster
to his attorney Lydia Doherty.

1484
01:37:47,762 --> 01:37:49,055
Put him through.

1485
01:37:50,015 --> 01:37:51,349
Go ahead.

1486
01:37:51,433 --> 01:37:52,559
Lydia.

1487
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:55,228
Did you finish with Gramm?

1488
01:37:55,437 --> 01:37:57,814
- She's downstairs.
- Gramm?

1489
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:02,402
Put my attorney on the phone,
please.

1490
01:38:02,652 --> 01:38:03,695
She's indisposed.

1491
01:38:03,945 --> 01:38:05,864
Look, you're meddling her.
You shouldn't be meddling in.

1492
01:38:06,114 --> 01:38:10,785
You seized a naive junior lawyer
on your legal staff.

1493
01:38:11,453 --> 01:38:14,247
You realized that she's damaged
psychologically and..

1494
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:15,040
Genius, isn't it?

1495
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:17,834
Susceptible to your craps.
And what you do?

1496
01:38:18,043 --> 01:38:19,586
You get her to kill people for you.

1497
01:38:19,794 --> 01:38:21,213
So you can stay alive.

1498
01:38:21,463 --> 01:38:24,257
That's an innovative legal strategy,
if I have ever heard of any.

1499
01:38:24,466 --> 01:38:27,260
Dr. Gramm, I'm flattered
with your imagination.

1500
01:38:27,969 --> 01:38:29,095
But you're grasping in straw.

1501
01:38:29,262 --> 01:38:31,973
She becomes a student of mine,
no less..

1502
01:38:32,265 --> 01:38:35,435
You keep her on the appeal process,
but she's still your lawyer..

1503
01:38:35,519 --> 01:38:37,938
So she has unlimited access
to you..

1504
01:38:38,146 --> 01:38:41,316
So you can plan
your copy cat murders together.

1505
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:43,818
And then you can get a new trial.

1506
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:46,446
And live happily ever after.
Isn't that the case?

1507
01:38:46,613 --> 01:38:49,866
Dr. Gramm, I want you to listen
very closely..

1508
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:52,702
Because when I get out of here..

1509
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:55,288
I'm gonna go out and
have a nice meal..

1510
01:38:55,956 --> 01:38:57,666
Stop by your grave..

1511
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,293
And piss all over it.

1512
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:04,172
Now, please, put my angelical attorney
on the phone.

1513
01:39:04,422 --> 01:39:05,131
She's dead.

1514
01:39:06,383 --> 01:39:08,176
It's over, Forster.

1515
01:39:08,426 --> 01:39:10,303
Except for the clock,
that goes tic-tac.

1516
01:39:10,554 --> 01:39:13,265
Tic-tac.
You got 12 hours to live.

1517
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,009
All right, fellows..

1518
01:39:55,098 --> 01:39:57,017
- How is Lynn Johnson?
- Well..

1519
01:39:57,267 --> 01:40:01,813
She just threw out of the house.
She didn't want me to be late for class.

1520
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:04,149
Jack, I have to ask you
something.

1521
01:40:04,232 --> 01:40:07,194
Was Lydia telling the truth?
Did you coach Janie?

1522
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:11,156
You believe Forster killed those people?
All those people?

1523
01:40:11,281 --> 01:40:14,075
- Yes.
- Janie's sister and everybody?

1524
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,119
- Yes.
- Beyond reasonable doubt?

1525
01:40:16,328 --> 01:40:19,706
- Absolutely.
- What would you have done in my shoes?

1526
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:22,417
Don't answer it.

1527
01:40:22,626 --> 01:40:23,877
Think about it.

1528
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:25,504
Justice..

1529
01:40:26,087 --> 01:40:27,380
And truth.

1530
01:40:28,924 --> 01:40:30,550
Where do they intersect?

1531
01:40:47,484 --> 01:40:48,401
Hi.

1532
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,158
Hello, everyone.

1533
01:41:00,372 --> 01:41:02,207
John Forster is dead.

1534
01:41:04,668 --> 01:41:07,629
His execution is not a cause..

1535
01:41:08,797 --> 01:41:10,257
For celebration.

1536
01:41:11,049 --> 01:41:13,468
Nor is a vindication.

1537
01:41:14,135 --> 01:41:16,972
It is a chapter..

1538
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:21,226
In the road to justice
and recovery.

1539
01:41:23,562 --> 01:41:25,063
I personally..

1540
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,568
Don't believe
in capital punishment.

1541
01:41:32,404 --> 01:41:33,697
I do believe..

1542
01:41:34,781 --> 01:41:37,450
In the rights of the victims.

1543
01:41:39,202 --> 01:41:40,704
I do believe..

1544
01:41:41,746 --> 01:41:44,166
That they deserve recompense.

1545
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:49,462
No matter how significant
or insignificant it may be..

1546
01:41:49,838 --> 01:41:52,299
In comparison
to the loss suffered.

1547
01:41:54,968 --> 01:41:57,053
I've suffered such a loss.

1548
01:41:58,972 --> 01:42:01,308
And like some of you here..

1549
01:42:02,184 --> 01:42:04,936
I've spent
those sleepless nights..

1550
01:42:06,688 --> 01:42:08,732
Trying desperately to..

1551
01:42:10,317 --> 01:42:14,112
Squelch down that
bullish instinct for revenge.

1552
01:42:17,365 --> 01:42:19,743
And I have wondered..

1553
01:42:20,076 --> 01:42:22,287
Jack, look at me.
Look at the kite.

1554
01:42:23,163 --> 01:42:24,664
If this pain will..

1555
01:42:25,957 --> 01:42:28,835
- Ever abate.
- Smile!

1556
01:42:30,545 --> 01:42:32,005
I've learnt..

1557
01:42:33,089 --> 01:42:37,135
That time does not heal
the wound.

1558
01:42:38,303 --> 01:42:41,014
It will though, in its most..

1559
01:42:42,516 --> 01:42:44,392
Merciful way..

1560
01:42:47,854 --> 01:42:50,232
Plant the edge ever so slightly.

1561
01:42:57,405 --> 01:42:58,740
So..

1562
01:43:07,123 --> 01:43:09,209
What is the first thing..

1563
01:43:09,417 --> 01:43:12,963
One should remember
when entering a court room?

1564
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,000
