1
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:10,778
At the beginning of WW II,
Sweden wanted to help -

2
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:14,818
<b>its war- torn neighbor Finland
by offering Finnish children -</b>

3
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:17,858
temporary homes
with Swedish families.

4
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:20,938
There were more
than 70,000 "war children".

5
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:25,018
<b>Mother, do you still remember
how it all began?</b>

6
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:29,818
<b>Do you still remember
how the war began?</b>

7
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:34,858
Eero!

8
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:52,178
Mother!

9
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,778
Eero! Eero!

10
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:30,378
MOTHER OF MINE

11
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:38,179
You want to talk about the war?
Sure, I remember the war.

12
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,139
Maybe I shouldn't have come?
- Tuomas will pick me up soon.

13
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,859
Who's Tuomas?

14
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,099
You missed my birthday,
but thanks anyway.

15
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:56,099
I was out of town...
- As always. Hi, Tuomas!

16
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,219
Hi, Kirsti. What's up?
- This is my son Eero.

17
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:05,139
So you're Eero. Tuomas,
from seniors' home help.

18
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,659
Let's go.
Lots of errands to run.

19
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,659
Were you leaving?
- I guess so.

20
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,659
When can we talk, Mother?

21
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,539
Lmagine, now he wants
to talk about the war.

22
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,299
You never wanted to
talk about it before!

23
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,219
I was invited
to a funeral in Sweden.

24
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,819
Signe Jönsson's.

25
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,459
<b>Signe's niece Siv
wrote in the invitation -</b>

26
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,259
<b>that Signe had wanted
me to attend the funeral. </b>

27
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,779
<b>I thought I wouldn't
travel as far as Sweden, -</b>

28
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,379
<b>they were all
strangers to me noW. </b>

29
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,579
<b>But you went.
- Yes. </b>

30
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,339
<b>Do you remember, Mother,
what it was like?</b>

31
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,420
<b>How different everything was
before it all began?</b>

32
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,660
Go to sleep, dear Eero.

33
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,180
What, are you
being a little girl now?

34
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,980
Nothing's going
to happen to me.

35
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,540
If I see a Russkie, I'll hide in
the bushes, quiet as a mouse.

36
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,540
Soon we'll be
together again.

37
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,860
What if their
bombers attack you?

38
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,020
Then the Finnish fighter planes
shoot them to pieces!

39
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,460
Eero, you'll be the man of
the house. Take care of Mother.

40
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,780
Understand?

41
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,541
I'll be back soon,
and everything will be as it was.

42
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:22,621
Let me take that.
- Eero, it's too heavy for you.

43
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,261
Mother?

44
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,701
Mother, you have to eat.

45
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,661
Come on!

46
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,581
We have to seek shelter!

47
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:14,221
Mother...

48
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:26,981
Come here if you dare!

49
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,022
Eero...

50
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:18,022
Are you crying?

51
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:24,382
I'm not going!
- Listen, Eero...

52
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:28,342
I can fix the house,
Dad taught me!

53
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,062
Don't do this to me.

54
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:43,902
Why do those ladies
get to decide?

55
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,462
Eero Lahti.

56
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:46,182
Date of birth?
- August 20th, 1934.

57
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,382
Why can't you come, too?

58
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:27,942
There's no war there
and nothing to be afraid of.

59
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:29,782
I don't want to!

60
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,142
Eero, remember...

61
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:37,862
When you miss me there,
I'll miss you here.

62
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:40,382
I'll always be with you.

63
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,022
It's time.
- Think of it as a vacation.

64
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:49,942
<b>But... - We'll be together soon,
and everything will be as it was. </b>

65
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,622
Dad said that, too.

66
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:37,783
<b>They'd promised the girls dolls,
and the boys bikes. </b>

67
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,743
<b>First, they picked the youngest
and then the prettiest girls, -</b>

68
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,863
<b>the ones with
the cutest smile. </b>

69
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:52,943
<b>Everybody was afraid of
a children's home -</b>

70
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,423
<b>and wanted a Swedish family
to take them in. </b>

71
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,823
<b>Except me. </b>

72
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:08,063
<b>Finally, they put me on a train,
and I was happy. </b>

73
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:12,023
<b>I thought they sent me
back to Finland. </b>

74
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:17,263
<b>I didn't realize the train took
me further away from home. </b>

75
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:07,664
Hello, my name is Eero Lahti
and I'm from Finland.

76
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,384
Yes, hello.

77
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,584
This is my wife.

78
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:47,464
This is it.

79
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:54,304
That's where I work the most.
You can chop wood.

80
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,344
We have a horse.

81
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,864
These are the pigs.
What's "pig" in Finnish?

82
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,184
She's here, she's here!

83
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:16,504
I thought they sent a...
Auntie Signe, he's here!

84
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,264
Some other day, alright?
- No!

85
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:28,744
You don't know
any Swedish, do you?

86
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:31,904
"Hyvä päivä!" Right?

87
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:42,744
Come on. Take off...

88
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:46,224
Let's take off...

89
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,024
The shoes, the shoes, -

90
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:09,264
you must take off your shoes, -

91
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,584
or Mother Signe will be mad!

92
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:21,904
The kitchen...

93
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:29,024
<b>This is it.
We have a radio, -</b>

94
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,904
a clock and a Grandpa.

95
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:37,785
He's sick and can't talk,
but he hears everything you say.

96
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,985
Right, old man?

97
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,385
Don't you want any, Signe?

98
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,905
He has a letter, too.

99
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:14,905
From the Finnish Children's
Aid Committee.

100
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,585
Look, there's a... word list.

101
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:40,545
There are a few lines
from the mother.

102
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,825
She says you do know
a little bit of Swedish.

103
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,265
<b>It says here... - My name is
Eero Lahti and I'm from Finland. </b>

104
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:58,065
Maybe you understand?

105
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,745
He must learn Swedish
if he stays here.

106
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:02,985
<b>No- one here
speaks Finnish. </b>

107
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:10,905
He'll be a good and strong
farm hand, won't he, Grandpa?

108
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:14,985
A good farm hand.
You can tend to the geese.

109
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:18,145
Skane goose.
Can you say that? Geese...

110
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:26,385
Stupid, they don't have
those words in there.

111
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,665
We're done eating.

112
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,425
Father's going to bed now.
Thank you!

113
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:43,305
<b>I'll put him in the children's
room. - No, on the kitchen sofa. </b>

114
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,785
Aren't you going to read
the letter? - It's past ten o'clock.

115
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,905
There's always tomorrow.

116
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,465
Hi, Skane geese!
Can you say Skane goose?

117
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:34,585
You pour this in here.

118
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,585
Get a hold of the bottom.

119
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:42,585
Spread it evenly,
so they all get some.

120
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:48,746
This is Eero, so you'll have
to speak Finnish. Say hello.

121
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:52,226
Hi! Hyvä!

122
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:00,546
Take off your boots.

123
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:09,786
Quickly now,
and then you wash your hands.

124
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:23,786
Let me see your hands.

125
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,306
Turn!

126
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,626
Still dirty.
Wash them again.

127
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:36,866
You have to
wash your hands properly.

128
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:40,386
This is not good enough,
they're dirty.

129
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:46,466
Hold your hands up,
so I can reach them.

130
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:49,306
Rinse!

131
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:55,746
You can't go to school
with dirty hands.

132
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:01,266
<b>School? - Yes,
you're going to school -</b>

133
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:03,866
if you're staying in Sweden.

134
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:07,906
I made you lunch,
Hjalmar's taking you to school.

135
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:09,706
What?

136
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:14,586
You're going to school, Hjalmar's
taking you there. Go on now!

137
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:23,746
I don't understand a word.
You'll learn Swedish at school.

138
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:27,826
Go on now! Don't fight it!

139
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:30,986
I don't understand. Go on!

140
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:38,106
Get your shoes
and your jacket.

141
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,706
Will you find your way home?

142
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,426
<b>Bye! - Bye! See you!</b>

143
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:11,386
Stop! Hallo!

144
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:17,626
I guess you're the war child.

145
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,746
Come on! Welcome.

146
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:24,186
Your name...

147
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:22,307
GIRLS

148
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,827
Do you pee sitting down?

149
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:34,827
Come on, Siv!

150
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:54,347
Where did you go?
Where are you going?

151
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:58,707
Will you stay at Auntie Signe's?

152
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,107
My mother feels sorry for you.

153
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:03,907
<b>She says children
are coming to Sweden -</b>

154
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:08,187
because their parents died
in the war. Did yours die?

155
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:11,347
Is Signe going to
be your mother?

156
00:30:12,107 --> 00:30:14,227
Want to come over
to my house?

157
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:16,227
I have a foal!

158
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:18,227
Forget it!

159
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:48,307
<b>Then there was a rumor that
there was peace in Finland -</b>

160
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:51,947
<b>and those who wanted to and
could were allowed to return. </b>

161
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:57,507
<b>Then the children wanted to go
home from the strange country. </b>

162
00:30:58,627 --> 00:31:01,587
Is Dad afraid of the Russkies?

163
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,467
There's a war on,
everybody's afraid.

164
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:35,108
"The strangers and their
guardians laughed and said:

165
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,268
<b>'Home? You dear,
innocent children, - </b>

166
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:45,188
do you know how far it is?
More than 100 leagues. '

167
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:50,788
'We don't care', the children
said, 'as long as we get home. '

168
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:55,148
'But you have a new home
here with us... "' -Mother.

169
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:02,868
Is Dad afraid of dying?

170
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:13,228
I guess, because then
he wouldn't see you anymore.

171
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,868
Are you afraid?

172
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,628
Eero!

173
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:22,788
You don't want
to stay here, right?

174
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:28,948
What? Say something!

175
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:32,508
You don't want to stay here!

176
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:40,428
Do you want to go home
to your mother?

177
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:44,028
I don't like you!
You are mean.

178
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:47,708
I don't want to be
on vacation anymore.

179
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,508
You should tell that
to you mother.

180
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:02,788
You don't like...

181
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:09,428
Mean... you can't
even pronounce it right.

182
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,628
Write that to your mother.
Go on!

183
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,149
You won't have to go to school
or feed the geese, either!

184
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:33,229
But you must
stay away from the beach!

185
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:08,469
The pig sty wall is rotten.
I need to buy some timber.

186
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:17,069
What are you doing?
- I don't understand any of this.

187
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:21,389
He's obnoxious, he's ungrateful.

188
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:26,469
He thinks this is a vacation.

189
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:30,309
Isn't it stupid?

190
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:33,189
The wall may not stand
another autumn storm.

191
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,989
I'll buy timber in Ystad.
- Sure, go ahead.

192
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:39,869
Do you have the
Aid Committee's adress?

193
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:43,829
I'm going to write a letter, too.

194
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:46,949
Are you alright, love?

195
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:52,309
What?
Of course I'm alright.

196
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,309
Why?

197
00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:03,989
Hjalmar Jönsson.
- Mrs. Grävnäs.

198
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:06,549
Welcome. Signe.

199
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:14,349
So, you want to get rid
of the child.

200
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,269
Well, I...

201
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:24,309
To tell you the truth... yes.

202
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:29,549
You've stated that there's
plenty of room for a child -

203
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,950
and that you
have an urge to help...

204
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,550
An urge...

205
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,870
Things don't always
turn out the way you had hoped.

206
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,190
I don't know,
maybe we haven't...

207
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,630
At least he doesn't
want to stay here.

208
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,550
It's not unusual that children
are troublesome first.

209
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,590
They don't always know
what's best for them.

210
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,110
What do you say,
Mr. Jönsson?

211
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,430
<b>Everything's new to the boy,
he's a refugee from the war - </b>

212
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,990
in a strange land,
among strange people.

213
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,150
That's exactly what I mean!

214
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,390
That's no reason to be running
out nights, stealing money...

215
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,070
How are we going
to keep an eye on him?

216
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,630
God knows what he'll do next!
- Signe...

217
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,750
But I can't take it anymore!

218
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,830
What I mean,
Mrs. Grävnäs, is that...

219
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,990
There's enough work with
the farm and my sick father...

220
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,230
<b>We can give him
food and accommodation, - </b>

221
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,230
but not against his will!

222
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,150
It is important to
the Committee -

223
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,030
that the parents like the child
and vice versa.

224
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,510
Thank God!

225
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,190
Then you'll take him?

226
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,350
<b>Go home! - Dear child,
how could you do that?</b>

227
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,110
Where would you go?
- Home. Mother's waiting.

228
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,670
Don't you know that your Mother
doesn't live there anymore?

229
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,510
Oh yes, I brought
a letter from Eero's mother.

230
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,470
Sending you to Finland
is out of the question.

231
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,950
Where would he go then?

232
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,430
I'm sure the Committee
will find a good solution.

233
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,590
There's room in the children's
homes. - Children's homes?

234
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,110
A children's home can't take
better care of him than we can.

235
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,990
So, shall I take him with me?

236
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,670
There you go.

237
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,630
Skane goose.
- Skane goose.

238
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,471
Can you say "scarecrow"?
- Scare crow.

239
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,831
No, scarecrow.

240
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,031
<b>So, he talks to you,
does he? - Yes. </b>

241
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:26,751
Good.

242
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:34,671
He doesn't say a word to me.
Except "Thank you" at the table.

243
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:41,031
Well, as long as he works
and eats... He's not complaining.

244
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:47,351
That's good.

245
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,191
You're the one who knows...

246
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:59,871
It is obvious you two
are getting along.

247
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:06,911
It'll be fine. The Committee
lady said so, too.

248
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:11,631
He's doing his best. Give him
time, don't be so hard on...

249
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:13,191
Hard?

250
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:20,311
It's not about giving time.

251
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,471
It's not about him!

252
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:27,711
I can't take this any more!

253
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:31,591
I'm just falling apart,
and you can't see a thing!

254
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,711
For heaven's sake, Signe...

255
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,031
You think
everything's alright.

256
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,791
Give Signe another kid,
and everything's fine.

257
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:54,231
But it isn't.

258
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:02,391
I don't know that kid.
I don't know who he is!

259
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:05,271
Just a stranger!

260
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:11,671
How could I be a good mother
to a child I don't want?

261
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,231
I couldn't even take care
of the one I had!

262
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:23,031
We've been through this before...
- No!

263
00:43:24,871 --> 00:43:28,631
No, we haven't.
We have not talked about it.

264
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:44,471
Don't just sit there
like a fool!

265
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,511
What are you staring at?
Talk to me!

266
00:43:53,712 --> 00:43:56,192
What do you expect me to do?

267
00:43:56,472 --> 00:44:01,032
Should I kneel and beg
for forgiveness? Is that it?

268
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:04,152
Should I vanish, too?

269
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:10,232
<b>Should I pretend everything's
fine just like you? - Shut up!</b>

270
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:16,032
Signe, you're the one
making him a stranger. It's you!

271
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:52,832
Got you some timber.
You're building like a real man!

272
00:44:56,512 --> 00:44:58,872
I guess your father
was a carpenter.

273
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:03,952
<b>You can sail a raft in the breeze,
but if there's a storm, - </b>

274
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:07,152
it'll bob up and down like
a piece of cork.

275
00:45:08,512 --> 00:45:11,432
I know the feeling.
Once you've been there...

276
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:15,792
I've sailed to
France and England.

277
00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:18,952
Let me show you...

278
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,112
That there is from Bordeaux.

279
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,392
The Bay of Biscay is rough
in a storm, wow!

280
00:45:33,552 --> 00:45:35,032
You get seasick.

281
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:40,432
I was on my way to America
once, but I met Mother Signe -

282
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:44,232
and my boots
got stuck in this dirt.

283
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,752
Did you and your dad
build things together?

284
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:57,912
I helped him fix the house.
- I can imagine.

285
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:00,552
The Russkies bombed it.

286
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:03,592
They bombed Dad, too.

287
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:10,512
I wanted to stay home,
I'm not afraid of the Russkies!

288
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:16,232
When the war's over,
you'll go home again.

289
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:19,592
I'll pack you
a sack full of food to go.

290
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:24,832
Let me know when
you're launching the raft.

291
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:32,552
Don't tell Signe.

292
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:38,392
Don't tell Signe.

293
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:53,032
"Dear Signe, -

294
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:57,592
I hope that you can manage
to take care of my son.

295
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:01,232
Someone's safe arms
is what he needs.

296
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:06,993
Since my husband died, I've
cried a lot and couldn't cope -

297
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:10,553
if I didn't know
that Eero is alright... "

298
00:47:12,753 --> 00:47:16,513
How dare she write this
to someone she doesn't know?

299
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:21,753
Pleading to my conscience?

300
00:47:21,953 --> 00:47:25,233
Isn't it enough that I have to
feel sorry for the kid?

301
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,193
Should I mourn for her, too?

302
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:32,553
She means well...
- Thanks. There's two of you...

303
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:35,633
That's good.

304
00:47:38,713 --> 00:47:40,313
God, I'm so tired.

305
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:56,593
What does the woman write?

306
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:58,553
She's left the house.

307
00:48:01,873 --> 00:48:06,033
She's working at
the German HQ in Helsinki.

308
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,913
She's rented a room.

309
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:16,073
She doesn't want Eero
to hear about that.

310
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:23,393
There! Shouldn't a mother
be honest with her own child?

311
00:48:26,913 --> 00:48:28,993
There's a letter for you, too!

312
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:34,313
<b>"My dear little son, - </b>

313
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:37,913
I'm so sad to hear
that you don't like it there.

314
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:42,473
Don't you think about me.
Think of how lucky you are -

315
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,953
to be able to play and
eat your fill every day.

316
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:51,553
<b>It'll take longer than I thought
until you get home, - </b>

317
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:55,273
so try to be a good boy.

318
00:48:56,553 --> 00:48:59,233
Remember, Mother
always loves you. "

319
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:01,553
Try to be a good boy.

320
00:49:02,513 --> 00:49:06,033
Behave and stay
near the farm.

321
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,913
It'll be a while
until you get home.

322
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:13,113
Think of what's
best for you.

323
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:17,193
I'm only thinking
of what's best for you.

324
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:20,073
Stay near the farm...

325
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:43,633
"These poor children who came
in such a poor state are now, -

326
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:47,233
thanks to the hospitality
of our Swedish families... "

327
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:50,033
Listen, it's about you.
- Shut up.

328
00:49:52,193 --> 00:49:56,473
"... regain the life and health
war-torn Finland couldn't give. "

329
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:01,633
<b>"These children are grateful
to their Swedish benefactors - </b>

330
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:04,873
for their sacrifices
in these times of hardship. "

331
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:07,233
Grateful, it says!

332
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:11,473
We're good to you,
but you're angry and boring!

333
00:50:12,073 --> 00:50:14,714
They could've sent us
someone nice.

334
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:25,914
Wait!

335
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:30,234
I know something
I mustn't tell you!

336
00:50:59,954 --> 00:51:02,674
Look at this nice dress.
It was for you.

337
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:08,194
What's this?

338
00:51:09,474 --> 00:51:11,354
What are you
doing in here?

339
00:51:12,954 --> 00:51:15,754
At home you can do
as you please, but not here.

340
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:25,474
You've no business being here.
This isn't your home!

341
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,675
Supper time.

342
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:13,715
The letter that came
was from your mother.

343
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,395
She sent you her love.

344
00:54:32,795 --> 00:54:34,275
To Mother.

345
00:54:44,755 --> 00:54:45,915
How nice.

346
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:51,075
What did you write?

347
00:54:52,795 --> 00:54:55,355
<b>I can help Daddy Hjalmar
with the geese, - </b>

348
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:59,075
Aunt Signe cooks good food,
and I like it here.

349
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:04,275
You can go to Siv later, after...

350
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:44,155
You're making
the Finn boy work?

351
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:47,155
You get off
the shitty work.

352
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:52,835
Want to help
all the Finnish war children?

353
00:55:56,915 --> 00:56:00,875
Lt'll be Christmas soon.
Will you let the boy rest then?

354
00:56:40,836 --> 00:56:43,676
I'll check the electricity.
- With the geese

355
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,716
Not now! Sit down!

356
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:56,316
That's the phone now.

357
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:06,596
Hello?

358
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:11,716
Yes, it's me.

359
00:57:14,636 --> 00:57:16,196
Yes, he is.

360
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:19,476
Merry Christmas to you, too.

361
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:22,596
Eero, it's for you.

362
00:57:24,596 --> 00:57:26,196
Come on, hurry up.

363
00:57:30,996 --> 00:57:32,356
Hurry up now.

364
00:57:34,756 --> 00:57:37,436
<b>Eero, darling.
It's Mother. - Mother!</b>

365
00:57:37,756 --> 00:57:40,596
<b>I miss you so much.
Is everything alright?</b>

366
00:57:40,716 --> 00:57:43,396
<b>Merry Christmas!
Get any nice presents?</b>

367
00:57:43,516 --> 00:57:45,596
Mother! Are you coming here?

368
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:49,036
<b>I can't talk any longer, I'm at
HQ, but everything's fine. </b>

369
00:57:49,516 --> 00:57:53,076
<b>They say peace will soon come,
and then you can come home. </b>

370
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:54,716
<b>I'll see you soon!</b>

371
00:57:57,236 --> 00:58:00,556
Mother! Mother?

372
00:58:33,836 --> 00:58:37,516
Roll up your sleeves, like this.
- What?

373
00:58:38,236 --> 00:58:39,996
Whatwhat?

374
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:44,756
And now...
Whatwhat?

375
00:59:02,996 --> 00:59:05,596
The Russians
have bombed Helsinki!

376
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:09,196
The Russians
have bombed Helsinki!

377
00:59:40,796 --> 00:59:44,316
<b>The city was badly damaged...
- What are they saying?</b>

378
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:48,237
<b>... explosions and fires.
Windows were shattered... </b>

379
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:52,317
<b>What are they saying? - The
Russkies bombed everything. </b>

380
00:59:54,277 --> 00:59:55,957
All of Helsinki?

381
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:01,397
Have the Russkies
invaded Finland?

382
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:04,997
<b>The main reason
to the loss of human lives -</b>

383
01:00:05,117 --> 01:00:08,677
<b>was that people didn't seek
shelter. The wounded and dead... </b>

384
01:00:08,957 --> 01:00:10,317
Mother...

385
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,477
It's alright.

386
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:36,317
Mother...

387
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:38,917
What is this?

388
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:43,597
What would your mother
have said if you'd drowned?

389
01:01:44,957 --> 01:01:46,917
How could she survive that?

390
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,557
God almighty!
Sailing to Finland!

391
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:55,797
Have you gone
completely insane?

392
01:02:00,597 --> 01:02:02,957
I don't want Mother to die.

393
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:10,357
You did survive,
but I wasn't important to you.

394
01:02:11,997 --> 01:02:15,877
Do you want me to have
a guilty conscience again?

395
01:02:15,957 --> 01:02:18,877
No, Mother!
That's exactly what I don't want!

396
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:21,757
Why didn't you
ever talk about it?

397
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:24,997
<b>Often I tried,
but you didn't listen. - Not true. </b>

398
01:02:25,157 --> 01:02:28,037
I would've listened,
I'm your Mother...

399
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:31,037
You just wanted
everything to be alright.

400
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:33,997
<b>That's what you wrote me, - </b>

401
01:02:34,797 --> 01:02:37,917
and I never knew
how you were doing.

402
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:42,077
You were only a child,
you must understand that.

403
01:02:42,397 --> 01:02:45,037
I couldn't burden you
with my worries.

404
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:52,557
Why didn't you talk
when you came home?

405
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:56,398
To you?
- Who else?

406
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:08,278
Don't you understand? You
weren't my Mother anymore.

407
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:15,478
Give me back my bike!
It's not fun!

408
01:03:17,558 --> 01:03:18,878
Give it to me!

409
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:22,398
It's not fun, stop!

410
01:03:45,758 --> 01:03:47,078
Thank you.

411
01:04:22,638 --> 01:04:24,518
Is this your mother?

412
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:29,718
She's so pretty.
- Signe!

413
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:52,878
Stop running after me!
Go somewhere and play.

414
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,718
Show me the letter.
I want to know.

415
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:32,078
Goddamn!

416
01:05:34,758 --> 01:05:37,118
Eero, stop.
It's not fun!

417
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:40,598
Stop! Leave them alone!

418
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:44,078
Stop! Get out!

419
01:05:44,718 --> 01:05:47,118
What is this? Get out!

420
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:52,478
Stand still,
so I can talk to you!

421
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:57,158
What are you doing?

422
01:05:57,238 --> 01:05:58,838
Don't yell at me!

423
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:57,119
<b>We know now Russia will win,
and that fills us with fear. </b>

424
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,319
<b>Hans-Jürgen, a peaceful man
and no warrior, -</b>

425
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:04,639
<b>is returning to Germany
and asked me to join him, -</b>

426
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,039
<b>and if it wasn't for Eero,
I'd immediately say yes. </b>

427
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:13,399
<b>Taking Eero there would be
selfish and wrong, -</b>

428
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:17,559
<b>as Germany is the least
safe place now. </b>

429
01:08:18,639 --> 01:08:21,319
<b>If I deny my love
and stay here, -</b>

430
01:08:21,999 --> 01:08:25,919
<b>I'm afraid I'll lose all hope. Does
it make me a better mother?</b>

431
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:30,799
<b>Maybe it was meant to be
that my dear son came to you -</b>

432
01:08:30,879 --> 01:08:33,999
<b>who can give him
all the love he needs. </b>

433
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:39,719
<b>That's why I'm asking you,
with grief in my heart, -</b>

434
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,079
<b>if Eero could stay with you. </b>

435
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:51,319
<b>Please, think about it,
but don't tell Eero yet, -</b>

436
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:55,439
<b>just give him my love
and say everything is alright. </b>

437
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,280
Eero! Come!

438
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,320
We have been talking, -

439
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,640
and there's something
we want to tell you.

440
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,080
Let's take a walk,
you and me.

441
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,320
We had a little girl,
Hjalmar and me.

442
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,880
Her name was Elin.

443
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,400
Elin was so...

444
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,800
<b>... full of life.
"Like Signe", they used to say, - </b>

445
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,240
"they're two of a kind,
always happy. "

446
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,080
Elin, she... drowned.

447
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,720
She was only six.

448
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,760
<b>Some said it was God's will, - </b>

449
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,760
but it was my fault.

450
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,120
You see,
Elin loved to swim.

451
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,880
She ran so fast, so fast -

452
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,680
that she could hardly strip
before she jumped in.

453
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,760
She wasn't allowed to go
if the wind was too strong.

454
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,800
I used to say to her: "Elin, don't
go if the wind's too strong. "

455
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,880
Then there was a storm.

456
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:31,441
Two years ago.

457
01:12:32,841 --> 01:12:35,481
Elin wanted to go see.

458
01:12:41,321 --> 01:12:43,041
I said I was busy.

459
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:47,881
<b>She kept asking and asking, - </b>

460
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:54,521
and finally I let her go alone.

461
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:05,241
How could I have been
so stupid?

462
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:09,641
My Dad's dead, too.

463
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:17,921
Why do people die? Why do
people change all the time?

464
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,841
If you're here, you're here,
I think.

465
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:28,721
The Lord gives
and the Lord takes away.

466
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:33,801
You see, life doesn't always
turn out the way you wanted.

467
01:13:35,681 --> 01:13:40,881
We don't always understand
why we do the things we do.

468
01:13:45,641 --> 01:13:47,121
Like your mother.

469
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:55,481
Remember the day when you
first came here on the bus?

470
01:13:59,241 --> 01:14:01,961
<b>I was hoping to get
a little girl, - </b>

471
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,201
as if that were easier.

472
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:10,161
Then you came.

473
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:14,161
I didn't want you.

474
01:14:24,441 --> 01:14:26,241
<b>The Lord takes away, - </b>

475
01:14:28,081 --> 01:14:29,881
but He also gives.

476
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:05,081
We'll hang
your clothes here then.

477
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,441
Come here.

478
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:07,642
Sir, a little closer
to your wife, please.

479
01:16:08,682 --> 01:16:09,962
Great.

480
01:16:13,242 --> 01:16:15,842
Take your hand
off her shoulder, please.

481
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:25,002
Smile, please.
It's not a funeral.

482
01:17:22,402 --> 01:17:23,682
Here he comes!

483
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:25,842
Look at me.

484
01:17:27,402 --> 01:17:28,962
Close your eyes.

485
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:30,362
Don't look.

486
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:39,642
Now!

487
01:17:45,722 --> 01:17:47,642
<b>We thought
you needed one, - </b>

488
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:50,562
so you'll be home faster
when you've been gone.

489
01:18:02,882 --> 01:18:04,282
<b>"Dear Kirsti, - </b>

490
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:08,722
we have thought about your
proposition about Eero's life.

491
01:18:10,162 --> 01:18:13,682
If your love to the German
is that strong, -

492
01:18:15,282 --> 01:18:17,082
I wish you all the best.

493
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:22,442
I guarantee you that the boy
is like our own now.

494
01:18:24,002 --> 01:18:27,442
<b>Surely, I'm not a better mother
than you would be, - </b>

495
01:18:29,242 --> 01:18:32,762
but I'll do my best to be
the best of mothers. "

496
01:18:43,322 --> 01:18:46,402
<b>To agree to this
Finnish proposition -</b>

497
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,763
<b>seems to be in the interests
of Germany, as well. </b>

498
01:18:51,403 --> 01:18:54,523
<b>If the Germans were to comply, -</b>

499
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:59,403
<b>we'd always remember them
as our brothers in arms... </b>

500
01:19:01,323 --> 01:19:04,123
<b>Those damn Germans
will stay put... - Quiet!</b>

501
01:19:05,723 --> 01:19:08,923
The Russkies will take
the whole country. - Quiet!

502
01:19:10,643 --> 01:19:13,763
<b>Citizens! We have taken
the first steps in order -</b>

503
01:19:13,843 --> 01:19:17,763
<b>to regain peaceful relations with
our great eastern neighbor. </b>

504
01:19:18,283 --> 01:19:20,163
<b>It's a step towards... </b>

505
01:19:20,243 --> 01:19:24,243
<b>We'll have to pack you lots
of food, anyway. - Pack?</b>

506
01:19:24,683 --> 01:19:26,723
Your halcyon days are over.

507
01:19:27,603 --> 01:19:29,283
Stop! Don't say that.

508
01:19:29,883 --> 01:19:32,523
<b>No- one's said
anything like that. </b>

509
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:36,603
Isn't Eero going back
like all the war children?

510
01:19:40,123 --> 01:19:42,403
I guess it's true what they say...

511
01:19:45,203 --> 01:19:48,043
Children should be
where their home is.

512
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:03,363
I thought Hjalmar liked me.

513
01:20:05,243 --> 01:20:08,043
Oh, he does, a lot.

514
01:20:11,803 --> 01:20:16,003
He wants to do
everything by the book.

515
01:20:17,523 --> 01:20:21,483
<b>Does the book say I have to
go home? - Only those who can. </b>

516
01:20:22,843 --> 01:20:24,283
And I can't?

517
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:29,923
Go to sleep.

518
01:20:32,323 --> 01:20:34,003
School in the morning.

519
01:21:02,243 --> 01:21:05,043
Hjalmar said he would've
gone to America, -

520
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,603
but his boots got stuck
in your dirt.

521
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,403
He said that?

522
01:21:19,203 --> 01:21:20,443
Nonsense.

523
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:24,283
I want to do that, too.

524
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:34,443
You'll stay here
with me and Hjalmar.

525
01:21:36,403 --> 01:21:39,403
<b>No- one's going
to take you away from us. </b>

526
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:43,163
<b>Never? - Never. </b>

527
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:46,723
I promise.

528
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:50,923
But don't tell Hjalmar.

529
01:23:20,844 --> 01:23:22,404
Have you explained?

530
01:23:27,324 --> 01:23:28,644
Explained?

531
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:32,244
What's there to explain?

532
01:23:35,564 --> 01:23:37,484
That the German left her, -

533
01:23:38,804 --> 01:23:40,604
and now it's alright -

534
01:23:42,924 --> 01:23:46,924
for her to have her kid back.
Is that what I must explain?

535
01:23:52,684 --> 01:23:53,884
<b>Good Lord, - </b>

536
01:23:56,924 --> 01:23:59,484
we don't even know
if she is in Helsinki!

537
01:24:02,004 --> 01:24:04,164
You're being unfair.
- Unfair?

538
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:09,884
Am I being unfair?

539
01:24:11,404 --> 01:24:12,924
What's fair, then?

540
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:16,684
That she'll be forgiven
and be called a mother, -

541
01:24:17,004 --> 01:24:19,924
a woman who voluntarily
gives away her child?

542
01:24:20,324 --> 01:24:23,324
And I'll just gratefully take it?

543
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:30,044
First, I lose a child,
then I lose another child.

544
01:24:31,004 --> 01:24:32,084
Is that fair?

545
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:38,844
We can't help it.
- I'm not going to do it.

546
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,164
I am not going to...

547
01:24:49,324 --> 01:24:50,884
give back our child.

548
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:54,124
He's not our child.
Don't make him believe that.

549
01:24:55,444 --> 01:24:59,564
I'm very good for him,
he needs me!

550
01:25:04,004 --> 01:25:06,884
What if Elin were away
and couldn't come back?

551
01:25:19,685 --> 01:25:20,845
Elin...

552
01:25:25,005 --> 01:25:29,725
Hjalmar, please,
Elin doesn't exist.

553
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:34,165
She's not coming back to us.

554
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:37,925
Elin's never ever coming back...

555
01:27:17,685 --> 01:27:19,725
You have to go now, Eero.

556
01:28:09,605 --> 01:28:11,485
Mother! Mother Signe!

557
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:17,445
Mother Signe!

558
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:55,526
Let go of me! No!

559
01:31:06,126 --> 01:31:07,206
Eero!

560
01:31:10,846 --> 01:31:14,086
My dear little Eero,
how you've grown!

561
01:31:26,406 --> 01:31:28,006
How was your trip?

562
01:31:37,047 --> 01:31:38,167
Let's go home.

563
01:31:59,407 --> 01:32:02,127
They called me again
to come to the office.

564
01:32:04,207 --> 01:32:06,047
I'm sure I'll get the job.

565
01:32:08,407 --> 01:32:09,807
Don't you think?

566
01:32:24,887 --> 01:32:26,967
Does a Kirsti Lahti live here?

567

Sender: Signe Jönsson
Sweden

568
01:32:37,607 --> 01:32:38,847
No.

569
01:32:40,287 --> 01:32:42,007
Are you sure?

570
01:32:58,847 --> 01:33:00,167
Who was it?

571
01:33:15,047 --> 01:33:16,207
Eero...

572
01:33:18,367 --> 01:33:20,327
All the bad things are over.

573
01:33:26,687 --> 01:33:28,487
Mother's here with you.

574
01:33:31,727 --> 01:33:34,207
I could never believe
what you said.

575
01:33:35,487 --> 01:33:39,087
I thought you'd disappear
at any moment.

576
01:33:41,887 --> 01:33:43,487
<b>I felt - </b>

577
01:33:45,207 --> 01:33:47,247
I could lose everything -

579
01:33:57,047 --> 01:34:01,007
<b>This, or these - </b>

580
01:34:03,767 --> 01:34:05,487
Signe wanted to give me.

581
01:34:11,927 --> 01:34:14,647
<b>She'd always hoped
I'd get them. </b>

582
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:17,567
<b>Or we. </b>

583
01:34:19,407 --> 01:34:21,967
<b>They came with
the funeral invitation. </b>

584
01:34:22,887 --> 01:34:24,607
<b>I couldn't open them... </b>

585
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:28,967
<b>Until I got there. </b>

586
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:53,248
"Dear Kirsti. Life on the farm
is empty without Eero.

587
01:34:54,048 --> 01:34:57,808
Sending him away was hard, and
I damned you for you decision.

588
01:35:03,328 --> 01:35:06,648
To tell you the truth,
I didn't believe you loved him.

589
01:35:09,488 --> 01:35:13,168
Eero never knew
that you wanted him back.

590
01:35:15,808 --> 01:35:18,328
I realize now that
this was wrong of me.

591
01:35:19,248 --> 01:35:24,488
Please, Kirsti, let him read
this letter, so he will know.

592
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:29,248
He must know. Signe. "

593
01:35:52,848 --> 01:35:54,288
"Dear Signe.

594
01:35:54,888 --> 01:35:58,608
There's peace now in Finland,

How could I even consider
leaving my own child?

guilt for the rest of my life.
