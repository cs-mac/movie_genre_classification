1
00:00:58,544 --> 00:00:59,591
Order up!

2
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,796
Where my greens at?

3
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,347
Two more drinks
for table six.

4
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:03,675
Got it.

5
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:13,480
- She got fired.
- What'd she do this time?

6
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,436
Well, she was washing dishes
in the kitchen,

7
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,520
but then she told the manager

8
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:17,729
- she wanted to be a wait...
- Dona?

9
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:21,992
- Roger.
- Hey, how long you been back?

10
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,948
A couple days.

11
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,162
You look good all changed up.

12
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:27,239
Thanks.

13
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,742
How you making it?

14
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:31,042
Yeah, I'm doing all right.

15
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:33,879
I know your folks
glad to have you back.

16
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,130
Yeah, they are.

17
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:38,300
Son, can we get our food today?

18
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:40,965
It's really good seeing you.

19
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:42,629
You, too.

20
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:47,384
He's sweet.

21
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:51,229
Always was.
Why'd you break up with him?

22
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:52,807
Had things I wanted to do.

23
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,730
Besides, I got a man.

24
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,811
Now, you see how
he taking care of me.

25
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:00,739
- He must be rich.
- He ain't starving, that's for sure.

26
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,532
- Pssh.
- You guys want a refill?

27
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:03,700
Oh, yes, thank you.

28
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,115
Y'all should come back with me.

29
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:08,914
And be a model like you?
You dreaming.

30
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,912
Maybe you ain't dreaming enough.

31
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:14,245
I ain't even know I was alive
till I went up there.

32
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:15,955
I'm a country girl
through and through.

33
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:18,378
Plus, I like eating too much.

34
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:20,926
I heard that
them New York models

35
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,129
got to have sex with whoever's
doing the hiring.

36
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:25,885
- That's true?
- Not if you don't want to.

37
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,216
What about you?

38
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,310
I do what I want, when I want.

39
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:33,393
You come back with me,
you see how it can work.

40
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:40,320
So, did you hear
about Leon Davidson?

41
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:41,901
He wrecked his daddy's Mustang.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,197
Drove it right into a ditch.

43
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,570
What? Does Nancy know?

44
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,119
No, girl, I heard
he was with some other girl

45
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:48,867
he met down in Charlotte.

46
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,998
- Oh, my God, Nancy know?
- Where you going?

47
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,454
- Outside for a little.
- So, did Nancy find out?

48
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh, yeah, she is mad at him.

49
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,143
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,601
Pretty day.

51
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,485
I guess.

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,323
I heard you talking back there.

53
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:26,821
You a model?

54
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:32,080
Yeah.

55
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,120
In New York.

56
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,619
New York City?

57
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:40,793
Damn.

58
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,393
Yeah.

59
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,316
Okay.

60
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:39,791
Been a while, huh?

61
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:44,375
- Feel 10 pounds lighter.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

62
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,259
All right, G. l. Joe, up and out.

63
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,961
I need the room.

64
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:06,019
Mmm, no, I'm not a whoremaster.

65
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,071
Nobody said you were,
but, Vince, come on.

66
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:12,446
This guy is offering to set us up
with another business!

67
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:14,367
- Am I right?
- Us?

68
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:17,617
Whether thou goest...
Wait, is it whether or whither?

69
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:19,369
What the fuck do I know
about a massage parlor?

70
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:21,416
So you'll learn.

71
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:22,743
Or, shit, I'll learn.

72
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,624
All right? I'll be the pussy hound.

73
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:27,172
All you gotta do
is say yes to Rudy.

74
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:28,965
It'll be clean work for you.

75
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,965
- Clean work.
- Hey, do you mind?

76
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:33,671
You should've stayed put at Kim's.

77
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,509
Once you start saying yes
to these guys...

78
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,968
I can say no to Rudy on this.
And I'm gonna.

79
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,894
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
little brother, come on.

80
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,596
Just slow down, here.
Let's talk about it.

81
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,931
I got a question for you.

82
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,350
What, you got an opinion
on this, too?

83
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:50,358
Korean entree. Bi bim blank.

84
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:54,985
Bap. It's bim bup... Bap.
It's bap.

85
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,990
- Bap?
- B-A-P.

86
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,079
In like Flynn. All right.

87
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,908
I got enough on my hands
with this here.

88
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,993
Which reminds me. Hey.

89
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,875
You put us
into the bar guides yet?

90
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:08,580
- Thanks.
- Yeah, we're in.

91
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:12,005
The gay one, too?
What's it called? Michael's Stick?

92
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:14,753
Michael's Thing.

93
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:15,837
Whatever.

94
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,470
You know, it might help
if we place a few ads, too.

95
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:19,595
I checked the rates.

96
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,176
They're not bad for a half-page.

97
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,136
Okay, draw something up.

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,938
- Me?
- Yeah.

99
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,732
- I can't draw.
- I thought all you guys were artistic.

100
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,143
I'll do it.

101
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,029
You got the time?

102
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:35,364
I'll fit it in my schedule.

103
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,027
I know a few of the women now.

104
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,953
They get a little hinky
when their pimps are around,

105
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,156
but if you catch them alone,
they talk.

106
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,661
After that,
I wanna talk to the pimps.

107
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,334
Also alone,
run interviews side by side.

108
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,038
He says, she says.
Contrast and compare.

109
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:52,000
Black pimps misusing white girls
from wherever?

110
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:55,336
I can deliver near as many black women
being pimped as white.

111
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,969
Sandra, all we're doing
is reinforcing the stereotypes,

112
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,392
just like those goddamn ghetto flicks
out there now.

113
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,185
Everybody cheering
for the pusherman.

114
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,355
I'm giving you life as lived.

115
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,852
We have Les Matthews for that.

116
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,858
He's got the street stuff covered.

117
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,603
And his copy reads smooth.

118
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,864
But this, it's not news.

119
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,695
- It's not for us.
- Oh, right. Uplift only.

120
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:25,665
Sorry.

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,294
We stand up for our own, Sandra.

122
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:32,831
At least let me write something longer

123
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:34,587
and show it to you.

124
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:41,423
- He's gonna notice money's missing.
- Don't worry about that.

125
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,429
- But how much do I take?
- Just don't give him all of it.

126
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,885
Well, how much?

127
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,066
Excuse me.

128
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:54,315
Hey. What are you doing
hanging around here?

129
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,487
Waiting for somebody.

130
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:01,196
I'm flattered, but I'm not gonna get
out of here for hours.

131
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:03,662
Somebody else.

132
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:07,620
Mystery date?

133
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,285
Mystery to you, maybe.

134
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,088
Hey, what can I get you?

135
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:16,421
I'm looking for Abby.
She works here.

136
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,047
Uh-huh. Abby.

137
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:19,586
Hey, Evan.

138
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,596
Is that it?

139
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,764
That's him.

140
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,137
That's what I said.

141
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,855
Okay. See you later.

142
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,816
I got your camera back from Darryl.

143
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,814
Cool. I've been missing it.

144
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:43,735
Keep it for me.

145
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:49,745
Hey, you two kids
have a swell time, okay?

146
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,911
Hey.

147
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:55,164
Think he's good-looking?

148
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:56,964
He's not my type.

149
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,588
Yeah, well, pretend you're her.

150
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,511
He's nothing special.

151
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,927
Yeah, exactly.

152
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,135
Oh, Jesus, Eileen.

153
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:12,514
Let me... Let me do it.

154
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:16,602
Oh. Like that?

155
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,484
Yeah. Yes, just like that.

156
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,191
- Yeah.
- Oh.

157
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:23,526
Oh.

158
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:31,242
Oh, Oh! Oh.

159
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,872
Oh.

160
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,734
Did you come?

161
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:16,457
- I don't think I'm quite ready.
- Sure, you are.

162
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:19,335
No, I'm not.
Eileen, seriously, I'm not.

163
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,742
So, did you come that time?

164
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,093
I told you three.

165
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,670
You told me three last night.

166
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,300
Every night three.

167
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:51,760
Till Darlene gets back, the two of you

168
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,467
are gonna have to start
making up for the losses.

169
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:54,843
Where the hell is Darlene, anyway?

170
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:57,179
You do not need to concern yourself
with where Darlene at.

171
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:58,605
She on a mission for me.

172
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,852
Hell, send me on a mission.

173
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,603
- Oh, you gonna start bitching, too?
- $400.

174
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:05,983
Can we put that toward tomorrow?

175
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,444
Hey, that's what
I'm talking about.

176
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,150
You start busting it like that,

177
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,406
you could take a whole snow day.

178
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,364
I'll make it up tomorrow.

179
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,326
Come on, Larry.

180
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:21,829
My feet are killing me.

181
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,925
You in pain?

182
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,217
Then you should learn
to walk on your hands, bitch.

183
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:35,676
What you honking at?

184
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,976
Shut up!

185
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:42,690
I never said that.

186
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:45,856
That was different.

187
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,731
For you, maybe.

188
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:54,945
Yeah. I guess for me, yeah.

189
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,290
All's well that ends well, right?

190
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:02,994
You're different.

191
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,172
How so?

192
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,470
Well, I meant that
as a compliment.

193
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:14,923
Okay.

194
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:19,060
But how did you mean it?

195
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:22,388
As a good thing.

196
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,103
Good how?

197
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:29,062
I'm fucking with you, Jack.

198
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,070
Jesus.

199
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:41,366
Listen, what are you doing
Saturday night?

200
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,081
My boss is having
a get-together at his place,

201
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,833
hors d'oeuvres, cocktails.

202
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,967
Come on, it'll be fun.

203
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:55,050
Gotta see how my week's going.

204
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:58,383
Where are you going?

205
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:02,391
I got an early morning tomorrow.

206
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:06,983
Oh, okay, well, maybe next time,
we'll stay at your place.

207
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:11,529
It'd be nice to sleep in the same bed
and have some breakfast.

208
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:14,816
Yeah.

209
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,069
But now I gotta go.

210
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:21,031
Oh, um, at least
let me get you a cab.

211
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,866
- No, no, I got money.
- No, really.

212
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,385
Such a gentleman.

213
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:40,092
I graduate and I'm looking at
a bad number.

214
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,471
- Really bad.
- Party's a bummer.

215
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:42,848
We should find a movie.

216
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,895
- How bad?
- 74.

217
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,144
No way I stay clear of the draft board
with a number that low.

218
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,851
- You seen that book they got, 4-F?
- Yeah, read every page.

219
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:53,108
Shit, I'm hoping McGovern can get in
and end the fucking war.

220
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,274
Me, too.
So, why the army jacket?

221
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:57,984
Irony.

222
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:01,746
- Everybody wears them.
- Everybody's ironic, huh?

223
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:04,495
I was thinking of going for
a creative writing master's next year,

224
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:06,417
but when I told
my father, he said,

225
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,620
"Anybody who'd write a poem
would suck a dick."

226
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,044
You should look into the copyrighting
program at the B school.

227
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,716
This way, you get to write
and get paid for it.

228
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,419
How about you, Abs?
When are you coming back to school?

229
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:18,049
You're a barmaid, right?

230
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:19,847
Hey, if I stick with it,

231
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:21,925
a year from now,
I'll get promoted to mermaid.

232
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:28,398
Seriously, I...
I don't see what the big deal is.

233
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:31,477
<i>So, Play Misty for Me
or Straw Dogs?</i>

234
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,606
Show of hands.

235
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:35,154
So, my theory is with fucking,

236
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,573
the men are always
wanting more, more, more, more, right?

237
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,244
And the women are like, "More?
You fucking kidding me?"

238
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,037
So, when it comes to frequency,

239
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:45,581
lesbians, both being women,

240
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:47,079
they do it the least, right?

241
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:48,284
So, they get the bronze.

242
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:50,587
Straights, one of each now,

243
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,039
it's "Push me, pull you."

244
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,503
But still, it's worth a silver.

245
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,004
But with you people,

246
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,719
it's all dick all the time, right?

247
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:00,092
No one gets a headache.

248
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,344
Just dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

249
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:05,472
I mean, you're like
the fucking East German track team.

250
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,803
You get a gold fucking medal

251
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,729
every time you hear the gun go off.

252
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:10,356
It's a little more complicated
than that.

253
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:11,648
Yeah, bullshit.

254
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,523
But you wanna know
why I'm not gay?

255
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:18,277
Not enough holes.

256
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:20,153
Mr. Martimo.

257
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,906
- Vincent.
- The usual?

258
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,117
Yeah, a short one.

259
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:30,331
And the courtesy
of your reply to my employer.

260
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:33,751
Well, I appreciate
the faith you put in me,

261
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,457
even making the offer.

262
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,833
But?

263
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:39,298
I thought about it.

264
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:43,215
I did, Tommy,
and it's not for me.

265
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:45,425
Look, everything they go through...

266
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,519
I got a lot of respect
for those girls.

267
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:51,272
But running them?
A parlor?

268
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:54,851
I don't know the first thing about it,
and I don't want to.

269
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:57,694
Hmm.

270
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:01,657
Are you telling me
I can't say no to Rudy Pipilo?

271
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,201
Of course you can.

272
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:07,701
It's, uh... It's an opportunity
he's offering, is all.

273
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:09,908
If you wanna pass, you pass.

274
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,995
All right, well, just tell him
I'm putting everything I have

275
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,205
into building up this joint for him.

276
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,006
- All right?
- He'll hear that.

277
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,010
All right, we'll see ya, Vince.

278
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,027
What?

279
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:42,357
And he's got the world
so ordered in his Nixon brain.

280
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,693
He loses his mind if someone new
parks in the driveway.

281
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:46,619
Shit, we missed the nine o'clock's,

282
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:48,367
but we can still make
a late show, though.

283
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,698
<i>Misty is 11:20.</i>

284
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,624
No, but they're all on that
fucked up frequency, though.

285
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,167
I had to throw
everything I had at my father

286
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:54,744
just to get him
to back down from law school.

287
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,249
<i>Straw Dogs, 11:40.</i>

288
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,797
I gotta go.

289
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,505
What, you don't
wanna come see the movie?

290
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:03,086
Nope.

291
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:08,682
Hey.

292
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:10,809
You Okay?

293
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:13,813
You should go back in.

294
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:21,946
Thanks for my camera.

295
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:30,997
Surrender or die!

296
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:36,119
Die, die,
you Amerikaner "schwine"!

297
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey, I told you to cut that shit.

298
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,752
Not in the goddamn house.

299
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:41,958
I'm trying to think here.

300
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,219
Come... Come on, Joey!

301
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:46,466
Take it upstairs.

302
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,724
Christ, go drive
your mom nuts for a while, all right?

303
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:52,928
Die, die!

304
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,018
Surrender or die.

305
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:03,605
I die for "zhe" fatherland.

306
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:04,940
Turn around.

307
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:07,821
Hey, Frankie, over here!

308
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,243
This is what you bring back?

309
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:15,283
How old are you?

310
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:17,869
- Twenty.
- "Twenty."

311
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,498
Twenty going on 16.
God damn it, Darlene!

312
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:25,005
I told you to bring back somebody
who was street ready,

313
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,631
not this chocolate Gidget

314
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,634
gonna get me sent to Rikers.

315
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:30,260
Put her back on the bus.

316
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:35,182
Look, she here, Larry.
She need a job.

317
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,138
Then drop her ass off
at the McDonald's

318
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,644
or the Calico Kitchen
or Childs.

319
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,650
But now that I think about it,

320
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:44,275
Childs is the right place
for this one right here.

321
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:05,254
"Street ready"?

322
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,257
- I can explain.
- I get it.

323
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,969
I'll tell you one thing, though.

324
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,764
I ain't finna get back
on that bus.

325
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,204
You like the movie?

326
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,174
Want some company?

327
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,160
- Give me the third one.
- Okay.

328
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:15,737
With wheat toast. Thank you.

329
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:23,252
Two eggs over easy,
bacon, and wheat toast.

330
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:30,377
So, you ever done
any real modeling?

331
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,048
You gonna eat them fries?

332
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:37,425
Come on, mama,
let's get it going, sweetheart.

333
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:39,681
Three eggs scrambled,
ham, home fries...

334
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,937
- Hey.
- In the van, sweet pea.

335
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:47,564
- Whoa, on what charge?
- Hey, come on.

336
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,817
- Soliciting.
- Who did I solicit?

337
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:52,865
- My partner here.
- This is total crap, guys.

338
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:55,235
Be that as it may,
get your faggot ass in the van.

339
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,578
Let's go, let's go.

340
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:01,282
You, too, get in there.

341
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,911
Make room.

342
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,208
I mean, it's gonna
get done, right?

343
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:09,757
Them guineas are gonna do it
whether or not we say.

344
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,584
I already said no.

345
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,131
You were there, you heard.

346
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,678
You can't change your mind?

347
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,553
Let me get this straight,

348
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:21,093
you, with all the seniority
in the world,

349
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:23,271
union card since you were 18,

350
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,268
married to my sister,

351
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,312
fucking rug rats
all over the house,

352
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:29,644
Mr. Bay Ridge himself,

353
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,568
you're gonna run whores
for the fucking wise guys?

354
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,822
You fucking hate
those guys, remember?

355
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,324
They beat one of your people
last month.

356
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:43,124
Fucking tore into me
like my name was Gambino or something.

357
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,167
Now you're gonna work
for them?

358
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,753
Doing this?
Give me a fucking break.

359
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,668
I go back to a job site,

360
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:53,251
doctors say I'll stroke out
within a year.

361
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:56,508
That's what they say.

362
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,468
I need money, Vince.

363
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,731
You're not doing this so you can
go pussy hound on me, right?

364
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:09,229
I mean, my sister finds out...

365
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,525
Fuck you think of me, Vince?

366
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:12,274
I wouldn't poke those girls
with your dick.

367
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:14,902
But if it's true what they're saying,

368
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,402
that the whole thing's
fixed with the city?

369
00:24:16,482 --> 00:24:18,234
Yeah. Which might be bullshit.

370
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:20,945
If it's true, then this could be
a lot of fucking money.

371
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:24,206
And I understand
how you feel about running whores,

372
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:28,036
but me, I look on it
like if it's me,

373
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,666
I'm gonna be better
than some asshole

374
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,213
who ain't even gonna try to be fair.

375
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,508
I mean, I've been a supervisor, right?

376
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,757
I made shop steward at 26.

377
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:38,759
You gonna rep these girls, Bobby?

378
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:41,466
What are you gonna do,
get them to work the contract?

379
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:43,350
Time-and-a-half on weekends?

380
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,272
Come on, Vince.

381
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:55,988
You'll see the money's right
and front to Rudy and them,

382
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,816
but I'll take care
of everything else.

383
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,156
I will.

384
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,411
I will.

385
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,907
Fuck you.

386
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:12,087
She said she's 20.

387
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:15,041
Looked like jailbait.

388
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,926
Fifteen would not surprise me.

389
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:21,632
Fake ID, homeslice.
Ain't no thing.

390
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:25,264
Maybe. All the same,
I don't need another child to support.

391
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:27,015
Start calling you Charlie Brown.

392
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:30,310
- Good grief, motherfucker.
- Plus, she's gonna be a lot of work.

393
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,775
I mean, like,
from the ground up type work.

394
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,857
Shit, I'll take her off your hands.

395
00:25:38,564 --> 00:25:41,534
You want her, you buy her.

396
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:43,527
She a looker?

397
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:46,663
Eye of the beholder.

398
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,493
Bring her to Leon's.

399
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:55,332
I like what I see,
I'll throw you 2K

400
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,291
and maybe a player
to be named later.

401
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,797
Mmm-mmm, you too good.

402
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:01,129
Keep your Mayer-

403
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,590
Two five.

404
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,019
Hey, so how'd the big date
go last night?

405
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,141
It went.

406
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,187
Hi-Hat.

407
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:21,736
Hey, Paul, we're slammed over here.
Where the fuck are you?

408
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:27,409
Oh, well, I'm honored that
I was your only phone call.

409
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:30,370
No, fuck it. It's cool.

410
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:32,122
Yeah, I'm on it. All right.

411
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:33,544
Mike, can you do me a favor?

412
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:36,998
Can you go over
to the 14th station house,

413
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:38,423
bail out our bartender?

414
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:39,591
Okay.

415
00:26:45,756 --> 00:26:46,928
Did I say you could do that?

416
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,850
Relax. Just a hobby.

417
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,228
I'm working on something.

418
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:54,648
Yeah, well, work on making me
another Jack and Coke instead.

419
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:05,401
Have you ever had a job, Reggie?

420
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:07,035
You think this ain't a job?

421
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:09,113
I see Shay and Melissa
doing all the work.

422
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,324
I don't know
exactly what it is you do

423
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,660
except count the cash
and treat them like shit.

424
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:17,706
Well, what you don't know
about me would fill a library.

425
00:27:18,831 --> 00:27:20,629
You think I don't know your type?

426
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,258
- Shit, I read you like a comic book.
- All right, Reg.

427
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:27,715
Which is not to say
that I don't admire

428
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:29,425
those pert little nay-nays

429
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,306
you got in that onesie
you wearing.

430
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:37,558
I'm not serving you.

431
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:42,480
Shit.

432
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:44,486
Girl take my picture without asking

433
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:46,238
and then won't fix my drink?

434
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:48,069
I feel downright exploited.

435
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,780
Hey, how about both of you
back this bullshit up, all right?

436
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:53,992
Vince, you ain't heard the news?
Sexism's out.

437
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:57,499
If you want pussy nowadays,
treat it equal.

438
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,038
Ain't that right, Miss Chrissy?

439
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,631
Well, now...

440
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,584
Don't start
the revolution without me.

441
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,716
Too late. Shit's already started.

442
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:11,593
Hey, man, you best
hit that shit before I do.

443
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:17,268
Where the fuck
did that come from?

444
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:20,063
Just taking a fucking picture.

445
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:22,816
This is a bar.
Look like an art studio?

446
00:28:24,146 --> 00:28:25,568
You like to watch?

447
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,075
Yeah?

448
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:44,592
Oh, mother...

449
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:47,007
Get the fuck off me!

450
00:28:50,923 --> 00:28:52,175
I want the money.

451
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,181
The money!

452
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,059
Where's the money?

453
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,015
Okay, I'll give it to you!

454
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,726
I'll give it to you!

455
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,772
Just don't hurt me.

456
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,856
Get it.

457
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:11,360
All Of it.

458
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:14,576
Just wait here.

459
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,503
Motherfucking piece of shit!

460
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,301
You bitch!

461
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,945
Hendrickson, Paul.

462
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,409
Here.

463
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,951
Big mistake
every time, you know?

464
00:30:03,662 --> 00:30:05,005
Hey, thanks.

465
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,674
These fucking cops
and their bullshit rousts.

466
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,002
You know?

467
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:10,385
We should go.

468
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,722
No humanity in these motherfuckers.

469
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:15,924
- Am I right?
- Such a lovely couple.

470
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,306
Better watch
your mouth there, slick.

471
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:21,639
No stitches.

472
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,110
Well, maybe just
a butterfly bandage will do.

473
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:31,740
Oh, probably don't even need that.

474
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:34,742
You're lucky.

475
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,037
Lucky me.

476
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:52,803
You just let it go like this?

477
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:54,554
Sure. Why not?

478
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:56,932
They need to make a living, too.

479
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,144
What he means to say
is the timing's all wrong.

480
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:03,806
- Timing for what?
- For OT.

481
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:06,229
A lot of guys on 4:00-12:00s

482
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,935
don't get serious about pross collars

483
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:10,487
until around 11:00 or 11:30.

484
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:13,487
You work past shift, you make
time-and-a-half on the overage.

485
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,113
Because?

486
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:17,536
Because you go home,
sleep a few hours,

487
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,329
and then you're in court
the next morning.

488
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:21,199
Pick up eight hours
of time-and-a-half

489
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,874
that you can bank
for vacation if you want.

490
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,952
I'm guessing the charges don't stick.

491
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,170
Girls are back on the street
by breakfast.

492
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:29,794
There was this dude
in Greek mythology

493
00:31:29,873 --> 00:31:31,921
that the gods punished
by making him roll a boulder

494
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,001
up the side of a mountain,

495
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:35,338
only to see it come back down
the other side.

496
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,094
So, he had to do it
again and again and again.

497
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:39,516
That'd be Sisyphus,

498
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:41,389
except he didn't get paid

499
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,516
each time he made it up to the top.

500
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:44,596
Meaning what?

501
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:48,567
- Never mind.
- I earn my money.

502
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,610
What, you think you can
have us drive you around

503
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:53,986
and just say any snide shit
that comes in your head?

504
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:56,533
You have no idea
what we have to deal with around here.

505
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:58,235
- Sorry.
- I earn my money.

506
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,738
- Got it.
- Are you hungry?

507
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:02,573
I could eat.

508
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,163
Drop us off at Leon's.

509
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:06,706
Gladly.

510
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:09,087
Hey.

511
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,633
Thanks for tolerating
my back and forth on this.

512
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:16,087
Hey, you like to think things through.
That's a good way to be.

513
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:19,298
So, with the girls,
the cops, your weekly nut,

514
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:21,217
what's gonna be left for us?

515
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,554
Plenty. And if I'm wrong about that,
we'll adjust my end.

516
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:26,309
I'm not greedy, Vincent.

517
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:29,141
I make money, you make money,
just like the bar.

518
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:32,356
You're saying that this is
all fixed with the city?

519
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:33,861
They want this.

520
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:35,860
They want as much
shit off the street as they can get.

521
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:38,450
They're offering
five locations like this one.

522
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:40,739
We make this one work,

523
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,162
there's gonna be plenty
right behind it.

524
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,999
- You'll see.
- Yeah, so no raids, no arrests.

525
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:47,705
There's a raid
now and then for show.

526
00:32:47,784 --> 00:32:49,206
We'll know it's coming.

527
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:51,167
You and your people
take the night off,

528
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,457
kick back up the next day.

529
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:55,334
This is gonna spread me a little thin.

530
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:57,427
But you're okay
if I bring in Bobby?

531
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:58,879
He'd run the shop and I'd give him

532
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:00,384
Black Frankie on the door.

533
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,140
Who you hire is your decision.

534
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:04,468
You're in charge of your own, Vince.
I'm not gonna interfere.

535
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,645
As long as the money's right,
I don't care.

536
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:09,685
Yeah, well, this shithole's

537
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:11,893
gonna need work to get it
where it needs to be.

538
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,770
Well, that's my cost,
but nothing too fancy.

539
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,105
I mean, make it classy,
but keep it simple.

540
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:19,696
- Classy but simple.
- Yeah.

541
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,903
Well, I guess Bobby
could handle construction.

542
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:23,987
Two things.

543
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,789
You're gonna wanna rig
some kind of back entrance

544
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:28,788
so guys can come and go
without being seen from the street.

545
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:32,337
- And also a VIP room.
- VIP?

546
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:33,880
For spenders, you know.

547
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:35,879
There needs to be
a little high-end in the place.

548
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:39,212
Yeah, not everything in life
is a $20 drip job, you know.

549
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:42,214
- Oh.
- You made a good decision here, Vince.

550
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:44,891
- This is gonna be real good.
- See ya, Vince.

551
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,267
Penny for your fucking thoughts.

552
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:57,150
Someone gonna sell the pussy,
someone gonna buy the pussy.

553
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,273
We're just landing the cut, man.

554
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:01,984
Right.

555
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:03,906
She don't get out the house much

556
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:05,329
'cause she got arthritis
and everything.

557
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:07,789
Doctor doesn't give her
any painkillers?

558
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:09,332
Yeah, but she's stubborn.

559
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:11,251
- You know him?
- Richie?

560
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,418
Sure.

561
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:15,038
- You don't want him.
- Why not?

562
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:18,380
Richie is not exactly
the typical mack.

563
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,928
One time, I brought his girl in
for beating on him.

564
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:26,725
- Guess I need a better pimp, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

565
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,269
Most of the guys
just give me the stink eye.

566
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:31,476
Don't worry, they'll start talking.

567
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:33,182
They love to hear themselves talk.

568
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:38,154
I was hoping maybe you could make
some introductions.

569
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,156
Maybe.

570
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:44,860
I'll look into it.

571
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,447
You know, I've been reading
about the testimony

572
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,248
that went over
to the Knapp Commission,

573
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,543
what's coming out now,
all that stuff about the pad.

574
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:56,289
Well, that guy was in Queens, mostly,
working narcotics.

575
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:58,715
Anyway, it's supposed
to be widespread.

576
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,752
They're saying whole precincts.

577
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:03,295
So they say.

578
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:07,049
Is it true? The pad?

579
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,472
I wouldn't know.

580
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:14,231
I mean, I just thought
you were so up front about the OT...

581
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:17,059
All I know is what
I read in the paper, just like you.

582
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,398
I'm done. You?

583
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,279
You're getting too agitated.

584
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:22,697
How do you want your eggs?

585
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,568
Got it.

586
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:38,296
<i>Record your message now.</i>

587
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:41,666
<i>Hey, I'm just calling to say</i>

588
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,048
<i>what a great time I had
with you the other night.</i>

589
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:45,504
<i>Uh, really great.</i>

590
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:48,386
<i>I feel like we're starting
to get to know each other a little.</i>

591
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:52,060
<i>Um...
l hope you feel the same.</i>

592
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:54,680
<i>And I also wanna check in,</i>

593
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,310
<i>see if you had any more of a handle</i>

594
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,517
<i>on coming to the party
with me Saturday night.</i>

595
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:02,278
<i>Okay, call me when you can.</i>

596
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:04,277
<i>Bye.</i>

597
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:07,947
- Kind of young, ain't she?
- Mind your business.

598
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:12,240
One order up.
Two eggs, mesh, bacon.

599
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,047
This is Rodney.

600
00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:27,587
You're with him now.

601
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:31,884
- What now?
- Think of yourself as a ballplayer.

602
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,802
They get traded all the time.

603
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:45,318
I'm Bernice.

604
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:48,032
Ruby. She Tiffany.

605
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:50,702
- Ruby?
- That's my name, Rodney.

606
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,745
It wouldn't kill you
to use it every now and then.

607
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:53,993
Yeah, all right.

608
00:36:58,535 --> 00:36:59,661
He broke you in yet?

609
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,621
Break me in?

610
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:03,586
Rodney, you're embarrassing her.

611
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:07,090
If she the embarrassing type,
she in the wrong line of work.

612
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:09,504
I'm all right.

613
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:11,093
That's good.

614
00:37:13,091 --> 00:37:14,388
One thing, though.

615
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,811
Ain't nobody wanna fuck a girl
named Bernice.

616
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:18,438
Pickup for Maria.

617
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:21,851
I think I'ma call you Ginger.

618
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:24,444
Everybody, say hello to Ginger.

619
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,532
You don't like it?

620
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:31,193
Not really.

621
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:32,573
Well, it's better than Ruby.

622
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:33,949
Ain't that right, Thunderthighs?

623
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:35,451
Get your hand out of my face.

624
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,210
How many girls
are we talking about?

625
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:42,754
Fuck do I know?

626
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:46,087
Well, they each need a room, right?

627
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:48,335
What kind of bed?

628
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,219
Fuck do I know?

629
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:51,926
And a john?

630
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:55,517
They each need a bathroom
or they go out to use the toilet?

631
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:56,593
Fuck do I know?

632
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:58,724
We put locks on their doors?

633
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:01,727
- Fuck do I know, Bobby?
- On the inside of the doors.

634
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,059
Do we want them locking themselves in
with the customers?

635
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,061
Fuck do I fucking know?

636
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:08,443
You're not much help here.

637
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:10,069
Sorry.

638
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:13,443
Don't worry, fucko.

639
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,986
I got this surrounded.

640
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,662
Great.

641
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:21,417
I can't believe Art didn't wanna come.
He loves to dance.

642
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:23,749
I didn't invite him.

643
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:26,961
This hide-and-seek game
that he plays with his job, I'm done.

644
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,963
You mean the job
that pays your rent.

645
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,636
- Whose side are you on?
- Honey, I'm Switzerland.

646
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:33,884
I'm just pointing out
that it might be easier to be out

647
00:38:33,964 --> 00:38:36,137
when you serve cocktails
to old queens for a living.

648
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,802
Fuck it, I wanna be in the world.

649
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,220
So, when's Art moving out?

650
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:43,231
As soon as I can afford my own rent.

651
00:38:43,306 --> 00:38:44,979
- He's with me.
- Okay.

652
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,360
Jesus, three dollars
just to go dancing

653
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,732
and they don't even have beers?

654
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:51,065
No booze, no liquor license,
no raids, and no mob owners.

655
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:52,945
- And no profit.
- Sweetheart,

656
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,284
some things are
more important than the bottom line.

657
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:11,092
Love saves the day.

658
00:39:22,554 --> 00:39:23,646
Hey, Daddy.

659
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:25,189
Looking for a date?

660
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,236
Hey there, Candy girl.

661
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:39,404
CoverGirl shit don't quite do it.

662
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,455
What are you,
a fashion photographer?

663
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:43,749
No, though I'll say this,

664
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:47,250
it don't look as bad as that
ass whooping you took last Christmas.

665
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:49,752
- Girl, you looked a mess that time.
- Rodney.

666
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:51,378
- Yeah?
- I'm working.

667
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,796
Yeah, about that...

668
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,509
I always wondered
how you gave head with a busted jaw.

669
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,226
Or turn tricks
with that cast on your arm.

670
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:04,225
No, wait, that was another time.

671
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:07,558
Uh, April maybe. May.

672
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:10,732
That one had you
over at Lenox Hill if I recall.

673
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:14,613
Fuck off.

674
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,951
Oh, no, no, mama.
Okay, now, wait a minute, now.

675
00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:19,369
See, you got me all wrong.

676
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:20,991
I ain't out here to bust on you, baby.

677
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,994
It's just that you keep
expecting better,

678
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:25,326
but you keep getting worse.

679
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,961
I mean, you go it alone.

680
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:31,164
come the dark hour, you are alone.

681
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:40,173
May I?

682
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:50,559
Now, what could be
more lonely than that?

683
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:53,145
So, what are you offering?

684
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:58,617
Next time I get my ass kicked,
I can cry on your shoulder?

685
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:02,320
What's the cut you take for that?

686
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,538
Ain't gonna be no next time
you come with me.

687
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:09,286
I'ma have your back
everywhere you go, baby.

688
00:41:12,414 --> 00:41:14,041
Aw, no, no, no.

689
00:41:14,124 --> 00:41:16,047
See here. No, no, look.
Look here, baby.

690
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:19,511
Or maybe next time you hook up

691
00:41:19,587 --> 00:41:23,137
with some hacky sack,
wack-ass motherfucker...

692
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:26,435
...we'll need to come by after

693
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:29,014
and sweep up what's left of you
from under the bed,

694
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,562
take it out to the cemetery
in a cereal box.

695
00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:37,196
You and me out here...

696
00:41:38,773 --> 00:41:39,820
You kidding me?

697
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:43,028
I'm talking world-famous, baby.

698
00:41:54,122 --> 00:41:55,169
Mmm.

699
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:56,465
You like that, huh?

700
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,352
Give your number
to my secretary.

701
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:13,483
See, what always
fucked me up about you was

702
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:18,359
what the hell some high-class acting,
movie-looking individual

703
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:21,032
was doing down here
to begin with, huh?

704
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,952
Walking around here,
smiling down your nose at everybody

705
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:27,406
like some cream filled,
tiara wearing

706
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:28,911
"I shit beige" bitch

707
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,867
- got everything under control.
- Rodney, Rodney.

708
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,920
Everything and everybody
all under control.

709
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:36,794
Rodney, why don't you
just hop back into that piece of shit

710
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:38,671
- pimp chariot of yours...
- Look at your face.

711
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,218
...and drive into a fucking wall!

712
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:43,467
Hoping to slob a johnson tonight
for not enough money, baby.

713
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:45,389
- You don't control shit down here!
- And you do?

714
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:48,969
Now that I think on it, baby,
that high-post act of yours

715
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:51,396
has got to make you
the saddest, "pathetic-est,"

716
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,018
craziest bitch on this stroll.

717
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:54,815
- I'm the craziest?
- What happened, Candy?

718
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:56,435
Daddy have his way with you
back in the day?

719
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,560
Yeah, you don't know shit.

720
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:58,987
Pass you around
to his drinking buddies?

721
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:00,609
- You don't fucking know shit.
- I don't have to.

722
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:02,907
You the one need to do the knowing.

723
00:43:16,955 --> 00:43:18,002
Whoa!

724
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:22,169
- Bro, did you see that one?
- You like that?

725
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:24,050
All that woman all to myself?

726
00:43:24,337 --> 00:43:25,554
Hell, yeah!

727
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:42,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

728
00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:54,306
Paul?

729
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:55,853
Yeah, it's me.

730
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:59,148
- Who's that?
- My roommate.

731
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:02,818
- Is he cute?
- Yeah, he's cute, all right.

732
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,358
Does he want to join us?

733
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:06,189
Mmm, maybe.

734
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:12,862
Hello.

735
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:14,743
Hi.

736
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:16,824
Sorry if we woke you.

737
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:20,419
You didn't.

738
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,068
Would you like to join us?

739
00:45:55,154 --> 00:45:56,747
You have some catching up to do.

740
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:22,019
Hey, you free?

741
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:25,735
Wow. You are beautiful.

742
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:29,234
How much?

743
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,283
How much, sweetheart?

744
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:38,615
What the fuck?

745
00:46:39,824 --> 00:46:42,498
Hey, you think
you're better than me, huh?

746
00:46:46,456 --> 00:46:48,754
Right on.
Yeah, well, they talk about it, right?

747
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:52,758
That sound... How do they get it
and keep it so consistent?

748
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:54,589
What's the secret sauce?

749
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:56,174
Well, here's the secret.

750
00:46:56,257 --> 00:46:59,056
Ain't no sauce, brother.
It's the pipes.

751
00:47:00,178 --> 00:47:01,851
- Voice pipes?
- No, man.

752
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:04,478
Pipes, pipes. Pipes in the building.

753
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:06,776
See, they sing
all that shit downstairs

754
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:08,228
and record it upstairs.

755
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,114
Smokey, Stevie, and all them killers.

756
00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:12,819
They voice go through the ducts

757
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:14,867
and pick up the soul
of the place on the way.

758
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:16,785
Ain't no expensive
recording equipment,

759
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:19,114
ain't no high-tech bullshit.

760
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:22,701
- Just pure innovation.
- There you go.

761
00:47:22,784 --> 00:47:25,412
And see, that's what separates us
from the white man.

762
00:47:25,495 --> 00:47:28,248
See, we can turn
a dime into a dollar just like that.

763
00:47:28,331 --> 00:47:31,255
And why?
That's all they gave us, baby.

764
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:33,419
Berry Gordy, for real.

765
00:47:33,878 --> 00:47:35,551
"Make do with what you got."

766
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,133
- It's what we do, brah.
- That's the genius of the race.

767
00:47:42,762 --> 00:47:46,107
Listen, I've been
talking to a reporter.

768
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:48,401
- Mmm.
- Doing a story on the street trade.

769
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:49,769
She want to rap.

770
00:47:49,852 --> 00:47:53,026
You say rap,
I hear "enrapment."

771
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:54,528
Right? She comes out here,

772
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:56,075
catches a little naughty business,

773
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,697
and then your people pull up,

774
00:47:57,777 --> 00:48:00,451
and there goes Reggie Love,
dumbest mack on Earth.

775
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,658
- Man, would I do you like that?
- Shit.

776
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:05,243
She just wants to write
what goes on down here.

777
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:06,373
Tell it straight.

778
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:10,248
Let me ask, is she that
uppity afro queen

779
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:11,753
I seen you with?

780
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:12,834
Mmm-hmm.

781
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:16,797
Yeah, Officer Alston
just trying to get on her good side,

782
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:18,256
so he could jump that thing.

783
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:21,384
Coming to Reggie Love talking about
some, "She just wants to write

784
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:22,935
"about what's going on down here."

785
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:25,058
Ooh, telling it real.

786
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:29,359
Man, are you in or not?

787
00:48:30,852 --> 00:48:32,024
Well, it might be bad for business

788
00:48:32,103 --> 00:48:34,401
if people see me
talking to a reporter.

789
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:35,944
Well, it might be bad for business

790
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:37,821
if I go through
your pockets right now.

791
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:41,204
See? You catch more flies
with honey, what I heard.

792
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:44,244
Shit.

793
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:47,331
She want to know about my game?

794
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:52,749
Man, somebody should write a book.

795
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:57,345
Oh, my God, just...

796
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,218
- Oh, don't stop, baby.
- Yeah.

797
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:01,595
Oh, baby, just keep going.

798
00:49:04,343 --> 00:49:06,892
Oh, God, right there.
Right there.

799
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:08,939
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

800
00:49:09,015 --> 00:49:10,813
No, no, don't,
don't, don't, don't stop.

801
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:12,442
I'm so close.

802
00:49:26,198 --> 00:49:27,620
Finished without me?

803
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:29,623
Sorry, babe.

804
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:31,374
I got nothing left.

805
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,542
Make sure you get
the money up front.

806
00:49:36,626 --> 00:49:38,424
- All right.
- Rodney ain't as bad as the others,

807
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:40,095
but you gotta bring in your piece.

808
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:42,344
You keep getting took, shit gets bad.

809
00:49:42,632 --> 00:49:43,929
What kind of bad?

810
00:49:44,008 --> 00:49:47,558
Abby, baby.
Come meet Bernice.

811
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:49,890
Abby works at the Hi-Hat
just down there.

812
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:51,474
Place jumps till late.

813
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:54,231
You new in town?

814
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:55,857
Just came up from Carolina.

815
00:49:55,937 --> 00:49:57,154
She know Darlene.

816
00:49:57,229 --> 00:49:59,027
Actually, we just met down there.

817
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:01,108
But I do know
some of her cousins, though, so.

818
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:03,493
Ah.

819
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:08,119
Well, uh, welcome to New York.

820
00:50:11,494 --> 00:50:15,169
- How is Darlene down there?
- What?

821
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,375
You saw her down in Carolina.

822
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:19,461
How is she doing back home?

823
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:22,421
She here. She come back with me.

824
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:36,815
So, what kind of bad?

825
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:47,788
Count it if you need to.

826
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:50,499
What's wrong with her now?

827
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:53,544
Oh, had an encounter out there.

828
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:56,373
An encounter, huh? Just one?

829
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,009
We need some time alone here.

830
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:09,389
Here you go.

831
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:13,564
How come she don't
gotta wear the leotard no more?

832
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,228
The elastic was chaffing.

833
00:51:15,307 --> 00:51:17,856
Oh, yeah? Well, mine, too.

834
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:19,937
Hey, that's the uniform.

835
00:51:20,187 --> 00:51:21,609
Wear it or walk.

836
00:51:23,024 --> 00:51:24,401
You, too.

837
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:26,698
What?

838
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:29,447
- It's our trademark.
- Ah.

839
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:38,338
- What can I get you?
- Gin, please.

840
00:51:38,414 --> 00:51:39,415
Gin.

841
00:51:51,052 --> 00:51:52,178
Did you see your family?

842
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:53,513
I stayed with a cousin.

843
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:55,931
What about your parents?

844
00:51:56,557 --> 00:51:59,982
If I went to see them, they'd probably
want money or something.

845
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:01,278
- Why?
- I don't know.

846
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:04,072
They think I owe them
for being born or some shit.

847
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:06,697
- Welcome back, Darlene.
- Thank you.

848
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:09,154
I wish I could go home,
just for a night.

849
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:11,330
- What for?
- Kill some people.

850
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:14,246
You seen any of the new
Saint Laurents?

851
00:52:14,325 --> 00:52:15,326
No.

852
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:16,911
I don't know
what the big deal is.

853
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,086
Most of them look boring to me,

854
00:52:18,162 --> 00:52:20,164
but there's this green fur I like.

855
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:21,457
No.

856
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:32,222
She said she was leaving.

857
00:52:33,677 --> 00:52:35,475
Can't believe I fell for that.

858
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:36,889
Who?

859
00:52:38,307 --> 00:52:39,433
Darlene.

860
00:52:41,018 --> 00:52:42,065
Larry's girl.

861
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:45,072
She left. Now she's back.

862
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:47,817
Why?

863
00:52:48,484 --> 00:52:50,612
Maybe she likes her life
the way it is.

864
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:52,404
You ever think of that?

865
00:52:52,905 --> 00:52:54,498
The way he controls her?

866
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:59,749
Did your daddy
pay for your college?

867
00:53:01,664 --> 00:53:04,292
- So what?
- Oh, but then I heard you quit.

868
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,420
Is he still helping you out?
Paying your rent and shit?

869
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,468
- No way.
- Mmm-hmm.

870
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:12,141
Daddies, husbands, and pimps,
they're all the same.

871
00:53:13,425 --> 00:53:16,850
They love you for who you are
until you try to be someone else.

872
00:53:17,388 --> 00:53:18,981
At least pimps are up front about it.

873
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:22,150
Yeah, that's, um...

874
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:38,034
I'm a little surprised you called.

875
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:41,121
Tell you the truth,
we have a lot of the same questions.

876
00:53:41,203 --> 00:53:42,796
Except for a few.

877
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:52,966
I want you to meet Reggie Love.

878
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:55,434
Reggie Love.

879
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:57,390
Your name rings out.

880
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,188
Yeah, I cut a wide swath in Midtown.

881
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:03,939
<i>Sandra Washington, Amsterdam News.</i>

882
00:54:05,895 --> 00:54:07,488
<i>Thought you was with The Times.</i>

883
00:54:07,855 --> 00:54:10,904
Reggie Love does not play
in the rec leagues.

884
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:14,078
I'm sorry, I thought
Officer Alston had...

885
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:15,905
Why didn't you tell him
that I work for...

886
00:54:15,988 --> 00:54:17,581
Reggie Love is fucking with you.

887
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,287
I'll leave you to it.

888
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,338
You know my fee, right?

889
00:54:29,543 --> 00:54:31,386
- Twenty an hour?
- Twenty?

890
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:35,842
You see me in coveralls,
cow shit on my shoes?

891
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:37,760
Forty.

892
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:43,190
Time is money, baby.

893
00:54:43,265 --> 00:54:46,064
Pretty girl like you
gots to know that, right?

894
00:54:46,518 --> 00:54:48,065
That the first rule of pimping?

895
00:54:48,145 --> 00:54:50,523
First rule of pimping
is look a man in his eyes

896
00:54:50,606 --> 00:54:51,823
when you're talking to him.

897
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:55,494
- Got it.
- Mmm.

898
00:54:58,489 --> 00:54:59,581
Forty.

899
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:10,126
She got you all fucked up, partner.

900
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:11,711
I can see.

901
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:14,388
- She's in your head.
- It's just a favor.

902
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,052
Yeah.

903
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:20,185
Whoa!

904
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:25,023
You know, it's customary
to signal your intentions

905
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:28,194
before pulling your vehicle
into traffic, Officer Flan-a-gan.

906
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:30,067
It's customary
to signal your intentions

907
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:33,194
before licking my hairy Irish ass,
Officer Haddix.

908
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:35,868
Sweeney took the day tomorrow,
so juice flows today.

909
00:55:35,943 --> 00:55:38,913
He wanted to get to you before
you went end of tour and missed him.

910
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:40,786
All right? Behave yourselves.

911
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:47,872
Guys are fucking testifying
on this shit downtown,

912
00:55:47,955 --> 00:55:50,458
and this assholes tossing envelopes
around in the street.

913
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,009
Guess they figure the worst is over.

914
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:53,711
That's what I heard.

915
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:54,886
From who?

916
00:55:56,213 --> 00:55:59,092
Steaks tonight. Tad's, maybe?

917
00:55:59,174 --> 00:56:02,724
- I might have dinner plans.
- Oh, shit.

918
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:11,111
So, Why'd you change your mind?

919
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:17,735
So, what, you got anything?

920
00:56:18,652 --> 00:56:20,871
Or there's still no film
in the camera?

921
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:22,915
Matter of fact,
there's been a change.

922
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:25,663
What kind of change?

923
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:27,161
In the law.

924
00:56:27,244 --> 00:56:28,496
Or the way they're reading it.

925
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:30,081
That's what my lawyer
is telling me.

926
00:56:30,164 --> 00:56:32,087
Something about community standards.

927
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:34,840
What about community standards?

928
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:37,964
Apparently, New York has none.

929
00:56:39,006 --> 00:56:41,179
So, you're back to filming?

930
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:43,602
When do we start?

931
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,228
From the looks of it,
you might need a couple weeks.

932
00:56:49,725 --> 00:56:51,272
How's Wednesday after next?

933
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:54,150
Great.

934
00:56:57,107 --> 00:56:58,450
- Hey, Ralphie.
- Hey, Bobby.

935
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:00,903
- Oh, that looks good.
- Yeah, thank you.

936
00:57:01,737 --> 00:57:04,206
I figured about two foot per person,

937
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:06,124
so that's room for five, maybe six.

938
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:09,286
- Right here?
- Yeah, looks fine.

939
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,417
Your guys do good work.

940
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:12,214
As always, pays to go with the union.

941
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:15,797
Anyway, here's for the real action.

942
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,894
We fill the bowl with water
so the girls can...

943
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:35,232
I get it. I got it.

944
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:37,030
Anyway, by the end of the month,

945
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:38,949
the only thing will be missing
will be women.

946
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:40,780
All right.

947
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:42,156
I'll talk to Frankie,
he can talk it up

948
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:43,738
with the pimps he plays cards with.

949
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:45,118
Okay.

950
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:46,874
I gotta get home, your sister's got

951
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:49,702
some kind of Tupperware festival
happening tonight.

952
00:57:54,456 --> 00:57:55,673
Later, Vin.

953
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,961
Here.
