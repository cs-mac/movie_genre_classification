00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:08,643
Go on.

2
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:10,937
Go on, Ben.

3
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,763
Please, baby, come inside me.

4
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,976
Wait!

5
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:22,645
Stay inside me, please.

6
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,056
Who the fuck is that?

7
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:53,186
Yes?

8
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:54,429
<i>Ben Azuelos?</i>

9
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:55,769
Yes.

10
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,892
<i>You 're under arrest
for sodomy in 7997.</i>

11
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,055
don't fuckin' believe it!

12
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,016
Shit, man!

13
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,057
Don't fuckin' believe it!

14
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:11,762
Fuck!

15
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,645
Fuckin' crazy!

16
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:18,519
Jeez...

17
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,355
Where have you been?

18
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:25,309
Where the hell have you been?

19
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,141
What's that?

20
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,356
- What is that?
- This?

21
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:32,022
The new me!

22
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:34,729
The new you!

23
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,140
You old bastard!

24
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:39,980
Who's the father?!

25
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,770
How dare you? What about you?

26
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:49,356
I'm glad to see you.

27
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:53,264
<i>Que tal?</i>

28
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,513
<i>Ola.</i>

29
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,762
Anna, Jeff. This is Jeff.

30
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,605
Come on down, Anna.

31
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:05,845
It's Jeff...

32
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:09,309
The guy who wasn't at our wedding!

33
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:12,142
Yes, Jeff who wasn't at the wedding!

34
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:14,720
Right, Jeff.

35
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,511
I'm so pleased to meet you.

36
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:23,471
Crazy!

37
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,970
You've got a car, a wife,

38
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:30,017
fine art books on the coffee table.

39
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,771
It's cool! Damn cool!

40
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,475
It's cool to see you.

41
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,973
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

42
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:37,351
Dig you, man.

43
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,720
Don't dig you yet.

44
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,431
But I'm sure will soon.

45
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:49,271
Listen, get your bag.
We'll get you settled in.

46
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:50,264
Sure?

47
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,103
Hang on. brought you a...

48
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,179
Hang on.

49
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,100
A souvenir.

50
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:07,971
A duck from Mexico.

51
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:15,311
- Is he staying long?
- don't know.

52
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:17,266
A day or two.

53
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm sorry. couldn't have known.

54
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:24,636
Expect you'd have told me if
you knew a pal was coming at <i>2</i> AM.

55
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,266
Especially one like him!

56
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:28,140
God, I'm sorry.

57
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,560
Why couldn't you have waited
two minutes?

58
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,636
We'll do it tomorrow.

59
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,978
Really want a baby.

60
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,680
Ben, it's the right time.

61
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,936
Know. want a baby, too.

62
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,973
Swear we'll do it tomorrow.

63
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:51,147
I'll save my strength.

64
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:54,560
I'll mobilize my little soldiers.

65
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:59,729
Mobilize away!

66
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,641
You naked in there?

67
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,348
We're making your bed.

68
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,390
This is fuckin' great!

69
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:10,890
Wanna go climbing!

70
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,564
We'll do that!

71
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,555
Yeah!

72
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,807
OK, I'm going to bed.

73
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:18,434
I'll be right up.

74
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,846
<i>Buenas noche.</i>

75
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:23,099
<i>Buenas n och es!</i>

76
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:24,814
Love you, honey.

77
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:28,731
Now dig you!

78
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:37,763
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks again.

79
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,678
She's great.

80
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,138
- Really great.
- know she is.

81
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,556
- Was still in Mexico this morning.
- Fuck!

82
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:49,599
You're all wet, hon!

83
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,223
First lived in
San Cristobal DE was Casas

84
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,720
in Chiapas.

85
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:01,432
It's the southernmost state
in Mexico.

86
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:05,058
Set up an art project
with some people there.

87
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,888
We needed some financing,

88
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:11,934
so came back to get investors
and galleries on board.

89
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,806
Long story short...

90
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,137
was at the airport and thought:

91
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,933
"Where do want to go?“

92
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:24,439
thought it was high time
saw you again.

93
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,813
Nice life you've got.

94
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:30,638
It's easy to live the way do.

95
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:34,057
But don't know if could live
the way you do.

96
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:36,394
Meaning?

97
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,351
Don't know. All this!

98
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:40,394
All what?

99
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:42,640
Your life...

100
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,136
It's easy as pie.

101
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,553
At the supermarket,
you pick up a girl.

102
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,058
You kiss her.

103
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:54,272
Next thing you know, you're married,
with a house...

104
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,931
and you turn the study
into the baby's room.

105
00:06:58,136 --> 00:07:00,139
- No!
- Just in case.

106
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:04,231
To be honest, thought
you'd done it long ago.

107
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:06,064
We're working on it.

108
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,640
I'm past the defense line.

109
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,388
The goal mouth is clear.

110
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:14,688
But only shoot penalties
into an empty goal!

111
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:20,762
It's the biggest thing
you could do with your life.

112
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,142
Huge!

113
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:24,304
Huge.

114
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,224
I'm working tomorrow.

115
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,892
Make yourself at home.

116
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:33,434
I'm off to bed.

117
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:34,430
OK, cool.

118
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,809
Tell me...

119
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:39,389
don't know if you have
anything planned tomorrow...

120
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,813
- We could...
- Sure.

121
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,021
It's weird to see you again.

122
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,981
Good weird.

123
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,189
Come here.

124
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:54,268
Sweet dreams you have!

125
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,481
Too you.

126
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:07,471
<i>- Hello, my love.
- Hello, my love.</i>

127
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,348
- OK?
- And you, darling?

128
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,721
<i>??? glad today's over at last.</i>

129
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:14,013
<i>Me too. Listen...</i>

130
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,269
<i> had a call from Jeff</i>

131
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:20,231
<i>He was seeing
that gallery owner girl.</i>

132
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,395
<i>Guess what? He's at her place.</i>

133
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:23,306
<i>Wow!</i>

134
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,809
You said it.

135
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:29,017
She's having a party
with the neighbors, roommates...

136
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,973
Some artists or something.

137
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,686
Jeff asked me to drop by.
So thought...

138
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:38,395
thought maybe I'd drop by.

139
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:42,647
<i>Let's have him over for dinner?
Get to know each other?</i>

140
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:46,018
<i> could do my homemade pasta.</i>

141
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:48,353
<i>We 'll open a nice bottle of wine.</i>

142
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:49,643
<i>Great, sweetie.</i>

143
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:51,515
<i>I'll pick him up.</i>

144
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:53,809
I'll <i>start dinner.</i>

145
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:56,100
<i>Love you, honey.</i>

146
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,310
<i>Me too.</i>

147
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,179
Monica!

148
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:16,845
Hello.

149
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:20,019
You're Ben!

150
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:25,731
I've heard so much about you.

151
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,146
Welcome. Come on in.

152
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:32,769
Hi, pal.

153
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,391
Hey, mister!

154
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:35,471
What're you doing?

155
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,064
Want a hug

156
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:39,727
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

157
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,188
It looks so good.

158
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,346
What is it?

159
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,769
My specialty, Corsican quiche!

160
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,640
- Shit!
- What?

161
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:52,104
Anna's making dinner to welcome you

162
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:54,270
- Who's Anna?
- My wife.

163
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,100
Tell her to come.
We're having a party.

164
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:59,850
Friday night is Gomorrah Party.

165
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,143
Common...

166
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:02,769
I'll ask her.

167
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,055
She can taste my quiche.

168
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:07,679
I'll get you a corkscrew.

169
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,555
Ben, Lilly. Lilly, Ben.

170
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,142
Hi, Lilly.

171
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:17,345
Making a salad?

172
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,852
No, I'm making salad dressing.

173
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,016
- Here.
- Thanks.

174
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,558
Whose place is this?

175
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,100
My chick's.

176
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,430
Who's your chick?

177
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:34,762
Monica?

178
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,057
OK, see.

179
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,805
- They've hit it off.
- So see.

180
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:45,015
She's into guys at times.

181
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,311
Up to her.

182
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,225
- It works for her.
- Cool.

183
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:51,730
What line are you in?

184
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:54,056
Town planner. In transport.

185
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:55,221
You?

186
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,561
- Me?
- What do you do in life?

187
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:58,970
Live.

188
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,474
What else can you do?

189
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,060
And the dad?

190
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,356
I'll make a call.

191
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:36,470
- Hey...
- <i>When will you be here?</i>

192
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:38,681
There's a slight change in plans.

193
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:42,270
Jeff got talked into having dinner
with this girl...

194
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,266
It's actually
more of a pick-up plan...

195
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,013
Hi.

196
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:49,144
<i>Ben .7</i>

197
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:51,312
was just saying hi to someone.

198
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,761
It's a bummer...
you're making dinner...

199
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,139
I'm Franck.

200
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:58,768
A pleasure.

201
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,225
<i>Ben .7</i>

202
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,435
Where was ?

203
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:05,518
It's a pain,
you're already making dinner

204
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:08,137
and Jeff is staying here.

205
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,636
<i>He's staying there?</i>

206
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:11,480
get the impression.

207
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,976
<i>Too bad. It' doesn't matter.</i>

208
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:15,932
You can come if you want.

209
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,807
They really insisted.

210
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:18,604
Yeah, come.

211
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:19,971
<i>What?</i>

212
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:22,764
That was Franck...

213
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:23,764
See ya.

214
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:24,930
<i>Who.7</i>

215
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:27,811
Get this!

216
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:32,809
You won't believe it. This guy
came in while we were talking...

217
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:37,396
I'm in the bathroom. And this guy
starts pissing in front of me

218
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,265
like wasn't even there.

219
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:41,472
- No <i>way!</i>
- This place is weird.

220
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,728
It's called "Sodom and Gomorrah."

221
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,978
And they mean it literally.

222
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:47,101
<i>Sodom and Gomorrah?</i>

223
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,057
Yeah, and you're welcome.

224
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:50,980
<i> Prefer my pasta!</i>

225
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:55,054
Why don't stay a while
to be polite, then I'll come home.

226
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:58,472
Perfect.

227
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:03,679
<i>We 'll relish your dinner
and everything else we had planned.</i>

228
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,303
<i>My little soldiers!</i>

229
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,137
I'll be waiting.

230
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:10,266
The two of us
will have a fabulous dinner.

231
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:11,929
<i> Can '1' wait.</i>

232
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:14,012
Screw Jeff.

233
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:16,637
<i>Yeah, sore w Jeff Goodbye</i>

234
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:17,437
Bye.

235
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,804
- Come here, you.
- Get away!

236
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:58,267
It counts steps!

237
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,555
It's a fucking pedometer!

238
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:04,637
It counts steps! don't believe it.

239
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,354
One and two and three...

240
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:24,479
No thanks.

241
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:25,930
Or maybe.

242
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:27,771
Nah. OK, yes.

243
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:41,807
They touch, they intermingle,

244
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:45,099
but you never really see
who they are,

245
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:47,099
or how many they are.

246
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,513
As they touch, their bodies blend

247
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,224
into a single entity.

248
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:54,726
It's aesthetically stunning.

249
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,180
Adore its spiritual side.

250
00:17:57,386 --> 00:17:59,555
What are you guys talking about?

251
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,932
A film we saw at Hump.

252
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,097
At what?

253
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:04,226
Hump

254
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:05,850
You don't know Hump?

255
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,356
Never heard of it.

256
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,855
It's a porn film festival.

257
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:14,305
They hold it in Seattle every year.

258
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,605
It's an open festival
with creative erotic films.

259
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,895
Creative and alternative.

260
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:21,481
Not just gonzo.

261
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:24,095
There's a jury and a selection.

262
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,720
You watch the films
in a big theater.

263
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,063
It's an exploration.

264
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:32,011
It's sex pushed
to the ultimate limit.

265
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,682
Afterward s they destroy the films.

266
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,896
So they don't haunt you.

267
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:39,429
It's like an artistic happening.

268
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:42,469
I'll make a film!

269
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:44,263
You will, huh?

270
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:46,270
Why not?

271
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,344
Whatsit you do?

272
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,725
I'm going to do...

273
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:54,682
something rad.

274
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:21,182
ASSHOLE

275
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:26,096
I'm going to make
a beautiful, grandiose film.

276
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:29,562
The deepest, most poetic film ever.

277
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,600
You never saw me fuck.

278
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,189
Never had the pleasure.

279
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,230
I'm a real beauty.

280
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,189
Yeah...

281
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,677
A raw beauty!

282
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,056
Beauty and the Beast.

283
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,227
You're going to make a porn flick?

284
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:52,886
No, an art flick.

285
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:55,017
Erotic art.

286
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:59,433
Fuck you.

287
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:02,184
You're pissed off
because you're fettered.

288
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:04,185
What's that mean?

289
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:07,477
You're settled.
So you're pissed off.

290
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:08,768
Doesn't stop me.

291
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,601
- You're gonna do porn?
- If feel like it.

292
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,890
What kind of porn
do you have in mind?

293
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:15,888
What kind?

294
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,188
Yeah, what kind of porn?

295
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:26,392
Soft, hard, fetish, vintage,

296
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,265
glamor, Latino,

297
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,970
anal, a cum flick...

298
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,100
- Bi...
- Eco?

299
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,600
- Eco!
- Well?

300
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,309
First need a camera.

301
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,928
If you're acting, get a zoom lens.

302
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:40,309
A macro zoom lens.

303
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:41,639
Blah, blah.

304
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:44,061
You should check out their site.

305
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,563
They have the synopses
of their films.

306
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,598
- Like the one with E.T.
- E.T.?

307
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,105
He comes back to see Elliot.

308
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:55,598
There's still light
but it's not in his fingertip...

309
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,559
Listen to this!

310
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:14,518
"Experimental pop art:
artists eat food coloring

311
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:18,144
to ejaculate colored cum
onto a transparent screen."

312
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:21,185
What's she doing?
Is that a traffic cone?

313
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:23,514
Everything's been done.

314
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,599
Just tap "porno" in Google.

315
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,765
If we make a film,
it's got to be something unique.

316
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:31,351
Hear you.

317
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:35,345
Then I'll fuck you.

318
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:38,688
That's so old.

319
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:41,434
It's not like gay porn was rare.

320
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,639
She's right, we've seen tons.

321
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,226
Guys on top of guys, under guys,

322
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:47,849
inside guys. A fucking bore.

323
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:49,972
That having been said...

324
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:53,271
No one has ever filmed
non-gay man-on-man action.

325
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:55,437
Straight guys fucking.

326
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:57,640
Guys like you, fucking.

327
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:58,556
She's right.

328
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:01,887
I'll fuck you.

329
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:04,932
- Are you nuts?
- You chicken?

330
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:07,268
What's an artist?

331
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:09,851
Isn't it someone who pushes limits?

332
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:12,596
You're the artist, I'll fuck you.

333
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,344
Could you do it?

334
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:16,936
Could you do it?

335
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:20,513
If you could, it would be fabulous.

336
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,805
But can you really do it?

337
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:27,183
I'll swallow a pill and swear
I'll tear you inside out!

338
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:28,642
You've got something.

339
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:30,053
That's what we'll do.

340
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,766
- Ready?
- What for?

341
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,889
Us. Two straights. Four nuts.

342
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,602
It transcends gay...

343
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,517
It's beyond gay.
It's what are you doing in my butt?

344
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:44,021
Seriously, if you can express
your long friendship like this...

345
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:46,139
Friendship always contains love.

346
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:47,979
- Love you Ben.
- Love you Jeff.

347
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:52,266
If were on the jury,
I'd give you first prize.

348
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,266
It would be magnificent!

349
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,060
Magnificent.

350
00:22:56,594 --> 00:22:58,146
A work of art.

351
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,725
Not only can't trust you,

352
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:14,689
but your child can't either.

353
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:19,726
Before he's even born,
before he's here, you let him down.

354
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:22,769
When he needs you most,

355
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:27,141
when he needs your sperm
and your genetic resources...

356
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:32,095
You let him down.

357
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,853
He's done everything possible
to come to you...

358
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:42,146
and you're with people
who aren't even ovulating.

359
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,138
Ben,

360
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:49,889
come home.

361
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,844

00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:07,145
love you, but bet

364
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:08,731
tomorrow, you'll back out.

365
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:11,772
Even in your wildest dreams,
you'd never do it.

366
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:13,640
OK, let's sign up now.

367
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:17,016
I'll book us a hotel room right now.

368
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,606
We'll do your film.

369
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:21,100
I'll book it now.

370
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:28,432
- What?
- Nothing.

371
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,929
- Sunday night?
- I'll nail you.

372
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,890
No way. I'll nail you.

373
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,723
- I'll call 'em up.
- We draw lots.

374
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:37,178
- I'll call.
- Let me hear.

375
00:24:37,386 --> 00:24:38,642
No problem.

376
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:41,804
Want to quit?

377
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:44,014
Don't want to quit!

378
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,678
<i>Information, how may help you?</i>

379
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:51,686
Hello, could you put me through to
the Sofitel at Porte DE Champerret?

380
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:54,263
I'll nail you!

383
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,104
Can still hang up.

384
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,678
I'm gonna crucify you!

385
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:04,770
<i>- Should I put you through?
- Yes.</i>

386
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:06,310

388
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:15,225
And the security code...

389
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:16,553
Forget security!

390
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:17,638
712.

391
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:19,515
<i>Single or queen -size?</i>

392
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,973
Queen-size is fine.

393
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,189
Yes, just one night.

394
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,189
Thanks a lot.

395
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:30,771
I'm the one paying.
I'm the one fucking you.

396
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:57,642
'Morning.

397
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:04,018
Nice wake-up call.
How about "Good morning"?

398
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:05,559
No talking. I'm busy.

399
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:07,847
Yeah, you look busy.

400
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,060
Shut up!

401
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:10,731
What the hell is this?

402
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,059
Forget it.

403
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,802
Sorry, but this is a bit weird.

404
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:21,522
What happened last night?

405
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:25,812
- Well?
- Wait a minute.

406
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:30,015
Can we rewind? You come in
and straddle me brutally.

407
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:34,889
You know was ovulating last night.
thought we could try this morning.

408
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:42,677
Sorry, fucked up.
I'm sorry, OK?

409
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:45,098
What did you do last night?

410
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:50,261
Was with Jeff.

411
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:53,929
He was wasted. thought
should keep an eye on him.

412
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:55,553
So...

413
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:59,564
decided to sober up
before coming home.

414
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:03,177
It took you till 4 AM to sober up?

415
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:07,225
Come on, Ben, don't bullshit me!

416
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:10,809
Jeff's a big boy.

417
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,263
You haven't seen him in ages.

418
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,684
He managed fine without your help.

419
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:20,766
It was a cool party.

420
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:24,517
Yeah, mean,

421
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:27,480
they won't become my best friends,

422
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:31,222
but it was fun, you know.

423
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,350
It was nice to see some new faces,

424
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,887
to talk, to hang out.

425
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:39,516
Enjoyed it, OK?

426
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:41,345
Anna...

427
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:48,055
We're gonna have kids. We shouldn't
cut ourselves off from others.

428
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:50,513
We should throw parties like that.

429
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,520
"We" should throw parties?

430
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:56,636
You left me all alone last night.

431
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:57,602
Invited you!

432
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,973
You invited me? You invited me!

433
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,387
Yes, invited you.

434
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:04,064
Everyone invited you.

435
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:07,639
" Don't know if you'll like it,
they're weird..."

436
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:09,136
Sounded like fun!

437
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:12,060
That was before
the mood changed, OK?

438
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:14,813
Should've called back.

439
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:21,518
You met a girl?

440
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:23,221
What?

441
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:24,888
Did you?

442
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:27,350
What's this?

443
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,262
OK, drop it.

444
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:49,936
Sorry.

445
00:28:50,636 --> 00:28:53,053
Screwed up. apologize.

446
00:28:56,261 --> 00:29:00,053
Screwed up. apologize.
Forgive me, my love.

447
00:29:00,261 --> 00:29:01,647
Love you, I'm sorry.

448
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:03,017
My love, I'm sorry.

449
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:16,138
Screwed up.

450
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:22,143
It's my fault, screwed up.

451
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,178

Spoken to your coach?
Can we start?

458
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:37,927
I'm concentrating.

459
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:41,139

You fuckin' jerk!

465

Don't take it so seriously.

466
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:04,803
You bitch!

467
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:08,553

471
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:21,268
Get off me!

472
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,063
You'll do the shopping, right?

473
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:37,639
Are we done after this?

474
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:39,847
Want to visit some galleries,

475
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:41,806
maybe get laid.

476
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:43,771
Isn't that already done?

477
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:47,228
What?

478
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,181
I'm trying to remember...

479
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:52,184
Don't pretend
you can't remember last night.

480
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:55,439
Sorry, got you
into some twisted shit.

481
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:59,061
Look, it was a weird night.
It happens. Not your fault.

482
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:00,303
It fuckin' is.

483
00:32:00,594 --> 00:32:04,138
Turn up at your place,
we get wasted,

484
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:07,689
talk about gay sex,
leave your wife at home.

485
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:11,097
Don't worry about her.
You didn't make me stay.

486
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:12,559
Could've gone home.

487
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:16,181
Had a great time.
You don't have to apologize.

488
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:20,095
We go back along way, even if
our lives are very different.

489
00:32:20,302 --> 00:32:24,474
And in the life you have now, I'm
not sure it was very appropriate.

490
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:25,803
I'm not judging you-

491
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,305
Look, Mr. Jacques Kerouac,
with your crappy bandana,

492
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:32,471
I'm not that much of a homebody.

493
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:34,971
Everything's black or white to you.

494
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:37,560
Just think
it's a great art project.

495
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:39,349
Think it's great, too.

496
00:32:39,552 --> 00:32:41,520
But in your situation...

497
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:45,014
My situation?
Are you trying 10...?

498
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,346
- Won't force you.
- know.

499
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm just saying
last night, we were drunk,

500
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,222
so you can back out.

501
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:56,220
Forget your preconceived ideas
about me, OK?

502
00:32:56,594 --> 00:32:58,313
Each man for himself.

503
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,397
I'll do it if like.

504
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:06,605
My marriage won't stop me
doing anything.

505
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,897
Anna and are very close.
You wouldn't know.

506
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:15,266
But we have an open relationship,
we're free to do as we like.

507
00:33:16,052 --> 00:33:17,178
I'm just saying...

508
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,642
Don't decide for me.

509
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:21,427
I'm not.
I'm talking to you as a friend.

510
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:24,018
There's no problem, that's all.

511
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:27,309
You know, you can...

512
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:29,603
You're not bound by it.

513
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,266
We're very different now.

514
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,602
Look, shut up for a minute.

515
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:37,896
I'll end up thinking
you're narrow-minded or retarded.

516
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:43,556
Stop trying to find excuses for me.
You know what?

517
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:48,016
It's like you're trying to blame me
for what you can't face up to.

518
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,105
Be honest...

519
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:58,846
Shoot.

520
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:03,437
Do you think you can screw me
for this film tomorrow?

521
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,143
You bet.

522
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,015
You could or you would?

523
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:09,179
Would.

524
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:10,891
You won't say to me:

525
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:13,595
"We should go our own separate ways,

526
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,805
'cause an artist's life..."

527
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,179
Not that again.
It was 15 years ago!

528
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:21,894
You didn't need me in Peru
to write poems on coca leaves.

529
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,677
Could you still leave a pal
high and dry

530
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:27,138
or do you have a code of ethics now?

531
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,771
<i>I will do it.</i>

532
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,012
You will?

533
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,059
So will .

534
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:39,062
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you bet.

535
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:44,013
We shouldn't do it as a challenge
or 'cause we feel obliged to.

536
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,685
We'll do it for art's sake!

537
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:49,387
It may be crazy,
but it's a great idea!

538
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:52,474
Right! We're pushing back
the limits of art!

539
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:54,977
- Will you tell your wife?
- Sure.

540
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,970
How do you think she'll react?

541
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:00,680
Can't know what she'll say,

542
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:03,931
but I'll explain it to her.

543
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:08,603
If it's a problem, won't do it.
But think she'll be OK with it,

544
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:12,095
'cause she trusts me.
That's marriage.

545
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:13,684
You don't believe me?

546
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:17,312
You're the one freaking out.
You don't have to do it.

547
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:20,688
Tell Anna and let me know.
If she's OK, I'm OK.

548
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,387
Leave Anna out of this.
I'll deal with her.

549
00:35:23,677 --> 00:35:25,348
So are we on?

550
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:27,220
We're on.

551
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,643
OK, we're on.

552
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:34,435
- Seriously?
- Do look like I'm joking?

553
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,017
We're on.

554
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,060
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night, yeah.

555
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,552
You can still back out.

556
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:45,849
I'm not backing out.
I'm gonna bareback you!

557
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:47,976
I'll be there.

558
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,096
Me too.

559
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:09,762
Sorry about last night.
It's my fault.

560
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,102
Agree, it was stupid.

561
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:15,147
Sometimes you're stupid,
then get stupid too.

562
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,307
Was stupid this morning

563
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,845
whereas you're more stupid
in the evening!

564
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:25,726
Love you.

565
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:26,976
Me too.

566
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:37,678
Need to tell you something.

567
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:41,306
Let the cat out of the bag...

568
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:42,601
Or the duck.

569
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:46,600
Or the duck, right
Talking of Jeff...

570
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:48,094
want everything.

571
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:50,476
Me too.

572
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,230
He's lost, you know.

573
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,720
I watched him last night...

574
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,314
It's touching how he wants
his life to have meaning.

575
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:08,268
The good news is, he met people
over there. They hit it off.

576
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:10,768
They take part in an art festival.

577
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,312
They've asked him to join them.
And he's totally into it!

578
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:15,601
I'm not sure...

579
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:17,722
He asked me to help him.

580
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:20,844
Yeah, sure.

581
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,224
What festival is it?

582
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:24,897
It sounds kinda weird.

583
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:28,056
It's a festival,
an anal... annual festival.

584
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:30,726
They do art films that are...

585
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:32,185
a bit...

586
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,476
A bit what?

587
00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:37,601
Dunno. They make films,
then destroy them!

588
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,062
Hump?

589
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:42,895
What?

590
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:46,935
- The festival?
- You know Hump?

591
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,605
It's a porn film festival.

592
00:37:49,427 --> 00:37:50,020
Is it?

593
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,558
Yes, it is.

594
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:54,013
Maybe. Don't jump down my throat

595
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:55,605
It's mainly artsy.

596
00:37:55,802 --> 00:38:00,021
Yeah, it promotes porn's artistic
aspect rather than its mundane one!

597
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,013
Right.

598
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:02,689
They're skin flicks.

599
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:06,519
- Whatsit you do?
- Lend a hand.

600
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:12,553
I'll make coffee and sandwiches...

601
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:15,308
I'll help him.
He's motivated for once.

602
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,563
They're doing it tomorrow.
want to help a pal. It'd be cool.

603
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,139
Can't help out a pal?

604
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,897
Sure you can.

605
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,969
How do you know Hump?

606
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,522
Oh, right!

607
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,556
Well played, girls!

608
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:56,230
Team spirit!

609
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:57,600
No problem.

610
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,095
Can handle it.

611
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:01,602
You can even call your girlfriends.

612
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,480
Yeah, you too.

613
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:12,063
What the fuck's that for?

614
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:13,268
Depends...

615
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:15,016
Opinions differ.

616
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:17,013
You scared?

617
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:20,272
Don't freak out. It doesn't bite!

618
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:24,267
You could've said
it was a costume ball.

619
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,146
Common, relax.

620
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:28,561
How'll you cope with a real one?

621
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:31,428
A hot one moving up and down
behind you!

622
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:36,392
Well, thought
we could do something more natural.

623
00:39:36,594 --> 00:39:39,012
That's not
what we had planned, sweetie.

624
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:40,512
Sorry.

625
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,769
Suggest that for tonight,

626
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:45,187
we use my tool.

627
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:48,515
If all parties aren't satisfied,
we can try

628
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,396
to introduce the...

629
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:51,554
No reason

630
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,143
for one cock to drive away another.

631
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:56,975
OK, no problemo.

632
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:00,595
Could stay and watch and jerk off.

633
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,812
You want a hetero trip?

634
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:06,307
Two girls for you,
and you control the joystick?

635
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:08,763
Can't we play with you a bit?

636
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,178
Feel threatened?

637
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:12,554
Don't be.

638
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:15,723
Don't want
to get between the two of you.

639
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:19,229
I'm very disappointed.

640
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:21,228
You're not the only one.

641
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:26,221
Guess I'm just too...

642
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,599
conventional for you.

643
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,430
<i>Muchachas!</i>

644
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,771
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

645
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:43,265
We're finishing up dinner.

646
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,562
Let's go out for a drink.

647
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:47,847
It's cool. A drink is cool.

648
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:49,937
- We don't have to...
- Give me the phone.

649
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:51,678
Give me the phone!

650
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,480
Hi, Jeff. And you?

651
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:02,142
Why don't we grab a drink together?

652
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:06,270
We can't leave you alone.

653
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,554
It's no trouble. Where are you?

654
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,561
Great, know a bar there.

655
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:23,811
What?

656
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:26,229
I'm just looking at you.

657
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:30,727
We'll never find a parking space.

658
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:40,931
Let me out. You're a pain.

659
00:41:41,136 --> 00:41:42,345
You're abandoning me?

660
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:44,472
I'm not abandoning you.

661
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,389
- See you in a sec.
- OK. See you.

662
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,720
Did you have a nice evening?

663
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:40,141
Yes, very nice.

664
00:42:40,802 --> 00:42:42,272
How about you?

665
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:44,887
Don't know... strange.

666
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:46,267
Whatsit you have?

667
00:42:47,552 --> 00:42:48,643
The same as you.

668
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,268
Was the poet,
he was the illustrator.

669
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:04,266
And he dumped me
for an unpaid apprenticeship.

670
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:05,227
That idiot!

671
00:43:05,677 --> 00:43:06,554
He had talent.

672
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,387
But he didn't believe in himself.

673
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:13,896
So he blew off the trip
we'd been planning for ages.

674
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,602
We named ourselves
after the famous road adventurers...

675
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:21,265
Kerouac... Easy Rider.

676
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:24,720
Went alone,
but it amounted to nothing.

677
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:28,352
Never graduated.
And hold your husband responsible.

678
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:31,512
- That idiot.
- What's he doing anyway?

679
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:34,018
- A valet parking apprenticeship.
- Unpaid!

680
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,511
Unpaid.

681
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:40,439
You're a cool chick.

682
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:43,102
Thank you for the compliment.

683
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,395
That's not what meant.

684
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:52,721
What meant was that
I'm a big fat stubborn moron.

685
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:54,314
That's what meant.

686
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:57,054
Know. know look kind of...

687
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,687
- But at the same time...
- Yes?

688
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,813
He was right.

689
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:08,811
You can't judge a guy
by his pleated pants,

690
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:10,930
his pedometer and his wife.

691
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,055
A pedometer is very sexy.

692
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,395
You dig that kind of stuff?

693
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,350
We'll use it tomorrow.

694
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:21,397
- Really?
- Yeah. We have it all planned out.

695
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:25,387
Yeah, he told me.
wanted to ask you... I'm curious.

696
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:29,187
Hump!
want to hear all about it.

697
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:30,938
You know Hump?

698
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:33,725
I'm blown away by your open mind.

699
00:44:34,094 --> 00:44:35,303
Shit!

700
00:44:36,302 --> 00:44:38,850
Do really look that uptight?

701
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,893
- He told you about our project?
- Of course.

702
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:44,012
Kind of weird, huh?

703
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:46,020
But since you're cool with it...

704
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:46,847
Well?

705
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:50,928
Only guys like you and Ben
could go through with it.

706
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:54,514
It's just one night.
It won't change your relationship.

707
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,647
Our relationship?

708
00:45:04,177 --> 00:45:07,555
The film is
of you and Ben sleeping together?

709
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:09,642
Totally wild, huh?

710
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,557
Hump, hump, hump!

711
00:45:35,552 --> 00:45:36,725
Anna, what's wrong?

712
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:38,601
What's going on?

713
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:39,596
What did you do?

714
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:42,137
You said you'd tell her.
She said she knew...

715
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:43,683
Shut up, both of you!

716
00:45:43,885 --> 00:45:46,351
- You told her?
- Didn't you tell her?

717
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:48,889
- "You told her“?
- was going to.

718
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:50,895
Wanted to tell you earlier.

719
00:45:51,094 --> 00:45:52,765
This wasn't the plan.

720
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:56,307
Everything got off to a bad start.

721
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,679
You freaked out at the word "porn."

722
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:00,438
freaked out?

723
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,639
Don't believe it!

724
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,724
My guy is going to make
a skin flick tomorrow

725
00:46:05,927 --> 00:46:07,812
with his pal!

726
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,516
Please, calm down.

727
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,520
What's going on in your head?

728
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:13,852
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

729
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:16,640
Can we get my car?

730
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:18,894
We talk here and now.

731
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,730
Why are you doing this?

732
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,681
Don't know.

733
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:34,975
Ever since art school,
we said we'd do something together.

734
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:36,351
"Something"?

735
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,435
Anna, please!

736
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:42,143
- Listen!
- Go away.

737
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,979
- Wait.
- Go away!

738
00:46:58,177 --> 00:46:58,853
I'm sorry.

739
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,891
Good evening, ma'am.
Ticket control.

740
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:41,806
Your ticket, please.

741
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,302
Don't know where ...

742
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,478
Do you have a piece of ID?

743
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,267
A piece of ID?

744
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:53,766
My name, my sex,
my distinguishing marks.

745
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:57,015
You think that sums up
my true identity?

746
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:58,689
You don't care.

747
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:01,303
No-one cares.
No-one ever knows anyone.

748
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,683
Listen here, Mrs...

749
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:04,355
That's right, "Mrs."!

750
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:08,428
Mrs. Ben Azuelos!
From the "Ben and Jeff“ comedy act.

751
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:17,095
They horse around and wrestle
like they were 14 years old.

752
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,888
Know how this will end.
Their “totally wild" thing.

753
00:48:22,635 --> 00:48:25,895
Thought knew the man
was living with.

754
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,016
And suddenly...

755
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:31,392
his best friend opens my eyes.

756
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,141
They never admitted it,
but it's coming out now.

757
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:37,596
It's not just about fucking.

758
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:39,853
It's much deeper,

759
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:41,806
much sicker than that.

760
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,766
Mrs. Azuelos...

761
00:48:56,135 --> 00:48:57,557
Mrs. Azuelos...

762
00:48:58,885 --> 00:48:59,561
Good evening.

763
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:14,354
Can tell you something
I've never told anyone?

764
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:28,973
Was 18 when came to Paris.

765
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:32,104
Had no friends,
so rented lots of films.

766
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:40,885
The guy at the video shop suggested
some documentary on architecture.

767
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,304
It looked interesting enough.

768
00:51:47,385 --> 00:51:49,637
Got home and watched the film.

769
00:51:54,427 --> 00:51:57,058
Almost died of boredom. Awful.

770
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:07,518
The next day went back
to return the film.

771
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,433
He looked at me.

772
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:18,054
Don't know why,
said it was fabulous.

773
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:21,305
There was something about him.

774
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:26,305
Then discover it's part one
of a ten-part series!

775
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:32,392
So the guy gives me part two,
and go home and watch it.

776
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:36,268
It's even worse.
So decide to tell him the truth.

777
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:42,230
Go back to the video shop.
take one look at him

778
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,103
and say liked it even better.

779
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:47,851
And so on.

780
00:52:48,052 --> 00:52:51,264
Every day, rented
another part of his collection.

781
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:54,183
And every day, said loved it.

782
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:57,311
When was finished, felt sad.

783
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:03,017
Maybe was afraid we'd have
nothing else to talk about.

784
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:07,723
Couldn't get him off my mind.

785
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:12,928
His nut-hugger jean shorts,

786
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:17,605
his hairy white legs,

787
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:20,102
his protruding eyes...

788
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:24,345
even imagined myself kissing him

789
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,016
And you know what?

790
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,679
It didn't feel all that strange.

791
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,970
Started imagining his balls

792
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,143
wondered if they were hairy.

793
00:53:46,677 --> 00:53:50,517
Was so flipped out
never set foot back in the shop.

794
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:56,022
I'm telling you,
it was a weird feeling.

795
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,721
Sometimes think should've tried.

796
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:04,060
Should've tried it with a dude.

797
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:07,189
It pisses me off
that I'm not more open.

798
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:12,932
Between the way see myself and
what am, there's a fucking abyss.

799
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:15,723
Didn't do anything with him.

800
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:18,144
- Know.
- Just want to make it clear.

801
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:19,979
Was talking about myself.

802
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:21,896
Know you're not gay.

803
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:23,480
Know you know.

804
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,143
Wish were more of a fag.

805
00:54:30,552 --> 00:54:32,104
It'd make tomorrow easier.

806
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,601
Tomorrow!

807
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:42,387
Do you think sleeping with someone
breaks something?

808
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:44,636
Mean,

809
00:54:45,427 --> 00:54:49,516
how many ex-lovers
are you still friends with?

810
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:51,393
It's far worse...

811
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:54,765
never stay more than five minutes
after ejaculating.

812
00:54:55,969 --> 00:54:57,723
You don't plan on coming in me?

813
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,977
So you agree I'm fucking you?

814
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:02,222
We said we'd draw lots.

815
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:04,511
Bring the condoms.

816
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:08,346
In the plural?

817
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:16,059
Don't know why told you
that story. It's so weird.

818
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:21,557
'Cause even if think
know what am,

819
00:55:23,552 --> 00:55:26,598
still felt something for that guy.

820
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,855
Don't think
lever felt anything like that.

821
00:55:34,135 --> 00:55:35,973
Me either, personally.

822
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:39,306
But do like George Michael.

823
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,229
Does that mean anything?

824
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:43,769
Hey guys, what about Dalida?

825
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:47,517
<i>More words, always words</i>

826
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:50,436
<i>The same words</i>

827
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:54,808
<i>Nothing but words...</i>

828
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:04,726
You OK?

829
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,302
It was along night.

830
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:36,427
Don't know why I'm doing this,
but feel committed.

831
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:40,388
The only explanation have

832
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,730
is that my personality
has several facets.

833
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:45,974
Multiple aspects.

834
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,519
When we met, one of these facets
fell head over heels for you.

835
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:55,188
It was exciting.

836
00:58:55,802 --> 00:59:00,602
Wanted to spend my life with you,
buy a house, have kids.

837
00:59:01,344 --> 00:59:02,517
But then...

838
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:04,807
this facet

839
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:06,725
grew bigger

840
00:59:07,094 --> 00:59:08,895
It grew until it took over.

841
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:11,097
It turned into a monster

842
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:14,478
that devoured all other aspects
of my personality.

843
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,058
Overall, I'm happy-

844
00:59:18,594 --> 00:59:23,014
But must not be that happy
because want to do this thing.

845
00:59:26,885 --> 00:59:28,437
Then you have to do it.

846
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,095
Are you serious?

847
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,684
Yes.

848
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:40,889
You talk about the different facets
of your personality.

849
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:46,686
Do you think I'm just an image stuck
in the kitchen. Your little wife?

850
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:48,726
No.

851
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:53,223
My world isn't confined to you.

852
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,261
You're not enough for me either.

853
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,563
Of course...

854
00:59:59,302 --> 01:00:00,724
mean, can imagine.

855
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:04,970
What do you mean?

856
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,805
You remember when
went to Benedicte's party,

857
01:00:12,135 --> 01:00:13,724
the one with her friends?

858
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,764
About a year ago?

859
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:17,682
Drank too much.

860
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:24,847
And let myself go with some guy

861
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:28,557
in the bathroom.

862
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:34,225
We hadn't even spoken much
to each other. It was something...

863
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:37,306
It was animal like.

864
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,393
He instantly turned me on.

865
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:44,719
The more he touched me,
the more wanted.

866
01:00:45,302 --> 01:00:47,139
It's like he opened a door.

867
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,845
A door to a part of myself...

868
01:00:50,469 --> 01:00:51,938
that didn't know.

869
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:56,887
And came a different way.

870
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,730
It was powerful.

871
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,345
It did me good. It was fantastic.

872
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,272
Afterward s,
knew what was coming home to.

873
01:01:07,302 --> 01:01:11,011
<i> Knew what I wanted.
Everything was clear to me.</i>

874
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:14,219
<i>It's as if</i>

875
01:01:14,885 --> 01:01:16,355
<i>As if was.</i>

876
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:17,847
<i>yours.</i>

877
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:20,185
<i> was with you, was your wife</i>

878
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,147
And yet,
could turn on the whole world.

879
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,105
It made me...

880
01:01:27,052 --> 01:01:28,687
It blew my mind.

881
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:31,685
<i>It's as if you came with me too</i>

882
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,267
It felt good.

883
01:01:35,094 --> 01:01:36,480
It was soothing.

884
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:39,100
And it was simple.

885
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:43,604
It only happened once.

886
01:01:43,802 --> 01:01:46,480
Never told you because...

887
01:01:46,677 --> 01:01:50,268
maybe my vision of you
was too rigid.

888
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:58,513
Now see what you mean
about me not being enough.

889
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,302
Listen...

890
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:07,598
don't ask me to try to understand
what you're doing, because can't.

891
01:02:09,177 --> 01:02:10,220
It was only once?

892
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:13,640
Shut up and listen to me.

893
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:16,849
It's not the same.

894
01:02:17,427 --> 01:02:19,146
You have to do this.

895
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:24,513
We can't live together
if we keep things locked inside.

896
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:26,058
They have to come out.

897
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,470
Or go in.

898
01:02:27,885 --> 01:02:28,762
Do what you want.

899
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:31,686
But you need to know

900
01:02:32,427 --> 01:02:34,893
if this is essential for you.

901
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,472
You need to know now,
before we have a child.

902
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:16,261
Good evening.

903
01:05:01,135 --> 01:05:02,889
- Who is it?
- It's me.

904
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,846
- Me who?
- Come on, open up.

905
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:09,348
Hey pal, come in.

906
01:05:12,469 --> 01:05:14,554
Got us the wedding suite.

907
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:16,809
It's very beige.

908
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:18,724
Every modern comfort.

909
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:22,015
Here's the gear.

910
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:25,061
Listen...

911
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:31,848
know it's not exactly
what we had in mind but...

912
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:34,888
it'll give it a certain mood.

913
01:05:35,094 --> 01:05:37,855
A grassroots feel, an artsy touch.

914
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,679
It's a film about two pals.

915
01:05:40,885 --> 01:05:43,184
So think it'll do the job.

916
01:05:43,385 --> 01:05:46,810
It has a few special effects
and we can retouch it.

917
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:47,934
OK, cool.

918
01:05:54,052 --> 01:05:55,723
The thing that makes

919
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:59,854
this whole story
original and interesting is that

920
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:04,188
it's about two straight friends
getting off together.

921
01:06:05,552 --> 01:06:10,222
But how will people know
we're really straight

922
01:06:10,427 --> 01:06:11,813
if we don't tell them?

923
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,179
You mean like an introduction?

924
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,602
Bingo.

925
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:26,016
To be honest, think it shows
on my mug that I'm straight.

926
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:28,261
No?

927
01:06:36,844 --> 01:06:38,016
That's good.

928
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:39,594
Can you just...

929
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:41,511
That's perfect.

930
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,011
Cool.

931
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:44,345
OK then

932
01:06:45,844 --> 01:06:46,970
It's rolling.

933
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,516
Hi, I'm Ben.

934
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,646
I'm Jean-Francois.
Everyone calls me Jeff.

935
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,846
- We're making...
- A film.

936
01:07:01,052 --> 01:07:02,391
A film.

937
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:04,386
No. Cut.

938
01:07:05,677 --> 01:07:08,178
Seattle. Gotta do it in English.

939
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:09,726
You think so?

940
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:13,011
With the hat and in English.

941
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,515
This is stupid.

942
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:39,808
We're French, we do it in French.
We'll subtitle the beginning.

943
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:44,143
Especially since the other part
will be more visual.

944
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:55,012
- ??? <i>Ben.</i>
- ??? Jeff

945
01:07:56,385 --> 01:07:58,435
<i>- Go on.
- No, you start</i>

946
01:07:58,885 --> 01:08:00,723
<i>So, we're making a film.</i>

947
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:03,889
<i>But first,
we wanted to introduce ourselves.</i>

948
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:06,386
<i>We 're old friends,</i>

949
01:08:06,594 --> 01:08:08,597
<i>we've known ear:it other for ages.</i>

950
01:08:08,802 --> 01:08:10,473
<i>We were at art school together</i>

951
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:15,057
<i>and when we finished,
we said we'd do something together.</i>

952
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:20,022
<i>But we took very different paths.</i>

953
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:22,352
<i>Jeff has become a sort</i>

954
01:08:23,594 --> 01:08:26,972
<i>of adventurer who travels the world.</i>

955
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:31,346
<i>I'm married, have a wife, a house.
All that jazz.</i>

956
01:08:31,552 --> 01:08:33,851
<i>He turned up two days ago.</i>

957
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:36,851
<i>And here we are.</i>

958
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,147
- <i>And so</i>
- <i>And so</i>

959
01:08:39,344 --> 01:08:42,722
<i>we heard about your festival
at a party.</i>

960
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:44,515
<i>And we thought</i>

961
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:48,561
<i>it would be kind of original to see</i>

962
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,387
<i>two straight guys in action
in front of the camera.</i>

963
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:55,936
<i>We were totally trashed
when we got the idea,</i>

964
01:08:56,135 --> 01:08:59,146
<i>but then it turned in to
a hetero macho trip.</i>

965
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,181
<i>I'm the dude, I'll nail you.</i>

966
01:09:01,385 --> 01:09:04,100
<i>- No, I'll nail you.
- I'll nail you.</i>

967
01:09:04,302 --> 01:09:06,554
<i>But we managed to get past' that</i>

968
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,605
<i>and here we are.</i>

969
01:09:10,302 --> 01:09:12,601
<i>We can '1' say we 're exactly relaxed.</i>

970
01:09:13,594 --> 01:09:16,556
<i>We 're actually pretty scared.</i>

971
01:09:17,552 --> 01:09:19,472
<i>But we said to ourselves:</i>

972
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:22,639
<i>”Isn't an artist's real role</i>

973
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,311
<i>to push limits to the extreme?”</i>

974
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:26,683
<i>You bet.</i>

975
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,186
<i>So here we are
and guess you're going to see...</i>

976
01:09:35,594 --> 01:09:37,146
<i>What you're going to see.</i>

977
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,513
<i>I think it's in the can.</i>

978
01:09:47,885 --> 01:09:49,225
<i>I'm good if you are.</i>

979
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:52,058
<i>- We can always change it later.
- Yeah.</i>

980
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,761
But it's good for now. It's good.

981
01:10:08,635 --> 01:10:11,598
I've got this funny feeling
in my gut.

982
01:10:15,427 --> 01:10:16,683
You bet.

983
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:19,057
Let's stop yacking

984
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,477
and just get to it.

985
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,679
You know what?
I'll put the camera right here,

986
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:29,394
next to the bed.
I'll count to five and we kiss.

987
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:30,512
This is it.

988
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:32,558
What about our tongues?

989
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:37,354
Maybe it would be more...

990
01:10:38,427 --> 01:10:39,387
More what?

991
01:10:39,594 --> 01:10:41,015
Don't know, more...

992
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:43,471
Whose tongue, yours or mine?

993
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:45,226
How about both?

994
01:10:45,594 --> 01:10:48,272
We've got to stop thinking
or we'll go nuts.

995
01:10:48,469 --> 01:10:49,180
We can draw lots?

996
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,935
We're not going to draw lots
over a French kiss!

997
01:10:53,135 --> 01:10:56,015
- Our tongues will improvise.
- Instinctively.

998
01:10:57,844 --> 01:10:58,886
Instinctively.

999
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:00,480
Instinctively!

1000
01:11:03,844 --> 01:11:04,851
Hang on.

1001
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:17,636
Wait.

1002
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,019
Gotta piss.

1003
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,397
Hurry UP-

1004
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:46,934
Ready?

1005
01:11:48,552 --> 01:11:49,476
Ready?

1006
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:52,142
Ready!

1007
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,188
- Five.
- Four.

1008
01:11:56,385 --> 01:11:57,641
- Three.
- Two.

1009
01:11:58,135 --> 01:11:58,977
One.

1010
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,058
That wasn't so bad.

1011
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,057
- It wasn't so horrible.
- It wasn't so horrible.

1012
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,470
It was awful.

1013
01:12:20,844 --> 01:12:22,053
Awful.

1014
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,303
This'll be tough.

1015
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:32,605
Agree.
We'll do it “Pretty Woman" style.

1016
01:12:32,802 --> 01:12:34,852
Agree, no kissing.

1017
01:12:35,052 --> 01:12:37,730
Kissing is too intimate,
we just need to...

1018
01:12:37,927 --> 01:12:39,681
- Charge in.
- Charge in.

1019
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:41,437
No big deal.

1020
01:12:41,635 --> 01:12:42,927
No big deal!

1021
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:51,104
Pure muscle. Check it out.

1022
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:52,475
It's well hidden.

1023
01:12:52,677 --> 01:12:54,016
No big deal!

1024
01:12:54,218 --> 01:12:55,807
That's it, let's go.

1025
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,350
No big deal. Socks?

1026
01:12:57,635 --> 01:12:58,975
Socks, OK.

1027
01:13:02,718 --> 01:13:04,887
We've taken a huge fuckin' step.

1028
01:13:06,427 --> 01:13:09,010
Hang on,
can make a weird suggestion?

1029
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:10,635
- Weird?
- mean...

1030
01:13:10,843 --> 01:13:13,688
What if we just hugged each other
bare-chested?

1031
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:17,637
You mean like if we
ran into each other at the pool.

1032
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:20,261
- That's it.
- In our bathing suits.

1033
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:23,225
Yeah, like we were greeting
each other.

1034
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:27,932
Jeff! Shit, man,
haven't seen you in ages.

1035
01:13:28,135 --> 01:13:30,304
- How's it going, dude?
- How are you?

1036
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,141
- Great. And you?
- You're lookin' good.

1037
01:13:33,343 --> 01:13:35,228
I'm so happy to see you.

1038
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:38,603
- You look great.
- You too! Shit, this is wild.

1039
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:13,012
There's one subject we've avoided.

1040
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:17,558
Don't know.

1041
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:20,599
Don't know what to do.

1042
01:14:24,385 --> 01:14:26,767
Maybe we should go easy
on the vodka.

1043
01:14:31,135 --> 01:14:33,387
- Viagra?
- Viagra.

1044
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:35,932
On a Sunday night...

1045
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,562
Without a prescription.

1046
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:45,354
Don't get something.

1047
01:14:47,468 --> 01:14:49,388
There's something don't get.

1048
01:14:49,593 --> 01:14:50,601
What's that?

1049
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:54,724
Don't turn you on?

1050
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,059
Maybe if saw your thing.

1051
01:15:04,718 --> 01:15:06,389
You want to see my thing?

1052
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,104
- You'll take off running.
- I'll take my chances.

1053
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:12,762
- You want to see my thing?
- Yeah.

1054
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:24,595
What about you?

1055
01:15:25,718 --> 01:15:27,105
You want to see mine?

1056
01:15:27,302 --> 01:15:28,558
Why not?

1057
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:52,848
Forget the blow jobs.

1058
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,806
There's Plan B.

1059
01:16:01,302 --> 01:16:03,554
One of us goes in the bathroom.

1060
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:07,101
He... comes back hard.

1061
01:16:09,885 --> 01:16:11,686
We could try that.

1062
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:14,896
I'm not sure I'll stay hard
when come back.

1063
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:19,141
Hang on, when you think about it...

1064
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,896
We want to make a film...

1065
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,803
that's a bit...

1066
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,511
A fuckin' work of art!

1067
01:16:27,718 --> 01:16:29,603
Art is so...

1068
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:33,596
Art's a big fuckin' deal!

1069
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:36,978
We want to have an experience,
not get it over with.

1070
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,310
Not with our eyes closed.

1071
01:16:40,177 --> 01:16:40,971
Right.

1072
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:44,810
Something we didn't think
we could do, and we did it.

1073
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:48,269
Like bungee jumping.

1074
01:16:48,468 --> 01:16:50,269
You jump, you go for it.

1075
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,979
Think they have VOD?

1076
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,431
What turns you on?

1077
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:08,598
What do you mean?

1078
01:17:08,802 --> 01:17:10,224
What gets you hard?

1079
01:17:11,135 --> 01:17:12,771
What are your fantasies?

1080
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:16,641
Something you've never done before.

1081
01:17:21,718 --> 01:17:23,638
Dunno, lots of things.

1082
01:17:24,135 --> 01:17:25,889
All kinds of ideas.

1083
01:17:26,552 --> 01:17:27,642
Such as?

1084
01:17:36,343 --> 01:17:39,686
Dunno, a blindfold over my eyes...

1085
01:17:40,635 --> 01:17:43,136
Not knowing who I'm with, see?

1086
01:17:46,468 --> 01:17:48,388
What about bondage?

1087
01:17:50,593 --> 01:17:52,892
Maybe. It depends who with.

1088
01:17:53,718 --> 01:17:55,354
Like to be hit.

1089
01:17:59,093 --> 01:18:01,061
A good spanking gets me...

1090
01:18:03,052 --> 01:18:05,517
- Idiot!
- I'm being serious.

1091
01:18:06,802 --> 01:18:08,011
Hit me.

1092
01:18:09,802 --> 01:18:10,560
Hit you?

1093
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:12,141
Slap my ass.

1094
01:18:13,927 --> 01:18:16,392
Go on. There's just the two of us.

1095
01:18:18,635 --> 01:18:19,975
Are you shitting me?

1096
01:18:20,177 --> 01:18:21,848
No, hit me.

1097
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,224
Go on, harder.

1098
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:29,637
Yes.

1099
01:18:33,218 --> 01:18:34,605
- Stop it!
- More.

1100
01:18:34,802 --> 01:18:36,354
- Stop it!
- Go on.

1101
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,679
There, take that!

1102
01:18:39,885 --> 01:18:41,556
Stop it! What're you doing?

1103
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,637
- I'm hard!
- Stop it Jeff!

1104
01:18:44,843 --> 01:18:46,100
Are you crazy? Get off.

1105
01:18:46,427 --> 01:18:47,387
I'm gonna do it.

1106
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,681
What're you playing at?

1107
01:18:49,885 --> 01:18:51,272
- I'm hard.
- Get off!

1108
01:18:51,468 --> 01:18:53,637
I'm gonna do it, swear!

1109
01:18:53,843 --> 01:18:56,060
- Get off me, Jeff!
- Go on, move!

1110
01:18:56,302 --> 01:18:56,978
Fight back!

1111
01:18:57,177 --> 01:18:59,014
Stop it, you fuckin' idiot!

1112
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:00,771
Insult me, you bitch!

1113
01:19:00,968 --> 01:19:02,723
Get off me, dammit!

1114
01:19:02,927 --> 01:19:05,261
- Take your shorts off.
- My hands are tied!

1115
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:10,803
Don't believe it!

1116
01:19:13,427 --> 01:19:15,146
You fell for it!

1117
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:21,437
You fuckin' hurt me.

1118
01:19:22,177 --> 01:19:23,896
Where? Let me see.

1119
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:26,600
Want a massage?

1120
01:19:26,802 --> 01:19:27,844
Get outta my way!

1121
01:19:30,593 --> 01:19:33,805
We said we were making
a film together. Together!

1122
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:38,348
By consent! Mutual consent!
Not a rape!

1123
01:19:39,843 --> 01:19:41,100
A rape...

1124
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:45,723
OK, it wasn't the best way
to go about it.

1125
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:47,559
We'll find a way.

1126
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:13,849
Hello, I'd like to order some food.

1127
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:17,022
<i>Two cheeseburgers,
2 fries, and 2 Cokes.</i>

1128
01:20:17,218 --> 01:20:18,391
Diet Coke for me.

1129
01:20:18,593 --> 01:20:20,394
No, a Diet Coke.

1130
01:20:22,343 --> 01:20:24,429
One Diet Coke and 1 regular.

1131
01:20:26,302 --> 01:20:28,636
One regular and 1 Diet Coke, yes.

1132
01:20:28,843 --> 01:20:29,886
That's it.

1133
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,267
Thank you.

1134
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,517
- Five.
- Four.

1135
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:45,975
- Three.
- Two.

1136
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:47,018
One.

1137
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:46,643
Think I'm in deep shit with Anna.

1138
01:22:50,135 --> 01:22:51,936
I'm in deep fuckin' shit.

1139
01:22:55,635 --> 01:22:57,057
Feel pathetic.

1140
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:03,934
I'm lucky she puts up with me.

1141
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:07,636
She loves you.

1142
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:12,558
She supports you.

1143
01:23:14,177 --> 01:23:16,642
She understands you, accepts you.

1144
01:23:20,968 --> 01:23:24,098
But think she might make
your life hell now.

1145
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:31,516
I'm hot

1146
01:23:33,802 --> 01:23:35,093
I'm very hot.

1147
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:39,303
Hot in what way?

1148
01:23:40,302 --> 01:23:43,016
I'm sweating
and my heart is pounding.

1149
01:23:44,385 --> 01:23:46,056
Want your pedometer?

1150
01:24:07,718 --> 01:24:09,389
Better get going.

1151
01:24:21,718 --> 01:24:23,270
Better go home.

1152
01:24:25,468 --> 01:24:28,893
Put things right with Anna and fast.

1153
01:24:29,093 --> 01:24:30,266
You bet.

1154
01:24:31,635 --> 01:24:32,761
Know what mean?

1155
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:34,971
Know exactly what you mean.

1156
01:24:36,177 --> 01:24:39,270
I've always known,
sometimes even before you.

1157
01:24:56,677 --> 01:24:57,435
Come here.

1161
01:25:31,635 --> 01:25:33,519

1162
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:36,728
Don't make promises

1163

1165
01:26:13,427 --> 01:26:14,766
<i>Hi} ??? Ben</i>

1166
01:26:14,968 --> 01:26:17,267
<i>I'm Jean -Francois.
Everyone calls me Jeff</i>

1167
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:21,013
<i>- We're making...
- A film.</i>

1168
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,640
<i>A film.</i>

1169
01:26:24,468 --> 01:26:25,476
<i>No. Cut.</i>

1170
01:26:25,843 --> 01:26:28,770
<i>Seattle. Gotta do it in English.</i>

1171
01:26:29,052 --> 01:26:30,142
<i>You think so?</i>

1172
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,605
<i>With the hat and in English.</i>

<i>But first, we wanted
to introduce ourselves.</i>

1175
01:26:52,718 --> 01:26:57,637
<i>We're old friends,
we've known ear:it other for ages.</i>

1176

together and...</i>

1177
01:27:00,677 --> 01:27:02,929
<i>But we took very different paths.</i>

1178

who travels the world.</i>

1179
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:10,517
<i>I'm married, have a wife, a house.</i>

01:27:10,718 --> 01:27:12,354
<i>All that jazz.</i>

And here we are.</i>
