I would never trade my woman in.

'cause she's ugly.

Maybe so. But I would rather take
a Hyundai instead of a Ferrari any day...

'cause you could leave her

for her yet to do in this life.

'cause after the people see you two...

1183
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,592
all they want to do
is run for the door.

1184
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,363
Thanks for giving my song to Elliot.

1185
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:15,436
- Well, it was good, man.
- Still, you didn't have to.

1186
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,842
Yes, I did.

1187
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,414
That's what brothers do.

1188
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,384
- LeRoy from Fame, baby.
You gonna remember our name.
- Back one more time.

1189
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:38,162
- Can I help you gentleman?
- Oh, no, thanks. We're fine.

1190
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:41,725
Well, no, you're not.
This is private property.

1191
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,963
Mr. Sang, what are you doing?

1192
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:50,408
I'm surveying the property.
We begin construction soon.

1193
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:54,004
Construction? You don't...
You don't own the property.

1194
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:58,416
Oh, I'm sorry. L... I assumed that
since you hadn't repaid your loan...

1195
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,454
that you had conceded that detail.

1196
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:05,118
- Damon, what's he talkin' about?
- Yeah, what's goin' on, man?

1197
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,628
Mr. Sang, please get off my property.

1198
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,630
As you wish.

1199
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:14,691
We can finish it in, what, 32 days?

1200
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:18,034
Leave now. Please.

1201
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,804
Okay. I will get
in touch then, Mr. Powell.

1202
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,725
- Damon, what's going on?
- Ma, I can explain.

1203
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:40,624
[All Yelling]

1204
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,735
Hey! Hey, easy! Yo! Yo!

1205
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:53,569
Hey, take it easy.
Take it easy. Check it out.

1206
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:56,269
It don't matter what deal Damon signed.

1207
01:16:56,378 --> 01:17:00,212
- Come on. I'm half owner
here, and I didn't sign it.
- [Woman] Thank God.

1208
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,648
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

1209
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:06,983
Yes, you did.
I forged your signature.

1210
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,819
- Oh! What?
- [All Yelling]

1211
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:13,292
You're an accountant.!
You should know better, man.!
You should know better, man.!

1212
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:18,230
Hey! Hey! Come on!
Yo! Yo! Easy! Easy! Take it easy! Kill it.

1213
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:22,599
Come on. Seriously. What was
my brother supposed to do, huh?

1214
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:25,672
Let my mother die?

1215
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,839
Because ofhim,
she's sitting here alive today.

1216
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,781
I'm glad he did what he did.

1217
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:38,512
Now, I think if it was your family,
you would do the same thing.

1218
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,555
Mookie's right.
Instead of pointing fingers...

1219
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,955
we need to figure out
a way to pay Sang back.

1220
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:45,549
- Yes!
- Yeah.

1221
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,357
Unless, of course, you intend to sell.

1222
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,795
No. I don't want to sell.

1223
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:54,562
Good. Then let's do
something about it.

1224
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,763
- Yeah! Come on!
- Yes.

1225
01:17:56,872 --> 01:18:00,569
[Woman] All I want to know is,
what's going in there?

1226
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,976
A driving range, a Korean market
and a full-service spa.

1227
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,980
I'm a charted member.

1228
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:10,017
That's all good for you,
but can't none of us get in there.

1229
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:14,452
What do you care? You don't golf,
eat Korean food or bathe.

1230
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:16,888
- [Laughing]
- Look, look. The point is...

1231
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:20,155
- they're driving us
out of our own neighborhood.
- That's right.!

1232
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:23,595
- And when's it gonna stop?
- Everyone, please.

1233
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,795
This is not about us against them.
That's not why we're here.

1234
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:31,464
This is about preserving
what is good in this community.

1235
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,905
And Powell Gas is one of
the best things in this community.

1236
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,034
- Can I get an amen?
- [All] Amen!

1237
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,840
This is about coming together
as a community...

1238
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:42,747
and doing not what is profitable,
but what is righteous.

1239
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,842
- Can I get an amen?
- [All] Amen!

1240
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:48,081
This is about putting our minds
and our spirits together...

1241
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:53,628
and figuring out a way to raise
$100,000 to pay back Mr. Sang.

1242
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,697
Can I get an amen?

1243
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,758
Come on, everyone.

1244
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,997
We can do this.
Let's put our heads together.

1245
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:08,600
Within one of us there is the answer.
Who amongst us holds it?

1246
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:13,536
- Lil Maxso.
- Why don't we just have a gas sale?

1247
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:17,015
A gas sale? Young man,
that's the most ridiculous...

1248
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,714
- That's a great idea, Maxso.
- [Cheering, Applause]

1249
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:25,691
- That was... That was marvelous.
- Good thinkin', Maxso.

1250
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:28,319
With all the people that Chris
has helped in this neighborhood...

1251
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,364
I'm sure everybody would buy gas.

1252
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:33,525
- All we'd have to do is get the word out.
- Yeah!

1253
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,502
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute now.
There's just one problem.

1254
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:40,041
Now, we only make 14 cents
on a gallon of gas. Tops!

1255
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,975
We'd have to sell
over 700,000 gallons.

1256
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,478
Damon, I can get you the gas at my cost.

1257
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,640
- God bless you, Sam.
- [Cheering]

1258
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:52,186
Whoa, what's that,
another 20, 25 cents?

1259
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:55,256
Unless we clear a dollar a gallon,
it ain't gonna happen.

1260
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:57,257
Even then it'll be tough.

1261
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,487
I'll get the station to do
a month-long promotion.

1262
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:03,996
We'll give away free C.D. S and T-shirts
to everyone who fills up at Powell Gas.

1263
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,660
- That-That's still not gonna be enough, Theo.
- You not lettin' me finish.

1264
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:11,762
You slash the price of your gas down to
92.3 cents a gallon... our call numbers...

1265
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:15,001
and I guarantee you that Hot 92 JAMS
will put up a dollar...

1266
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,637
for every gallon of gas sold
for the next 30 days at Powell Gas.

1267
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,614
- Now, will that help?
- [Cheering]

1268
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:28,478
All right, all right. Well, then,
that settles it. Let's get started.

1269
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,582
- We got work to do.
- [Cheering]

1270
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:38,389
All right, y'all.
Hot 92 JAMS, the most music. What's up?

1271
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,866
You got your boy Theo
in the place to be...

1272
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,666
broadcasting live from the Powell Gas
and Market on Crenshaw and 29th...

1273
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,003
in beautiful downtown Leimert Park...

1274
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:51,568
where we're selling gas
at 92.3 cents a gallon, y'all.

1275
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,982
That's right. Our goal is
to sell 100,000 gallons of gas
in the next 30 days. Why?

1276
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:00,179
To save Powell Gas and Market which
has been serving the community here...

1277
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:02,188
for the past 40 years.

1278
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:07,626
That's 92.3 cents a gallon brought
to you by Hot 92.3 JAMS of L.A.!

never dropped out of DeVry, bro.

- the way you're selling gas.
- It's unbelievable, man.

We're almost halfway there,
and it's only been a week.

Mook, what do you say, man?

Give everybody the rest of night off,
come back fresh tomorrow?

Sounds good. I'm just worried
about old dude over there.

1307

[Mook]
Maybe somebody should stay the night.

- He's just watching. Actually, he's very nice.

Still, I think somebody should stay.

Good, man. But remember,
we're only paying for up to a 100,000.

1324
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:51,645
Oh, that's cool.
Appreciate it, man.

1325
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:55,011
- [Vehicle Backfiring]
- Oh, excuse me.

1326
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:02,651
- [All Yelling]
- Pump the gas! Don't flood the engine!

1327
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,260
- Hey, there's your problem.
- What?

1328
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,630
- Somebody poisoned the tank.
- With what?

1329
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:16,829
That's a good question.
Whatever it is, it corroded the lining.

1330
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,930
- Those large flakes are metal.
- So why don't we get new tanks?

1331
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:23,977
Just the permits alone is gonna take you
a couple of months, not to mention the cost.

1332
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:26,308
How could someone poison the tanks?

1333
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:29,872
Will, did you notice anything last night?
You were up, right?

1334
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,418
Yeah, I was up.
I told you I'm a vet.

1335
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,315
Okay, I might have
nodded out a little.

1336
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,756
- Oh, man!
- [All Talking, Indistinct]

1337
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,057
- Come on. It's not his fault.
- You know somethin'? She's right.

1338
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,291
We all know
whose fault it really is.

1339
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,231
Mookie, come back here, man.

1340
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:51,738
- Mookie, don't!
- No. I'm not lettin' him get away
with it. You know he did it.

1341
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:54,933
No, I don't know that.
And neither do you.

1342
01:26:56,778 --> 01:27:00,680
Let me talk to him.
He'll be honest with me.

1343
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:19,290
- Papa.
- What do you want?

1344
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:24,929
I need to talk to you, Daddy.
I know you're upset with me.

1345
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:29,609
You've disgraced your mother...

1346
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:32,942
me and yourself.

1347
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:36,448
I'm sorry, Daddy...

1348
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,985
but I love him.

1349
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,612
And if you love me,
you'd respect that.

1350
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,920
If you respect me,
you would not love him.

1351
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,392
Especially someone
who spreads lies about me.

1352
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:50,794
Calls me a thief,
a racist and even worse.

1353
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:57,834
Well, now he's saying
you sabotaged their gas tanks.

1354
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,501
And what did you say?

1355
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:07,306
I couldn't imagine my father
doing such a thing.

1356
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:09,747
That you were an honorable man.

1357
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:16,490
Did you do it?

1358
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:25,662
Why, Dad?

1359
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:31,699
I offered them a fair price.
They should have taken it.

1360
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,105
It wouldn't have
come down to this.

1361
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,837
I did what I had to do.

1362
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:46,910
So we're gonna have a full setup here...
a food court, retail spaces and a day spa.

1363
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:53,653
- May I help you?
- No, no, no. Please, please,
don't get up, gentlemen.

1364
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:55,786
Allow me to introduce myself.

1365
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,797
I'm Councilman Tripp.

1366
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:02,268
You know Damon and Mark Powell,
their mother, Loretta, uh...

1367
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,634
their attorney, Mr. Garrison.

1368
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,730
- The Reverend Thompson.
- Hello.

1369
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,275
And of course,
you know your daughter, Jee.

1370
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,474
Excuse me, but I'm in
an important meeting.

1371
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,983
You will need to
set up an appointment.

1372
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:21,749
You didn't have an appointment when you
sent your boys over to our station last night.

1373
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:25,986
Please leave,
or I'll have you escorted out.

1374
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:31,353
Before you do anything
you might regret, Mr. Sang...

1375
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,434
maybe you'd better
take a look at this.

1376
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:36,770
I offered them a fair price.

1377
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:40,272
They should have taken it.
It wouldn't have come down to this.

1378
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,968
I did what I had to do.

1379
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,910
Mr. Sang, our business is concluded.

1380
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:53,419
Wait. Please.
L-I can explain. Wait!

1381
01:29:56,724 --> 01:30:02,287
- [Sighs]
- I'm so sorry to see that happen.

1382
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:06,527
But since you have a few minutes,
perhaps you can hear us out.

1383
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:10,798
In addition to forgiving the Powells
of their $100,000 loan...

1384
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:15,740
we expect you to pay for all repairs
and upgrades to the Powell Gas station...

1385
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:21,338
contribute $10,000 to the Chris Powell
Community Center and, uh...

1386
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:24,816
- I forget anything?
- Oh, yeah, there's one more thing.

1387
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,888
I don't want you
takin' this out on Jee.

1388
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:32,221
I swear, I hear one thing, I'm gonna
take this straight to the police.

1389
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:39,122

1393

It's gonna be under renovation
for another couple of weeks, but
the market is open for business.

1394
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:14,261

- And we are down here
having this great block party...

1395
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:19,101
to congratulate the community for giving it
up and helping to save Powell Gas.

No.

But you can take me
out to dinner tonight.

1404

Hey, I wanna go!

You always want to go.

An Asian dude named Theo?

selling this place?

1411
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:11,914
I don't think we can.
All these people would kill us if we did.

1412
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,127
So does that mean you're staying?

1413
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,254
I can handle it own my own
if you don't want to.

1414
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,424
Please, you couldn't pay me
enough to leave.

Besides, who's gonna run
this station when you off on tour?
