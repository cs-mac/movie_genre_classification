1
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:58,593
Already at dawn Antonia knew that her days were numbered.

2
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:03,431
She also knew that her last day had come.

3
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:08,477
She was not bad, but in contrast to the most-

4
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,815
-Did Antonia when the measure was filled.

5
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:27,079
She would call in those she loved.

6
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:30,791
Then she would close her eyes and die.

7
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,515
Farmer Bass would cobble coffin.

8
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,688
Olga, Russian, would sweep her with great delicacy.

9
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:57,193
It would not be something to be ashamed of.

10
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,786
Her grandchildren would sit by her side-

11
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,539
-for she wanted to know exactly how Döden-

12
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:14,961
- would bring her beloved grandmother to himself.

13
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,883
And...

14
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:24,303
It's time to die.

15
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,780
She got up to begin its final day.

16
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:30,990
Is this?

17
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:34,368
Yes. Here it is.

18
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,980
It does not look like much.

19
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:06,692
It did not 20 years ago when I moved, either.

20
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,528
It has not changed.

21
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:23,626
It is not particularly beautiful, but at least it is quiet.

22
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:40,685
Were you born here?

23
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:47,483
Shortly after the war, Antonia home to bury his mother.

24
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:50,945
But the mother was still alive.

25
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:02,623
Your useless lump! Your shameless thief!

26
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:18,514
Just to let you know that I know.

27
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:21,934
Do you think I'm blind?

28
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:27,773
I do not see that you take them in the alley behind the church?

29
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:36,115
Completely gone. But as difficult as ever.

30
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:40,870
Your hypocritical wretch! Piece of shit!

31
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:46,459
She is right. Father was a dirty old man.

32
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,378
He's been dead for 30 years.

33
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:53,799
I have come home now, mother.

34
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:56,969
I came as fast as I could.

35
00:07:57,053 --> 00:08:00,014
This is my daughter, Danielle.

36
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:04,226
Get out of my sight! Vipers!

37
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,358
False and ruthless! Boozer! Your perverse lecher!

38
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:14,028
Evil! Vicious and diabolical was you!

39
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,966
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit ...

40
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,469
Antonia?

41
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,888
Olga!

42
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,017
Antonia...

43
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,689
And, mor.

44
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:53,651
Too late, as usual.

45
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,905
Just like your father. Amen.

46
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,578
Vila i frid, mor.

47
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:08,457
Though it seems unlikely.

48
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:42,366
That's Chiel. We met some.

49
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,369
Hello, Chieltje!

50
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,539
What old he has become.

51
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,548
There lives Krum finger. We were good friends.

52
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:01,260
I wonder how he made it through the war?

53
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,319
It's Crazy Madonna. She becomes moonstruck and barks.

54
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,407
Then the Protestant Furious.

55
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:28,204
He stands over her, in several ways.

56
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:38,547
That's Russian Olga café.

57
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:43,010
She is also a midwife and liksveperska.

58
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:46,514
Where men pee on Saturday nights.

59
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,850
Then it stinks so that the nails kroknar.

60
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:54,146
And the nuns ... They apparently have not died out yet.

61
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:57,084
It is of course nonsense. But it belongs to.

62
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:39,543
If you look at ... the black sheep's back.

63
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:45,466
Proficient observed. Are you both drunk and blind now?

64
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:53,140
Just as hot-tempered and ugly as they did before

65
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:56,727
but you've got a well-layered girl.

66
00:12:56,811 --> 00:13:03,651
Look at my sons, thoroughbred stallions both. Available to marriage.

67
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:08,322
Ready for breeding. It would be something for your girl?

68
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:13,160
Olga? A gin tack.

69
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:17,206
I have a daughter to offer too.

70
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,254
She is certainly retarded but strong as a pregnant sow.

71
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:26,757
And bridal chest has been full time.

72
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:29,635
Deedee! Kom hit!

73
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,140
Are you deaf, kid? Come in, I said.

74
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:39,103
Come, so they can watch you. Come now.

75
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:45,568
A hearty bite. Here you should see.

76
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:48,779
Does anybody want?

77
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:59,165
Hello there! Where will you go?

78
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:03,085
Drink the beer and shut your dirty mouth.

79
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:30,029
Antonia and Danielle returned to Antonia's roots.

80
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:39,246
They settled in the pink house.

81
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,918
They lived their own life, and the villagers found themselves in it-

82
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:47,630
- that you accept crop failures, malformed children

83
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:53,678
- and the obvious, albeit unreasonable, in God's omnipresence.

84
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:23,124
There was one who was happy to Antonia had returned.

85
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:27,003
Krum Finger never went outside the door-

86
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:31,340
- as Antonia took his daughter with him on a visit.

87
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:47,416
Remember how we used to walk in the woods?

88
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,711
The forest got to see a lot of, it.

89
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:55,049
- How's your wife? - Good. Just great.

90
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,381
Come on, you idiot.

91
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,976
Came back! You ungrateful dog!

92
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,396
Your miserable swine! Came back!

93
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:56,861
Admittedly figured lip slower than others-

94
00:17:56,944 --> 00:18:00,823
- but when he chose Antonia went quickly.

95
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:08,789
Farmer Bas had only lived in the village for 20 years-

96
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:15,129
- which complicated relations with other farmers, but not with Antonia.

97
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:49,956
Now the church well get drunk.

98
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:13,145
Backward Deedee lived on a large farm with parents and two brothers.

99
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:18,651
As the men yelling and screaming was noted there that the women said nothing.

100
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:40,047
Where the hell are my Sunday shoes?

101
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:44,218
Have you seen my shoes?

102
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:15,833
A voluminous woman, it was her. Coba.

103
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:20,171
She was drunk on moonshine before the fair.

104
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:26,469
Then she dung cart and pushed his way between the church visitors.

105
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:34,226
Here is Bertje. His father was in the textile industry.

106
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,688
Krumfinger Bertje and I were friends.

107
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:42,026
He was an insurgent and hid Jews in the attic.

108
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:47,740
Someone turned him in, and they were shot them all.

109
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:55,623
And who did not dare to give him last rites?

110
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,700
Hello?

111
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,539
Anybody home?

112
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:45,381
I...

113
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:49,218
I would like to talk to you.

114
00:21:49,302 --> 00:21:52,179
About what?

115
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,604
About us...

116
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:04,775
If the marriage ... I was thinking ...

117
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:10,239
You are a widow, and my wife is dead.

118
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:17,622
You are a beautiful woman ...

119
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:24,462
My sons need a mother.

120
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,632
I do not need your sons.

121
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:30,301
Not?

122
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:32,637
No.

123
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:42,271
- Do you not a man? - Why?

124
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:51,948
Feel free to come and help us with things we can not do themselves.

125
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:57,370
It would be nice if we could get some help.

126
00:22:57,453 --> 00:23:01,040
What do I get in return?

127
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:06,003
A cup of coffee, fresh eggs, vegetables.

128
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:09,423
Everything I own.

129
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:19,517
Well then. I'll think about it.

130
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,923
Behave yourselves, boys.

131
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,536
Beware.

132
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:35,176
Bass came regularly and Antonia gave him his friendship

133
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:38,930
But no more than that so far.

134
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,494
- I would borrow the saw. - I'll get it.

135
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:04,622
I can do that.

136
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:47,373
Holy shit!

137
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,695
Ta said!

138
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,531
Pips! Pips!

139
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:23,868
Little friend...

140
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,871
I'll bake a cake for you ...

141
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:29,081
Så and ...

142
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:32,585
Then, you get to swim ...

143
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:37,089
And tomorrow you should get new glasses.

144
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,841
The village obviously knew everything.

145
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:24,971
But they were silent as the grave Pitte been close to getting into.

146
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:36,148
When the wounds were healed disappeared Pitte- no one knew where.

147
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:48,119
"Kaka flock together," said Antonia.

148
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:51,622
Deedee and lip found each other.

149
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:37,687
- Have Krum Finger seen it? - He only cares about books.

150
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:43,109
It's not good. There is so much I can not.

151
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:58,791
So Danielle started art school. She was happy.

152
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:45,296
Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into years.

153
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:51,969
Antonia sowed and Danielle painted, the fields were green and yellow.

154
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,727
Done? Drag.

155
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:16,369
Mother?

156
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:19,205
Mother!

157
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:21,958
I want to have children.

158
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:29,382
How did you get such thoughts?

159
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,303
Barn?

160
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:42,687
A man, then? Should not you have a husband, too?

161
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,357
No. I do not think so.

162
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:04,166
It only becomes difficult if we take someone from the village.

163
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,169
Farmers are just söner-

164
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:11,841
- and they do not look further than the next korumpa.

165
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:23,477
Take a deep breath.

166
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:30,318
Through the nose! In a few months we will go to standard

167
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:34,280
- and where we find the father of your child.

168
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:27,541
What is this?

169
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:31,671
There seems to be a home for fallen women.

170
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:36,050
Will they ever be able to get up? We go.

171
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:39,053
Come in. Come and sit.

172
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,724
Come and sit.

173
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:55,987
For my part, I can not imagine anything better than being pregnant.

174
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,240
This is my second and, believe me:

175
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:05,997
It's not mating act that is important, and not the child.

176
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,252
It is very wearing and giving birth. That's wonderful.

177
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:34,108
We are looking for ...

178
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:40,906
- ...a man. - A man? Who is not?

179
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,871
A man who can ...

180
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:52,752
... impregnate me. There is a child, I want-not a man.

181
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:55,212
He does not know.

182
00:34:55,296 --> 00:35:00,384
As they say: What you do not know can not hurt you.

183
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:06,057
I'll do it.

184
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:11,228
Here.

185
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:19,070
Stylish motorcycle!

186
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:23,658
What He supports himself on faith?

187
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:29,747
- Does he have good genes? - We are related.

188
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:43,381
One more time.

189
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:43,482
- Did you see the stars? - No. Should it?

190
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:47,653
- It learns to help ... - It is probably not well.

191
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:51,365
- I'm starving. - It's a good sign.

192
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,784
We are a fertile offspring.

193
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:58,039
Thanks. And do not hesitate if you need my help.

194
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:02,543
- Come on. - This is gonna be good.

195
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:09,634
He would do well even if he was not genuine.

196
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:15,640
A kind of corruption that infects us all.

197
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:21,854
For that warns us of Peter, the rock on which the Church is founded on:

198
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:26,525
For those who allow themselves to be guided by the carnal begären-

199
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:29,946
-and who despise authority.

200
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:36,702
Jews kingdom went under because of the accursed Jezebel and a daughter.

201
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:43,334
Even more shame is that these varelser-

202
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:48,047
- are women. They should be a föredöme-

203
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,717
-i subjection and obedience

204
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:56,847
- and teach their daughters to live in chastity.

205
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:59,475
May they reverse the signal

206
00:39:59,558 --> 00:40:06,315
- so that they avoid being thrown into hell fire on Judgment Day!

207
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:43,853
Base realized that there was only one solution: blackmail.

208
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:28,230
Jesus, Maria, Josef...

209
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:32,526
And Jesus said to them:

210
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:37,490
"He who is without sin, let him throw the first stone."

211
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:44,080
And just as they had to do, we should examine our conscience

212
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:48,376
- before we sit in judgment of others.

213
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:54,173
Let us also remember that salvation came into the world through a woman.

214
00:41:54,257 --> 00:41:59,345
To her, asking no vain for help and protection.

215
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:06,727
Let us remember the text on one of our female saints days:

216
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:10,147
She opens her mouth with wisdom.

217
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:14,443
On her tongue is friendly admonitions.

218
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:17,989
She is a good Mistress

219
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:22,076
And do not eat the bread of idleness.

220
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:43,014
Danielle gave birth to a daughter and named her Lisa.

221
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:17,965
The years went by.

222
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:23,930
When Antonia and Danielle visited Krum finger followed by Thérèse.

223
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:30,478
She seemed to understand him better than what Danielle had done.

224
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:35,858
If we now imagine a different tidsskala-

225
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:40,363
- so that 80 years would end on 29 days-

226
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:43,699
-or last for 80,000 years.

227
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:48,412
- Time ... - What is it? Do we have time?

228
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:52,208
We have found the time.

229
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:55,294
The ants may have their own time ...

230
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:58,339
- And the crickets ... - and the bees ...

231
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:01,592
- And the butterflies' time. - And the trees time.

232
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:06,013
- Star Time. - And the lunar time.

233
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,520
- You smell bad finger. - Yes ...

234
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:16,357
It's the smell of the past.

235
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,487
Finger and Thérèse took each other to the heart.

236
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:37,587
Their churches dogmas stood in the way of their love.

237
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:44,218
Protestant had longer to Madonna than she to the moon.

238
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:55,062
The chaplain resigned his office.

239
00:44:55,146 --> 00:45:01,152
His exuberance was at odds with the Church's joy at the death.

240
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:21,505
I am free! I am free!

241
00:45:42,234 --> 00:45:44,570
Deedee?!

242
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:42,837
A while ago you asked for my hand.

243
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,425
It you can not get, but the rest you get.

244
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:57,727
After many years of abstinence, I feel the urge again.

245
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,105
Shall we say once a week?

246
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:07,486
A bit more often, perhaps? At least sometimes?

247
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,656
If the need arises ...

248
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,245
If the need arises, we will definitely consider it.

249
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:24,962
And not at the home of one of us. In our age, we should be for ourselves.

250
00:48:21,185 --> 00:48:26,107
The seasons came and returned. The time propagated the signal

251
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,653
- but to give life to something other than itself.

252
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:03,769
Letta!

253
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:08,065
Is it time again? How many have there been?

254
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:11,902
I have nowhere to go.

255
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:16,866
For the future of children doing what I kan.-Come in!

256
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:33,132
Simon, my äldste.-hat!

257
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:36,302
And this is Arletta.

258
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:40,348
Is it...

259
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:44,852
- It's Lisa. My daughter. - So cute...

260
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:51,817
- Sure, I have become great? - Dad in the day.

261
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:57,156
- How's dad? - Good. He has married.

262
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:02,495
With an ugly and wise woman who has a heart of gold

263
00:50:02,578 --> 00:50:07,541
- and a brewery. He is very happy.

264
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:14,173
- Who is it? - It is the priest.

265
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:21,764
- He has resigned his office. - Oh ...

266
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:35,653
- God bless you. - It is to be hoped ...

267
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:51,419
The priest made her children every year-

268
00:50:51,502 --> 00:50:55,047
- and they lived happily ever after.

269
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:17,945
- When did you learn to count? - When I was three.

270
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:22,074
- Who taught you? - I taught myself.

271
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:26,245
And Krum Finger has helped me.

272
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:29,790
How much is 147 times 48?

273
00:51:29,874 --> 00:51:33,669
7056, of course.

274
00:51:39,175 --> 00:51:42,678
The root of it is 84th

275
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:49,310
And the square of it is 49,787,136th

276
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:59,028
It is sad to have to say it, but your daughter is not normal.

277
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:04,951
- I'm a prodigy. - Yes, I'm afraid so.

278
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:09,413
This is Lara Anderson, Thérèse teacher.

279
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:13,834
She has a great first class, of course, with 30 children.

280
00:52:13,918 --> 00:52:17,296
- It is a difficult task. - Very.

281
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:23,761
Thérèse is far ahead of the others and needs a lot of attention.

282
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:28,349
What I suggest is that you in the family-

283
00:52:28,432 --> 00:52:33,104
- take responsibility for that she gets extra tuition.

284
00:52:33,187 --> 00:52:38,276
In addition, I adapt lessons to her needs.

285
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:41,737
What subjects are you good at?

286
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:46,284
All spectrum of colors. She is really good at painting.

287
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:48,953
And she can do carpentry.

288
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:52,915
Krum Finger can help us. He knows too much.

289
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:59,213
- Philosophy, poetry, religion ... - Logic. Science.

290
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:04,176
I suggest two or three hours a day.

291
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,346
Should the passage is?

292
00:53:13,394 --> 00:53:17,023
Would it fit, do you?

293
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,900
Starting with.

294
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:29,160
What time was that she was coming?

295
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:35,207
Would she not come for the food? It is now.

296
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:40,379
But she might have been delayed? Or so she does not desire?

297
00:53:46,552 --> 00:53:50,222
- That was the day she would come? - Yes.

298
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:54,644
Drinking her coffee or tea?

299
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:59,690
How should I know? Stand still or sit.

300
00:54:13,996 --> 00:54:16,540
Stig in.

301
00:54:16,624 --> 00:54:19,252
Hej, Theresa.

302
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:22,046
- Hi! - Hi!

303
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,054
Mother Teodora says that God created everything.

304
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:34,392
But she does not think of who created God.

305
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:39,730
It is tragic that so many let faith prevail over the intellect.

306
00:54:39,814 --> 00:54:46,028
I think I see that religion often causing death and destruction.

307
00:54:46,112 --> 00:54:48,906
But now it was Plato.

308
00:54:52,451 --> 00:54:55,871
Is not it terrible that nothing is.

309
00:54:55,955 --> 00:54:58,874
Why is there so much.

310
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:08,884
Should I tell you how to eat artichokes?

311
00:55:08,968 --> 00:55:14,473
Artichokes are large, round, thick vegetables.

312
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:18,477
The leaves are fleshy and tender.

313
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:23,441
First you boil them. Then pull the leaves, and a one-

314
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:27,361
-and dip them in a FRENCH DRESSING.

315
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:33,701
Then scrape the soft flesh with his teeth until it reaches the heart.

316
00:55:33,784 --> 00:55:38,456
- The heart? - Yes. Heart.

317
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:45,296
- What to do with the heart. - It enjoys one of the.

318
00:55:45,379 --> 00:55:49,508
One piece at a time. With closed eyes. It's a delicacy.

319
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:53,721
- Is the whole a delicacy? - Yes it is.

320
00:55:53,804 --> 00:55:57,850
Should I get someone lesson, right?

321
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,876
And they beat the love in full bloom.

322
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:04,393
I can not sleep.

323
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:34,924
This year Madonna died of a broken heart.

324
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:58,030
Protestant followed her soon after. "Force of habit," said the village.

325
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,502
They disagreed BREAD AND NOT BED

326
00:59:11,586 --> 00:59:14,755
EXPOSE THE GRAVE share the

327
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:36,152
Dan fell from the combine and broke his neck.

328
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:48,164
After having been missing for 15 years appeared Pitte up-

329
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:51,876
-and demanded his share of the inheritance.

330
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:56,339
Hit with cuddling ...

331
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:48,140
Looking at ...

332
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:56,107
My ladies...

333
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:05,074
- Who is it? - Satan.

334
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:17,712
Thérèse grew up with Simon, Lettas eldest son.

335
01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:22,633
He was in love with her and would remain so.

336
01:01:22,717 --> 01:01:27,847
Simon is in love! Simon is in love!

337
01:01:30,308 --> 01:01:35,605
Thérèse soon discovered that it needed more than the head.

338
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:41,193
Music and Mathematics gave birth to the heart and brain.

339
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:46,824
She concentrated on the elements and came to master both.

340
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:51,245
Your thesis is, without doubt, its merits.

341
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:57,752
But it is important that you stay within the established framework.

342
01:01:57,835 --> 01:02:02,214
I had specifically said no more than two pages.

343
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:06,761
And you wrote five. Therefore, you will fail.

344
01:02:06,844 --> 01:02:12,475
Within our subject is of the utmost importance ...

345
01:02:12,558 --> 01:02:18,940
"Championship is found in the ability to restriction."

346
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:23,361
Since you do not differ in quantity and quality-

347
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:28,950
- I am forced to conclude that you are incompetent.

348
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:36,916
For the sake of truth.

349
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:39,794
For the revolution!

350
01:02:48,052 --> 01:02:50,304
Bottoms Up!

351
01:03:27,466 --> 01:03:31,512
In these enlightened days became Thérèse raped.

352
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:35,600
Av Kernels.

353
01:03:35,683 --> 01:03:38,728
My treat!

354
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:41,939
Beer for all!

355
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:48,863
Do you have something to celebrate?

356
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:53,909
If you have the good way?

357
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:00,249
Sleep tight.

358
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:45,753
He is not here.

359
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:25,042
Get up!

360
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:35,386
Out! Fast!

361
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:00,411
Stay!

362
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:05,791
- Take reasoning ... - No.

363
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:10,630
You move, I'll shoot.

364
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:14,008
I could kill someone, it would be you.

365
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:19,764
But I curse you, and my curse will follow you for life.

366
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:22,808
Tig!

367
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:29,398
If you ever return should my anger tear you to pieces.

368
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:33,861
My hatred will destroy you, your legs will krossas-

369
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:38,240
- split your teeth, your tongue be filled by each.

370
01:06:38,324 --> 01:06:42,995
Will you come back, the water you drink poison you.

371
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:49,418
The food you eat will rot in your throat the air you breathe devour your lungs.

372
01:06:49,502 --> 01:06:55,258
In vain will you plead for relief of your pain. This is straffet-

373
01:06:55,341 --> 01:06:58,636
Because you have raped a child.

374
01:08:55,169 --> 01:08:57,880
Help me.

375
01:09:50,474 --> 01:09:55,855
Janne was then the owner of the farm and thrived in his new role.

376
01:09:58,357 --> 01:10:03,321
The village is buzzing with rumors, but no one was singled out.

377
01:10:03,404 --> 01:10:08,200
They rejoiced over the dear anförvantens death.

378
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:49,450
My scores will be built.

379
01:10:49,533 --> 01:10:52,078
Are you happy about it?

380
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:57,083
And...

381
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:05,007
Little friend..

382
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,721
The world is a helvete-

383
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:16,560
- where both tormented souls and devils dwells.

384
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:21,732
Schopenhauer?

385
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:35,371
The saying is wrong: Time does not heal all wounds.

386
01:11:35,454 --> 01:11:40,459
But the pain is alleviated and memories fade.

387
01:11:43,796 --> 01:11:48,884
The years went by. Thérèse celebrated twenty years.

388
01:11:52,096 --> 01:11:57,768
Assume: The singular chain complex of the empty set is zero.

389
01:11:57,852 --> 01:12:03,024
Assuming 5.8 gives the nth homology group is as fellow

390
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:09,697
- nth relative homology group if we, as a subspace, take the empty set.

391
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,825
Now we can construct a functor from ...

392
01:12:12,908 --> 01:12:19,248
From the 2-category of topological pair to the category of chain complexes.

393
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:24,879
Define functor S * as follows:

394
01:12:24,962 --> 01:12:30,593
S * of an ordered pair (X, A) is the singular kedjekomplexet-

395
01:12:30,676 --> 01:12:37,016
- the room X modulo complex of A.

396
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:56,410
She spent time with some intellectuals, but was not satisfied.

397
01:12:57,161 --> 01:13:01,707
It neokapitalistiska samhället-

398
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:08,381
- make a socialist alternative to a non-material adaptation.

399
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:12,635
If a man is a cross of rela-

400
01:13:12,718 --> 01:13:17,056
- this is what it primarily to process.

401
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:22,853
All relationships are disturbed, because the system makes it impossible to healthy relationships.

402
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:28,109
Just take the relationship between man and woman.

403
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:33,823
There is no chance when the community does not guarantee a greater consensus.

404
01:13:33,906 --> 01:13:38,327
Their sophistry insulted her intellekt-

405
01:13:38,411 --> 01:13:42,623
- and it was weak even with the physical exchange.

406
01:13:42,707 --> 01:13:46,419
What have I done?

407
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:53,509
Thérèse who was used to bring the best, found himself not in it.

408
01:14:02,977 --> 01:14:07,940
Simon was not intellectually the equal of Thérèse-

409
01:14:08,024 --> 01:14:13,070
- but their friendship turned into love, and she was satisfied.

410
01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:16,699
Will you marry me?

411
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:21,203
It only leads to misery if we marry.

412
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:26,125
I would have too little time for you.

413
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:30,463
But we love so well.

414
01:14:30,546 --> 01:14:33,507
Just because.

415
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:36,385
Okay then.

416
01:15:11,295 --> 01:15:14,382
I think I'm pregnant.

417
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:19,428
With children?

418
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:28,688
And.

419
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:37,488
- Oh ... - Do you want it?

420
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:40,616
- Of course she wants. - Not at all.

421
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:44,370
- Of course she wants. - That you're not?

422
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:47,832
- Of course she wants. - Not at all.

423
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:51,043
- Why not? - Why should she?

424
01:15:51,127 --> 01:15:55,047
- It should not she. - It is she certain.

425
01:15:55,131 --> 01:16:00,720
- And, and, and ... - Nej, nej, nej ...

426
01:16:00,803 --> 01:16:03,514
Now?

427
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:06,976
This I have to think it over carefully.

428
01:16:09,312 --> 01:16:12,690
Have you no compassion on the child?

429
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:17,778
Would you not spare the suffering of living?

430
01:16:17,862 --> 01:16:22,450
Should you deliberately forcing a child to life?

431
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:26,746
Set aside Schopenhauer. This is important.

432
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:30,541
How can we bring more children into the world?

433
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:33,711
This vile world ...

434
01:17:02,156 --> 01:17:06,327
Thérèse and Simon's daughter named Sarah.

435
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:10,873
A pretty girl. Redhead course.

436
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:17,046
Just like his dad. We are redheads in our family.

437
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:42,488
What a sweet kid ...

438
01:17:50,663 --> 01:17:56,127
Thérèse did not fully embrace the child in the way one might have wished.

439
01:18:02,466 --> 01:18:06,178
Simon could not explain what it was due.

440
01:18:06,262 --> 01:18:12,310
It is sad to have to say it, but your mom is not normal.

441
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:24,238
The time went by. The seasons flowed together and succeeded varandra-

442
01:18:24,322 --> 01:18:27,408
-in a future winding dance

443
01:18:27,491 --> 01:18:33,372
- as to put an end to the eternal circuit time of birth and death.

444
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:53,392
- Hipp, hipp .. - hooray!

445
01:18:53,476 --> 01:18:57,688
- It is for you. - Did you think we had forgotten?

446
01:18:57,772 --> 01:18:59,857
We had not.

447
01:18:59,941 --> 01:19:04,654
Now you start with Sarah finger.

448
01:19:04,737 --> 01:19:09,575
Then we read Nietzsche together.

449
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:13,537
Why do you never go out, Finger?

450
01:19:16,499 --> 01:19:20,503
The best thing is to not have been born.

451
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:24,507
Not to be. Being nothing.

452
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:29,095
- The next best thing is ... - Stop now, finger.

453
01:19:29,178 --> 01:19:31,555
To die.

454
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:59,834
- Mom! Look! - Yes, honey.

455
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:02,420
- Without hands! - Yes Yes.

456
01:20:05,965 --> 01:20:08,593
What happened? Have you fallen?

457
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:15,266
- Can I watch? - Come here.

458
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:19,353
There's iodine in the cabinet there.

459
01:21:16,744 --> 01:21:19,246
Great grandmother!

460
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:27,213
Read what I have written.

461
01:21:32,885 --> 01:21:39,267
- But Deedee is not dead yet. - How nice! Then she read it!

462
01:21:41,769 --> 01:21:46,274
Deedee! I have written something to you!

463
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:49,068
Here! It is for you!

464
01:21:57,493 --> 01:22:02,790
To the dead Deedee. Deedee is a beautiful, dove gray.

465
01:22:02,873 --> 01:22:08,296
But she is not dead. Would she do it, I would miss her.

466
01:22:08,379 --> 01:22:11,966
For after the grandmother and mum

467
01:22:12,049 --> 01:22:14,927
-and Lara and Grandma

468
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:22,226
- Deedee are the finest in the whole village, the whole province, the entire nation

469
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:29,233
- in the whole universe. It's Deedee, and she is not dead.

470
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:34,655
How nice...

471
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:41,996
Now I will write more.

472
01:22:52,548 --> 01:22:57,637
Sarah's poem about Dead Deedee seemed to have revived the Döden-

473
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,974
- for dogs suddenly it very much in the village.

474
01:23:14,445 --> 01:23:20,701
Letta was simply born twelve children, but the thirteenth was her death.

475
01:23:24,121 --> 01:23:26,374
Damn it!

476
01:23:26,457 --> 01:23:30,461
I had wanted to continue for a while.

477
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:44,308
The priest and the twelve children moved, and he became a social worker in town.

478
01:23:52,441 --> 01:23:57,822
Janne got a well-aimed kick a long beaten cow.

479
01:24:08,624 --> 01:24:12,461
Lip died in an accident with traktorn-

480
01:24:12,545 --> 01:24:15,840
-and Deedee was inconsolable.

481
01:24:32,106 --> 01:24:36,193
And than was awful units not.

482
01:25:26,619 --> 01:25:29,705
My dear, little Thérèse ...

483
01:25:35,211 --> 01:25:39,840
It is absurd to think that the endless pain life germanium

484
01:25:39,924 --> 01:25:43,219
-is throughout random.

485
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:50,101
No. So common that the misfortune is, it seems to be the rule.

486
01:25:51,602 --> 01:25:54,981
Whose debt is it that we exist?

487
01:25:55,064 --> 01:25:59,151
Hardly the sun, that has happened to give us life.

488
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:07,660
It is my own guilt, because I do not believe in God or the afterlife.

489
01:26:09,287 --> 01:26:13,749
Otherwise I could allow myself hoping loading

490
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:19,297
- a heavenly dessert after a main course indigestible.

491
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:35,396
I can not accept the widespread view that "everything will be better."

492
01:26:41,777 --> 01:26:44,363
It never gets better.

493
01:26:44,447 --> 01:26:50,453
At best, or at worst, it is only different.

494
01:27:05,176 --> 01:27:07,887
I do not think more ...

495
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:11,474
I want to especially avoid thinking.

496
01:28:35,099 --> 01:28:38,811
Så and ...

497
01:29:07,965 --> 01:29:12,595
After Krum Fingers death drew Thérèse away.

498
01:29:12,678 --> 01:29:17,725
Danielle responded with impotent rage at her daughter's grief.

499
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:42,792
Where is Krum finger now? Where do they go?

500
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:46,212
Krum Fingers body is fire

501
01:29:46,295 --> 01:29:49,799
And the ash is utströdd the ground.

502
01:29:49,882 --> 01:29:52,051
Men...

503
01:29:52,134 --> 01:29:55,263
Nothing dies forever.

504
01:29:55,346 --> 01:29:58,224
There is always something quarterly

505
01:29:58,307 --> 01:30:01,852
-As give life to something new.

506
01:30:01,936 --> 01:30:06,732
So begins life without knowing where it comes from.

507
01:30:06,816 --> 01:30:10,611
- And why it exists. - Why?

508
01:30:10,695 --> 01:30:14,282
Apparently wants life to live.

509
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:20,579
- Is there no heaven either? - The dance we dance is the only one.

510
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:28,212
Who of us will die first?

511
01:30:28,963 --> 01:30:34,135
If I can determine, it will be me who dies first.

512
01:30:34,218 --> 01:30:37,722
But I had not thought to do that yet.

513
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:42,518
I'll tell you when it's time.

514
01:30:42,602 --> 01:30:47,857
But do not worry. I feel I have many years left.

515
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,651
It was good.

516
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:56,115
Deedee...

517
01:30:57,241 --> 01:31:02,121
It should levas- it may make or break.

518
01:31:15,343 --> 01:31:18,721
The time overcame the time.

519
01:31:18,804 --> 01:31:23,100
It was born not as many children as the Lettas time

520
01:31:23,184 --> 01:31:26,979
- but enough of that life would go on.

521
01:31:27,063 --> 01:31:32,526
Sometimes crawled time forward slowly as a turtle.

522
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:39,116
Sometimes stormed to the front like a vulture in search of prey.

523
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,495
The time took no account of death or life

524
01:31:42,578 --> 01:31:48,376
- to wilting or plant, love, hate or jealousy.

525
01:31:48,459 --> 01:31:55,132
The overrode everything that is important to us and that makes us forget it.

526
01:34:49,265 --> 01:34:52,935
Are you not feeling well?

527
01:34:53,019 --> 01:34:55,980
I'm going to die.

528
01:34:56,063 --> 01:34:58,149
Not?

529
01:34:59,275 --> 01:35:01,944
Today.

530
01:35:02,028 --> 01:35:06,365
I had promised to tell you.

531
01:35:06,449 --> 01:35:09,994
Terrible.

532
01:35:10,077 --> 01:35:12,955
It's not easy.

533
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,293
Go get the others.

534
01:35:17,376 --> 01:35:20,046
Little friend...

535
01:35:20,129 --> 01:35:23,925
I will not die until you're back.

536
01:35:31,724 --> 01:35:36,812
Already at dawn Antonia knew that her days were numbered.

537
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:41,275
She also knew that her last day had come.

538
01:35:57,625 --> 01:36:02,171
She would call in those she loved.

539
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:05,925
Then she would close her eyes and die.

540
01:36:17,311 --> 01:36:23,359
Bass would cobble coffin and Olga, Russian, would wrap her,

541
01:36:23,442 --> 01:36:29,907
- with great delicacy. It would not be something to be ashamed of.

542
01:36:51,012 --> 01:36:56,183
Crazy Madonna wants me to come out and play.

543
01:37:34,597 --> 01:37:41,270
Danielle would save her tears, and then let it explode on screen.

544
01:37:57,495 --> 01:38:02,249
Granddaughter Thérèse would consider over-

545
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:07,421
- exactly how much air volume Antonia's last breath contained.

546
01:38:13,552 --> 01:38:17,556
And I, Sarah, her barnbarnsbarn-

547
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,560
- would not leave my beloved gammelmormor-

548
01:38:21,644 --> 01:38:25,898
because I wanted to be when Döden-

549
01:38:25,982 --> 01:38:31,737
- divorced Antonia's soul from her stunning body.

550
01:38:50,089 --> 01:38:54,385
And when this long chronicle has reached its end

551
01:38:54,468 --> 01:38:57,722
-is nothing accomplished.

552
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:03,561
