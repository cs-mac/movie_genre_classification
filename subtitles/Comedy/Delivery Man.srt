1
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:14,492
<i>In many ways,
they'll miss the good old days</i>

2
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,412
<i>Someday, someday</i>

3
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:23,501
<i>Yeah, it hurts to say
But I want you to stay</i>

4
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,546
<i>Sometimes, sometimes</i>

5
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,675
<i>Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth</i>

6
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:36,680
<i>I will do my best</i>

7
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:40,518
<i>You say you wanna stay by my side</i>

8
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>Darlin', your head's not right</i>

9
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,693
<i>See, alone we stand
Together we fall apart</i>

10
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:54,073
<i>Yeah, I think I'll be all right</i>

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,493
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Joey.

12
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,370
Your brother's looking for you.

13
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,463
- Hey.
- Hey, David.

14
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,883
Where the hell were you?

15
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,136
- Did you take the truck home again?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:18,055
Pop asked you not to use the meat truck
for personal purposes.

17
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,225
- Hi, Mom.
- But you did it anyway?

18
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,309
Uh-huh.

19
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,520
- Do you have the jerseys for tonight?
- Yes.

20
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,149
No, no, no, seriously.
Do you have the jerseys for tonight?

21
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,944
- Yes. Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- Aleksy, hang up.

22
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,738
Yeah, sweetheart.

23
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,199
I should never have gotten
this woman pregnant.

24
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,076
Do not procreate, David.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,705
Reproduction is a very bad idea.
Do not reproduce, ever.

26
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,415
Hey, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,252
To pay back some money that I owe,

28
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,339
I've built a little hydroponic greenhouse
in my apartment.

29
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,258
You're... You're growing pot?

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,093
And you're the only person
I know with a green thumb.

31
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:00,097
- And you want me to grow pot?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,932
Right. Absolutely.

33
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,686
That is the one thing missing for me
right now to achieve total happiness.

34
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,229
Getting into a drug ring.

35
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,732
Because the pressure of my wife
calling me every 3 minutes

36
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,360
because she's about to give birth
to my first child isn't intense enough.

37
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,486
How much do you owe?

38
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,864
- 80.
- "80"?

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,784
- 80,000.
- 80,000?

40
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,538
When you say it with that face,
it does make it seem like a lot.

41
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,583
How do you get yourself
into these situations, David?

42
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,959
$80,000?

43
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,921
What happened?
How do you owe someone 80,000?

44
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,256
I borrowed money to invest in Newtech.

45
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,384
- That is a pyramid scheme.
- It is not a pyramid scheme.

46
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,012
- The guy was arrested!
- Those charges were unrelated!

47
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,264
- He was arrested!
- David.

48
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,937
You know, David, I love you like a son.

49
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,605
I am your son.

50
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,274
Which is why I love you like a son.

51
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,611
But if you don't have our new jerseys
for tonight's game...

52
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,779
I have the jerseys.

53
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,323
You gotta have the jerseys.
It's the team picture.

54
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,491
I have the jerseys.

55
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,829
He won't have the jerseys.

56
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,174
Come on, come on.

57
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,307
<i>Your loan has been denied.</i>

58
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,393
But if I don't get the $80,000,

59
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,354
there's people that are
gonna come and drown me.

60
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,231
Can you please put that down
on your little form,

61
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,108
that there's people
that are gonna come drown me?

62
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,318
<i>You do not have
the necessary collateral.</i>

63
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,237
That is why we're not
gonna give you any money.

64
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,531
Basically, then, you're just
a big goddamn pawn shop.

65
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,740
No, we're not a pawn shop.

66
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,868
You're a pawn shop with fancy furniture.

67
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,913
And for all these reasons,
I have to turn down your application.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,623
I'm very sorry.

69
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,584
All right. I understand.

70
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,046
This is a hold-up.

71
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,798
Excuse me?

72
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,591
I said, "All right. I understand."

73
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,678
This is a hold-up, asshole.

74
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,972
- Excuse me, you just said something.
- No.

75
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,725
- Just then, you said something.
- No.

76
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,230
I'm here. I'm David Wozniak.
I'm here to pick up my jerseys.

77
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,440
- I've been waiting for you.
- I know! I know!

78
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,983
I'm so sorry,
but my team photo is tonight.

79
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,151
The whole team has to
have their jerseys,

80
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,235
it's for the whole year.

81
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,611
- All right already!
- Thank you so much.

82
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,821
I really do appreciate it.

83
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,413
Yes!

84
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,839
- A bag?
- No.

85
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,215
Rolling papers?

86
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,759
I grow tomatoes.

87
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:48,265
Hey! It's a delivery truck!
I'm making a delivery.

88
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,475
You're kidding me, right?

89
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,520
Yes. I swear I have the jerseys,
on our mother's...

90
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,399
Yes! On our mother's grave.

91
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,695
The jerseys are with me
in the truck as we speak.

92
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:07,242
Hey! Come on, stop! Hey! Hey!

93
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,162
You got my jerseys!

94
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,949
- I know it's late.
- Yes, it is.

95
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,910
But you brought me
such beautiful flowers.

96
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,411
I did.

97
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,706
And Mr. Bernstein takes
such great care of them.

98
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,504
Where have you been, David?

99
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,880
Emma, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,967
I was trying to pay back
some money that I owe.

101
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:09,638
I understand,
but why can't you call or text?

102
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,807
And why can't I come
to your apartment anymore?

103
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,517
I never said
you couldn't come to my place.

104
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,895
- Are you hiding something?
- Nothing.

105
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,482
You're sure you're not hiding
anything in your apartment.

106
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,193
Nope.

107
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,865
I'm pregnant.

108
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,003
That's great.

109
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,008
Yeah.

110
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,635
- Emma...
- No.

111
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,638
You know what? I can...

112
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,724
I can do this on my own.

113
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,684
What do you mean, "on your own"?

114
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,477
I want a child, okay?

115
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,314
But I don't want a father

116
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,191
who just disappears
because he gets too busy.

117
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,483
You're unreliable.

118
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,736
I mean, you've got...
You've got money problems.

119
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,489
You basically don't have a life.
This is not a life.

120
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,825
- I have a life.
- You don't have a life.

121
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,244
People who have a life do not ring
pregnant women's doorbells

122
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,495
at 3:00 in the morning.

123
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,997
I didn't know you were pregnant.

124
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,041
David, you would know.

125
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,419
If you just called me
every once in a while.

126
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,392
I guess...

127
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:42,981
I guess at first, for a second there,
I was in shock.

128
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,275
I mean, you know, it was a shock.

129
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,819
But then, you know, the...

130
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,407
That feeling of fear went away,
and I got this feeling that

131
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,329
this could be the most beautiful
thing that ever happened to me.

132
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,665
Stevie, no. Hey, Stevie, no!

133
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,125
Hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

134
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,293
Back to bed. Not in the sandbox.

135
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,045
Hey, where are you going?
No, don't go in the sandbox.

136
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,422
Not in the sandbox!

137
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,385
You gotta talk Emma
into getting an abortion.

138
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,761
- What?
- You have to.

139
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,721
How could you say such a thing?

140
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,182
How can you say stuff like that
in front of your children?

141
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,393
My children know that
they're too old to be aborted.

142
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,147
I'm realizing that I might want a kid.

143
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,401
You are a free man.
You do not want kids.

144
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,111
Kids are a black hole.

145
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,657
They will suck up all of your energy,
your money, your time, your hair.

146
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,867
Remember when I had great hair?

147
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,120
I can't get it up anymore.

148
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,080
How can you talk like this
in front of your children?

149
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,498
I can say anything I want
in front of my children

150
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,874
because they don't listen to me.

151
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,460
My children do not pick up on
the frequencies of my voice.

152
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,170
And I'm telling you,

153
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,090
I have a problem
achieving a full erection now.

154
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,677
It's not normal for a man of my age
to no longer have a nice, big erection.

155
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,264
Hey, what are you doing?
Listen to me, go back to bed.

156
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,515
Not in the sandbox.

157
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,184
Don't get in the sand.
Don't go in the sand!

158
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,147
- As your friend...
- Daddy?

159
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,566
No. No, no, no. Hey.

160
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,276
- Dad.
- Back to bed, honey.

161
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,402
Daddy.

162
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,696
I'm trying to have a conversation.
Please stop that.

163
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,573
- Daddy!
- Okay, stop that now.

164
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,910
I'm telling you, I think I might want a kid.

165
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,039
As your friend and as your lawyer,
David, may I be brutally frank with you?

166
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,249
Sure.

167
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,712
You don't have the skills
to bring up a child.

168
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,673
I need order in my life.

169
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,385
And this is order?

170
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,347
I think this is beautiful.

171
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,516
Daddy!

172
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,419
David Wozniak.

173
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,592
Uh, the back door was
already broken into.

174
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,428
My name is Mark Williams.
I'm an attorney.

175
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,848
I've been trying to contact you
for several days now, Mr. Wozniak.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,107
I do not have a great deal of time.

177
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,359
I shall be brief.

178
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,611
Between 1991 and 1994,

179
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,407
you donated sperm
under the pseudonym "Starbuck"

180
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,159
at the privately-owned
Graboski-Levitt Clinic,

181
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,245
which I represent.

182
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,871
No.

183
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,375
That was not a question,
it was a statement.

184
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,086
We have all the documents
necessary to prove it.

185
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,845
Over the course of 33 months,
you were a very, very frequent donor.

186
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,806
You donated 693 times

187
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:08,687
in exchange for which
you received the sum of $24,255.

188
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,023
Your sperm is of a very high quality.

189
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,025
Oh, thank you.

190
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,154
I'm sure your sperm is also high-end.

191
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,822
Uh...

192
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:23,285
Certain complications arose,
which meant that for a period,

193
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,537
Mr. Graboski-Levitt gave your sperm

194
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:30,167
to all the women in his clientele.

195
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,712
You have sired 533 children

196
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,423
and 142 of them
wish to know your identity.

197
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,591
What?

198
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:43,138
You are the biological father
of 533 children.

199
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,518
At the time of each of
your multiple donations,

200
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,020
you signed a confidentiality agreement.

201
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,691
Legally, the Graboski-Levitt Clinic
is obligated to protect your identity.

202
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,860
But a subset of your children

203
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,363
is contesting the legality
of those documents.

204
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,201
They wish to know who Starbuck is.

205
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,596
You say that for each
of the 693 sperm donations

206
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,225
you signed a confidentiality agreement
under the pseudonym of "Starbuck"?

207
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,434
Every time. Always.

208
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,770
I always signed the
confidentially agreement, always.

209
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,355
And you signed those documents

210
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,857
before or after executing
the manual labor?

211
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,025
Before.

212
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,236
And you always wrestled
the dragon alone?

213
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,362
Yes.

214
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,697
Frankly, I'm disappointed
you never told me about any of this.

215
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,033
Usually you call up your friends
after you get laid,

216
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,660
not after you wrestle the dragon alone.

217
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,370
But if you absolutely insist,

218
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,332
I promise you I will phone you
every single time I fly solo.

219
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,752
That's an interesting offer.
Unfortunately, way too time-consuming.

220
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,589
Listen, they claim that your right
to privacy should take a back seat

221
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,968
to their basic human right
to know who their biological father is.

222
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:09,182
It's very complex. Very, very complex.

223
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,725
It's...

224
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,894
It's really complex.

225
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,147
Do you know that this is
the dream of every lawyer

226
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,483
to argue a case this significant?

227
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,112
A case that will leave its mark?
That will stand as a precedent?

228
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,407
My mother always said that
I would never amount to anything.

229
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,867
- I'll show that old bitch.
- What do we do now?

230
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,830
As your lawyer, I suggest you
cease masturbating in fertility clinics.

231
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,791
- Do I have to get a real lawyer?
- You can't afford a real lawyer.

232
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,586
I'm gonna call the Bar Association today,
reactivate my license.

233
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,753
You don't have a license?

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,047
I lost it because of a small formality.

235
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:46,011
Something about a missing dated form
and a bribe. It's nothing.

236
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,806
Oh! Yes, in hopes of persuading
Starbuck to meet with them,

237
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,310
142 of the children in your lawsuit
want you to know who they are.

238
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,647
This envelope contains the profiles
of 142 of your children.

239
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,319
Do not open it!

240
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,119
Brett.

241
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,371
Hey, Starbuck.

242
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,164
Don't call me that.
Can Susan take the kids?

243
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,333
When she's not investing
all her energy in her new career,

244
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,461
she prefers to wisely use her time
sleeping with men I don't like.

245
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,712
Do you have a babysitter?

246
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,130
Why, you need someone
to watch over that envelope?

247
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,465
I know I shouldn't have,
but I've opened it.

248
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,758
Worst idea ever.

249
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,010
I picked out one of the profiles.
I just picked one.

250
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,471
One. Do you know
whose profile I picked?

251
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,098
Andrew Johansson.

252
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,520
We got to go.

253
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,834
What do you got?

254
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,669
- $225
- $200.

255
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:53,847
There he is.

256
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,355
Let's go, baby. Take it. Take it.

257
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,942
Come on, 13! Let's go, 13!
Come on, Johansson.

258
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,945
13 is wide open! Let's go!

259
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,283
Yeah!

260
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,912
<i>Andrew Johansson
with the 3.</i>

261
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,083
Play defense, play defense,
play defense!

262
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,128
Play defense, play defense! Yes!
Do you see him? Do you see him?

263
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,880
He stopped it, he blocked it.
He got right in the lane.

264
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,965
Did you see him get in the lane?
Did you see 13 get in the lane?

265
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,133
We got 13, guys.

266
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,261
Why don't they put him in?
Why don't they put him in?

267
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,929
The game's almost over.

268
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,681
Why are they not... They put him in!

269
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,768
<i>Andrew Johansson.</i>

270
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,436
13 seconds.

271
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,937
Okay, set up.
He's open, he's open, he's open.

272
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,647
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

273
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,274
Pass it to 13! Pass it to 13!

274
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,151
Why won't they give it to 13?
Give it to him!

275
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,488
He's open! Catch it. Got it, got it, got it!

276
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,248
Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!

277
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,667
Andrew! Andrew!

278
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>Those were my genes.</i>

279
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,760
My genes were on a professional
basketball court tonight!

280
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,056
In a way, you could say that
that was an extension of myself

281
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,266
that hit that game-winning shot!

282
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,560
I mean, do your kids play
professional basketball?

283
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,562
No, not to my knowledge.
But I will inquire.

284
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,772
They don't tell me everything.

285
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,984
So, I've been thinking
that we could plead insanity.

286
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,154
- What?
- I don't know.

287
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,115
Maybe you would
not be held responsible

288
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,785
for actions taken
while mentally unstable.

289
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,163
We could bank
on your mental problems.

290
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,165
I don't have mental problems.

291
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,254
I don't have mental problems!

292
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,048
When we're in court,
I want you to say it exactly that way.

293
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,467
1, 2, 3, Wozniak!

294
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,386
Let's go.

295
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,888
Come on! One, two. One, two. One two.

296
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,974
Big time, big time, big time!

297
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,517
Let's play some basketball.

298
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,977
Come in. Back up, back up!

299
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,521
Hurry up! Come up, up, up!

300
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,772
- Are you allowed to hit the arm?
- No.

301
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,732
Okay. Pick and roll!

302
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,652
Let's go! Back, back, back! D, D, D!

303
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,487
Great steal! Here we go, hit me!

304
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,948
I'm going in for the jam. Okay, not a jam.

305
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,033
What the hell position is he playing?

306
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,244
A little help? Thank you.

307
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,207
All right.
Why don't we meet up back here at two?

308
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,417
Emma!

309
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,837
Uh...

310
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,463
Give me a second?

311
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,178
I have officially decided to have a life.

312
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,014
I'm at work.

313
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,518
I'm going to convince you
that I deserve to be this kid's father.

314
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,321
I'm sorry, excuse me.

315
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,625
4 days in a row,
I have not had any sleep.

316
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,585
But I've never been so happy in my life.

317
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,463
I never thought that
I would love anyone that much.

318
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,467
The kid poops 4 times a day
and I think I'm losing my mind.

319
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,094
I think I'm going crazy, because I swear

320
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,139
his diapers make me so proud.

321
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,308
I'm totally convinced that my child

322
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,477
takes way better dumps
than any other kid.

323
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,103
Your brother wants parental leave

324
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,981
so he can spend more time
admiring his son's diapers.

325
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,317
It's the law, okay?
I'm entitled to parental leave.

326
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,654
I had 3 kids, and 2 hours
after each of them was born,

327
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,948
I was here, serving customers.

328
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,326
You absolutely have to have kids, David.

329
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,414
What?

330
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,291
My girlfriend's pregnant.

331
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,210
You got a girlfriend?

332
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,461
Yeah.

333
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,756
David, you're gonna love it.
You are gonna love it.

334
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,217
Your kid is never gonna poop
as good as my kid,

335
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,052
but you are gonna love it.

336
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,804
- Can you believe that?
- No.

337
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,700
I promise,
I will only be gone an hour.

338
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:29,247
No, I won't. Look, I've called everyone.

339
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,043
How many times have I covered for you?

340
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,756
Oh, my God, man.

341
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,258
I'm begging you, man.

342
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,177
I really, really need you to do this for me.

343
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,388
I can't even talk to you.

344
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,768
Yeah?

345
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,689
Can I help you?

346
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:01,154
I'll have a espresso to go, please.

347
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,378
I said "to go."

348
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,601
ls there a lid?

349
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,478
Do you have a lid?

350
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,439
Usually, you get a lid
when you order a coffee to go.

351
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,450
$3.25.

352
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,125
You could be a bit more polite.

353
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,543
Polite?

354
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,003
I'm a customer.

355
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,671
You're a barista.

356
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:04,300
Would it be possible
to act in a polite manner?

357
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,551
What the hell are you talking about?

358
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm talking about a little "please"
and "thank you."

359
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,808
- A little thank you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,561
Is that not considered cool
by your generation anymore?

361
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,189
Who the hell are you, man?

362
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,525
I'm just saying if you smiled a little more,

363
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,527
maybe there would be
more people in here.

364
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,820
If you want to be a waiter...

365
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,738
Well, there's the thing.
I don't want to be a waiter.

366
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,073
I'm an actor.

367
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,827
I am an actor missing the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.

368
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,663
And you, because you give me
3 bucks and a quarter,

369
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,248
you want me to smile?

370
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,418
You want me to smile when I am
totally pissing away my life?

371
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,964
It doesn't have to be a big smile.

372
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,216
Okay.

373
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,890
Have a nice day.

374
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,542
Good afternoon.

375
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,545
I'll take care of the coffee shop.

376
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,840
Yes or no?

377
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,677
Customers come in sometimes.

378
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,181
It isn't always empty.
I can't leave you with the shop.

379
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,849
But it's the role of a lifetime.

380
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,685
Yeah, and how do I know
you won't just walk off with the cash?

381
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,521
You can leave with my truck full of meat.

382
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:47,904
And why would you do this?

383
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:52,283
Satisfaction of knowing
that you helped someone

384
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,118
make something of themself.

385
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,416
Bring it back without a scratch.

386
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,799
Okay. People might come in.

387
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,178
I can figure out
how to make a cup of coffee.

388
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,223
All right. Okay.

389
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,018
Thanks.

390
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,903
<i>It is total chaos
in the meat market today, David.</i>

391
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,572
And you decide to disappear?

392
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,366
In the whole family business,

393
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,618
<i>you know you've got
the easiest job, right?</i>

394
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:40,873
<i>And in spite of having the simplest job,
you manage to do the job badly!</i>

395
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,584
It's like everyday you find a new way

396
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,878
to push back the frontiers
of incompetence!

397
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,548
<i>There are only two components
to your chosen occupation.</i>

398
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,884
<i>Get meat, deliver meat.</i>

399
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,094
That's not what I ordered.

400
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,470
It's free.

401
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,138
Take it, it's free.

402
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,100
<i>You're no longer a "deliverer."
You're more of a "keeper."</i>

403
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,852
Why is our truck still full of meat? Why?

404
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,273
Why have you only taken
our meat out for a drive?

405
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,608
- Yeah?
- I'll have...

406
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,111
Tell me who you are
before I call the cops.

407
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:15,908
I'm the waiter.

408
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,535
I'm the owner.

409
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,328
I do the hiring here.

410
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,917
Josh got called in
for the audition of a lifetime.

411
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,378
Fine. He can look for another job, then.

412
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,880
Sir, it was the audition of a lifetime.

413
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,674
That's not the problem.

414
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:33,843
What's the problem?

415
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,595
He's not a good actor.
He has never been cast.

416
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,680
Never.

417
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,849
He's a good kid, but he's wasting his life.

418
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,350
He's fired.

419
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,312
Look, this whole thing was my idea.

420
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:48,232
So, I guess it's your fault
if he can't pay his rent.

421
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,388
I lost my job?

422
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,640
You lost your job.

423
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:26,896
I got the part.

424
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,023
You got the part?

425
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,067
Yeah, they loved me.

426
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,027
You got the part?

427
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,071
As of today, I'm an actor.

428
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,490
- Congratulations, man!
- Thanks.

429
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,658
Thanks, man. Thanks.

430
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,619
Wow!

431
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,370
I knew it!
I knew you were gonna bail on me.

432
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,456
How the hell am I
supposed to pay the rent?

433
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,876
Okay, wait. No, no, wait! Wait!

434
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,798
The cash is on the table.
I'm 4 dollars short.

435
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,675
Peter, you owe me money.

436
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,053
No, you owe me money!

437
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,848
Okay, so then,
what are you gonna do about it?

438
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,933
You told me June.

439
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,686
Tell me,
what am I supposed to do now, huh?

440
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,814
Tell me!
What am I supposed to do now?

441
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,947
Miss, don't worry about the money.

442
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,451
You, uh, won your pizza.

443
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,163
Yeah, you won the contest.

444
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,582
You won our, uh...

445
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,750
You won our "Eat and Win" contest.

446
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,087
I don't know what you want,
but this is not a good time.

447
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,257
I'm not doing too well right now,
so can you leave my apartment?

448
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,508
Yes.

449
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,845
Yes, absolutely.

450
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,016
I'm about to call the police!

451
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,019
No. No need for that at all.

452
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,231
It's only that I can see that
you're not doing very well,

453
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,068
and we have a policy

454
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,947
that's very, very, very strict

455
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,618
in the condition in which
we can leave our customers.

456
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,037
Here at...

457
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,460
At Rocco's Pizzeria,
we believe in a more humane pizza.

458
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,463
So, is everything okay?

459
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,720
Miss?

460
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,571
Shit!

461
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:27,701
Okay, okay, you're okay, you're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

462
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,261
Miss. Miss!

463
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,138
- Kristen?
- Miss!

464
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:50,849
Let go of me!

465
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,102
Kristen! Kristen!

466
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,939
Excuse me, and who are you?

467
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,779
Are you ashamed to say
you're my father?

468
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,122
No.

469
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,457
May I have a word with you?

470
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:20,838
Yes.

471
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,012
The good news is that for the moment,

472
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,640
we just happen to have a spot
open in our rehab program.

473
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,184
The bad news is that your daughter

474
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,979
seems totally uninterested
in the program.

475
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,441
Since she is still a minor,
it's your decision.

476
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,987
- I'm not...
- it's a very good program.

477
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,364
We've gotten great results.

478
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,619
I'll talk to her.

479
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:01,837
Hi.

480
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,131
How are you?

481
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,091
Please sign the release.

482
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,887
Look, I don't know who you are, but...

483
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,515
I'm begging you, sign the papers.

484
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,977
- They have a great program here.
- I can stop on my own.

485
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,064
I mean, I just had the scare of my life!

486
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,941
- Please sign the papers.
- I think the program is...

487
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,778
No, if I do the program
then I'm gonna be surrounded

488
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,447
24 hours a day by addicts.

489
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,326
And I guarantee, I will relapse.

490
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,871
People don't stop using
in these programs.

491
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,499
They stop when they wanna stop.

492
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,710
- They will help you.
- They'll lock me up.

493
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,048
And I'll lose my job. I just...

494
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,716
I just got this great job

495
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,719
and I have nothing in my life
besides this job.

496
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,766
- I'll talk to the...
- Thank you.

497
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,782
I'm going to sign the release.

498
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,952
Worst decision that you'll ever make.

499
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,162
She says she'll be happy.

500
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,415
Right now she doesn't need to be happy.

501
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,750
She needs to stop using.

502
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,836
And she will.

503
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,963
Do you love your daughter?

504
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,841
I do.

505
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,885
Tell her. Go tell her that you love her.

506
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,014
And tell her that you will
not sign that release.

507
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,071
Where do you work?

508
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,366
Bloomingdale's.

509
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,287
You're okay for tonight?
Yes.

510
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,582
- And you got my number.
- Yeah.

511
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,626
- Great. You start work tomorrow at...
- 8:00.

512
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,795
- Okay. And you'll be there at 8:00?
- 8:00.

513
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,464
Okay.

514
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,716
Well...

515
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,470
In my life, I have a tendency

516
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:19,975
to make very, very, very bad decisions.

517
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,898
Tell me that I haven't just
made another wrong decision.

518
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,317
You haven't.

519
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:31,820
Thanks.

520
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,702
Oh, man.

521
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,102
Yes.

522
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,272
Yes!

523
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,110
Thank you, thank you. Yes!

524
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,194
Whoo!

525
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,451
<i>Wonderful</i>

526
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,330
<i>Glorious</i>

527
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,626
<i>The sum of all your experiences</i>

528
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,213
<i>A living breathing result of the fight</i>

529
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,801
<i>And every night
you spent shrouded in darkness</i>

530
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:22,180
<i>Has led you to this moment in the light
It's all right</i>

531
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,183
<i>Wonderful</i>

532
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,146
<i>Glorious</i>

533
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,275
I've never even tried that.

534
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,277
When you do it,
it's different than regular Pilates?

535
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,696
That is why notable
notorious Americans,

536
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,824
such as Roger Morris,
George Washington,

537
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,285
Eliza Jumel and Aaron Burr...

538
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,168
I'm a writer, too. I like to write.

539
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,294
- Oh, that's awesome.
- Yeah, yeah.

540
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,676
- You hold me still.
- Taxi!

541
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,306
All right.

542
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,475
Yeah.

543
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,981
Grab my hand.

544
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,943
- Just watch me dance.
- Okay.

545
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,825
Here, just take it.

546
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,535
Wow! Okay, thanks!

547
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,626
How about hitting this guy up?

548
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,546
Yeah! Do you feel that?

549
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,049
...have all called the
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

550
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,593
- Nice!
- Thank you.

551
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,512
- Exciting.
- Thank you.

552
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,598
It's all right.

553
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,517
No, no. Okay.

554
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,019
Okay, Okay!

555
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:01,029
<i>My love is beautiful
It's here for the taking</i>

556
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,450
<i>It's strong and pure
and utterly earth-shaking</i>

557
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,412
<i>My love has brought me here
to show you it's true</i>

558
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,833
<i>A wretch like me
You'll make it through</i>

559
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,421
Hey, come on, buddy,

560
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,880
what are you doing?
You never see a girl before?

561
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:20,716
Wow.

562
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,385
Honestly, really? Just keep walking.

563
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,804
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, Shorty!

564
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,139
Hello, Ice Queen!

565
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,057
Hey, Ice Queen,
I need a hand over here.

566
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,767
Hey, I need a hand right here!

567
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:32,728
oh!

568
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,229
Did you say "Ice Queen"?

569
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,190
- Did you actually say "Ice Queen"?
- Yeah.

570
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,984
Don't say that!

571
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,819
Don't say stuff like that!

572
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,487
All right.

573
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,242
...all called the Roger
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

574
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:55,417
Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
Was that unbelievable? Unbelievable!

575
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,626
Don't forget the money, guys.

576
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,088
<i>And everything became clear.</i>

577
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,632
I had kind of an epiphany.

578
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,678
I cannot be the father of 533 children.

579
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,971
It's not possible.

580
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,767
It is impossible to be
the father of 533 children.

581
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,186
It is impossible to be
the father of 4 children.

582
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,606
Right! Exactly. It's impossible.

583
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,443
But I can be their guardian angel.

584
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,196
Their guardian angel?

585
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,990
They need me.
They need a guardian angel.

586
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,618
They need someone to look out for them.

587
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:33,663
And I fathered them,
so it's my responsibility.

588
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,459
So, you're telling me that
your purpose on Earth is to look out for,

589
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:41,546
like a superhero, 533 children.

590
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,048
I didn't say "superhero."

591
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,299
Out of curiosity,

592
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,009
when you're looking out
for these children,

593
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,469
will you be wearing any kind of cape?

594
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,763
I didn't say "superhero."
I said "guardian angel."

595
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,974
So, no cape, but you will have wings
and play the harp.

596
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,726
You know I'm starting to feel more
and more comfortable

597
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,894
with this insanity plea.

598
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,981
I do not have mental problems.

599
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,984
Say it exactly like that to the judge.

600
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,820
Thanks.

601
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,661
Hey, there.

602
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,290
So, today is the first ultrasound.

603
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,336
David, look, I need... I need a friend.

604
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,089
- I'm a friend.
- I want that to be clear.

605
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,382
It's clear.

606
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,925
Okay, well, let's get going.

607
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,260
I drank a gallon of water

608
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,512
and I'm not allowed to pee
before the ultrasound.

609
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,773
So, is that the leg there?
That is.

610
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,400
Which one?
Which one's the leg?

611
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,860
The white spot that you see.

612
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,362
- And is that the head up high?
- That is the head up high.

613
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,614
- Okay.
- And we're gonna see right the arm.

614
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,576
- That's amazing.
- Isn't it?

615
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,035
So, now all the organs are okay?

616
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,787
Yep. Perfect.

617
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,124
I just passed by the baby's head.
And there's the belly.

618
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,376
My God, do you see the belly?

619
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,461
And there's the whole baby.

620
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,046
That's incredible.

621
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,216
David, I'm not sure.

622
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,219
Not sure of what?

623
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,597
Look at them. They're monsters.

624
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,682
I mean, look at that one. Look at him.

625
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,642
Emma.

626
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:22,647
This is the most absolute beautiful thing
that can happen to anyone.

627
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,983
Who are you? The Dalai Lama?

628
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,610
What do you mean,
"the most beautiful thing"?

629
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,821
And look at that one.
He's eating his own booger.

630
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,656
It's a great source of protein.

631
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
Listen.

632
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:38,455
You are going to be a good mother.

633
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,258
So, here's what.

634
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,137
Since I absolutely
do not trust you at all...

635
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,642
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna declare you the father.

636
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,976
- Yes!
- No, David, wait.

637
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,229
I'm gonna declare you the father
on probation.

638
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,566
- "Father on probation"?
- Yeah. You get no slack.

639
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,610
For how long?

640
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,445
Forever.

641
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,491
Will our child have to call me
"Daddy On Probation"?

642
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,659
No.

643
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,953
Will I have to wear a uniform

644
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,206
that will separate me
from the regular daddies?

645
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,501
- No.
- Then, I accept.

646
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:28,004
We're having a kid. We're having a kid!

647
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,297
Yes.

648
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:44,980
Your name?

649
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,649
- Earl Monroe.
- And you are?

650
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,526
A friend.

651
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,497
He's over there.

652
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,171
Great.

653
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:11,715
Thank you.

654
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,758
You're not going to visit with him?

655
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,761
No. I...

656
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,682
I just wanted to stop by
and see him, and...

657
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,352
- Well, now I have, so...
- He would really enjoy it.

658
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,193
Yeah, but...

659
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,613
Don't worry, just say
whatever comes to mind.

660
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,965
Hey, Ryan.

661
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:22,285
1, 2, 3.

662
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,595
Earl Monroe.

663
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:45,934
You did good.

664
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,813
I said nothing the whole time.

665
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,357
I couldn't get a word out.

666
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:56,611
You were there. You did really good.

667
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,323
Okay.

668
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,617
Great.

669
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,849
<i>In Athabasca, we set a fire</i>

670
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:28,977
<i>To the world we left far behind</i>

671
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,813
<i>All the faces, we put away</i>

672
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,191
<i>Lost lives float into space</i>

673
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,111
<i>I got a message, I got a sign</i>

674
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,781
<i>Through the wires swinging in time</i>

675
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,868
<i>It's so simple, it's like the sun</i>

676
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:48,037
<i>Shines down on everyone</i>

677
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,166
<i>Black bird, from the blue</i>

678
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,335
<i>I give my love to get used</i>

679
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,755
<i>Our hopes come true</i>

680
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,174
Sabrina!

681
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:01,718
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

682
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,303
- You are late.
- I know, I'm sorry.

683
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:15,732
Thank you very much.

684
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,286
Excuse me.

685
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,538
Sorry.

686
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:32,540
Excuse me.

687
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,764
Look, if we really want
to find out who Starbuck is,

688
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,933
we need these guys to help us
put together the strategy

689
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,893
to make sure that this thing
doesn't turn into a circus.

690
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,896
We don't have the money.
We can do it on our own.

691
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,815
The objective wouldn't be
to always have them there.

692
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:01,486
I think if we just take the time
to check out what they've proposed...

693
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,363
I simply wanted
to express the fact

694
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,573
that I feel we were better off
without them.

695
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,023
Yes, gentleman in the blue.

696
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,401
Do you have a comment?

697
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:53,788
I just want to say that...

698
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,170
I don't know all of you here.

699
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,006
But...

700
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:08,344
But you're all focused, a lot,

701
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,890
on finding Starbuck.

702
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,561
But, whatever happens,

703
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,814
you're all brothers and sisters.

704
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,776
You've all found one another.

705
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,546
- Hey!
- Hey!

706
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

707
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,134
What are you doing here?

708
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,720
I'm... Yeah... You know, I'm...

709
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:52,680
I'm the father.

710
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:56,476
I'm the adoptive father.
I'm Ryan's adoptive father.

711
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,519
- Ryan?
- He's not here tonight.

712
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,980
He's at a home for the disabled.

713
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,274
He's disabled,
and he just couldn't make it.

714
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,401
- Hey!
- Hey.

715
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:08,154
Kristen. This is...

716
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,156
- Taylor.
- Yeah. Taylor saved my life.

717
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:13,326
He saved my life at the pool.
He's a lifeguard.

718
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,663
And I'm the adoptive father of Ryan,

719
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,874
and he couldn't be here,
because he's handicapped.

720
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,250
You're the father of one of the children?

721
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,377
- Adoptive.
- Oh, wow.

722
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,712
- How's it going?
- Hey, hey, hey, Josh!

723
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,881
Yeah.

724
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:33,054
- Josh, this is Taylor, and this is Kristen.
- How's it going?

725
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,140
Josh worked at a coffee shop,
and he is now an actor.

726
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,767
Josh, this is Taylor.

727
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,144
Taylor is a lifeguard.
He saved my life a few months ago.

728
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,897
And this is Kristen. Orders pizza.
She is also an ex-drug addict.

729
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,024
And I'm the adoptive father

730
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,360
of a young disabled man
who couldn't be here.

731
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:48,528
And his name is Ryan.

732
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:50,363
Hey, you're the guy from the park.

733
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,823
- Hey.
- How are you?

734
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,074
Great.

735
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:55,910
Josh, Kristen and Taylor.

736
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:57,078
- Hey.
- How are you?

737
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,287
What's up? Adam.

738
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,999
Kristen has got a great job,
and she's still...

739
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,710
Yep, I'm still working at Bloomingdale's.

740
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,461
So the job, which is great.
Everyone's doing great.

741
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,589
And I'm the adoptive father
of a disabled...

742
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,007
Young disabled man.

743
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,927
Ryan, who was obviously...

744
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:16,514
Unfortunately, was in conflict
with some of the disabled days

745
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,725
of doing the activities and
stuff that we're involved in.

746
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,269
So, I got the stuff for him.
I gotta run out of here.

747
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:23,563
But everyone looks good.

748
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,774
- Good to see you.
- Great. Great to see you.

749
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,822
Taxi!

750
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:42,874
As of tonight, you are officially part of
a mass action lawsuit against yourself.

751
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,292
What the hell are you doing here?

752
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:48,004
A bit of reconnaissance work.
What the hell are you doing here?

753
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,589
I was following one of my kids...

754
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:52,383
But why are you doing this?
Who does things like that?

755
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,051
I don't know, I was curious.

756
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,261
- Stop!
- Stop what?

757
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,221
Stop everything for the rest of your life.

758
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,348
Every time you have an idea,
I want you to come to me,

759
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,976
and as your friend,
I will shoot your idea down.

760
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,478
You're not a normal person, David.

761
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,146
I am a normal person.

762
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:07,148
David, we've known each other
for 20 years.

763
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,150
I can tell you for a fact,
you are not normal.

764
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,401
I'm very normal.

765
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,611
Really?

766
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,279
- What about Mariouka?
- I don't see the point...

767
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,489
5 years ago,

768
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:16,365
you married a Russian woman
that you had never met.

769
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:17,784
She needed to get into the country,

770
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,203
and she promised to clean
my apartment for a year.

771
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,914
And she disappeared after 3 days
with her real husband.

772
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,667
David, how much money
did you lose importing Cuban cigars?

773
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,169
That guy looked very honest.

774
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:30,129
He was in his bathing suit!

775
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:34,509
Since when does anybody do business
with a man in his bathing suit?

776
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:44,143
Listen, for the first time in my life,
I think I'm doing the right thing.

777
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,394
You're not doing the right thing.

778
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,359
Stop seeing your kids!

779
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,714
Where's our money?

780
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,055
I'll get it! I said I'll get it.

781
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,226
It's now $100,000.

782
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:29,772
So, I really need you
to lend me some cash.

783
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,236
Tony. It's David. Yeah...

784
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,155
Hello?

785
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:41,367
Phil! Buddy, how are you?

786
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,786
Rob!

787
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,205
Nelson!

788
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:49,750
All right, don't worry, man. I understand.

789
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,254
No, no. I'll catch you soon.

790
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,946
Hello, David Wozniak.

791
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,327
All the profiles.

792
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,706
And I saw on your overdue bills
that your name is David Wozniak.

793
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,918
I was sitting behind you at the hotel.

794
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,378
My name is Viggo.

795
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,882
I'm your biological son.

796
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,010
Are you gonna expose me?

797
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,805
I don't know.

798
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,478
I don't even really know
why I ever wanted to meet you.

799
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:54,982
Who are you?

800
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,401
What do you do for a living?

801
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,904
I work at a meat store.

802
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,365
I'm a vegetarian.

803
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,786
So, you murder animals.

804
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,372
No. I deliver the meat.

805
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:10,957
I don't murder it.

806
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,210
I chauffeur it around.

807
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,170
Leo Tolstoy says,

808
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,422
that "if a man earnestly seeks
a righteous life,

809
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,384
"his first act of abstinence
is from animal food."

810
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:23,803
I did not know that.

811
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,179
Sir Thomas More said,

812
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,765
"The Utopians feel that
slaughtering our fellow creatures

813
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,059
"gradually destroys
the sense of compassion

814
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,437
"which is the finest sentiment
of which our human nature is capable."

815
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,525
That's interesting.

816
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,197
Can we keep this our secret?

817
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,784
Can I stay here a few days?

818
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,704
I need to get to know you.

819
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:53,791
It has only been 2 weeks,
and he has become unbearable.

820
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,751
Again this morning,
he called me 3 times.

821
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,629
That's 3 times this morning.
He's taking up all of my time.

822
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,881
Do whatever he wants.
We can't let him expose you.

823
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,550
Long conversations.

824
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,262
Long, like police interrogations.
He feels the need to bond.

825
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,222
Do whatever he wants,
or he will expose you.

826
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:13,310
He wants to point out books
that are so dense and so esoteric

827
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,355
that it's impossible
to make heads or tails of it.

828
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:19,316
And then he'll twist it
and ask if I agree with it,

829
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,194
and then, he'll use it to prove
that somehow I'm full of shit.

830
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,697
I'm not having conversations
with him, Brett.

831
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,074
I'm in a chess game that
I don't realize that I'm in.

832
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,994
And it's exhausting. It's draining.

833
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,080
No.

834
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,373
- Answer it.
- No!

835
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,918
You have to answer it.
Anything he wants.

836
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,046
Hey, I got you a kale salad.

837
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,255
You got me a what?

838
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,590
Kale salad.

839
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,300
I'm kidding.

840
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,762
I got you a triple monster burger.

841
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,430
Yes, please.

842
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:51,307
Hey, should you be painting like this?

843
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,392
Because I can do this.

844
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,728
I can do the painting. I'm happy to do it.

845
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,107
Thank you for being here.

846
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,109
I'm glad I'm here.

847
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,320
- But I'm excited to do the painting.
- Yeah?

848
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,780
From now on, let me do the painting.

849
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,114
- All right.
- Okay.

850
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,949
I got you some French fries.

851
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,452
- You got French fries, too?
- Yes.

852
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,162
And there might be
something else in there.

853
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,497
Really?

854
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,248
A little treat?

855
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,794
You got me two burgers!

856
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,755
So, I'm trying to cancel
tomorrow night with Emma

857
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,674
and I think I can get off a bit early,
so we can do whatever.

858
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,469
Whatever you want.
Tomorrow night will be Viggo's choice.

859
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,012
All right, I'm off.

860
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,306
Good game, David.

861
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,395
Everything okay?

862
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,482
Yeah.

863
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,653
You want to play?

864
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,697
Yeah!

865
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,159
All right.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.

866
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,955
We gotta hurry. Careful, careful, careful.

867
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,665
Do you have any sweatpants,
or anything?

868
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,166
No.

869
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,502
You don't want to wear that stuff.
It's not a nightclub, Viggo.

870
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:02,711
Do you have any shorts for me?

871
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,088
I don't think my shorts are gonna fit you.

872
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,427
Like this.

873
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,139
What?

874
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,977
Up there.

875
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,021
Dribble, dribble, dribble.

876
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,565
Oh, my...

877
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,650
You just gotta dribble. You gotta dribble.

878
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,026
So, you just... You just dribble.

879
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,696
Dribble, dribble! You gotta dribble!
You gotta...

880
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,076
Why doesn't he dribble?

881
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:39,707
David, you absolutely have
to be there next Saturday.

882
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,667
Everybody's gonna be there.

883
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:44,753
Actually, I have plans
next Saturday with Emma.

884
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,256
But you were the one who came up
with this whole concept

885
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:49,675
of brothers and sisters
finding one another.

886
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,012
Yeah, I understand, but I
already have plans with Emma.

887
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:56,724
Anyway, I spend a heck
of a lot of time with you.

888
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,685
You know, I also have a real family.

889
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:05,566
Family.

890
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,401
You said "real family."

891
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:10,112
- No.
- You... You...

892
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,448
Just because
you decided to turn the page

893
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:16,035
on that period of your life
doesn't mean we don't exist.

894
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:20,623
We exist. We exist for real.
We're also your real family.

895
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,502
Viggo.

896
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,005
Viggo!

897
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,805
All I'm saying is,
I hope that you're happy.

898
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:39,934
I hope you realize that I had
to lie to Emma to be here.

899
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,186
That I lied to the woman
carrying my child.

900
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:43,729
Your "real" child.

901
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,273
Viggo, we have talked
about the incident a lot.

902
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,568
I don't think we need to continue
to dwell on our little misunderstanding.

903
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:52,780
I am here. Do you see that I'm here?

904
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:54,448
Do you see that I am here?

905
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,784
- With your fake kids.
- Fake?

906
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,661
Fake? Viggo, what the hell
are you talking about?

907
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,913
I mean, if we're not real, what are we?

908
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,165
- Nietzsche said...
- Screw Nietzsch-ka!

909
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,583
Screw Kindergarten!

910
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,377
"Kierkegaard."

911
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:07,795
I think it's this way.

912
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,922
Screw Nietzsche! Screw Kierkegaard!

913
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:13,092
And screw... The...

914
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,928
You can't even come up with one more.
That's it, you're done at two.

915
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:21,350
Look, screw all of those dudes.
None of those guys had 533 real kids.

916
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:30,067
Did you bring me here to expose me?

917
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,318
No.

918
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,654
I want to keep you all to myself.

919
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,382
<i>I know it's coming
I can feel it in my bones</i>

920
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:54,800
All right!

921
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:59,221
<i>This is information you already know</i>

922
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:02,683
<i>Even if it's only temporarily</i>

923
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:06,395
<i>Give the illusion tonight
You belong to me</i>

924
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,772
<i>Oh, the things</i>

925
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,860
<i>I will believe</i>

926
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:16,030
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

927
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:19,199
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

928
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,828
<i>The words come easily</i>

929
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,788
<i>And they sound so lovely</i>

930
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:26,248
You all right?

931
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:32,087
<i>I guess it's just as easy if you lie to me</i>

932
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:35,215
- Put these next to the grill, here.
- Next to the grill.

933
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,425
Special recipe.

934
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,719
It's a secret family recipe,
but you'll like this.

935
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,227
Wow!

936
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,813
Do you see what happens
when the tofu hits the grill?

937
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:51,857
Nothing.

938
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:55,569
Exactly what happens when
the tofu hits our taste buds.

939
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:02,076
<i>I am alone
I am in love with an idea</i>

940
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:05,746
<i>Sophisticated neurological appeals</i>

941
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:09,416
<i>I want to negotiate some kind of a deal</i>

942
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,128
<i>I want to tear it open
Show you that it's real</i>

943
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,923
<i>Oh, the things</i>

944
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:19,093
<i>I will believe</i>

945
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,846
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:26,100
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

947
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,561
Okay. Get in nice and tight.

948
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,775
All right, we got one more. Get in close.

949
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:36,360
- All right.
- Can I get in?

950
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,444
All right.

951
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,074
Okay, everybody, just scooch in.
Get as close as you can.

952
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,744
Okay, on the left.
Can you move in just a little?

953
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,747
All right. Say, "Cheese."

954
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,541
Cheese!

955
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,638
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

956
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:10,144
<i>Got me down to the very marrow</i>

957
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,067
<i>Don't you know I need your help</i>

958
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,530
<i>You're a friend of mine</i>

959
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,575
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

960
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,486
Hey. This is Ryan.

961
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,945
Hey, Ryan.
What's up, Ryan?

962
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,405
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hi.

963
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,766
<i>That was the best, right?</i>

964
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,268
I had a great time.

965
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:38,524
So, uh... I guess this is it.

966
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,110
Have a great day.

967
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,746
Ryan?

968
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,795
Could I just have a... Just... Thanks.

969
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,928
I..

970
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,350
I just wanted to...
I wanted to tell you...

971
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,401
I'm your father.

972
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,320
Okay.

973
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,365
So...

974
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,286
You'll keep seeing more of me.

975
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,832
That was a fun weekend. Okay.

976
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,469
You seem way too relaxed.

977
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,431
This is a great moment for me.

978
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:54,641
It's a new stage in our relationship.

979
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:55,892
No.

980
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:57,603
- No?
- No.

981
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:01,148
It's really important that you know
there is no truth in anything

982
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,817
they are going to say about me. None.

983
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:08,280
You must understand,
they love to humiliate me.

984
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:09,948
They're monsters. Really.

985
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,743
- They are monsters.
- Okay.

986
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,625
I want to propose a toast to Emma.

987
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,878
Because I think it's important
that you know that this...

988
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,214
- Rite of passage.
- Rite of passage.

989
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,550
Well, it's not just about
humiliating David.

990
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,260
Although, it is one of the objectives.

991
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:34,306
And if we have exposed David's past
to the harsh light of day...

992
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:36,099
Well, I think it's important,

993
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,893
because you gotta know
what you're getting into.

994
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,645
And now that you know all this...

995
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,355
I have some more pictures.

996
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,939
Not Sniper.

997
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,232
Sniper?

998
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,318
It was his rock band.
They wore a lot of makeup.

999
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,904
It was the '80s. Everybody wore makeup.

1000
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,989
I didn't wear makeup in the '80s.

1001
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,909
But look, now that all this is known...

1002
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:55,619
I think it's also very important
for you to know

1003
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:59,081
that the Wozniaks have had
some wonderful times

1004
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,000
- and some hard times.
- No.

1005
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,670
Dad?

1006
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,844
When my wife and I were newlyweds,

1007
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:16,306
we always dreamed of
having a honeymoon in Italy.

1008
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,850
But we didn't have much money.

1009
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:21,395
Then we had children.

1010
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,941
We told ourselves, someday,
when we're old.

1011
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,110
But time passed.

1012
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,779
You have to make
the most of the present.

1013
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,489
Do you all make the most of the present?

1014
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,573
Yes.

1015
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,367
Yes, Dad.
We make the most of the present.

1016
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:37,869
When my wife fell ill,

1017
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:41,415
David came over one day
with plane tickets to Venice.

1018
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,084
He had seen to everything.

1019
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,671
The hotel near Doge's Palace,
the gondolas.

1020
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:51,925
Then later, our 3 sons
flew over and joined us.

1021
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:57,097
We had a big family dinner
near St. Mark's Square.

1022
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:59,599
David paid for everything.

1023
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:02,436
David...

1024
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,896
He does things like that.

1025
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,108
If you are able to live
with his countless faults,

1026
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:11,445
you will also live through
some marvelous times.

1027
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,158
Let us pray.

1028
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:17,909
- No.
- Come on. Dad, please.

1029
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,578
- Let's drink.
- Yes.

1030
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,795
Your father is adorable.

1031
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,630
Yeah.

1032
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:35,177
I can't believe you brought
your whole family to Venice.

1033
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,138
How did you pay for that?

1034
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,182
I had money.

1035
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:41,641
When you were 20?

1036
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,352
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1037
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:48,440
What kind of job did you have
that would pay for a trip to Venice?

1038
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:52,778
It was a manual-labor type job.

1039
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,199
That was an awesome meal.

1040
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,827
Almost.

1041
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:04,122
All right, let's bring it.
Open the flood gates, here.

1042
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:07,501
Have fun.
Okay, have a good day at school, guys.

1043
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,668
Have a good time.

1044
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:11,922
It's okay to like recess. How are you?
Look at these angels.

1045
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,841
My man, how you feeling?
Have fun, buddy.

1046
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,819
Coffee? Toast? Eggs?

1047
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:36,696
- No.
- How was your weekend?

1048
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:39,241
- Relaxing.
- Good.

1049
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,659
Very relaxed.

1050
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,911
Dinner with the family.

1051
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,038
And I read.

1052
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,748
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1053
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,209
That you lie to your girlfriend,
that's part for the course.

1054
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:51,753
Untruthfulness is the basis of a good,
strong relationship.

1055
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,088
But I'm not your girlfriend, David.

1056
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:55,715
So, before you tell me
that you spent the weekend

1057
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,467
with Frodo and Gandalf
and Bilbo Baggins,

1058
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,678
why don't you go ahead
and take a look at this?

1059
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,431
Well, as you can attest,

1060
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:06,643
the reporter won't be winning any prizes
for his journalistic skills.

1061
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,689
But apparently,
his story was picked up by CNN

1062
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:14,568
and Fox, and even the BBC.

1063
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,778
Which means,
when you go to bed tonight,

1064
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:20,615
4 or 5 billion people will be asking,
"Who the fuck is Starbuck?"

1065
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,910
Now tell me, is this good news for us?

1066
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,371
Does this augur well for our trial?

1067
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:29,583
Is this the type of situation
over which we can regain control?

1068
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,334
The answer is yes.

1069
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:34,796
Now, we go on the offensive.

1070
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:37,382
A countersuit.
We, too, are going to sue the clinic.

1071
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:38,592
What for?

1072
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,761
Substantial punitive damages.

1073
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,098
It's the clinic's duty not to do anything
to jeopardize your anonymity.

1074
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:49,394
By overusing your donations,
they have given rise to a substantial,

1075
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:52,022
well-funded challenge to your anonymity

1076
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,734
which has now generated
extensive media coverage.

1077
01:09:55,901 --> 01:10:00,363
I mean, you should hear the stuff
that people are saying about Starbuck.

1078
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,616
What are they saying about Starbuck?

1079
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,285
Terrible things. But it's good.

1080
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:07,287
It's fine, because our countersuit...

1081
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:09,289
David, your debt problems will go away.

1082
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:11,708
We're going after big, big money.

1083
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,964
<i>it is all over Twitter,
it is all over the net.</i>

1084
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,717
<i>No way is this guy
coming out of the closet.</i>

1085
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,885
<i>No way!</i>

1086
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,887
<i>At work,
every meeting you go into,</i>

1087
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,096
<i>no matter what you say,</i>

1088
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:29,476
<i>everyone will always be thinking,
"Hey, it's El Masturbator."</i>

1089
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:30,810
<i>500
and 33 kids!</i>

1090
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:33,647
<i>He's donated 693 times!</i>

1091
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:38,234
<i>Boy, this guy was making money
hand over fist. I can't believe it.</i>

1092
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,988
<i>Anyway, listen.
He went by the code name "Starbuck."</i>

1093
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,156
<i>"Starbuck"?</i>

1094
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,909
<i>I think "Chock full of Nuts"
would have been more like it.</i>

1095
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:47,285
<i>"Chock full of Nuts"
would have been better.</i>

1096
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,914
You should read some of these tweets.

1097
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,332
<i>The last kid was an accident.</i>

1098
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,709
<i>I guess he was watching
a rerun of Baywatch,</i>

1099
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,336
<i>and it just happened.</i>

1100
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,674
<i>I had no idea this could
actually be a job.</i>

1101
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,343
<i>I mean, I knew it could be a hobby.</i>

1102
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:08,807
What do you think about
all this "Starbuck" business?

1103
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:10,350
Oh, it's horrible.

1104
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,394
What's horrible?

1105
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:16,147
It's horrible.
You don't think it's absolutely horrible?

1106
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,024
- I don't know.
- What was he thinking?

1107
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,861
Well, he obviously wasn't thinking
that they would use his sperm so much.

1108
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,030
And he obviously wasn't thinking

1109
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,866
that they would choose
his profile so often.

1110
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,201
May I help you?

1111
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,955
Yeah, do you have a stroller
for 533 children?

1112
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,708
- No.
- No. No.

1113
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:35,875
He doesn't.

1114
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,045
Because it's not normal
to have 533 children.

1115
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,672
It's not normal.

1116
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,680
Viggo, where the hell are you going?

1117
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,557
- I don't know.
- It goes in the back.

1118
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:52,392
- In the back.
- Okay.

1119
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,060
Hey, David.

1120
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,731
Your brothers are in the office.
They want to see you.

1121
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,697
They wanted 100 grand! 100 grand?

1122
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:09,993
I mean, Pop didn't have it.
So they tried to drown him!

1123
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,244
What were you thinking?

1124
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,747
Tell me, David, what were you thinking?

1125
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,959
Get the cash, David. Get the cash!

1126
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:20,211
Unbelievable!

1127
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,648
- Dad, listen.
- Go away, David.

1128
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,447
Go away.

1129
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:04,255
Let's...

1130
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,512
Let's do the countersuit.

1131
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,473
Excellent. Excellent.

1132
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,975
- Come on in.
- All right.

1133
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,355
<i>What would happen
if we no longer</i>

1134
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,398
<i>respected these types of agreements?</i>

1135
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,323
Nothing less than an unlimited quantity
of chaos.

1136
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,576
Custody battles.

1137
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:38,957
Possible intrusions upon happy families.

1138
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:42,460
And this, on either party's side.

1139
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:48,091
<i>Mothers showing up
on donors' doorsteps.</i>

1140
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:52,804
<i>And donors suddenly
wanting visitation rights,</i>

1141
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:56,724
<i>wanting to partake
in important decisions</i>

1142
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:58,810
<i>about religion, about schooling.</i>

1143
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,278
None of the parties were coerced
into signing this agreement.

1144
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,614
And nowhere have I seen
an expiration date.

1145
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,247
What'd you guys think?

1146
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,751
Why don't I understand
when you are talking?

1147
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,337
Well, you see...

1148
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,465
This is a complex situation.

1149
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:31,718
I would vote for the other guy.

1150
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:37,265
Well... No. The other guy is wrong.

1151
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,560
Grandma's right.
I think you're gonna lose again.

1152
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,104
Did she say that?

1153
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:47,525
Okay. Well, all right. Thanks, kids.

1154
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,402
You can all go to bed.

1155
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:51,571
Is that going to be
your argument in court?

1156
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:55,283
That won't work in court.
You can't send the real judge to bed.

1157
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,952
Yes, I can.
Daddy can send anyone to bed.

1158
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,829
And right now, you're all going to bed.

1159
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:01,789
Now, go.

1160
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:47,418
These are children who are lost.
They are lost in the wilderness.

1161
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:50,421
And they want to know
who their father is.

1162
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,340
I mean, is that too much to ask?

1163
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,802
And what would...

1164
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:59,555
What would happen if we no longer
accepted these types of agreements?

1165
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:06,729
Nothing more than
an unlimited quantity of chaos.

1166
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:11,818
Um...

1167
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,111
The mic...

1168
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,571
Oh, that's better. Is that okay?

1169
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,366
Here we are, outside of
the New York courtroom...

1170
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,999
I feel like this is an easy case to win.

1171
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:27,583
<i>What I'm saying is,</i>

1172
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,005
<i>which fundamental right should
take more importance here?</i>

1173
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:34,757
<i>I've been a musician
pretty much my whole life.</i>

1174
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,302
And when I write music,
I write it because...

1175
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:40,388
I think, when I say this,
I speak for everyone.

1176
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:41,681
I know, how for me...

1177
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:44,100
I wasn't actually able to
grow up with a dad.

1178
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,895
I would like to meet the guy,
the man, who created me.

1179
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:51,024
And there's a lot of transitions
in my life that I've come across.

1180
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,527
It's central to who I am.
It's really all I've thought about.

1181
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:58,740
I just want to feel
like I have a part of myself.

1182
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:01,701
The last ultrasound
that is on Friday at 2:00,

1183
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,453
do you think that you can make it there?

1184
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:07,498
There is no contract, okay?
They've broken the contract!

1185
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,791
They break with the contract!

1186
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:13,963
The man signed an anonymity
agreement for 693 donations!

1187
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,757
He has a right to punitive damages,

1188
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,259
because you should hear
what people are saying about him now.

1189
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:19,886
- You have got to be prepared!
- I am prepared!

1190
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:22,305
Well, then why don't you do it?

1191
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,148
You're my friend, I'm sorry.

1192
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,441
- I'm just so pissed off.
- Yeah.

1193
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:35,985
So we hope that it has been made clear

1194
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:39,864
that the intentional blocking
of this vital information

1195
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:43,910
has had, and will continue to have
a negative psychological impact

1196
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:47,580
on each and every single one
of Starbuck's children.

1197
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:48,915
In finishing,

1198
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:54,295
while the donor may have bargained
for confidentiality with the clinic,

1199
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:58,257
and the parents may have
accepted that confidentiality

1200
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:01,886
as a condition to receiving
the sperm donation...

1201
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,847
The children didn't agree to anything.

1202
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:10,853
Yet, they are the ones,
they are the ones most directly affected.

1203
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:13,856
This makes no sense.

1204
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:15,900
Thank you.

1205
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,962
These are some great kids.

1206
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,227
Without the anonymity clause,

1207
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,605
none of them would be here.

1208
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:58,776
And not to have these beautiful kids,

1209
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:01,988
that would be a great loss.

1210
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:05,825
We need the anonymity clause.

1211
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:24,635
The court will now take
the matter under advisement.

1212
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,284
How long could it take?

1213
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:54,457
I don't know, David. I do not know!

1214
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:55,750
What don't you know?

1215
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:58,586
I know absolutely nothing!
My mother was right.

1216
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,880
I'm useless and I'm out of my league.

1217
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,175
You should have got
a real lawyer, David.

1218
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:11,057
<i>All rise!</i>

1219
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,151
You may be seated.

1220
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,074
In the adjudicated action,

1221
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:30,660
the parties will receive
a detailed document,

1222
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:35,248
in which you will read
that Starbuck is entirely,

1223
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:39,961
and without reservation,
entitled to remain

1224
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:42,088
anonymous.

1225
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:48,553
He will also be entitled to $200,000
in punitive damages

1226
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:51,514
from the Graboski-Levitt Clinic.

1227
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,724
You are adjourned.

1228
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,978
Starbuck, therefore, will be entitled
to remain completely anonymous.

1229
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,814
He also will receive
$200,000 in damages.

1230
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:02,441
Yes! Yes!

1231
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,656
Brett, what's your reaction to the verdict?

1232
01:21:08,823 --> 01:21:11,284
Obviously, I feel great compassion
for the children.

1233
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,494
But I am very, very happy.

1234
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:19,041
I am very proud to have vindicated
my client and his rights.

1235
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:23,963
<i>And I want to say thank you
to my own children and to my mother.</i>

1236
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,215
<i>Mom, I won.</i>

1237
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,134
<i>I won.</i>

1238
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:33,431
<i>And I just want to say, David, we did it!</i>

1239
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,391
No!

1240
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:36,726
<i>We did it, David!</i>

1241
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,729
- No.
- Who's David?

1242
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,862
<i>He's my lover</i>

1243
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,781
<i>who has always been there for me.</i>

1244
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,909
<i>And, David, my darling...</i>

1245
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,622
<i>I love you, David. I love you, David.</i>

1246
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:04,462
Obviously, a very emotional trial for everyone here.

1247
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:06,839
Did you expect this verdict?

1248
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,216
We're disappointed.

1249
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:11,677
Our case was dismissed,
and we've now exhausted

1250
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:13,429
every possible legal recourse.

1251
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,682
But we haven't lost everything.

1252
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:21,145
While we were told today there's no law
requiring Starbuck to identify himself,

1253
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,815
there's more to this
than just legal obligation.

1254
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,526
There's us, and there's him.

1255
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,613
And beyond any law,
there are human beings.

1256
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,741
So, ultimately,
the final decision is Starbuck's.

1257
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:37,912
He's under no legal obligation
to identify himself.

1258
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,790
<i>But now that he's seen all of us,</i>

1259
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:43,959
<i>he may well decide to do so.</i>

1260
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,836
<i>That decision is his.</i>

1261
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,924
<i>There has been a lot of
unfavorable comments about Starbuck</i>

1262
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,884
<i>in all of this media coverage.</i>

1263
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,804
<i>We would really just like
our father to know</i>

1264
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,847
<i>that in our eyes,</i>

1265
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:59,975
<i>he's not a criminal or a freak.</i>

1266
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,228
<i>To us, he's someone</i>

1267
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:07,024
<i>who gave life and happiness
where it was badly needed.</i>

1268
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,463
Congratulations, darling.

1269
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:35,386
I had it.

1270
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:41,434
I had pitched the perfect game
and I had to screw the whole thing up.

1271
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:45,646
My mother saw the whole thing on TV.

1272
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:51,986
Well, she must have been surprised
to find out that you had a male lover.

1273
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,198
No. She said she always suspected it.

1274
01:23:58,743 --> 01:24:00,703
She told me we make a lovely couple.

1275
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:04,165
And your kids?

1276
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,462
- They think it's cool.
- Mmm.

1277
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,635
I'm just wondering...

1278
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:21,557
And really just theoretically, but...

1279
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,769
If I decided to identify myself,

1280
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,021
would I lose all the money
from the countersuit?

1281
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,524
Yeah, I think you would.

1282
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:39,700
Emma always says that, uh...

1283
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:44,121
That I don't have a life.

1284
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:48,334
So, um, I officially set out

1285
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:53,130
to try and do the right thing.

1286
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,176
It's harder than I thought.

1287
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:25,913
Pop.

1288
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,208
Pop, I'm Starbuck.

1289
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,379
<i>You are El Masturbator?</i>

1290
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:35,798
Yeah.

1291
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:47,893
Now, for once in my life,
I'd like to make the right decision.

1292
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,353
Once.

1293
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,606
For once in my life, I would
like to be a normal person.

1294
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,734
How would a normal person
handle a situation like this?

1295
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,487
A normal person would
not be in this situation.

1296
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:03,409
Let's just say that a normal person
had a slight lapse of judgment

1297
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:07,121
and donated sperm 693 times.

1298
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:11,292
What would they do?
What would my brothers do?

1299
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,752
Your brothers are not mentally equipped

1300
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:16,630
to deal with a situation like this.

1301
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:19,592
When you get right down to it,

1302
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:22,720
you're probably one of the
few people on this earth

1303
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:25,431
able to deal with such a situation.

1304
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:28,767
Why not just tell them?

1305
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,563
As you know,
I have some money problems.

1306
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:34,607
Yeah, your debts.

1307
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:40,404
You know I grew up
in terrible, terrible poverty.

1308
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,572
Yes, I know, Pop.

1309
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,407
I know.

1310
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:48,287
When I left Warsaw to go to the States,
my father gave me $10.

1311
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:50,414
That was everything he had.

1312
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,626
I couldn't turn down his help,

1313
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:58,797
so I promised him I'd pay him back
1,000 times over, once I got rich.

1314
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,968
My father died

1315
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,805
when your mother and I
still didn't have a cent.

1316
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:09,516
I...

1317
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,269
I always wondered
what was harder for him.

1318
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:14,480
Not being able
to give his children enough,

1319
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:17,650
or not being with them
when they hit hard times.

1320
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:22,446
My great good fortune in life
is to see you boys everyday.

1321
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:26,116
That, for me, is success.

1322
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,243
So, like my father, I want to help you.

1323
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,538
Here is $10.

1324
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,625
It brought me good luck.

1325
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,336
With $10, I built my empire.

1326
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,005
So, take the $10.

1327
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,175
And also take...

1328
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:50,015
It's your share of the meat store.

1329
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:54,353
It's your inheritance, in small bills,
to pay off your debts.

1330
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:00,401
I'm scared I'll disappoint them.

1331
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:02,695
Why would they be disappointed?

1332
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,406
I'm a meat truck driver.

1333
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,492
I'm an incompetent meat truck driver.

1334
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:11,078
True, you are incompetent.

1335
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:16,500
It takes you 4 times longer
to deliver meat than anyone else.

1336
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:20,212
But wherever you go, people love you.

1337
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:22,172
They're going to love you.

1338
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:25,300
Everyone loves you.

1339
01:28:28,429 --> 01:28:30,055
Thanks, Pop.

1340
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:35,746
We'll be right with you, sir.

1341
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:41,960
Emma!

1342
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,962
Emma!

1343
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,143
Mr. Wozniak?

1344
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:16,829
You gave us a little scare, there.

1345
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:19,957
Yeah.

1346
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:22,167
Hi.

1347
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,491
Mr. Wozniak?

1348
01:30:57,703 --> 01:30:58,745
Yeah.

1349
01:30:58,871 --> 01:31:01,331
Your family is here to see you.

1350
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:30,986
Is he healthy?

1351
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:33,530
Yes.

1352
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:36,992
Does that mean he can work tomorrow?

1353
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:23,664
This is weird.

1354
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:33,966
<i>Hey!</i>

1355
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,427
I lied to you.

1356
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,097
I am your biological father.

1357
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,481
And you have a little brother.

1358
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:54,194
He was in a bit of a hurry. But...

1359
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:59,574
He's doing very, very, very well.

1360
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:00,993
Can we see him?

1361
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,082
I'll find out.

1362
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,059
<i>Hey!</i>

1363
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:31,857
He's so small.

1364
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:33,817
Emma.

1365
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:41,908
Will you marry me?

1366
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,372
Wouldn't you want to wait and see
if I get my figure back?

1367
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:53,378
If you stay flabby,
I promise I'll get flabby as well.

1368
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:56,381
I wonder if that's
the first time the word "flabby"

1369
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:58,550
has been used in a marriage proposal.

1370
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:13,899
Emma...

1371
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:18,236
I'm Starbuck.

1372
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,627
Why are you always scamming?

1373
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:37,798
God, how could you think
that a marriage proposal

1374
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:43,261
would excuse the fact that
you're the father of 533 children?

1375
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,722
David! God!

1376
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,101
How...

1377
01:34:49,518 --> 01:34:52,687
This is no longer your child.

1378
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:57,025
I want to be very clear on two points.

1379
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,527
The first point.

1380
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,779
I said I was gonna change
as quickly as possible,

1381
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:01,947
and I am doing that.

1382
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:05,117
I've had a chance to do a lot of thinking.
A lot!

1383
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,453
And I've come to the conclusion
that it's not anyone but me

1384
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:10,997
who can decide if I am the father or not.

1385
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:14,418
Not a judge, not my family, not Dr. Phil,

1386
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:16,545
and in the end, not you.

1387
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:21,675
In other words, nobody but the father
can decide if he is the father or not.

1388
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:25,720
And I, David Wozniak,
am the father of this child.

1389
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:31,351
The other reality that can't be changed
is the fact that I am Starbuck.

1390
01:35:31,518 --> 01:35:33,854
Now, this, obviously,
can be somewhat frightening

1391
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:38,066
since it's something totally new,
and no one on this planet

1392
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,819
has ever experienced it before. It's...

1393
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:44,990
It is like the first steps
on the moon.

1394
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,910
But despite a few drawbacks,

1395
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,371
I think that we can
actually take away from this

1396
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:54,166
a tremendous amount of joy.

1397
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:59,296
Not to mention,
vast amounts of free babysitting.

1398
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:02,507
I don't know how this is gonna work out.

1399
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,051
Right now, me coming out
and revealing who I am,

1400
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:06,761
I'm risking everything.

1401
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:12,476
I'm risking all for the well-being
of my 533 kids.

1402
01:36:12,851 --> 01:36:15,270
And I would think
that you seeing me risk all

1403
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:17,606
should convince you
that whatever happens,

1404
01:36:18,732 --> 01:36:23,028
that no matter what turmoil this kid
right here gets into, I will be there.

1405
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:26,823
Now, you asked me to have a life.

1406
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,535
Well, here it is. This is my life.

1407
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:35,957
It may be a bit strange.

1408
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,293
And a bit oversized.

1409
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:42,589
But it's my life.

1410
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,343
The second point.

1411
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:48,011
That was a very long first point.

1412
01:36:48,178 --> 01:36:52,349
The first point was long.
The second point...

1413
01:36:52,516 --> 01:36:56,895
The marriage proposal was not a scam.

1414
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,775
The second point was much shorter.

1415
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:04,903
I need you in my life.

1416
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:27,842
Promise me,
one day you'll take me to Venice.

1417
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:43,191
Okay.

1418
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:45,527
<i>The world is yours</i>

1419
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:50,782
<i>Hold it close</i>

1420
01:37:50,824 --> 01:37:53,868
<i>With open arms</i>

1421
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:55,996
<i>Little feet</i>

1422
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,334
