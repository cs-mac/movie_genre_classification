<i>"Her nipples now so erect
they seemed to reach out for him''.</i>

2
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,203
<i>"Then in one quick movement,
he took her full inside his mouth''.</i>

3
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,768
<i>Listen to this.</i>

4
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,085
Hey, guys, wait for me.

5
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,023
Hi, Sharon.
Hi, Jan.

6
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,811
Come on, hurry up.
We're gonna miss them.

7
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,402
They're gonna be dressed already.
Come on!

8
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
"Never had she wanted
a man this much''.

9
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,112
"Her longing swelled
from deep inside her."

10
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,457
Come on, Bubba,
I can't hold you forever!

11
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,294
Come on, Bubba,
we can't hold you much longer!

12
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,634
Okay.

13
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,837
Bubba!

14
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,297
Hey! Oh, Bubba.

15
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,136
I got... I got one!

16
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,424
That way. Move it, chump.
That way!

17
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,625
Move it. Move it.

18
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,669
Come on, get over that way.
Move it, get over there.

19
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,433
"She felt as if she'd been pierced
to the very soul by a bolt of lightning."

20
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,770
Betsy, listen to this.

21
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,040
"And then, just then,
he raised himself up above her...''

22
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,274
"...and plunged his fullness
into her waiting..."

23
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,872
Can you believe this?

24
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,412
Hello, Chrissie, darling.

25
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,719
Betsy!

26
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,915
Hi, Jordan.

27
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,018
Is anything wrong?

28
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,356
Wrong?

29
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,919
Quick, she's going into the room.
- Not at all.

30
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,124
I just can't get dressed
for the big event...

31
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,033
...till my roommate
finishes ironing my blouse!

32
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,229
Well, do you wanna borrow
something of mine?

33
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,206
You can't be serious.

34
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,210
I mean, that's very sweet of you, Chrissie,
but I couldn't possibly.

35
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,714
Tell me, do you have any
of that gaudy nail polish?

36
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,477
I wanna do my toes.

37
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,786
I just don't feel dressed
till my toes are done.

38
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,350
What's this color called?

39
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,861
Naked pink.

40
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,073
Look at her picture.

41
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,840
Hey, Bubba, you all right?

42
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,511
Thanks for the nail polish, Chrissie.

43
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,052
Where you going?

44
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,155
To the stables.

45
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:36,464
She's given us so much horseshit,
it's only fair we give some back.

46
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,763
Christine Ramsay makes me sick.

47
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,135
If I have to spend one more night
watching her and Jim Green...

48
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,374
...slobber all over each other,
I think I'm gonna scream.

49
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,146
It sounds like maybe
you're a little jealous.

50
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,206
Jealous?

51
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,551
I could have Jim in a minute!

52
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,724
That's some big horse.

53
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,851
Oh, God. Excuse me.

54
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,395
Oh, gross, Betsy, that stinks!

55
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,862
It sure does.

56
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,196
You've gotta let me light it.
You've gotta let me light it.

57
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,707
Fire! Fire! Fire!

58
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,404
This is embarrassing.
Just try this.

59
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,565
Here.

60
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,968
Hi.

61
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,343
Hi.

62
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,841
Come on.

63
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,777
Do you wanna dance?

64
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,548
Do you wanna dance?

65
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,148
No.

66
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,696
Do you wanna dance?

67
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,196
Hi.

68
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,162
Good evening.

69
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,629
Really!

70
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,203
For those of you
who do not know who I am...

71
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,147
...I am the headmistress here
at Cherryvale, Prudence Dutchbok.

72
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,184
Good old Miss Douchebag!

73
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,949
I would like to take this opportunity
to welcome some very special guests.

74
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:15,085
The outstanding ladies
of the Cherryvale Building Committee.

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,930
A round of applause.

76
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:24,130
Largely dueto their generosity,
we will soon have our new wing.

77
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,372
I would also like to
welcome our neighbors...

78
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,378
...the young men from
the Freemount Academy for Men.

79
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:42,215
And now, all you boys and girls
have a grand and glorious time.

80
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,668
Would it be like that?
Like in that book, I mean?

81
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,209
Oh, no, of course not.

82
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,369
It wouldn't?

83
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,673
No, I mean, it would be.

84
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,306
It would be just
exactly like the book.

85
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:16,146
Well, okay, then,
maybe we should try it.

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,211
Really?

87
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,019
Do you really wanna do it?
All right!

88
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,729
Look, Chris, this isn't something you
just jump into, you know?

89
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,257
I mean, I wouldn't want you to do anything
you're not totally ready for or anything.

90
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,859
What do you mean?

91
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,269
Well, it's just that it's such a big step
and everything and...

92
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,704
I love you, Jim.

93
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,871
I love you, too, Chris.

94
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,546
You're perfect, you know that?

95
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,140
Yeah, I guess I am.

96
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,467
I'm telling you.
The closer he gets the bigger it gets.

97
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,543
Peter, this is Miss Birdie Fallmouth.

98
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,703
Hello, Peter.

99
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,839
And next is Christian, Miss Fallmouth.

100
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,817
Aren't any of you young gentlemen
going to stand up?

101
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,874
Your name?

102
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,818
Oh, I'm Roy, ma'am.

103
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,877
Hi, Roy.

104
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,083
And this is Bubba Beauregard.

105
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,659
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

106
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,806
She's such a nothing.

107
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,178
I absolutely don't understand
what he sees in her.

108
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,683
I'd like to see you get a guy 
as good as Jim.

109
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,979
Why not Jim?

110
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,578
You couldn't.
He's in love with Chris.

111
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,680
Chris is no competition.

112
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,624
Tomorrow in riding class I begin my campaign.

113
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,228
Coach Whelan, may I see you a moment?

114
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,294
I wonder if you would
keep an eye on our girls...

115
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,566
...while I show the ladies
the drawings of the new wing?

116
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
Certainly, Miss Dutchbok.
Good, good, good.

117
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,939
Ladies? I think these drawings
will take your breath away.

118
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,106
Young man!

119
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,716
Illegal use of the hands.

120
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,749
Right this way to my office, ladies.

121
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,042
Hey, Douchebag's office.

122
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,645
And the new wing.

123
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,809
Douchebag Hall.

124
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,110
I have to warn you, I like a lot of...

125
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,777
...whatchamacallit, foreplay.

126
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,721
Is that enough?

127
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,778
I guess so.

128
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:59,698
And now, ladies, if you will.
My office. Come, please.

129
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:04,505
<i>The marvelous renderings of the new wing, 
which in your generosity and...</i>

130
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,986
<i>Good morning, girls, and attention.</i>

131
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,316
<i>This is Miss Dutchbok speaking.</i>

132
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>And you know the morning exercises...</i>

133
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,063
Good afternoon, class.

134
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,195
I know how much
you've been looking forward...

135
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,265
...to today's lessons of the mechanics
of sexual intercourse.

136
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,353
Too many people
are embarrassed or ashamed...

137
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,788
...about the very natural act of sexual intercourse.

138
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:32,882
Come right in.

139
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,052
Go right ahead with your class, Miss Copuletta.

140
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,186
We'll just stand here for a tiny moment.

141
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,232
Yes, of course, Miss Dutchbok.
Thank you.

142
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,801
Now then, during sexual intercourse...

143
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:48,034
...the male undergoes certain biological changes...

144
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,439
...which cause his organ to become erect.

145
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,243
Now, after a short length of time, the male organ
releases its fertile cargo...

146
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:59,182
Thank you very much, Miss Copuletta.
That was very stimulating.

147
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,152
Come, ladies, let's ... Let's go to lunch.

148
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,350
We have a lovely lunch in the cafeteria.
We're having chicken.

149
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,622
Miss Copuletta?

150
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,653
Which do you think is the most important
in a penis...

151
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,359
...length or width?

152
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,301
Well, I don't think that we have the time
to get into that today.

153
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,563
What, is she kidding?

154
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,309
I mean, we don't have the time today
to talk about that.

155
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:30,475
Now, we are going to see a short film called
<i>The Tadpole and His Community.</i>

156
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,875
Rita, take care of the blinds, please.

157
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,551
Hello, Hotel D'Amour?
I'd like to make a weekend, please.

158
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,393
I mean, I'd like to reserve a reservation 
for a weekend in your hotel.

159
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,932
A week from Friday.

160
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,360
It's Mrs. Christine Rams... Jones.

161
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,995
No, not Rams-Jones, just Jones.

162
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,472
What if they wanna see
your driver's license or something?

163
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,999
Listen, it seems that I was wrong about the name.
It's not Jones, it's ...

164
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,807
Should I use my name or his?
Yours.

165
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,939
Ramsay. Mrs. Christine...
His. Use his!

166
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,414
Green!

167
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,182
Ramsay is my married name 
and Green is my professional name.

168
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,051
Jones was my mother's maiden name.

169
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,386
But, I'm a graphic designer
and I really am married...

170
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,858
...so that's pretty much my story. Goodbye.

171
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,661
How was I?

172
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,818
Terrific.

173
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,017
I made the reservation at the Hotel D'Amour.
The weekend after next.

174
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,921
That's where my parents stayed
on their honeymoon.

175
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,759
God, this is gonna be wonderful. 
So perfect.

176
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,496
Don't you think?

177
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,821
Don't you?

178
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,028
Of course I do.
Why do you say that?

179
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,372
It just seemed like you
were beginning to have some doubts.

180
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,806
Me? Doubts?
What, are you kidding me?

181
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,344
Well, that's good,
at least one of us won't be nervous.

182
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,905
Nervous? 
What's there to be nervous about?

183
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,394
Oh, oh, no! Oh!
Do you see what I see?

184
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,560
Jordan, dear.

185
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,725
Surprise!

186
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,029
Go get her, Bubba!

187
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,116
That is the finest example
of bareback riding I've ever seen.

188
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,790
I'll get them.
I'll get them.

189
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,392
No, really,
I'll go in and buy them.

190
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,199
But up till now you've done everything.
Now it's my turn, all right?

191
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,364
Okay.

192
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,375
I suppose I'd say,
"I'd just like to buy some condoms"?

193
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,120
Well, be a little bit more sophisticated.

194
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,848
Sophisticated?

195
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,487
Sophisticated?

196
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,565
Yep, it is fabulous.

197
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,338
It's called Fountain of Truth,
and you know what I'm gonna do?

198
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,903
I'm just gonna do one half of your face 
so you can see the incredible difference.

199
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,950
It just relaxes those years right off your face.

200
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,715
Now let that dry for a few minutes 
and I'll be right with you. Okay?

201
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,252
Hello there, young fella!
Hi.

202
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,452
What can I do you for today?

203
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,223
I'd like to buy some prophylactic devices.

204
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,889
Now that is what I like to hear.

205
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,830
You know what they say,
"An ounce of prevention..."

206
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,700
You know, most young people
today are too careless about their bodies.

207
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,831
Well, what type of prophylaxis
did you have in mind?

208
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,103
What... What, what type?

209
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,303
Well, yeah, we have the ones
with the little rubber tip...

210
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,870
...for getting in the hard-to-reach areas,
and we have the stimulators...

211
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,849
...and we have my personal favorite...

212
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,785
...which possesses marvelous prophylactic qualities.

213
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,881
All you do is insert the tip
of a toothpick into the end...

214
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,291
...and she's ready to work for you. Yep.

215
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,391
And, of course,
we also carry the full line of flosses...

216
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,925
...and picks and the bristle
brushes in the various degrees of stiffness.

217
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,536
Did your dentist recommend
anything in particular?

218
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,302
My dentist?
Yep. Your dentist.

219
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,643
Did you get them?

220
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,677
What the hell is this stuff?

221
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,984
He... He misunderstood me
and it was too much trouble to...

222
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,489
I'll do it.

223
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,863
Absolutely magnificent.

224
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,899
And you can really feel it working, can't you?

225
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,662
You know what?
Let's let this little bit in here...

226
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,829
...dry a little bit more
and I'll be with you in two seconds.

227
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,736
Well, hello, young lady.

228
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,740
What can I help you with today?

229
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,332
I'd like to buy some condoms.

230
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,809
Yeah. Well, let's see.

231
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,470
We have these on sale this week.

232
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,980
This is three dozen for $5.99.
I'll take them.

233
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,539
However, I don't know if I'd trust them.

234
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,346
They've been on the shelf
for quite some time.

235
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,183
Now, we have this new product here. 
These are multicolored and ribbed.

236
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,517
Oh, that'll be just fine.

237
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,750
No, I don't think so.

238
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,622
I don't think you'd want anything that tawdry, 
do you?

239
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,458
No, no, or do you?
No.

240
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,055
No. No, what you want
is something really reliable, huh?

241
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,293
Yeah.
Yep.

242
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,634
Well, I have sold literally miles and miles 
of these and I've never had any complaints.

243
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,603
Now, does he like them pre-lubricated?

244
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,111
Your husband.
These are for your husband, aren't they?

245
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,736
Yes, for my husband.

246
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,146
They're definitely for my husband, 
and we're both definitely married!

247
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,207
And does he like them pre-lubricated, then?

248
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,446
Yeah, I'll take them.

249
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,818
Get this stuff off my face!

250
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,920
Miss Dutchbok.
Good afternoon, Miss Dutchbok.

251
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,089
Good afternoon, Christine.

252
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,190
You probably wonder what I'm doing here...
I don't really care!

253
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,700
...buying these very things for my father.

254
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,929
Actually they're not for my father, they're...

255
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,438
Fine! But don't you have
homework to do back at school, Christine?

256
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,973
Yes, I do.
I do have lots of homework...

257
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,307
...and I'll just be paying for these vitamins here 
and going on my way. Thank you.

258
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,476
You know, green really is your color.

259
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,451
Hey, did you win one yet?

260
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,392
So you're finally gonna get into Chris' pants.
I can't believe it.

261
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,327
Hey, scumbag, don't talk about Chris like that.

262
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,594
Oh, our James doesn't approve of your vocabulary, 
do you, James?

263
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,828
No, he's right, Roy.
I'm sorry, Jim.

264
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,303
Perhaps I should've said,
have you given her a hot beef injection?

265
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,637
You guys are animals!
Get out of here!

266
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,176
<i>Hey, big boy. Think you're man
enough to score with me?</i>

267
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,837
Damn right! Hey, guys!

268
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,006
<i>I have to be in bed early tonight.</i>

269
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,483
Don't worry, honey, you will be.

270
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,020
<i>Oh, don't touch me there!
It's not fair!</i>

271
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,147
Hey, Jim, I'm doing better than you.

272
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,421
<i>Oh, oh, yes, yes.</i>

273
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:31,258
I did it! I scored!
I got into her pants!

274
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,060
Yeah, that's about as close
as you're ever gonna get to nookie.

275
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,533
Hey, Mr. Big, I thought you were
gonna call Chrissie.

276
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,628
You wouldn't want her
to cancel her de-virginization, would you?

277
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,230
I'm sure not gonna call her
in front of you nerds.

278
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,638
Oh, why not?

279
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,669
Is Jimsie-wimsy afraid to talk his baby talk 
in front of Roysy-woysy and Bubba-wubba?

280
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,578
I'm not afraid to do anything.

281
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,014
He's afraid.
Mmm-hmm.

282
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,416
Get off it!
Well, if you're not afraid, then call.

283
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:59,082
Go ahead. Hey, here's a dime.
There's the phone. Call.

284
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,625
Five bucks says you're chicken.

285
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,956
Do you have five bucks?

286
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,495
Go on.

287
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,456
Well, go on, chicken.

288
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:18,134
You guys make one sound, I'm gonna hang up 
and beat the shit out of both of you.

289
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,379
Hello?

290
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,980
Chris, hi.

291
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,581
- Hi.
- Hi.

292
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,591
Hi, Jim, what are you doing?

293
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,219
You know, hanging out.

294
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,729
Hanging out.

295
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,928
<i>What are you doing?</i>

296
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,193
Oh, I'm just sitting around.

297
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,328
I've been thinking about you.

298
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,995
<i>I've been thinking about you, too.</i>

299
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,766
You have?
What have you been thinking?

300
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,832
This is great. I gotta take some of this down
so I can use it for myself.

301
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,308
I've been thinking
a lot about our weekend.

302
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,174
Oh, weekend.

303
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,912
You have?
What have you been thinking about it?

304
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,076
<i>Oh, lots of stuff.
You know, like how much fun it's gonna be.</i>

305
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,052
<i>- What else?</i>
- How great it'll be.

306
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,452
Mmm-hmm. What else?

307
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,924
<i>Well, lots of stuff like that.</i>

308
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,287
- Do you still love me?
<i>- Sure.</i>

309
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,953
Well, then, let me hear you say it.

310
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,394
<i>No, not right now.</i>

311
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,658
Why not?

312
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,825
- Because...
<i>- Oh, come on, let me hear you say it.</i>

313
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,266
- No.
<i>- Why not?</i>

314
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,325
Because!

315
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,961
Because you're afraid
to let anybody hear you.

316
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

317
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,362
Then say it.

318
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,103
All right. I love you.

319
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,777
And I love you, too, Jimbo.

320
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,719
- What happened?
- Jordan was on the extension!

321
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,585
Scumbags!

322
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,793
I love you.

323
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,460
<i>Hey, big boy,think you're man enough
to score with me?</i>

324
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,771
I am if Bubba is.

325
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,768
<i>Oops, sorry, tonight I have to wash my hair.</i>

326
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,335
- What?
- Oh, Jim.

327
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,650
Do you think I'm doing the right thing,
with Jim, I mean?

328
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,811
I guess I'm kind of scared.

329
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,087
Bets, have you ever really done it,
all the way?

330
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,920
Well, yes and no.

331
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,960
What do you mean, "Yes and no"?
Don't you know?

332
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,486
Bubba says we did it once
and that it was very good for both of us.

333
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,625
But I was passed out.
I don't remember a thing.

334
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,465
Well, it's not gonna be like that for me.
What else does Bubba say?

335
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,199
He says that I had three orgasms.

336
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:33,176
That I begged him for mercy and that I said 
I've never seen a man so well endowed.

337
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,243
- Well, is he?
- Is he what?

338
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,407
Is he well endowed?

339
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,779
I don't really know.

340
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,479
I mean, not firsthand.
Just from what Bubba tells me.

341
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,122
Jordan thinks that length is most important,
what do you think?

342
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,683
- I think width.
- Why width?

343
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,763
Because Jordan thinks length.

344
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,426
All right, girls, let's get a move on. 
We're gonna be late for practice.

345
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,931
Who slammed?

346
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,338
Hey, Jordan, how's it going?

347
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:43,041
Who slammed?
Cut it out with the slamming!

348
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,778
Hut!
Only a floater, Jim.

349
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,092
We go deep, make a play.

350
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,856
Okay.
All right, let's see it.

351
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,191
All right!

352
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,062
First we're gonna give them cheer number 69.

353
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,659
"Rickety rackety."

354
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,296
All right, girls? All right.

355
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:08,971
What's so funny?

356
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,441
Keep your eye on the coach and Rita.

357
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,977
Why?

358
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,344
Oh, I think we might be seeing
a little more of them.

359
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,541
Okay.

360
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:21,382
Rickety rackety shanty town.

361
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,752
Who's gonna keep those Trojans down?

362
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,450
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

363
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,370
Oh, Bet!

364
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,638
This is it!

365
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,713
This is the last straw.

366
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,552
I don't know which of you is responsible
for this shocking debacle!

367
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,921
I don't care.

368
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,520
You're all confined to campus for the next week!

369
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,858
- But we...
- Silence!

370
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,733
If you don't deserve punishment,
I'm sure each of you...

371
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,136
...will think of something
you have done to deserve it in the past.

372
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,504
Dismissed!

373
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,944
But Miss Dutchbok, I didn't do anything...
Now, now, now, Jordan, dear,

374
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,585
I'm doing this for your own good.

375
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,281
You'll thank me for it in future years.

376
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,852
Run along, dear.

377
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,756
Coach Whelan, pull yourself together.

378
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,761
Oh, dear.

379
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,536
Here, drink this, it'll do you good.

380
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:56,047
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.
I don't drink.

381
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,173
Alcohol is poison to the body.

382
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,740
Oh, don't be silly.

383
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:04,846
Consumed in moderation, alcohol is perfectly harmless.
Watch.

384
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,894
There you are, dear. Mmm-hmm.

385
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,305
See?

386
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,711
I'll be back soon, Bertha,
but you stay here as long as you like.

387
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,480
Very soon I will forget all about this morning.

388
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,414
Thank you, Miss Dutchbok.

389
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,719
By tomorrow we'll have forgotten all of this.

390
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,150
Where'd you get all this stuff, anyway?

391
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,519
My brother J.D. left it to me
when he graduated.

392
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,353
Your brother?

393
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,450
Get up!

394
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,261
If we get caught, we're gonna get expelled.
I don't wanna get expelled.

395
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,464
Look, you only go around once in life...

396
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,905
...and you gotta grab
for all the nookie you can get.

397
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,408
Guys.

398
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,494
Smile.

399
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,395
It's embarrassing.
The girl's desperate...

400
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:00,438
...she's got the bathroom packed with all these
smelly and large things.

401
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,598
And she does enough pushups
to make you look...

402
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,665
I've got to get a new roommate.

403
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,910
I think Betsy's room is over here, darling.

404
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,056
Hi.

405
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,191
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,758
Sugar.
I don't believe we've met.

407
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,100
- I'm Jordan Leigh-Jensen.
- Hi.

408
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,163
Oh, we're unknown visitors here.

409
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,267
My older sister's Christine Ramsay.

410
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,211
Mine's Betsy Newhouse.

411
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,873
Yes, there is a family resemblance.

412
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,282
Well, your sister's room is right in here.

413
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,449
Bubba!

414
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,291
But my sister!

415
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,817
Your sister's at the library.
She'll be back any minute.

416
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,699
Bubba, what are you doing here?

417
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,835
But my sister.

418
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,000
Make yourself at home.
Can I get you anything?

419
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,601
No. Really, I don't wanna be any bother.

420
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:18,377
Oh, don't be silly.
You're no bother.

421
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,847
Excuse me.

422
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:30,623
Miss! Miss! Miss!

423
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:35,889
You know, I'm so overheated.
These workouts really do me in.

424
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,590
Mmm.

425
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,193
Ah!

426
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,288
Want some?

427
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,865
Mmm!

428
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,736
Well, I am feeling a little warm myself.

429
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,537
Oh, I'll take care of that.

430
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:38,621
You know, you seem like the kind of girl 
that's had some experience with men.

431
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:44,934
Tell me, can you see any reason
why men wouldn't like my legs?

432
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:53,443
Well, what's wrong with me, then?
Why don't men go for me?

433
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,878
Feel my calf.

434
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,177
Go ahead, feel it.
Go ahead, feel it.

435
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,250
Well, what do you think?
Tight as a drum, right?

436
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,252
No cellulite in the upper thighs, right?

437
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,891
None that I can see. No.

438
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,627
What is it, then?

439
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,537
Why am I so unattractive to men?

440
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,702
I know! My breasts!

441
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:32,550
Would you call these breasts firm?

442
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,517
Or do you think they're saggy?

443
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,611
Firm. Definitely firm.

444
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:40,419
Are you sure?
Are you really sure?

445
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,954
Why don't you feel them?

446
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,555
Is something wrong?

447
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,258
Wrong? Oh, no.

448
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,801
It's just that it's so hot in here.

449
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,303
Yeah, we have that problem
with the heat all the time.

450
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,272
Let me see if I can make it
a little cooler for you.

451
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,286
George Washington.

452
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,120
So, what are we talking about?

453
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,255
Good.

454
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,700
Excuse me. I...
I don't suppose that you...

455
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,497
I didn't think so.

456
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,641
I'm just not in the mood right now, Bubba.

457
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,372
Not in the mood?
You're not in the mood?

458
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:39,109
I risked my life sneaking in to see you
and you're not in the mood?

459
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:45,885
Okay, okay.
But just remember, I like a lot of foreplay.

460
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,251
Great.

461
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,418
Great.

462
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,985
Go ahead and start without me.

463
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,223
Where you going?

464
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,822
Where am I going?

465
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,925
I'm going to the bathroom, of course, 
to have a smoke.

466
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,864
In Europe, they smoke before instead of after.

467
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,936
It's the latest thing.

468
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,921
Oh, I got a cramp.
Help! Help!

469
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,298
Help, help!

470
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:32,795
Be a doll, will you?
Grab that bottle of love oil.

471
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,280
Bubba?

472
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,997
You sleazebag!

473
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,034
Oh, hi there, Betsy.
I was just...

474
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,704
Yeah, I know that you were just, you pervert!

475
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,386
Oh, that feels so much better.

476
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,997
There's just one spot that's still a little tight.

477
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,491
Here?

478
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,058
Down just a little.

479
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,263
Here?

480
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:41,327
Lower.

481
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,467
Here?

482
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,530
Lower.

483
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,268
Here?

484
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,540
That's perfect.

485
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,819
Let me turn over now
so you can do the other side.

486
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,286
No! Jordan,
I don't think I can do that!

487
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:34,814
Oh, how thoughtless of me!
Your hands must be tired.

488
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,025
I know, I'll massage you.

489
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,687
No, no, Jordan!

490
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,663
Yes?
Please! I have to tell you something.

491
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,666
Yes?
I'm not really a girl.

492
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,360
Jordan! Jordan, please, don't scream!

493
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,939
I never meant for this to happen!
Jim? Is that you?

494
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,005
How could you deceive me?

495
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,969
He snuck into my room and took advantage of me!

496
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,505
You tricked me into taking my clothes off 
just so you could see me naked!

497
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:00,744
Chris.

498
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,945
What's going on?
I don't know.

499
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,853
I wonder what he was doing in there.

500
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,691
What happened?

501
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,463
It was unbelievable.

502
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,028
Yeah, yeah, tell me, tell me.

503
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,677
Come on.
He must be an 11, right?

504
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,684
Two 11s, unbelievable.

505
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:53,223
Miss Douchebag, get rid of it.

506
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,349
- Oh, good evening, girls.
- Good evening, ma'am.

507
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:59,055
Oh, there's nothing as fine 
as a sauna before bedtime.

508
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,392
Oh, God.

509
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,024
So good for the respiratory system, don't you find?

510
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,590
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

511
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,831
Highly good for the lungs.

512
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,008
If I don't get out of here soon, 
I'm gonna end up the size of a prune.

513
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:20,701
- Coach!
- I'm okay.

514
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,508
Listen to me...
Perfectly okay.

515
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,947
Let me help you.

516
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:32,679
I got enough help from you this afternoon
to last me a lifetime.

517
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,017
Coach!

518
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:38,092
Let me take you to my room, all right?
You can sleep it off.

519
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,091
Okay, here we are.

520
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,325
Is this my room?

521
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,389
Yep, come on.

522
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,096
Oh, miss? Miss!

523
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:19,426
Excuse me. Pardon me.

524
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,499
Betsy?

525
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,439
Betsy, I'm sorry. I was an animal.
Do you forgive me or what?

526
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:34,842
Oh, I get it, the old silent treatment, huh?

527
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:40,686
Well, let me see how we can fix that.

528
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:04,293
Hey Jim, where's the old pizzazz?

529
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,395
The old pizzazz? Where's the old pizzazz?
Oh, yeah.

530
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,524
Come on, you've got the hottest girl here...

531
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,762
...chasing after you and you're depressed?

532
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,031
Why don't you just forget dumb old Chris
and give Jordan a chance?

533
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,165
I don't ever wanna hear you
say anything bad about Chris again!

534
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,937
Okay, okay.

535
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,041
What's wrong with him?

536
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,175
I don't know.
Something about Chris.

537
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:34,221
Why, Jim, I didn't expect to see you here today.
How you doing, son?

538
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:40,186
Not too good, actually, Mr. Ramsay. It's Chris.
We had a misunderstanding.

539
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,565
It's all my fault,
but Chris won't even talk to me now.

540
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:46,432
Well, Chris has a mind of her own, 
you know that.

541
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,164
But I'll put in a good word
for you, if you like.

542
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:51,230
Thanks a lot, Mr. Ramsay.
Thank you very much.

543
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:58,205
<i>Good morning, we're delighted to welcome you
to Parents Day at Cherryvale.</i>

544
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,716
<i>Refreshments are now being served at the pool...</i>

545
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:05,118
<i>...and a full schedule of activities 
has been planned for your enjoyment.</i>

546
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,114
Here you go, Daddy.

547
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,216
Thank you, sweetheart.

548
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,784
- Give me another one of these, would you?
- Are you sure?

549
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,456
Okay.

550
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,977
Oh, I don't have to tell you,
Coach Whelan, how vital today's Parents Day is...

551
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:40,251
...to the economic future of Cherryvale.
Yes, Miss Dutchbok. That's right.

552
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:00,102
Oh, which reminds me, dear, excuse me.

553
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,146
- Jordan. Jordan, dear.
- Yes, Miss Dutchbok?

554
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,307
I'm so eager to meet your father, 
but it is getting rather late, dear.

555
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,181
Late? Miss Dutchbok, my father is always late.

556
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:11,448
My father likes to be late
so he can make an entrance.

557
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,513
Ah, well, if he doesn't arrive soon,

558
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,082
I'll just run up to the parking area 
to make sure he hasn't lost his way.

559
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,185
Whatever you say.

560
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,695
You look so nice, dear.

561
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,698
- She's not gonna like me.
- I know it.

562
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,000
Nonsense.

563
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:33,737
Jordan loves all her new mommies,
and you're no exception.

564
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:38,977
Come on, what does little Bambi-wambi say
to the dreat big drowly bear?

565
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,414
I wove you.

566
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:49,820
No more baby talk!

567
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,754
Chauncey is watching.

568
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,266
Chauncey, drive!

569
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:06,074
<i>Stand aside, young man!
Make way! Make way!</i>

570
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,943
Dad, you remember my roommate, Jordan?

571
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,851
Very pleased to see you again, Mr. Flugel.

572
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,050
Jordan, little Jordan.

573
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:27,090
You and Rita have been so close, 
I just feel like a second Daddy to you.

574
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:32,658
Yes, ma'am. You just think of yourself 
as Frank Flugel's little girl anytime.

575
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,303
Isn't that right, Rita?

576
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,472
Oh! Stop, Mr. Flugel!

577
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:40,567
Oh, what's going on here?

578
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,908
I'm giving Bubba another chance.

579
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,607
After what he did?

580
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:48,139
What the hell?
Maybe you should give Jim a break, too.

581
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,788
Come on, you didn't give up
those hotel reservations, did you?

582
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,653
See, look at it this way.

583
00:54:57,327 --> 00:55:01,263
I'm gonna forgive Bubba.
Compared to Bubba, Jim's a saint.

584
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,425
Compared to Bubba, anybody's a saint.

585
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,104
Nice driving, Chauncey.

586
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:10,897
Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed it, sir.

587
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,709
Come on, check it out!

588
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,634
I got this one.

589
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:20,308
<i>Make way, gentlemen, please!
We won't be needing any assistance this afternoon!</i>

590
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,113
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

591
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,021
Let me get it.

592
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,318
Don't touch the car, please.

593
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:29,381
Right.

594
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,077
- Jordan.
- Daddy!

595
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:00,555
You are as beautiful as ever.

596
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,456
Oh, I want you to meet Bambi,
your new stepmother.

597
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,726
How do you do?

598
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,031
What happened to the last one,
Mrs. Lawrence Leigh-Jensen number seven?

599
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,231
Now, now, Jordan,
let's not behave like a cross child.

600
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,866
We're all here to have fun.
We wanna meet all your friends.

601
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:23,003
Oh, where is that lovely Miss Dutchbok 
whom I've been corresponding with?

602
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,073
Mmm!

603
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,984
Yeah. Good.

604
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:55,708
Hey, sweetheart, what class are you in?

605
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,474
I'm not in any class.
I'm a teacher here.

606
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,175
Oh, so what do you teach?

607
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,841
Sex education.

608
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:03,848
What?

609
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,218
Sex education.

610
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:08,622
Sex education?
That's my favorite subject!

611
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:27,309
All right. Here, right here.
Right here.

612
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,376
Here you go. Here you go.

613
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,812
Well, back, back, back, back,
I'll handle this now.

614
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:34,373
My dear, I need to give you some help here.

615
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,078
Back up, back up.

616
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:48,320
Hmm?

617
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,411
I think she's gonna be all right.

618
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:20,362
I guess we should talk.

619
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:26,601
Nothing happened between me and Jordan. 
I love you.

620
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,308
Hello!

621
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:50,154
Hello! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

622
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:55,293
Welcome. Welcome to Cherryvale.
I'm Miss Prudence Dutchbok.

623
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,195
Charmed.

624
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,967
And I've already guessed who you are. 
Oh, yes, Jordan speaks of you ceaselessly.

625
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,008
She's so proud of her father...

626
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:09,478
...and your kind letters and continued support
of Cherryvale.

627
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,138
I think you're a remarkable man.

628
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,682
Mademoiselle, you are far too kind.

629
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,244
Oh, I hope you'll allow me
to give you a personal tour of the school.

630
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,983
Well, I can think of nothing
that I would like better.

631
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,289
Oh, I know you're interested
in seeing the sights of the new wing.

632
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,261
Unfortunately, we...

633
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:30,026
It's been difficult raising funds 
for the construction beginning, but...

634
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,035
Well, now, let's not go another step further.

635
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:36,630
Oh, dear, I seem to have
left my checkbook in the car.

636
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:41,302
Would you mind accompanying me back
to the car, Miss Dutchbok?

637
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,506
Oh, I'd love it, and please call me Prudence.

638
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,777
Very well, Prudence.

639
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:48,840
Oh!

640
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:05,031
I don't want to take up too much of your time,
Mr. Leigh-Jensen.

641
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,434
May I call you Mr. Leigh-Jensen?

642
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,403
If you wish.

643
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,434
I'm sure Jordan will be anxious to see you.

644
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,444
She's probably wondering where you are.

645
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,084
Don't worry.
No one is gonna find us in here.

646
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,682
Try this.

647
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,437
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

648
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,275
<i>Oh! What are you doing?</i>

649
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,941
<i>Does it displease you?</i>
Dutchbok.

650
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,918
<i>It doesn't displease me that much.</i>

651
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:02,118
But do you suppose while you're doing that, 
my darling, you could write that check?

652
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,892
Well, of course I could, darling.

653
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:09,189
<i>Here, here, let me
help you with these buttons.</i>

654
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:12,360
<i>These buttons?
Yes, they're so binding.</i>

655
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,027
<i>I wouldn't want anything
to bind you.</i>

656
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:18,332
<i>I'll take care of the buttons,
you take care of the check.</i>

657
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,000
<i>As you wish, dearest.</i>

658
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,475
<i>- Damn.
- What is it?</i>

659
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:22,944
<i>I've dropped my pen.</i>

660
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:26,380
<i>Oh, I'll get it... Oh!
Forgive me, Prudence.</i>

661
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,717
<i>- A rash impulse.
- I couldn't resist.</i>

662
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:34,087
<i>No need to apologize.
The check, dearest?</i>

663
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,452
<i>Oh, yes, yes, of course. Damn!</i>

664
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,689
<i>- The pen?
- No, no, the check. I've dropped the check.</i>

665
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:43,790
<i>- Well, let me.
- Oh, oh, stop that!</i>

666
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,300
<i>Stop! Don't!
Stop! Stop! Don't!</i>

667
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,771
<i>Oh, my God, use both hands!</i>

668
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,831
<i>But I need one to write the check.</i>

669
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:56,310
<i>Oh, forget the goddamn check!
Use both hands!</i>

670
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,871
<i>- Do you like it like this?
- Oh, yes!</i>

671
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,150
<i>Yes! Don't be so gentle!</i>

672
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,414
<i>- How about this?
- Yes! Yes!</i>

673
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,984
<i>- And this?
- Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

674
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,494
<i>Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!</i>

675
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,664
<i>Wait a minute.
Something strange is happening here.</i>

676
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,500
<i>There's nothing strange about two people 
trying to give each other pleasure...</i>

677
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,132
<i>...no matter how bizarre that means.</i>
- I know!</i>

678
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,803
<i>And by the way, if you're turned on to rubber garments,
I happen to have...</i>

679
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:30,345
<i>Oh, shut up, you fool!</i>

680
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:35,746
Our voices! It's almost as if they're amplified!

681
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,787
Oh, you, miserable...

682
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:47,220
You, you bit me!

683
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:51,856
I didn't like you at first,
and I don't like you now!

684
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:53,801
Wait! Wait!

685
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:58,098
<i>You bad, bad, bad boy! Let me out!</i>

686
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:09,243
What do you want me to do?
I don't care!

687
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,042
<i>You can't do a damn thing!</i>

688
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:18,524
Never, never, never, never, never!

689
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,157
Let the boy go!

690
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,493
<i>I never liked you, either!</i>

691
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:47,888
Holy shit.

692
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:53,589
<i>Whose car is this?</i>

693
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,862
Hey, Bubba!

694
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:57,957
Bubba?

695
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:00,363
Home, take me home!

696
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,597
Was that my car?

697
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,177
What did I do?
You hit the emergency brake!

698
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:10,776
<i>I'm sorry.
Get your paws off my derrière.</i>

699
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,491
Hey, hey.
Hey.

700
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:27,120
How's it going?

701
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,425
Okay, you two, have a really great time. 
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

702
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:32,627
Right.

703
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,602
Blow in her ear.
It really gets broads hot.

704
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:35,695
Thanks for the advice, Bubba.

705
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,535
Pinch her boobs.
It'll drive her crazy.

706
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,837
Great. I don't know what I'd do without you.

707
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,503
Bye.

708
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,283
Okay, read me the current spread.
Let's see.

709
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,287
All right. The odds against you 
getting her into the dorm are 2-to-1.

710
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,652
Now, if you do get her there...

711
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,248
...the odds against you getting any 
of her clothes off are 4-to-1.

712
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,419
It's 7-to-1 against you getting her top off.

713
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,894
Piece of cake, Roy, piece of cake.

714
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:02,864
But it's 9-to-1 against you 
getting any actual bare tit!

715
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,332
It's 12-to-1 against you
getting down to her panties.

716
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,801
And 15-to-1 against you
getting her mother-ass naked.

717
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:10,635
22-to-1 against you scoring in any way,
shape or form!

718
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:11,901
Yee-haw!

719
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,670
I'm gonna be rich!

720
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:28,919
Hello, can I speak to Jordan Leigh-Jensen, please?

721
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:34,025
Hello, Jordan? This is Bubba.

722
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,276
Nice place.

723
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,040
Yeah, nice.

724
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,543
How long ago did you say
your parents stayed here?

725
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,486
Twenty-three years ago, on their honeymoon.

726
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,622
May I help you?

727
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,188
I'm the graphic designer.

728
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,597
Excuse me?

729
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:13,192
I called you on the phone.

730
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,863
I made a reservation on the phone.
Do you remember?

731
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:18,032
And what name did you give?

732
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,540
Well, what name do you have?

733
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,236
Excuse me?

734
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,769
What I believe my wife is trying to say is 
that she telephoned about a week ago.

735
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,179
The name is Green.

736
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:30,549
Green. Green.
No, no, I'm afraid I have no Mr. Green.

737
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,112
It might be under Ramsay.

738
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,749
Ramsay, Ramsay, Ramsay.

739
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,986
Or possibly Jones.

740
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:46,698
Jones, Jones. Ah, yes, here we are.
Mr. and Mrs. Rams-Jones.

741
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,532
The honeymoon suite.

742
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,173
There's late-night entertainment in our piano bar.

743
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:58,408
Of course, you have your world famous sunsets
on the D'Amour beach.

744
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:02,542
And for a slight additional charge, 
the Jacuzzi and the tennis courts.

745
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:03,677
Well, here we are.

746
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,243
Is this the honeymoon suite?

747
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:09,586
They're all honeymoon suites since the remodeling.

748
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:40,348
And I hope that you have a pleasant stay.

749
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,288
Thank you.
Thank you.

750
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:57,137
Thank you.

751
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,840
Thank you very much, sir.

752
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,312
You could tape them together.

753
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,498
Well, so what do you think?

754
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,494
It's nice. It's very nice.

755
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:33,808
I wonder if this is anything like 
when Mom and Dad stayed here.

756
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,067
Wow, look at this.

757
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,581
Hey, pretty fancy, huh?

758
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,641
This tub looks like it could hold both of us.

759
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,581
I mean, if we wanted it to.

760
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,352
Look at this view.

761
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,823
Someone's at the door.

762
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,298
So what?

763
01:08:58,368 --> 01:09:00,893
Relax, will you? Who's there?

764
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:10,037
Some complimentary pink champagne,
Mr. Rams-Jones.

765
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:13,605
Hey, thank you.

766
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,612
Well, okay. Okay, enjoy it.

767
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,017
Thank you.

768
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,387
Wow, complimentary champagne.
This must've cost a mint.

769
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:24,048
Uh-oh.

770
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,552
What's wrong?

771
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,186
Oh, there aren't any glasses.

772
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,926
Well, we can drink out of the plastic ones
in the bathroom.

773
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:32,558
No, don't be silly.

774
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,772
I'll call room service.
I'm dying to give that guy a tip again.

775
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,749
Is that her?

776
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:53,354
I can't believe it!
You actually got her here.

777
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:54,788
What'd I tell you, numbnuts?

778
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:59,191
Okay. I got another 10 bucks says 
you get her top off but no bare tit.

779
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:02,021
You're on.
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

780
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,032
How are we supposed to know how far you get?

781
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,364
Yeah, you don't expect us to take his word for it,
do you?

782
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:09,371
Good as gold. The man's word is as good as gold. 
Trust me.

783
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,303
Bubba's told the truth every time!
Hold it! I'll tell you what.

784
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,368
You get in the closet with Roy, 
the rest of you assholes, out.

785
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,779
Hey, he gets to watch and not us. 
You in on this with Bubba and Roy?

786
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,783
Sam, every time he...
Hold up here!

787
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:24,786
I don't give a rat's ass which one of you
is in the closet with Roy...

788
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,687
...but I want the rest of you out of here 
by the time I get back with Jordan.

789
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:30,453
All right, gentlemen, last call. 
Here we go! 4-to-1 clothes off.

790
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,460
7-to-1 top off.
12-to-1 panties down.

791
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,553
22-to-1 score city. Who's in?

792
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,188
10 on panties!

793
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:39,434
Don't even mention it.
I'd do anything for that guy.

794
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:42,437
But I'll tell you, Jordan,
if he weren't my best buddy...

795
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,905
...I'd have to put the old moves on you myself.

796
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,442
Really, now?
But what about Betsy?

797
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:53,572
Betsy? Betsy's an amusing girl, 
but she and I are just good friends.

798
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:56,314
I got you both down.

799
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,191
Well, that's Jim's side.
I'm over here.

800
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,028
What do you think?
Marvelous.

801
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,156
Oh, surely you didn't do all this yourself?

802
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:14,135
Well, I guess some of the guys
in the dorm helped out.

803
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,812
So, how's about a drink?

804
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:25,746
When's Jim gonna get here?

805
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:27,612
Any minute. Any minute.

806
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:31,585
You just make yourself comfortable.
Take off your shoes!

807
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,851
Or any other tight, binding articles of clothing.

808
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:37,085
And I'll mix you that drink.

809
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:46,423
Ow!

810
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,336
What's wrong?
Wrong? Nothing. Nothing.

811
01:11:55,945 --> 01:11:58,470
You'll have to excuse me, Jordan.

812
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:03,416
It's just I'm not used to receiving
female visitors in my room.

813
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,355
And I must be a tad nervous.

814
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,329
Nervous, Bubba, you of all people?

815
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,433
It's just that, well...

816
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:25,630
Being here alone with you in this room...

817
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,697
Yes?

818
01:12:30,413 --> 01:12:34,076
I feel that my loyalty to Jim might be, well...

819
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,680
...compromised.

820
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,084
Compromised?

821
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,983
Yeah.

822
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,726
It isn't perfect.
It just isn't.

823
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:51,062
And I'm not feeling romantic
like I thought I would.

824
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,267
You're not?

825
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,566
Well, what are you feeling?

826
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,868
Nauseous.

827
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:07,407
Well, Chris, this is just what I need.

828
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,344
- What?
- Nothing.

829
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,545
No, what was it you said?
Nothing.

830
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:18,050
Listen, I'm sorry you're not feeling romantic,Chris. 
I'm feeling romantic.

831
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,526
You are?

832
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,927
Absolutely.

833
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,964
I mean, look at this place.

834
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,799
It's the most romantic place I've ever seen.

835
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:32,864
Like this bed.
Have you ever slept in a vibrating bed before?

836
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,371
No, but vibrating beds...

837
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:38,470
Have you ever had pink champagne,
and a red fur rug......

838
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:41,345
...and a knight in shining armor
standing by your bed?

839
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,510
- No.
- Well, all right.

840
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:46,783
So here we are in the most romantic place
in the world...

841
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:50,485
...and here you are with the most romantic guy
in the world.

842
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,593
Take me.

843
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:57,689
Take me and do with me what you will. 
Ravage me.

844
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:01,968
Are you feeling romantic now, my darling?

845
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:05,496
What I'm feeling is drunk and scared.

846
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,873
And like I'm gonna toss my cookies any second.

847
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:16,110
Damn.

848
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:20,622
And after our summer,
she begged me to stay, but...

849
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:27,988
That was Paris.

850
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,862
Look, Bubba, I'm getting really sick 
of waiting for your friend.

851
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,527
Jordan, just a little longer.
For Jim's sake.

852
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,502
Come on, this is ridiculous!
I'm gonna go!

853
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:37,334
Wait! Wait!

854
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:42,272
Now, Jim bought a bottle of vintage champagne
just for tonight.

855
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:47,305
He'd never forgive me if I let you go without
at least trying some. Please?

856
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,062
Voilà!

857
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:04,429
Red champagne?

858
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,525
The finest money can buy.

859
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,099
Just wait till you try this stuff.

860
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,263
Whoa!

861
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,207
Oh, I'm ...
Look what you've done!

862
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,107
My clothes are ruined!

863
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,146
Take them off! All of them!

864
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:20,478
Take them off and soak them.

865
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,481
I'll get you a towel.

866
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:44,564
No.

867
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:50,001
Got one!

868
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,111
- Give me that! Do you have any soda water? 
- Soda water?

869
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:58,983
To take the stains out!

870
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,920
I'll go see if we have any.

871
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:19,140
So tell me, Jordan, would you like to dance?

872
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:44,761
Oh, Betsy. What a great surprise.
I was just thinking about you.

873
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,358
Oh, yeah? I'm sure.

874
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,630
What in the world is going...

875
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,766
I suppose you two know each other?

876
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,068
What the hell are you doing here?

877
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:54,302
I came here to meet Jim,
if it's any of your business.

878
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:57,812
Is that right?
You expected Jim to leave Chris at the Hotel D'Amour?

879
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,245
No!
The Hotel D'Amour?

880
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:01,306
That's right. They left hours ago.

881
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:04,079
Jim is at the Hotel D'Amour with Chris?

882
01:17:06,522 --> 01:17:08,319
I can't believe this!

883
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:14,885
I spent all night in this pigsty with you
drinking after-shave cologne!

884
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:19,934
Listening to your boring stories about
what a big lover you are!

885
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,837
Where're my clothes?

886
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:26,169
Your clothes?

887
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,579
Where're my clothes?

888
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,112
How am I gonna go out like this?

889
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,025
Oh, thanks.

890
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:58,034
Now, come on, girls. Can't you take a joke?
I mean, come on, it's funny!

891
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:10,050
All right, come on.
15-to-1.

892
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,586
10-to-1.
All right.

893
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:13,281
Come on.
All right, Sam.

894
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,286
Hi, there.

895
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:49,346
Hi.

896
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:54,294
I couldn't find you.
I got worried.

897
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,666
I behaved like a real jerk.

898
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,173
So did I.

899
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,110
I love you, Chris.

900
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,386
I know. I love you, too.

901
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,117
I guess this just wasn't it.

902
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,858
Wasn't what?

903
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:28,827
The right time, the right place, the right anything.

904
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:34,197
I tried so hard to pretend that it was.

905
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,194
It just wasn't.

906
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:42,339
It was just, I don't know, like, too...

907
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:43,971
Tacky?

908
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:51,149
God, I'm glad you said that.
I was afraid that you liked it.

909
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,750
Really?
I was afraid you liked it.

910
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:08,233
I never could love anybody
more than I love you, Chris.

911
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,266
Oh, Jim.

912
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,817
I can't believe you made me late
to my own graduation.

913
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:13,757
Now, Jordan, your father doesn't
get married every day.

914
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:15,023
Just about every other day.

915
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:17,657
Yes, Miss Copuletta.
I mean, Mother.

916
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:19,894
Chauncey, stay with the car this time.

917
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:23,995
But, of course, Mr. Leigh-Jensen. 
I always stay close to the car.

918
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,812
<i>Parents, faculty, honored guests.</i>

919
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:43,785
<i>Welcome to the 86th Commencement Exercises
of Cherryvale Academy.</i>

920
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:47,621
Well, the year is finally at an end.

921
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:52,599
<i>It has been a long, hard struggle but, girls,
we've pulled together...</i>

922
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:55,762
<i>...and now you have finally completed your studies.</i>

923
01:22:55,871 --> 01:23:00,968
<i>I see your teachers aglow
with the satisfaction of a job well done.</i>

924
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,372
I see...

925
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:06,976
I see...

926
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:12,113
Never!

927
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,821
Your parents, secure in the knowledge...

928
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:19,622
<i>that their daughters have received the very best.</i>

929
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:22,458
<i>And, you graduates, I see your joy.</i>

930
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:25,898
<i>The justifiable pride
in your accomplishments.</i>

931
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:30,171
<i>The excitement as you go
forward into your futures.</i>

932
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,436
<i>You've blossomed
from awkward adolescence...</i>

933
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:36,410
<i>...into the full bloom
of young womanhood.</i>

934
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:41,415
<i>But with this joy
comes a tug at the throat.</i>

935
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,046
<i>A tiny sorrow.</i>

936
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,482
<i>A tender nostalgia.</i>

937
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:47,579
Hey, watch it, man!

938
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:50,819
<i>I can remember my own days here
as a student.</i>

939
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:56,854
<i>And certainly, on a day like today, 
comes a wide array of varied emotions.</i>

940
01:23:57,566 --> 01:24:01,297
<i>In future years,you'll reflect upon
your years here...</i>

941
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:06,737
<i>...and remember them, I am certain, 
as the happiest time of your life.</i>

942
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:09,333
<i>What of my own feelings?</i>

943
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:12,777
<i>Well, we have had
our ups and downs...</i>

944
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:16,409
<i>...but I shall miss your shining faces...</i>

945
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:20,717
<i>...even as you go forth 
to fulfill your bright promise.</i>

946
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:24,953
<i>And now I shall yield
the floor to Miss Newhouse...</i>

947
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:28,019
<i>...who, for reasons
I don't pretend to understand...</i>

948
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:33,659
<i>...has been elected to make the farewell remarks
on behalf of the graduates.</i>

949
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:38,239
- Sunny days.
- Sunny days.

950
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,407
Thank you, Miss Dutchbok.

951
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:46,572
On behalf of the entire graduating class...

952
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:49,116
...I'd like to thank you
for all you've done for us.

953
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:52,051
No, you won't be seeing
our shining faces anymore.

954
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,588
Here's something
you can always remember us by.

955
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,123
Ready, girls?

956
01:24:56,892 --> 01:25:00,828
Graduation, Cherryvale!
You won't forget us soon!

957
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,592
Sunny days ahead of us!
We leave behind this moon!

958
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:09,197
Way to go!
