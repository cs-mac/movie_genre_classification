{2946}{2995}My name is Don Juan DeMarco...
{3004}{3099}...son of the great swordsman|Antonio Garibaldi DeMarco...
{3108}{3187}...tragically killed defending|the honor of my mother...
{3194}{3284}the beautiful Dona Ines|Santiago y San Martine.
{3322}{3382}I am the world's greatest lover.
{3818}{3898}I have made love|to over a thousand women.
{3938}{3990}I was 21 last Tuesday.
{4114}{4186}-Good evening, sir.|-Good evening, Nicholas.
{4284}{4366}No woman has ever|left my arms unsatisfied.
{4374}{4417}Only one has rejected me...
{4428}{4474}and as fortune would have it...
{4478}{4556}she's the only one who|has ever mattered.
{4562}{4591}This is why...
{4596}{4624}at 21...
{4630}{4694}I have determined to end|my life.
{4724}{4747}But first...
{4770}{4822}one final conquest.
{5480}{5502}May I?
{5508}{5538}Actually...
{5542}{5608}I'm expecting a friend.|He should be here soon.
{5642}{5673}I will not linger.
{5736}{5761}I am Don Juan.
{5830}{5864}That's very funny.
{5872}{5912}ls there|a costume party at the hotel?
{5918}{5970}No, I am Don Juan...
{5982}{6048}directly descended from|the noble Spanish family.
{6062}{6113}And you seduce women.
{6120}{6180}No, I never take advantage|of a woman.
{6202}{6243}I give women pleasure...
{6262}{6291}if they desire it.
{6342}{6423}It is of coursethe greatest pleasure|they will ever experience.
{6585}{6632}There are some women...
{6649}{6694}fine-featured...
{6700}{6736}a certain...
{6742}{6788}texture to the hair,
{6794}{6846}a curve to the ears, that ....
{6852}{6909}that sweeps like the turn|of a shell.
{6942}{6978}these women...
{7032}{7068}have fingers...
{7085}{7161}with the same sensitivities|as their legs.
{7180}{7274}The fingertips have|the same feelings as their feet.
{7290}{7344}When you touch their knuckles,
{7374}{7458}it is like passing your hands|along their knees...
{7480}{7517}and this...
{7534}{7606}tender, fleshy part|of their finger...
{7650}{7744}is the same as brushing your hands|around their thighs...
{7862}{7885}and...
{7912}{7942}finally...
{8167}{8250}Every woman is a mystery|to be solved...
{8258}{8346}but a woman hides nothing|from a true lover.
{8364}{8447}Her skin color can tell us|how to proceed.
{8454}{8560}A hue like the blush of a rose,|pink and pale...
{8566}{8627}and she must be coaxed|to open her petals...
{8634}{8680}with a warmth like the sun.
{8692}{8737}The pale and dappled skin
{8742}{8806}of the redhead|calls for the lust of a wave...
{8812}{8846}crashing to shore...
{8852}{8904}so we may stir up what lies beneath...
{8910}{8988}and bring the foamy delight|of love to the surface.
{9000}{9021}Although there is...
{9028}{9126}no metaphor truly describes|making love to a woman,
{9132}{9212}the closest is playing|a rare musical instrument.
{9223}{9256}I wonder:
{9262}{9332}Does a Stradivarius violin feel...
{9336}{9396}the same rapture|as enraptured as the violinist...
{9400}{9489}when he coaxes a single,|perfect note from its heart?
{9990}{10026}Muchas gracias, senorita.
{10044}{10132}Every true lover knows that|the moment of greatest satisfaction...
{10138}{10209}comes when ecstasy is long over...
{10218}{10266}and he beholds before him...
{10270}{10347}the flowers which has blossomed|beneath his touch.
{10452}{10508}Sorry I'm late, it was unavoidable.
{10570}{10634}Hope you went ahead|without me.
{10850}{10875}Oh well.
{10882}{10922}Now I must die.
{11066}{11129}THE BEACHES OF|CANARY ISLANDS
{11138}{11204}Unmask the Mysteries.
{11816}{11842}-Hey.|-Evening, Jack.
{11848}{11882}How you doing, man?
{11928}{11974}You're putting on|a little weight here.
{11980}{12074}You know..., you and me been|going to the same bakery.
{12098}{12129}Sorry to do this to you, Jack.
{12136}{12212}but this is a job, that|only Super-shrink can handle.
{12230}{12320}He's a jumper to be|reckoned with, I'm telling you.
{12338}{12367}What's the costume?
{12374}{12412}He's Don Juan.
{12418}{12487}"He wishes to end his life...
{12506}{12564}gloriously".|He wants us...
{12576}{12636}to send our finest swordsman...
{12642}{12708}to do battle with him,|preferably...
{12732}{12787}"Don Francisco de Silva".
{12794}{12843}Did he actually say this?
{12869}{12908}I was up there.
{13033}{13064}How do you get in this?
{13086}{13109}Over here.
{13269}{13330}You sure this is how|Freud started?
{13336}{13394}What do I know?|I'm just a dumb cop.
{13400}{13434}You're the shrink.
{13786}{13831}Where is|Don Francisco de Silva?
{13837}{13876}I will fight none other.
{13891}{13914}Where is he?
{13922}{13972}Don Francisco de Silva...
{14005}{14066}Left for Mallorca...
{14073}{14158}on this weekend|but I am his uncle...
{14169}{14230}Don Octavio de Flores.
{14240}{14332}This will not do. I must die|at the hands of Don Francisco.
{14338}{14375}I am Don Juan DeMarco.
{14390}{14449}You are the Don Juan?
{14473}{14500}This is correct.
{14528}{14600}Why, with so many successes,
{14608}{14676}does the great Don Juan|wish to end his life?
{14682}{14745}Because there is nothing left|to live for.
{14769}{14844}Do you mean to say|there is nothing at all?
{14910}{14938}Not when...
{14944}{14980}my Dona Ana is everything.
{15028}{15064}Her name is Dona Ana.
{15100}{15160}Now you understand|why I must die.
{15210}{15290}I ask only that it be at the hands|of Don Francisco...
{15294}{15381}so it may be said I died in glory|from a worthy opponent.
{15388}{15453}Don Juan, this young woman...
{15468}{15528}Dona Ana, must be very special.
{15541}{15608}I would like so much to hear|about her.
{15690}{15784}Have you never met a woman|who inspires you to love...
{15805}{15887}until your every sense|is filled with her?
{15904}{15942}You inhale her...
{15958}{15988}you taste her...
{16016}{16100}you see your unborn children|in her eyes...
{16108}{16165}and you know that your heart|has at last found a home.
{16210}{16256}Your life begins with her...
{16280}{16364}and without her|it must surely end.
{16442}{16504}I have no doubt losing a love like this...
{16510}{16580}can be very painful, ....
{16590}{16658}but why lose hope|along with life?
{16664}{16681}Why lose everything?
{16720}{16768}You must not forget, my friend...
{16784}{16842}that the power of your love...
{16848}{16932}the power of the love of Don Juan|is eternal...
{16940}{16987}and will not be denied.
{17104}{17140}I apologize...
{17158}{17228}for this unmanly display,|Don Octavio.
{17424}{17458}Please.
{17524}{17546}I accept.
{17643}{17674}Bravo.
{17702}{17730}Bravo.
{18181}{18219}Good Morning, Doc!
{18360}{18455}White male, age 21,|brought in on a ten-day paper...
{18460}{18520}after suicidal gesture...
{18552}{18614}apparently precipitated by a...
{18628}{18672}break-up of a relationship.
{18686}{18726}And the patient...
{18738}{18810}indicates no previous history|of suicides,
{18814}{18877}no record of prior hospitalization.
{18918}{18995}There's no record of anything,|school, jail...
{19002}{19048}mother, father, parents, nothing.
{19066}{19116}And this kid is...
{19124}{19171}"bizzako"...
{19190}{19215}and is...
{19222}{19265}severely delusional....
{19284}{19325}and believes he's somebody else.
{19332}{19354}Anybody we know?
{19376}{19404}Name is Don Juan.
{19452}{19479}-I'm working nights again.
{19482}{19510}All right, okay.
{19516}{19544}I'm not kidding.
{19580}{19617}Let's settle down and...
{19622}{19668}I'm always the bad boy.
{19716}{19742}Who wants him?
{19883}{19908}I do.
{19918}{19962}-Wait.|-Don't be exasperated.
{19972}{20001}Wait a minute.
{20010}{20041}Are you not retiring?
{20048}{20126}Of course I'm retiring, but I think|it make a hell of a swan song.
{20130}{20214}This sound like a long term case to me,|the way you described it.
{20220}{20281}I'm ganna give it to Bill.|Do you have the time?
{20478}{20532}Wait. Hold on one second.
{20536}{20616}No offense. I'd like to|discuss this in some detail.
{20622}{20663}Can you talk about it later?
{20670}{20716}-Is that alright?|-I look forward to it.
{20738}{20776}I want this kid.
{20798}{20840}Be reasonable. Jack...
{20844}{20896}You're leaving in ten days.
{20902}{20936}So is the kid.
{20966}{21045}A delusional patient does not|get cured in a week and a half.
{21050}{21124}The instant his 10-day paper|expires, he'll be committed...
{21130}{21170}Then we'll have to transfer|him to Bill anyway.
{21176}{21215}If this was a year ago...
{21220}{21308}and I said I'd get this kid out of here|in 10 days, there'd be no doubt.
{21312}{21348}That's probably true.
{21360}{21406}So that's not the real reason|you're giving him to Bill.
{21532}{21596}You've been doing it by the numbers |for months now. You know it.
{21610}{21641}You're burnt out.
{21648}{21688}That's why you asked|for early retirement.
{21694}{21758}You don't need more time|to travel with Marilyn.
{21776}{21827}Don't make my life harder for me|than it has to be.
{21832}{21911}How long have I known you?|For 25 years we've been going around like this?
{21916}{21997}Yes, and during that time you're the|best damn clinician this place has seen.
{22004}{22075}The best, everybody knows that.|But now it's time...
{22084}{22146}You know, it's time to get away.|Where are you going?
{22152}{22213}The pyramids? Oh, it's wonderful.|All that sand...
{22220}{22292}that sky, those vistas,|you'll have a wonderful time.
{22296}{22349}I wish you could see your face.
{22382}{22426}I'm giving him to Bill.
{22500}{22536}This kid is gonna do
{22542}{22638}a flamenco number on Bill's head|until it looks like a tortilla...
{22644}{22686}and it's gonna be on your watch.
{22920}{22954}Would you...
{22960}{23024}Would you like to talk about|why you attempted to kill yourself?
{23090}{23169}You want Don Juan DeMarco,|the world's greatest lover...
{23174}{23211}to talk to you?
{23244}{23290}What do you know of great love?
{23380}{23434}Have you ever loved a woman...
{23452}{23508}until milk leaked from her
{23512}{23592}as though she had just|given birth to love itself...
{23600}{23653}and now must feed it or burst?
{23746}{23800}Have you ever tasted a woman...
{23822}{23898}until she believed that|she could be satisfied...
{23906}{23989}only by consuming the tongue|that had devoured her?
{24008}{24092}Have you ever loved|a woman so completely...
{24112}{24174}that the sound|of your voice in her ear...
{24180}{24228}could cause|her body to shudder
{24234}{24310}and explode with|such intense pleasure...
{24332}{24404}that only weeping could|bring her full release?
{24484}{24530}Where is Don Octavio De Flores?
{24534}{24586}Who? Who?
{24600}{24630}My host at this villa.
{24677}{24701}Villa?
{24821}{24856}Villa?
{24868}{24888}Si, villa.
{25030}{25072}Where is Don Octavio?
{25137}{25178}You mean Dr. Mickler?
{25204}{25225}Who?
{25324}{25402}Why do you think that|Dr. Mickler is...
{25410}{25470}Don Octavio de Flores?
{25488}{25558}Why do you think Don Octavio|de Flores is Dr. Mickler?
{25761}{25797}Hello there, Willy.
{25820}{25847}How are you?
{25861}{25896}-Don Octavio de Flores?
{25906}{25978}-I just said...|-You told him that you were|Don Octavio de Flores?
{25984}{26005}Oh, Jesus.
{26012}{26064}You told a delusional patient...
{26072}{26121}you were a 17th century|Spanish nobleman.
{26128}{26181}The idea|was to get him in the bucket, right?
{26204}{26257}Well, he's all yours, Don.
{26284}{26348}Wait a minute,|did you tell Paul?
{26354}{26392}You bet i did.
{26398}{26433}And what did he say?
{26456}{26490}His exact words were,
{26498}{26559}"Jack broke it,|let him fix it".
{26746}{26813}This is very kind of you|to show me the way.
{27000}{27021}Yeah, come on in.
{27050}{27072}Dr. Mickler.....
{27078}{27129}Dr. Mickler...., I've brought...
{27174}{27244}Mr. Juan here for his appointment.
{27256}{27290}Thank you, Gloria.
{27298}{27357}I can return at the end|of the hour and see him back.
{27362}{27429}-No, it's okay, I'll do it.|-It's really no trouble.
{27434}{27521}I'll be passing by this door|in exactly one hour.
{27526}{27575}-Gloria. Thank you.|-I have a break coming up.
{27580}{27631}-Thanks a lot.|-No problem.
{27664}{27721}What are you doing|to these girls?
{27754}{27781}Gosh almighty.
{27848}{27898}Your people took my mask,|Don Octavio.
{27928}{27959}They had no right to do that.
{27972}{28013}I never remove|my mask in public.
{28017}{28104}Do you understand|the consequences of this?
{28110}{28156}Not fully, but...
{28196}{28236}Well, I will be cursed.
{28262}{28353}I can certainly understand|how that could be upsetting.
{28375}{28411}Think how you would feel...
{28417}{28447}if you were made to take off|this mask that you are wearing.
{28495}{28575}Our masks really|get us in Dutch, don't they?
{28598}{28631}How long you been wearing yours?
{28650}{28690}Since I was 16.
{28762}{28819}I placed the mask on my face
{28834}{28915}and vowed never to remove it,|on the day I left my mother,
{28921}{28986}the dark beauty, Dona Ines.
{29028}{29091}I have some pills here.|I'd like you
{29114}{29165}and I'd like you to take them,|l think they'll help.
{29170}{29210}Pills to stop delusions?
{29223}{29297}Then I am afraid we must take|these pills together...
{29305}{29329}because...
{29336}{29395}you are severely deluded.
{29458}{29509}What delusions have I got?
{29540}{29602}This fantasy that you are some...
{29616}{29643}Dr. Mickler.
{29678}{29731}I'm very disappointed in you,|Don Octavio.
{29736}{29783}Very disappointed.
{29805}{29843}Here's the drill.
{29848}{29931}They can make you take the medication.|That's State law.
{29964}{30023}You're on what they call|a 10-day paper.
{30028}{30082}For those 10 days|they can do...
{30089}{30161}-whatever they think is appropriate.|-I am not deluded.
{30184}{30206}I am Don Juan.
{30228}{30328}If you will not medicate me|for these 10 days, I'll prove it to you.
{30334}{30425}Alright. What if I don't believe|you're Don Juan?
{30595}{30653}Then I will take your medication...
{30684}{30758}and you may commit me|for as long as you like.
{30823}{30861}Do we have an agreement?
{30898}{30953}Do I have these 10 days|to tell you my story?
{31133}{31161}Very well.
{31184}{31223}I was born in Mexico.
{31768}{31830}It became evident from|a very early age...
{31842}{31898}that there was something|different about me.
{32320}{32342}I, myself...
{32350}{32392}slowly began to realize|that my play
{32398}{32495}was not like that|of the other boys.
{32518}{32612}By the time I was 10,|the attraction that females had for me
{32617}{32668}was becoming of some concern|to my mother.
{32678}{32724}She presented me to God...
{32733}{32806}and asked the Lord to save me|before it was too late.
{32824}{32858}Apparently...
{32864}{32903}it was too late.
{33010}{33116}The lessons I learned in church|were not without value, however.
{33138}{33189}By the time I was 12,
{33194}{33261}I understood the obligation|the Lord spoke of
{33266}{33337}to share one's blessings|with those less fortunate.
{33684}{33707}Vayanse ya de aqui!
{33713}{33750}Se acabo lo bueno!
{33860}{33886}One night...
{33892}{33972}I watched Dona Querida|at the window in her slip.
{33994}{34064}and noticed,for the first time|how a woman's underclothing...
{34070}{34110}barely touches her skin...
{34123}{34228}how it rides on|a cushion of air as she moves...
{34234}{34312}how the silk floats about|her body, brushing her flesh...
{34318}{34366}like an angel's wings...
{34398}{34485}and I understood how a woman|must be touched.
{34544}{34589}Are you Italian,
{34594}{34649}Mexican or Spanish?
{34654}{34721}That is all you have to say?|What is my nationality?
{34726}{34812}No. Your name is DeMarco.|That's Italian.
{34818}{34925}You were brought up in Mexico|and whwn you speak English,
{34930}{34983}you speak it|with a Castilian accent.
{35026}{35103}My accent has been colored|by my many travels.
{35148}{35225}Very well, I will answer your question.|I was raised in Mexico.
{35238}{35294}My father was born in Queens.
{35300}{35390}His name was Tony DeMarco.|He was Italian. The Dance King of Astoria.
{35396}{35419}Excuse me.
{35424}{35482}Your father was a dance king...
{35488}{35549}here in New York City,|in Astoria?
{35567}{35580}Si
{35634}{35720}My father had come to Mexico to work|for a pharmaceutical company.
{35728}{35787}He had just gotten off the bus|and was walking...
{35792}{35863}to a nearby hacienda|to inquire about renting a room...
{35870}{35913}when he first saw my mother.
{35928}{35991}Both her parents were killed|by a sickness.
{35996}{36031}My mother was younger and stronger.
{36036}{36115}and survived.|She took over their plantation.
{36148}{36179}Sitting in the sunlight|on the veranda...
{36216}{36308}the bright rays lighting her hair,|she was a vision so beautiful...
{36340}{36424}that, at first, my father|could not believe his eyes.
{36434}{36495}It was love at first sight.
{37374}{37465}They held each other in|the moonlight, kissing and touching
{37470}{37504}dancing until morning.
{37512}{37598}I thought you said that your mother|was standing in the sunlight.
{37604}{37673}That's my father's story.|My mother says it was at night.
{37780}{37831}They were married|the next week.
{37836}{37892}My father took|the name Don Antonio...
{37898}{37988}and became "el patron",|running the coffee plantation.
{38010}{38083}Their love was like|a perfect prayer.
{38096}{38148}Even God could not deny it.
{38154}{38225}I was born exactly|nine months later.
{38282}{38339}So I said to him ''Let me just|see if I understand this".
{38341}{38439}''You have been exploring|our car for six days now...
{38455}{38502}"and you still have absolutely no idea|what's wrong with it..."
{38514}{38563}''why the radiator keeps|running out of fluid?"
{38581}{38638}''So this means|we get the car back..."
{38629}{38661}''just as broken as when|we brought it in..."
{38676}{38766}"Except now you want us to pay|you $430 for the time it took you..."
{38772}{38829}"not to figure out what's wrong"
{38838}{38862}Know what he said to me?
{38900}{38980}"We can keep looking if you want,|Mrs. Mickler...
{39000}{39065}...but it's $65 an hour".
{39282}{39348}Well, I don't know, pay the guy.
{39360}{39383}Pay it?
{39496}{39534}Where were you just now?
{39588}{39619}Down in Mexico.
{40212}{40268}-Jack, I was looking for you.|-A little springtime.
{40278}{40325}-Excuse me, Nurse.|-You're giving me tulips?
{40330}{40360}-Grace, I'm sorry.|-Thank you.
{40368}{40424}-Jack, why are you giving me tulips?|-l want to talk to you about the kid.
{40430}{40496}-What's the occasion for tulips?|-Listen, the hell of it.
{40504}{40545}This kid is fantastico.
{40550}{40601}I'm glad he's meeting|your expectations.
{40606}{40673}-Jack, there's something I want to discuss.|-I know you do.
{40678}{40761}-Let me tell you what he did this morning.|-Please, wait! Jack!
{40766}{40833}When do you intend to start|Don Juan on medication?
{40838}{40869}He's been here 2 days.
{40890}{40937}You do intend to|give him medication?
{40944}{40970}Well, I don't know.
{40976}{41026}Wait.|He's a delusional patient.
{41032}{41054}Meds?
{41070}{41109}If I give him medication...
{41114}{41161}I'll never get into this world...
{41166}{41235}that he's in and it's a wonderful world.
{41278}{41301}-No meds.|-Ok.
{41306}{41332}-Temporarily.|-Thank you.
{41338}{41388}-If you do one thing for me.|-What's that?
{41394}{41424}Well, right now...
{41460}{41570}Don Juan is having a distracting|influence on the female staff up in his unit..
{41587}{41621}I mean, officially, in his hacienda...
{41632}{41664}there are more nurses|on Valium than patients.
{41676}{41711}-Right.|-Could you do something about that?
{41716}{41780}I took care of it, my dear man.|Don't worry about it.
{41806}{41839}Hey, man,|it's time for your shrink.
{41862}{41931}-Who are you?|-I'm your new nurse, Mr. Compton...
{41938}{41987}but you can call me "Rocco",|Casanova.
{42022}{42056}I am not Casanova.
{42066}{42094}I am Don Juan.
{42100}{42138}Yeah, right. Come on, man.
{42564}{42585}Come in.
{42622}{42659}Doc, Don Juan.
{42666}{42695}Hi, Rocco.
{42700}{42729}Thank you.
{42788}{42829}Well, got a real treat|for you today.
{42854}{42895}Here are her nipples...
{42900}{42933}and here's her pubis.
{42962}{43038}Her lover is kissing the contours|of her bottom...
{43050}{43116}just where it folds|onto her upper thighs.
{43322}{43364}Why don't we move on|to something else?
{43378}{43416}What do you have in mind,|Don Octavio?
{43422}{43465}Why don't we talk about...
{43474}{43505}who I am?
{43510}{43547}Yes, i know who you are.
{43554}{43577}Who am I?
{43582}{43666}You're Don Octavio de Flores|the uncle of Don Francisco de Silva.
{43704}{43751}And where are we, here?
{43756}{43832}I haven't seen a deed,|but assume the villa is yours.
{43846}{43910}What would you say to someone
{43922}{44016}that said to you this is a|psychiatric hospital and that
{44022}{44062}you're a patient here
{44068}{44127}and that I am your psychiatrist?
{44132}{44200}I would say that he has a rather|limited, uncreative way of looking
{44210}{44240}at the situation.
{44274}{44356}You want to know if I understand|that this is a mental hospital.
{44362}{44404}Yes, i understand that.
{44430}{44495}But then how can I say|that you are Don Octavio...
{44500}{44557}and I am a guest|at your villa, correct?
{44584}{44653}By seeing beyond|what is visible to the eye.
{44678}{44773}Now, there are those, of course, who|do not share my perceptions, it's true.
{44780}{44829}When I say|that all my women are..
{44834}{44910}dazzling beauties,|they object.
{44938}{44990}The nose of this one is too large...
{44998}{45089}The hips of another, are too wide,|perhaps the breasts...
{45094}{45137}of a third, they are too small.
{45142}{45220}But I see these women|for how they truly are:
{45242}{45268}Glorious...
{45276}{45321}radiant, spectacular...
{45334}{45437}and perfect because|I am not limited by my eyesight.
{45470}{45531}Women react to me the way|that they do, Don Octavio...
{45536}{45642}because they sense that I search out|the beauty that dwells within them
{45652}{45714}until it overwhelms|everything else.
{45724}{45790}And then, they cannot avoid|their desire...
{45798}{45879}to release that beauty|and envelop me in it.
{45896}{45929}To answer your question...
{45948}{46007}I see as clear as day that this...
{46014}{46062}that this great edifice|in which we find ourselves...
{46070}{46133}is your villa,|it is your home...
{46156}{46226}and as far for you,|Don Octavio de Flores,
{46238}{46297}you are a great lover|like myself...
{46320}{46374}even though you may|have lost your way...
{46398}{46426}and your accent.
{46456}{46494}Shall I continue?
{46554}{46582}Very well.
{46592}{46624}Back to Mexico.
{46676}{46733}My mother, God bless her,
{46738}{46782}does not give up easily.
{46804}{46839}When i was 16,
{46844}{46926}she made one last attempt|to instill Christian values in me...
{46932}{46978}by finding me a tutor.
{46998}{47081}My mother's judgement|left something to be desired.
{47104}{47174}Dona Julia was 23 and married,
{47186}{47269}the faithful and devoted wife|of Don Alfonso...
{47276}{47314}a man of 50.
{47336}{47418}It was no secret that Dona Julia,|would have been much better served by...
{47424}{47474}two men of 25.
{47478}{47565}"Glorify God in your body|and your spirit...
{47602}{47655}which are God's"
{47748}{47820}My feelings consumed me|day and night.
{47826}{47862}I felt within me...
{47868}{47902}a torment...
{47910}{47972}a burning wound...|a yearning...
{47978}{48057}combined with the most|indescribable bliss...
{48076}{48115}but what was it?
{48120}{48178}And you had no idea what it was?
{48184}{48237}Well, I had an idea, but...
{48276}{48314}nothing definite.
{48340}{48369}My father,
{48374}{48444}understanding that manhood|was nearly upon me,
{48452}{48516}began to teach me how|to use my sword.
{48524}{48613}So a lot of sword fighting|went on when you were growing up?
{48618}{48728}It was a small and isolated town|that resisted modern technology.
{48752}{48779}Advance.
{48784}{48814}Lunge.
{49160}{49208}I notice that the smile...
{49214}{49260}on Dona Julia's face was gone.
{49278}{49370}It had been replaced by a sadness|even sweeter than the smile.
{49376}{49451}I sensed that Dona Julia was|having a struggle within her....
{49468}{49557}and my own situation was becoming|no less difficult.
{49634}{49687}I could only think of|Dona Julia.
{49724}{49776}To keep myself from going mad...
{49782}{49837}I turned into a metaphysician.
{49870}{49932}I considered the meaning|of the truth...
{49948}{49979}of being...
{49992}{50025}and God.
{50088}{50156}I thought of the timetable|for the sun's demise...
{50180}{50264}and then I thought|of Dona Julia's eyes.
{50838}{50878}I never will consent.
{50962}{51003}I never will consent.
{51048}{51088}I never will consent.
{51116}{51167}But somehow,|she consented.
{51172}{51200}She did.
{51634}{51711}Then suddenly i was hit|with a revelation:
{51716}{51765}The way a woman's body is made,
{51772}{51815}the way a man's body responds to it,
{51819}{51877}the fire burning in my loins,
{51904}{51972}the intense desire|to merge as one...
{51984}{52014}it all came together...
{52040}{52106}in one brilliant flash.
{52628}{52723}There are only four questions|of value in life, Don Octavio.
{52764}{52800}What is sacred?
{52830}{52873}Of what is the spirit made?
{52904}{52948}What is worth living for?
{52969}{53013}And what is worth dying for?
{53062}{53118}The answer to each is the same.
{53156}{53190}Only love.
{53300}{53332}Dona Julia...
{53342}{53386}was my first love.
{53480}{53504}Well,
{53562}{53603}I see our time is up.
{53681}{53715}The mask?
{53826}{53886}Obsessive compulsive disorder...
{53898}{53951}with eroto-manic features.
{54000}{54025}Confirm...
{54046}{54092}delusional disorder.
{54176}{54213}Confirm depression with...
{54219}{54269}obsessional features.
{54825}{54888}Possible hysterical personality.
{55542}{55610}I take it you want to go upstairs.
{55628}{55668}What gave you that idea?
{55732}{55782}Why are you listening|to opera?
{55794}{55824}You hate opera.
{55830}{55861}You have very...
{55869}{55916}very beautiful eyes.
{55950}{55972}Come here.
{56031}{56096}You know, I have to go upstairs and...
{56116}{56198}take my calcium so my bones don't|break into little pieces...
{56204}{56269}my aspirin, so my heart|doesn't clog up...
{56274}{56351}my Metamucil, so I don't get|colon cancer...
{56356}{56432}and, of course, my estrogen|to convince my body...
{56437}{56482}that I'm still 23.
{56550}{56575}Come here.
{57269}{57315}What the hell are you doing in there?
{57872}{57900}Rain check?
{57972}{57998}No, no.
{58004}{58065}I was thinking about|our adolescence.
{58069}{58113}There isn't any
{58122}{58201}transitional battleground left|for us anymore.
{58210}{58295}I just feel as thought|we've surrendered our lives to
{58316}{58387}the momentum of mediocrity.
{58419}{58493}What happened|to all the celestial fire...
{58498}{58546}that used to light our way?
{58552}{58604}Oh, Jack, no. Listen, honey.
{58619}{58697}You know all those fires|are a lot of trouble.
{58702}{58801}They caused a lot of trouble,|are hard to control, they flare up
{58806}{58859}they burn a lot of energy...
{58882}{58922}and then they suddenly die.
{58928}{58995}I want to tell you something.|That's bullshit because...
{59000}{59050}No, it's not bullshit.
{59056}{59128}A good, steady, warm, glow...
{59172}{59238}you know, that does the trick|over the long run.
{59252}{59286}No fire...
{59292}{59319}No heat.
{59324}{59375}No heat, No life.
{59382}{59449}-That's the equation.|-No, no Jack.
{59524}{59554}May I assume that...
{59560}{59656}the upshot of all this is that you will not|be easing gracefully into retirement?
{59662}{59745}Goddamn right, baby.|What am I going to retire from?
{59752}{59775}Life?
{59798}{59834}Listen. We haven't started yet.
{59823}{59879}This is a 1 2-rounder,|and this is the third round...
{59893}{59951}and you and I are going to go|out of here like Halley's comet.
{60013}{60086}Listen to me. What is going on?
{60102}{60141}You've been funny lately.
{60187}{60207}I don't know.
{60212}{60266}Come on, you gotta me, Jack.
{60272}{60343}It's no secret.|I don't know.
{60348}{60379}I've been feeling...
{60400}{60475}I've been treating this|kid lately.
{60480}{60563}He thinks he's Don Juan|and he's got a costume.
{60578}{60635}He's got a sword and a mask and...
{60640}{60688}And so who is he really?
{60748}{60785}I don't know.
{60814}{60855}But he's...
{60887}{60931}he's getting to me.
{61306}{61371}Goddamn. you're a great broad,|really.
{61487}{61512}I know.
{61537}{61589}This is going to be a good one.
{61808}{61870}-Oh, Jesus, not there, honey.|-Wait, I'm sorry.
{61886}{61943}Damn, What is that?|Your hair comb?
{61984}{62044}-I'm on my hair clasp. It's got teeth !|-I don't want to be injured here.
{62066}{62156}At every instant we fell into|each other's arms.
{62168}{62235}Time stopped|for those four months.
{62244}{62337}There was neither day or night,|just my love and hers.
{62360}{62398}As for Don Alfonso...
{62410}{62501}he spent so much time away handling|the details of his trading business,
{62506}{62595}that I was practically able|to live in Dona Julia's house.
{62602}{62687}I truly believed I had found|everlasting paradise...
{62692}{62733}until one night...
{62738}{62766}Dona Julia...
{62772}{62820}my sweet bird!
{62962}{62988}Where is he?
{62994}{63074}-Where have you hidden him?|-For God sakes, Don Alfonso...
{63082}{63120}What sort of drunken fit|has seized you?
{63132}{63185}How dare you suspect me!|Me, who the thought
{63190}{63227}of infidelity would surely kill.
{63234}{63263}Yes, search...
{63269}{63335}and search and search.|Heap insult on insult.
{63342}{63417}You ungrateful, purgerous,|barbarous man.
{63431}{63476}Are you quite satisfied now?
{63482}{63544}I will kill this man.
{63598}{63628}My sword.
{63652}{63692}Where is my sword?
{63804}{63843}He's going to kill me.
{63886}{63913}He's going to kill me.
{64014}{64056}Quick. Go out the garden gate.
{64342}{64382}I will kill you!
{64622}{64695}It was the last I was ever to see|of my tutor...
{64719}{64767}the lovely Dona Julia.
{64820}{64913}In great remorse, she left that night|and was never to be heard of again.
{64950}{64999}Don Alfonso|was humiliated
{65005}{65069}that he had been cuckolded|by a 16-year old boy...
{65075}{65155}so to retaliate,|he announced publicly...
{65160}{65251}that he and my mother had been|having an affair for many years.
{65300}{65373}It was, of course,|a bold-faced and terrible lie.
{65414}{65495}My father was quick|to defend my mother's virtue.
{65628}{65650}I have no doubt...
{65658}{65709}my father would've prevailed...
{65720}{65761}were it not|for one fatal mistake.
{65832}{65880}He looked up|at my mother's eyes...
{65908}{65959}and it was too late.
{66188}{66220}Antonio...
{66498}{66522}No, Juan!
{66536}{66607}I will lose them both!
{66616}{66656}You have killed my father.
{66666}{66693}Now you must kill me.
{67966}{67997}Forgive me, father.
{68040}{68098}Of course i forgive you.
{68248}{68279}You are my son.
{68946}{69007}And so it was that my father...
{69012}{69077}the great swordsman|Don Antonio...
{69086}{69139}died in my mother's arms...
{69146}{69213}as our tears fell upon him.
{69306}{69395}That evening,|to hide my shame forever,
{69404}{69462}I placed a mask|upon my face...
{69526}{69606}and vowed never to remove it|in the presence of another.
{69836}{69914}My father left me too soon.|Don Octavio.
{69954}{69993}I never had the chance...
{71772}{71802}Oh, great.
{71838}{71888}-Are you Dr. Mickler?|-That's right.
{71894}{71918}Sign here.
{71930}{71986}Would you just hold that for a sec?
{72184}{72211}Hello, dear.
{72486}{72519}So, Jack,
{72536}{72560}what's the occasion?
{72618}{72649}Excuse me, madam.
{72668}{72711}You're the occasion.
{72990}{73039}No, really. Are you sure...
{73044}{73074}there's no...
{73412}{73440}Beautiful.
{73472}{73496}Excuse me, ma'am.
{74229}{74276}Buenos dias, El capitan.
{74332}{74364}Where's Rocco?
{74418}{74450}He has moved to Madrid.
{74458}{74499}-Madrid?|-Si.
{74518}{74549}-Spain?|-Si
{74604}{74693}Then he feels so guilty,|he feels so overcome with shame...
{74698}{74745}that he puts on this mask...
{74750}{74795}and he vows never...
{74806}{74880}to take his mask off again|as long as he lives.
{74886}{74937}Now, is that|a perfect myth or not?
{74942}{75014}It's wonderful.|It's a wonderful story.
{75020}{75094}You know, Jack, this kid is remarkable.|You're right.
{75100}{75133}You're right.|It's like a Greek myth.
{75140}{75171}It's exactly like a Greek myth.
{75176}{75224}The son becomes potent...
{75230}{75266}sexually active...
{75272}{75365}Leads to the destruction of his father,|who he replaces. As, of course, he must...
{75370}{75434}He must some day, to become a man|but the guilt...
{75440}{75535}of replacing the man who loves him|and gave him life is too great.
{75540}{75642}It's enormous. So he must|hide it by wearing a mask.
{75658}{75709}It's time to put the kid on meds, Jack.
{75750}{75815}You want to drive this kid nuts?
{75826}{75876}Fill him full of...
{75882}{75941}anti-psychotic chemicals...
{75946}{76016}and in 48 hours|you'll have a nut case
{76022}{76099}you are not ever going to forget|for the rest of your life.
{76104}{76204}Jack, he is a schizophrenic.|He is not Don Juan.
{76210}{76259}How do you know|he's not Don Juan?
{76264}{76310}I've been with the kid. I know.
{76316}{76397}Has he ever told you, Jack,|in any of his sessions...
{76405}{76433}that he's been living|with his grandmother
{76438}{76469}in Queens?|Has he ever told you?|690|00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:11,358|-I haven't...|-Has he mentioned it?
{76522}{76568}....any details like that.
{76636}{76693}I got a call about an hour ago|from the department.
{76738}{76764}Now, please, Jack...
{76782}{76823}put the boy on medication.
{76844}{76892}-Paul, you don't understand...|-Jack!
{76898}{76926}Please!
{76932}{76987}Take it easy. He is your patient.
{76992}{77025}You got five days.
{77035}{77092}You got five days.
{77106}{77171}I am pissed off at you.
{77194}{77255}And don't forget|we're barbecuing Saturday.
{77274}{77310}Really pissed off.
{77640}{77670}Mrs. DeMarco?
{77720}{77782}Yes. This is Dr. Mickler. Remember?|We spoke on the phone
{77788}{77841}about your grandson.|I want to have a...
{77882}{77958}Dona Ana.|she's all he talks about.
{77976}{78033}He waits for the mailman every day|like he's delivering cannoli.
{78070}{78165}The boy's convinced|he's found his one true love.
{78228}{78264}He's worse than his father,
{78272}{78298}Tony
{78316}{78339}Tony,
{78344}{78411}the Dance King of Astoria.
{78466}{78509}This is his father?
{78560}{78605}He won a prize for dancing?
{78612}{78653}You never heard of him?
{78700}{78766}Did his father sell pharmaceuticals?
{78818}{78904}Tony couldn't sell a boat|to a drowning man.
{78910}{78974}He worked|for a dry cleaning concern.
{78984}{79052}He did drapes and sofas.
{79058}{79106}Is his father still alive?
{79170}{79216}Didn't Johnny tell you anything?
{79222}{79256}Tony died...
{79264}{79325}in a terrible car crash.
{79332}{79365}It was five years ago.
{79370}{79396}In Mexico.
{79402}{79443}In Phoenix.
{79496}{79532}They never lived in Mexico?
{79538}{79559}Never.
{79564}{79632}-Where is his mother?|-I couldn't tell you.
{79648}{79713}We were never what|you might call close.
{79784}{79841}Mrs. DeMarco, How often did|you see your grandson...
{79848}{79892}when he was growing up?
{79904}{79942}Only once.
{79950}{79991}Johnny was six.
{79996}{80054}Do you mean that|that's the only time...
{80060}{80126}you saw Johnny|in your entire life?
{80132}{80194}Until three months ago.
{80252}{80282}I open the door...
{80304}{80361}and there was Zorro.
{80376}{80412}Chelsea Stoker.
{80422}{80499}I just seen your grandmother and|she's got the bizarre impression
{80504}{80584}that your name is|John Arnold DeMarco...
{80592}{80650}that you grew up|in Phoenix, Arizona...
{80658}{80717}and that your father|died in a car crash.
{80752}{80796}Interesting fantasy.
{80824}{80883}But I suppose|if it makes her happy...
{80896}{80938}it is harmless enough.
{80966}{81007}She told me your father|worked in....
{81012}{81065}a dry cleaning establishment.
{81070}{81178}You want me to tell you some story like my|grandmother's so you will think I am sane.
{81184}{81271}If that is what it takes to get out of|this place. I will be happy to do it.
{81294}{81368}But there is a rumor that you are|supposed to be a psychiatrist.
{81394}{81432}I've heard that rumor, too.
{81442}{81511}Can you not tell when you meet|a woman who's completely insane?
{81516}{81606}Are you saying that your grandmother|made this all up?
{81612}{81658}In so many words, yes.
{81680}{81711}She hated my mother.
{81716}{81797}It's not unusual because my|grandmother hated everybody.
{81810}{81878}So we stayed as far away from her|as possible.
{81894}{81964}-In Phoenix, Arizona.|-In Mexico.
{81974}{82034}You mean you never lived|in Phoenix, Arizona?
{82044}{82096}No, I never lived|in Phoenix, Arizona.
{82106}{82154}What about|your father's death?
{82160}{82233}I have told you how my father died,|Don Octavio.
{82390}{82433}Her name is Chel--|I'm not going to take it away.
{82438}{82515}I just want to point out|her name is Chelsea Stoker.
{82520}{82575}They never use|their real names.
{82582}{82639}She is really my Dona Ana.
{82710}{82755}She is trying to teach me a lesson.
{82788}{82821}You know, I...
{82852}{82931}I once treated a young man,|about your age...
{82982}{83089}and he fell in love oddly enough,|with a girl on a poster.
{83114}{83170}He was very insecure about women...
{83195}{83228}And..
{83254}{83306}and he tried|to contact her.
{83320}{83356}He must have called...
{83362}{83407}the magazine 100 times...
{83426}{83478}till finally somebody|at the magazine...
{83498}{83559}took pity on him|and gave him her number.
{83570}{83593}So he called her.
{83630}{83716}They had a one-minute conversation|and she let him know...
{83748}{83813}she never wanted to speak|to him again.
{83926}{83954}And then what happened?
{83960}{84044}He tried to kill himself|is what happened.
{84158}{84217}Dona Ana is real, Don Octavio.
{84290}{84337}Want to hear about her?
{84352}{84393}I suppose so.
{84462}{84527}Shortly after|the death of my father...
{84532}{84641}my mother decided that it would be|the best to send me to Cadiz...
{84646}{84718}as though a voyage at sea|would purify me.
{84732}{84812}She herself had determined|to take her vows...
{84818}{84910}at the convent of Santa Maria,|where she is a nun to this day.
{84936}{84982}I was being sent forth...
{84988}{85038}Like a dove of promise.
{85070}{85135}Of course, what my mother never|knew was that the ship...
{85140}{85208}was run by scoundrels.
{85212}{85258}Instead of Cadiz...
{85264}{85300}they set sail...
{85308}{85372}for an obscure|Arabian Sultanate,
{85378}{85467}where the passengers were|immediately sold into slavery.
{85520}{85561}You were sold|into slavery in a...
{85566}{85646}-sultan's kingdom?|-That's correct.
{85654}{85690}I was purchased...
{85696}{85737}by one of four wives of a sultan
{85742}{85790}and led off by her eunuch.
{86192}{86280}I had no idea why I was made|to dress as a female.
{86290}{86375}my mask had been replaced|by a mask of another sort...
{86380}{86473}and so I supposed I was keeping|the vow I made to hide my face.
{86532}{86572}The Sultan had a harem...
{86578}{86633}of fifteen hundred young women...
{86648}{86741}so the demands he placed on|his wives were relatively minor.
{87250}{87311}I was presented to the Sultana.
{87320}{87406}I still did not understand why|l was required to be in drag.
{88050}{88085}You may rise.
{88150}{88189}And you my go.
{88274}{88311}You may stay.
{88428}{88453}Slowly...
{88458}{88503}I began to develop a theory...
{88508}{88558}why I was brought|to the Sultana...
{88586}{88634}But, i still loved Dona Julia.
{88722}{88753}I am sorry.
{88764}{88792}I love another.
{88876}{88899}Undress!
{88918}{88961}Kill me if you must.
{89000}{89081}I am prepared to die,|for I cannot go on living...
{89090}{89161}knowing that I defiled|the memory of the woman...
{89180}{89253}who brought my manhood alive|and made it sing.
{89378}{89406}It sings?
{89444}{89495}I was prepared|to lose my life...
{89500}{89553}rather than debase|my love.
{89564}{89654}How could I be unfaithful|to my dear Dona Julia...
{89660}{89735}who had nearly given up|her life to love me?
{89750}{89812}How could I sleep|with another woman...
{89818}{89870}after giving|myself, body and soul...
{89876}{89927}to sweet Dona Julia?
{89946}{90025}How could I forsake|the purity of love...
{90030}{90083}I had with my flower,
{90088}{90124}Dona Julia?
{90182}{90280}Actually, I was surprised at how|easy the past can be overcome.
{90378}{90483}You know, my friend, until this afternoon|I have always believed that a man
{90488}{90534}could love only one woman.
{90550}{90639}I've been badly misled.|It's absolutely incredible...
{90644}{90742}to me just a few hours ago Dona Julia|was the only woman who existed...
{90748}{90774}and now...
{90780}{90882}there is the magnificent|SuItana Gulbeyaz.
{90886}{90936}-What a glorious body, breast...
{90942}{90982}Will you please shut up?
{91054}{91082}Suddenly...
{91088}{91158}I was truck by the danger|of my situation.
{91170}{91237}I prayed they'd found|a place to hide me...
{91242}{91284}where I wouldn't be discovered|by the suItan.
{91290}{91328}As fortune would have it...
{91350}{91426}their solution was a|brilliant one.
{91440}{91491}It was God's canvas...
{91496}{91555}in all its natural beauty.
{91720}{91753}For the next 2 years...
{91758}{91820}my days were|spent with the Sultana
{91838}{91866}And yours nights?
{91872}{91962}My nights were spent with the 1500|young women of the Sultan's harem.
{92132}{92156}Come.
{92184}{92248}Come to me, my little cockatoo.
{92324}{92380}At the end of 2 years,|I noticed...
{92386}{92463}I didn't have the same|enthusiasm as before.
{92604}{92653}This could be a problem.
{93170}{93222}You may rise,|my little dove.
{93730}{93756}Oh, well...
{93762}{93822}all good things|must come to an end.
{93848}{93877}Gulbeyaz,
{93882}{93929}sensing the danger|to us both,
{93940}{94002}arranged for me|to depart within the hour.
{94030}{94099}I had learned to love|in 1000 ways,
{94112}{94176}each one is a lesson|in the soul of a woman.
{94234}{94296}I knew i would miss|every one of them.
{94318}{94358}They'd stolen my spirit...
{94364}{94452}and infused me with joy,|like a May day breaking.
{94566}{94601}I would...
{94618}{94680}I would like to hear this in|complete detail...
{94686}{94756}but there's something that|i must do now...
{94786}{94855}so I wonder if we could|continue this tomorrow.
{94882}{94904}Of course.
{94954}{94973}Thank you.
{95006}{95037}Hasta manana.
{95288}{95317}You're home early.
{95360}{95453}How would you feel|about coming upstairs?
{95548}{95572}Ok. Go!
{95646}{95689}Ok. Wait a sec.
{95752}{95781}Over here now.
{95874}{95905}What happened?
{95916}{95998}-You're no good at all.|-I am too good. I've got 3. Look.
{96004}{96046}-I got three.|-Well...
{96052}{96098}-When is my turn?|-I got five.
{96104}{96149}I know. You're better than me.
{96212}{96260}-Did you get it?|-Yes!
{96724}{96795}Last but not least, the moment|we've all been waiting for....
{96800}{96831}Don Juan DeMarco.
{96956}{97031}In respect to that,|I want to say that...
{97060}{97120}I've got a meeting with the kid...
{97128}{97244}later on today and I think it might|very well be the definitive meeting.
{97270}{97324}Jack, this isn't a treatment conference.
{97330}{97373}This is a disposition conference.
{97378}{97478}We have to know what to do with this kid|on Monday when his 10-day paper expires.
{97484}{97518}Do we ask the judge|to commit him?
{97524}{97559}Do we let him go?
{97570}{97596}What?
{97669}{11371}l...l don't know.
{97688}{97773}I won't know until I have|the meeting with the kid.
{97778}{97815}He's a suicidal patient.
{97820}{97857}He's not suicidal.
{97862}{97910}It was a call for help.
{97916}{97970}You're not suggesting|that we let him go, are you?
{98020}{98063}-No, I'm not suggesting that.|-Alright.
{98068}{98149}First thing Monday we have to get|the judge over here for a hearing.
{98154}{98225}Also on Monday we'll have to|transfer him to another therapist
{98232}{98282}because that's your last day, Jack.
{98293}{98350}Bill?|You think you're up to it?
{98356}{98398}If he's on medication, I could.
{98476}{98506}He'll be on medication.
{98572}{98627}Alright. I'll give him...
{98640}{98729}l don't know., A hundred milligrams|of Mellzac, Q.I.D
{98754}{98813}And Bill can begin to decrease it
{98815}{98869}once his anxiety lessens about|being attacked...
{98892}{98953}-by his patients.|-Could you tell him to stop?
{98964}{98995}And if he refuses?
{99000}{99045}Do we restrain him|and give it by injection?
{99050}{99113}I'll get him to take the medication,|for Christ's sake.
{99118}{99167}What's the big concern here?
{99176}{99238}He hasn't been assaultive.|Anyway, I've got to go.
{99244}{99308}No, no. There's one other|piece of business.
{99314}{99359}Okay, we're ready.
{99388}{99448}For he's|A jolly good fellow...
{99454}{99512}For he's|A jolly good fellow...
{99518}{99614}For he's|A jolly good fellow...
{99624}{99703}Which nobody can deny!
{99814}{99902}"Today is the first day|of the rest of your life".
{99938}{99958}Come in.
{100040}{100080}I am Dona Ines,
{100086}{100128}the mother of|Don Juan DeMarco..
{100144}{100193}May I come in, Don Octavio?
{100268}{100288}Ah, Please.
{100616}{100685}I came as soon as the|archdiocese de Mexico City
{100690}{100754}told me that my son had called them.
{100758}{100789}What exactly is wrong with him?
{100884}{100957}I'm very grateful, Sister,|that you've come...
{100962}{101016}at this strange moment in time...
{101046}{101108}because there is so much|crucial information
{101114}{101163}that I need in order to help|your son.
{101168}{101197}How can I be of help?
{101208}{101299}For instance, is it a fact|that your son grew up...
{101308}{101386}with you and your husband|in Mexico in a small town?
{101392}{101438}San Luis Coatzalcoalcos.
{101444}{101519}It's not very far from "Izucar de Matamoros"..|Have you heard of it?
{101570}{101614}Well, not many have.|It's very small
{101682}{101788}You know, In order to help your son|I have to have some information.
{101796}{101854}I need to know about|Don Alfonso,
{101860}{101935}about his father, Don Antonio,
{101964}{102031}and about your relationship|with both of them.
{102038}{102140}I think it would be best if you would|discuss these matters directly with my son.
{102160}{102230}My vows to God|do not allow me to talk...
{102238}{102282}about certain aspects|of my past.
{102288}{102348}I don't think, Sister...
{102354}{102405}I'm making myself clear.
{102409}{102452}I've been to see
{102458}{102489}your son's grandmother.
{102530}{102598}and she tells me that|neither you nor your son...
{102602}{102641}have ever lived in Mexico.
{102684}{102715}She said that you met Tony
{102721}{102768}in Queens, New York,
{102784}{102830}and until recently
{102838}{102928}she said she only saw her|grandson once in her life,
{102934}{102977}when she was in Phoenix, Arizona.
{103004}{103070}She also said that 5 years ago...
{103078}{103164}that your husband died in a car crash.
{103180}{103210}Now, in addition...
{103396}{103422}I'm sorry,
{103442}{103557}but you must understand, Sister,|that i need to know the truth.
{103584}{103663}The truth is inside you,|Don Octavio.
{103684}{103737}I cannot help you find that.
{104054}{104131}Isn't she exactly|as I described her, Don Octavio?
{104206}{104231}Yeah.
{104258}{104293}Exactly.
{104409}{104480}Dona Julia has become|a nun at the same convent.
{104518}{104551}So it seems.
{104590}{104680}I told my mother could go back today,|but I'll miss her.
{104685}{104764}She really has a way of putting|me in touch with what's real.
{104871}{104922}Why are you so certain...
{104928}{105008}that your mother was not having|an affair with Don Alfonso?
{105102}{105173}My mother was not|having an affair.
{105196}{105296}Well, I think you can understand how|the thought might have occurred to me,
{105309}{105363}when you told me|how your father died.
{105372}{105442}It's never been clear|to me what...
{105452}{105547}what your mother meant when she|cried out: "I'll lose both of them!"
{105552}{105618}Did she mean|both her husband and her son?...
{105634}{105691}Or both of her lovers?
{105838}{105866}My mother...
{105872}{105921}was not having an affair.
{105946}{106011}Do you understand why|it's necessary...
{106016}{106040}Stop!
{106074}{106182}You don't think I know what's going on|with you, Don Octavio? but I do. You need me...
{106193}{106262}for a transfusion because your|own blood has become dust
{106267}{106297}and clogged your heart.
{106322}{106365}Your need for reality...
{106370}{106427}Your need for a world|where love is flawed...
{106432}{106508}will continue to choke your veins|until all the life is gone.
{106550}{106644}My perfect world is no less real|than yours, Don Octavio.
{106650}{106697}It is only in my world
{106704}{106740}that you can breathe.
{106754}{106778}Isn't it?
{106822}{106847}Isn't it?
{106892}{106916}Yeah
{106978}{107021}You're right. My...
{107035}{107072}world is...
{107122}{107160}not perfect.
{107478}{107540}What is this thing|that happens with age?
{107559}{107620}Why does everyone|want to pervert love
{107626}{107689}and suck it bone-dry|of all its glory?
{107718}{107762}Why do you bother|to call it love anymore?
{107909}{107954}This will be our...
{107984}{108026}last session.
{108052}{108109}I'm retiring on Monday.
{108347}{108402}Then I'll tell you about Dona Ana.
{108447}{108503}and you will decide|if I should be set free.
{108662}{108702}On the second day,
{108708}{108757}after i left the Sultana,
{108784}{108838}our ship was caught|in a typhoon.
{108878}{108933}I alone survived.
{108948}{109004}After days drifting at sea,
{109016}{109077}I found myself|on the island of Eros.
{109168}{109208}She was 17...
{109216}{109261}and Nature's bride,
{109274}{109324}fresh and fair,
{109332}{109411}and unacquainted with|the miracle of physical love.
{109432}{109514}Her beauty was not made|of shapes and forms,
{109522}{109614}but shined from within,|like a star.
{109906}{109971}There are those who do not believe|that a single soul...
{109974}{110006}born in heaven...
{110022}{110083}can split into twin spirits|and shoot,
{110090}{110152}like falling stars to earth,
{110178}{110239}where over oceans|and continents
{110244}{110294}their magnetic forces|will finally
{110299}{110355}unite them back into one.
{110362}{110432}But how else to explain|love at first sight?
{110470}{110503}We were convinced
{110509}{110603}that there was no other life|beneath the sky but ours.
{110620}{110650}We believed...
{110658}{110708}that we would never die.
{110754}{110799}You must promise me
{110812}{110872}that we'll be together|for all time,
{110940}{111016}that we'll live here on this beach...
{111026}{111059}always...
{111102}{111178}and that should circumstance|ever separate us,
{111234}{111284}it is here we will come...
{111312}{111376}to wait all eternity...
{111397}{111446}for the other to return.
{111562}{111596}I love you.
{111642}{111673}Promise me.
{111708}{111741}I promise.
{112278}{112305}One day,
{112312}{112350}I asked her to be mine.
{112406}{112448}I love you too much,
{112518}{112570}but i cannot love you any less.
{112671}{112745}It's of no great consequence, but...
{112762}{112848}will you be wearing your mask|throughout our lives together?
{112944}{112982}I have sworn to do so.
{113016}{113143}Then I ask only that you tell me|what led you to make such a vow.
{113230}{113310}I related the sad tale|of my Dona Julia...
{113314}{113356}never guessing for a moment...
{113362}{113439}that my sweet Dona Ana believed|l had saved myself for her...
{113444}{113483}as she had for me.
{113604}{113653}Very well, my love.
{113718}{113779}I will accept that I am not the first...|if you'll tell me,
{113784}{113833}with the same honesty,
{113840}{113877}how many others
{113906}{113935}there have been.
{113954}{114061}This would have been a very good time|for me to lie, but truth...
{114068}{114120}is a terrible habit.
{114180}{114215}Including you,
{114266}{114300}there have been
{114400}{114433}exactly ...
{114580}{114608}one...
{114640}{114687}thousand five hundred and two.
{114750}{114782}I could see...
{114788}{114852}that this was a sum|substantially greater...
{114858}{114911}that the one she had in mind,
{114916}{114976}and not easy for her to assimilate,
{114980}{115024}try as she might.
{115059}{115127}As her pain struck at my heart|like a dagger,
{115134}{115174}I begged to be forgiven.
{115200}{115230}I removed my mask
{115235}{115328}as a gesture of remorse|but my it was to no avail.
{115334}{115379}To hide her humiliation,
{115385}{115417}she took off the mask
{115423}{115474}and left me forever.
{115512}{115565}So my adventures came to an end,
{115572}{115656}and with them the chance that|one day, like my father,
{115666}{115760}I would die in the arms|of the woman I loved.
{116062}{116094}Who am i?
{116164}{116196}Sit down.
{116316}{116344}You...
{116364}{116399}are Don...
{116414}{116441}Juan...
{116452}{116485}DeMarco,
{116512}{116563}the greatest lover|the world has ever known.
{116652}{116694}And you, my friend,...
{116718}{116742}who are you?
{116802}{116834}Who am i?
{117009}{117072}I am Don Octavio de Flores,
{117104}{117154}married to the beautiful
{117170}{117210}Dona Lucita,
{117226}{117273}the light of my life.
{117392}{117439}And you, my friend...
{117500}{117577}you have seen through|all of my masks.
{117738}{117779}Here's your water, Doctor.
{117787}{117818}Thank you.
{118114}{118180}You said that you believed,|Don Octavio.
{118232}{118314}I believe that you are Don Juan,
{118340}{118392}but there are|a lot of people that don't.
{118654}{118699}Then I'll do as you ask,
{118706}{118740}my friend.
{119273}{119322}Vamos!
{119808}{119846}You're retiring on Monday.
{119852}{119894}So, what are we going to do?
{119898}{119946}We're going to get airborne.|kid, I'll tell you that.
{119950}{120016}I'm trying to tell you something:|l like it here.
{120022}{120107}-I like my garden.|-We need to be a flight of eagles.
{120212}{120264}I don't see myself|in that picture.
{120280}{120346}What's the matter with you?|What are you talking about?
{120352}{120456}-l don't know.|-l need to find out who you are.
{120482}{120533}Jack, you know who I am.
{120578}{120661}Who's brought you coffee|for the last 32 years?
{120668}{120755}Listen, I know a lot about dirty coffee|cups and I know a lot of facts,
{120760}{120831}but I need to know all|about you.
{120938}{120960}What do you wanna know?
{121002}{121035}I want to know...
{121046}{121091}What your hopes
{121121}{121165}and your dreams are
{121174}{121242}that got lost along the way
{121247}{121296}while I was thinking|about myself.
{121356}{121387}What's so funny?
{121609}{121659}Thought you'd never ask.
{121832}{121861}-Hey, Doc.|-Good morning.
{122368}{122419}Do you understand|why you're here, young man?
{122508}{122536}Okay, then.
{122540}{122639}I'd like for you to tell me a little about|yourself, where you grew up?...
{122648}{122737}what made you want|to kill yourself? how you feel now?
{122928}{122956}I was born in...
{123018}{123054}in Queens.
{123106}{123138}Me and my parents
{123142}{123214}moved to Phoenix|when I was a kid.
{123250}{123273}I hated it.
{123304}{123338}When I was sixteen,
{123358}{123407}my father was killed in a...
{123414}{123466}car accident just outside of town.
{123490}{123522}My mother...
{123533}{123614}she'd been having these affairs|and my father knew.
{123660}{123749}Anyway, she felt so guilty,|she decided to become a nun.
{123842}{123936}So, within three weeks|of my father's death,
{123956}{124012}she was in a convent|somewhere in Mexico.
{124050}{124083}And there I was.
{124204}{124284}I had nowhere to go.|I didn't know what to do.
{124452}{124504}So, one day, I was...
{124572}{124621}looking at this magazine,
{124670}{124708}and there was a centerfold,
{124733}{124790}And I knew she wouldn't|go for me,
{124794}{124852}the way that I was,|you know, so I...
{124890}{124950}I'd been reading a book,
{124956}{124987}this book,
{125016}{125045}and...
{125096}{125153}I decided to become Don Juan.
{125197}{125220}So,
{125228}{125270}I called up the magazine.
{125280}{125369}They wouldn't help me.|They wouldn't give me any information, so...
{125410}{125476}So, I was about to give up and...
{125482}{125544}one day I reached this woman|who worked there.
{125550}{125594}I think she was a temp,
{125600}{125631}or something....
{125680}{125776}The woman took pity on me|and she gave me the girl's number.
{125780}{125810}So I called her up.
{125830}{125899}I said that we were|meant to be together and...
{125922}{125989}she called me a creep|and then she hung up.
{126094}{126158}I just decided|that my life was over, so I...
{126164}{126208}was going to kill myself.
{126212}{126287}Or at least I was going to make|people believe that I would kill myself
{126294}{126348}kill myself so I could get some|attention, or something.
{126356}{126414}I never really had any intention
{126432}{126466}of killing myself.
{126592}{126615}Thank you.
{126622}{126656}This has been very helpful.
{126704}{126746}Someone will show you|back to your room now.
{126972}{126994}Doctors,
{127016}{127089}this seems like|a perfectly normal kid to me.
{127108}{127143}I've had a couple of...
{127150}{127210}centerfold fantasies myself...|and I'm certainly not going to...
{127214}{127257}commit him to a mental institution|for his.
{127264}{127317}Your Honor,|I....l think his behavior...
{127322}{127348}Let him go.
{127373}{127386}Thank you.
{127402}{127432}Thank you very much.
{127438}{127504}As his doctor,|I concur with your views.
{127514}{127539}I've spent more time|with him than you have!
{127544}{127627}I will call you later|and thank God for medication.
{127638}{127691}Have a wonderful vacation.
{127773}{127847}Bill, Nurse. As head of|the hospital, let me speak.
{127918}{127943}My name...
{127948}{128026}is Don Octavio de Flores.
{128054}{128138}I am the world's greatest|psychiatrist.
{128164}{128261}I have cured|over a thousand patients.
{128266}{128334}Their faces linger in my memory
{128340}{128383}like summer days.
{128404}{128483}But none more so than|Don Juan DeMarco.
{128666}{128743}So it was not so insane|that we all found ourselves...
{128748}{128840}on an airplane,|flying to the island of Eros.
{128942}{128973}It was like...
{128978}{129031}the Garden before the Fall.
{129102}{129143}Everything seemed possible.
{129416}{129483}How does our fable end?
{129502}{129535}His Dona Ana,
{129540}{129583}his centerfold,...
{129598}{129623}was she...
{129628}{129713}waiting all eternity on the beach|for him to return,
{129718}{129766}as they'd promised each other?
{129814}{129845}Why not?
{130614}{130674}Sadly, I must report...
{130680}{130741}that the last patient I ever treated,
{130764}{130794}the great lover,
{130800}{130840}Don Juan DeMarco,
{130847}{130899}suffered from a romanticism...
{130908}{130982}which was completely incurable.
{131020}{131054}And even worse...
{131058}{131088}highly
{131094}{131130}contagious.
{131214}{131226}.......................
