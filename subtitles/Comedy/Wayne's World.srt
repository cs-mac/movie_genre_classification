1
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,229
Spend all day with us.
There are two - you heard me -

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,074
two of everything
in every Noah's Arcade.

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,711
That means two of Zantar,
Bay Wolf, Ninja Commando,

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,677
Snake-azon, Psycho Chopper...

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,716
It's good seeing you, Benjamin.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,314
You haven't been to Shakey's
for so long.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,118
Well, I've been real busy.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,953
It's two for you cos one won't do.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,077
All this week,
kids under six get every fifth...

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,119
There's a new pet.
Chia Pet, the pottery that grows...

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,196
..they are very fast.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,437
..simple. Plug it in,
insert the plug from anything.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,669
Simple.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,832
..even for our customers
in Waukegan, Elgin and Aurora,

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,512
we'll be there right on time.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,874
So call!

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,036
- All right! Excellent!
- Excellent.

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,394
OK. Extreme close-up!

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,720
- Excellent.
- Excellent extreme close-up.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,395
Now it's Wayne's World's Totally
Amazing Excellent Discoveries.

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,950
Our guest is Ron Paxton.
Welcome to Wayne's World, Ron.

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,268
Thanks, Wayne.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,352
Now, you're the inventor
of the Suck Kut, right?

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,873
What exactly is it?

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,793
The Suck Kut is a revolution
in home hair cutting.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,190
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,474
Well, yes.

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,433
Fireworks!

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,598
Now, Ron, the question on everybody's
mind is, how does it work?

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,319
I'm prepared for
a complete demonstration.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,234
OK, Garth, sit there. He's gonna
put that thing on your melon, OK?

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,356
Just a trim. Don't buzz me, OK?

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,276
So tell me, Ron.
Exactly how does the Suck Kut work?

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,399
Well, as you can see,
it sucks as it cuts.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,755
It certainly does suck.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,079
What are we looking at?

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,720
Wayne's World.
They do it from their basement.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,550
- People watch this?
- Yeah, lots.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,235
Turn it off, man! Turn it off!
It's sucking my will to live!

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,151
Oh, the humanity!

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,159
- You want to hand me the telephone?
- Sure.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,237
Russell? It's Benjamin.
Are you watching TV?

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,880
Listen, could you turn it
to channel 10?

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,397
I want you to find out who these guys
are and where they do their show.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,675
I think we can sell it to Vanderhoff.

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,318
Take your Ritalin, OK?

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,868
- OK, you're in a forest.
- Forest?

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,791
With Heather Locklear.

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,678
- With Heather?
- And you're very warm. Very...

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,875
- ..warm?
- Warm.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,669
- These guys are so funny.
- Oh, they're obviously brilliant.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,873
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery...not!

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,029
Thanks, Ron.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,358
OK, time's up for this week.
Until then, good night!

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,749
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,039
And...we're clear!

57
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,872
- All right!
- Excellent!

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,432
- All right! Excellent!
- Excellent!

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,308
Let me bring you up to speed.
My name is Wayne Campbell.

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,313
I live in Aurora, Illinois,
which is a suburb of Chicago.

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,674
Excellent.

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,557
I've had plenty of joe jobs.

63
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,356
Nothing I'd call a career.
Let me put it this way...

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,319
I have an extensive collection
of name tags and hairnets.

65
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,077
OK, I still live with my parents,
which I admit is both bogus and sad,

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,958
but I've got an amazing
cable access show,

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,871
and I still know how to party.

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,509
But what I'd really love
is to do Wayne's World for a living.

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,919
It might happen.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,355
Sh'yeah, and monkeys might
fly out of my butt.

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,192
Ah, the mirthmobile.

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,357
This is my best friend Garth Algar.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,555
Hi.

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,152
I think a little Bohemian Rhapsody,
gentlemen.

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,559
Good call.

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,957
Whoa! It's Phil.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,277
Phil, what are you doing here?
You're partied out, man...again.

78
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,512
- What if he honks in the car?
- I'm giving you a no-honk guarantee.

79
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,232
Phil, um, if you're gonna spew,
spew into this.

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,914
- Garth, pull over.
- Oh, man! Come on!

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,513
Not again.

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,789
He does this every Friday.
Stop torturing yourself, man!

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,793
You'll never afford it!
Live in the now!

84
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,720
It will be mine.
Oh, yes... It will be mine.

85
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,917
Hey, Wayne's World!
Wayne's World! Party!

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,070
Excellent! Way to go!

87
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,513
Party on, Wayne!

88
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,640
Hey, Campbell. Uno momento, fellas.

89
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,796
Officer Koharski, how's it going?

90
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,393
Fine.

91
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,790
Say, I smell bacon.
Does anyone else smell bacon?

92
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,509
Yeah, I definitely smell
a pork product of some type.

93
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
Yeah, yeah. I know what you're doing.

94
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,072
Bacon, pig, oink-oink,
police officer.

95
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,310
I said that to cops
when I was your age.

96
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,789
Hey, what are you up to?

97
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,475
I just pulled over a tour bus
on its way to Chicago.

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,757
We had a tip there was some
drug smuggling going down.

99
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,353
We searched the vehicle.

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,477
It was clean,
so we did the body cavity searches.

101
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,312
- No way.
- Way!

102
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,278
I inspected 1 2, inside and out.

103
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,316
OK, this guy needs coffee
and crullers stat!

104
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,914
We got to get him to rampart.
Let's go!

105
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,797
This is Stan Mikita's Donuts.
Excellent munch post.

106
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,829
This is the manager, Glen.
He's here 24 hours a day.

107
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,879
I recommend the sugar pucks.
They're excellent. Come on.

108
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,555
I'd never done a crazy
thing in my life before that night.

109
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,235
Why is it if a man kills another
in battle it's called heroic,

110
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,198
yet in the heat of passion
it's called murder?

111
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,794
Hello! What do you think
you're doing?

112
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,270
Only me and Garth get
to talk to the camera. Come on.

113
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,635
I don't really have too much
to say right now.

114
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,278
What's that?

115
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,994
Hi, Mr Withers.
How's the amusement park?

116
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,594
Just great, Wayne.

117
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,036
Four coffees
and a half dozen crullers, please.

118
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,599
And one jelly donut.

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,997
There's your girlfriend, Garth.
Sh'yeah!

120
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,120
Excuse me. I fell.

121
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,034
Don't you guys ever get tired of
ordering the same thing?

122
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,190
No.

123
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,078
- Uh-oh. Don't look. Stacy.
- Where?

124
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,158
Oh, God. I made eye contact.

125
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,037
Psycho hose beast.

126
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,711
Happy anniversary, Wayne.

127
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,713
- Stacy, we broke up two months ago.
- It doesn't mean we can't go out.

128
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,236
Well, it does, actually.
That's what breaking up is.

129
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,311
You going to the Gasworks tonight?

130
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,879
- No!
- No!

131
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,872
Don't you wanna open your present?

132
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,349
If it's a severed head,
I'll be very upset.

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,796
- Open it.
- OK. OK.

134
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,510
- What is it?
- It's a gun rack.

135
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,435
A gun rack? A gun rack.
Sh'yeah, great.

136
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,351
I don't even own a gun,

137
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,398
let alone many guns
necessitating an entire rack.

138
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,870
What am I gonna do with a gun rack?

139
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,758
You don't like it? Fine.

140
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,436
Wayne, if you're not careful,
you're gonna lose me.

141
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,636
I lost you two months ago.

142
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,235
Are you mental? We broke up.
Get the net!

143
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,109
- Wayne!
- Hey!

144
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,760
How you doing? Garth!

145
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,149
Hey, Tiny, who's playing tonight?

146
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,595
Jolly Green Giants, Shitty Beatles.

147
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,240
The Shitty Beatles?
Are they any good?

148
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,517
- They suck.
- Then it's not just a clever name?

149
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,828
Who else?

150
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,070
Crucial Taunt, just finishing.

151
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,118
- I hear they can wail.
- You're right. Party on.

152
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,792
Party on.

153
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,391
This is the Gasworks,
an excellent heavy metal bar.

154
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,711
- Always a babefest.
- And they got a pool table, too.

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,070
Party! Excuse me.

156
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,711
Excuse me.

157
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,677
Excuse me.

158
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,830
- What?
- I'd like to get by now.

159
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,071
Get out of my face, you little dweeb.

160
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,318
Excuse me.

161
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,635
What do you want, you little dweeb?

162
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,749
Thank you.

163
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,879
She's a babe!

164
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,996
Fight! Fight! Fight!

165
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,389
All right.

166
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,951
I love this woman.

167
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,673
Hey, Raymond,
club soda with a lime, please.

168
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,478
And would you get me a towel?

169
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,916
- Boy, you really wail.
- Thanks.

170
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,197
You're that party time guy on TV.
Wayne, right?

171
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,508
Yes, and you are?

172
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,352
Cassandra.

173
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,557
Rough night, huh?
Everybody's kung fu fighting.

174
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,509
Yeah. Well, nice meeting you.

175
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,750
Hey, hold on!
Can I call you sometime?

176
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,717
For $5, come to the rent party.

177
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,268
- It's at my loft.
- I'm there.

178
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,116
I gotta go. The owner's
trying to dick me out of some money.

179
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,238
See how many people I brought in?

180
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,356
That bass player's a babe.

181
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
She makes me feel kind of funny,

182
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,869
like when we used to climb the rope
in gym class.

183
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,428
You said I get cash up front.

184
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,435
She will be mine.
Oh, yes... She will be mine.

185
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,038
Pardon me.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

186
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,878
Garth, sit there.
He's gonna put that on your melon.

187
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,997
OK, just a trim.
Don't buzz me, OK?

188
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,631
Russell, stop the tape.

189
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,075
So, what do you think?

190
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,675
I think it's two chimps
on a davenport in a basement.

191
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,512
I'm not sponsoring this.

192
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,831
I got spots on Love Boat, but this?
What is this?

193
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,434
Mr Vanderhoff, this is your audience.

194
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,988
The same kids that line up
at Noah's Arcade.

195
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,640
- It looks so cheesy.
- That's where I come in.

196
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,793
Russell's our best producer. He does
Chicago PM with Elaine Ronkey,

197
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,838
Sunshine Saturday,
The African American Digest.

198
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,797
- Never heard of that.
- It's on late.

199
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,154
It won several awards.

200
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,231
Well, I'll stick with Love Boat.

201
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,472
If I may, speaking
from a producer-director standpoint,

202
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,516
kids can relate to this show.

203
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,352
These guys aren't phonies.

204
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,715
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

205
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,473
Kids know dick.
I watch 'em in my arcades.

206
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,872
They stand like lab rats hitting
the feeder bar to get food pellets.

207
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,111
As long as they pump in quarters,
who gives a shit?

208
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,673
Let me ask you.

209
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,389
What's your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

210
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,553
Well, uh, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

211
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,756
Like our new game called Zantar.

212
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,389
Zantar is a gelatinous cube
that eats warriors in a village.

213
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,040
If you eat a chieftain,
you go up a level.

214
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,680
Beauty is, you can't
get to the next level,

215
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,716
kids keep coughing up quarters.

216
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,191
Gelatinous cube eats village.
It's terrific.

217
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,511
I know nothing about video games.
I found that riveting.

218
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,433
- I do my own commercials.
- I did not know that.

219
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,112
I don't mention the games

220
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,715
because the technology moves
faster than the advertising.

221
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,394
I did not realise that.
Russell, did you?

222
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,959
No, I did not realise that.

223
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,431
So, Mr Vanderhoff, let me see
if I'm hearing you correctly.

224
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,308
Are you saying that if you had a
spot, say, on a weekly show,

225
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,038
you could come on the show

226
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,317
and update the kids
on what was new in your arcade?

227
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,119
Yeah, that's it.

228
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,475
- Well, I'm impressed.
- Wow!

229
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,759
Noah's Arcade presents Wayne's World.
I think that's brilliant.

230
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,114
Brilliant.

231
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,590
- Well, thank you.
- We'll get right to work on this.

232
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,195
We'll send the contracts over.
We'll be in touch.

233
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,397
Well... I'd like to think about this.

234
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,268
Oh, of course you would.
I wouldn't have it any other way.

235
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,755
- She'll validate you.
- Thank you.

236
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,232
He's in.

237
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,270
Stop it! You're scaring me.

238
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,750
Oh, cool. You're learning
Cassandra's language.

239
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,276
I've never seen you so mental
over a girl before.

240
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,918
Are you gonna marry her?

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,436
Marriage is punishment
for shoplifting in some countries.

242
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,717
- OK, you passed inspection.
- All right.

243
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,392
Just barely.

244
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,756
Uh, OK, that's $42.57, Wayne -
parts and labour.

245
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,319
- No way.
- Brutal.

246
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,278
- Oh, OK. There you go.
- All right, we got it.

247
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,952
- That's not enough.
- What?

248
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,396
- We got...that.
- That's good, but I need more.

249
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,439
- Oh, man! Why don't you use a gun?
- It's not my fault. Come on.

250
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,229
- I suppose it's society's fault?
- More.

251
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,194
- Cool.
- All right.

252
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,714
Well, here's an extra dollar.

253
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,920
You guys shoulda been
at Gasworks Friday.

254
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,798
- Yeah, we were.
- This band, Crucial Taunt,

255
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,553
they had this megababe
lead singer...unreal!

256
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,428
Phil, we were there.
Have you gone mental? Hello?

257
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,432
- I think we should go now.
- Here you go.

258
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,235
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

259
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,471
- By tonight, we will.
- Ah!

260
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,796
Excuse me. Do you know where
we could find Wayne Campbell?

261
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,158
- That's privileged information.
- Where do they broadcast from?

262
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,994
- Are you a friend or a relative?
- We're neither.

263
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,835
You know, Russell,
I may not have grown up around here,

264
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,956
but I understand these people.

265
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,598
This must be the place.

266
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,153
OK, we're just about
out of time, right?

267
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,708
But let's give
a Wayne's World salute

268
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,155
to the Guess? jeans girl,
Claudia Schiffer.

269
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,318
- Tent pole! She's a babe.
- She's magically babelicious.

270
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,073
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

271
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,589
Are you through yet?
I'm getting tired of holding this.

272
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,477
Yeah, that's what she said.

273
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,910
OK, so Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

274
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,115
OK, that's all, good night.

275
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,760
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

276
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,873
And...we're clear.

277
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,191
- OK. Excellent show, everyone.
- Excellent.

278
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,989
Great show. Wayne, Benjamin Kane.

279
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,709
Regional Programme Director,
Oliver Communications.

280
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,870
Russell Findley. We spoke today. Hi.

281
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,633
Maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted?

282
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,837
Russell, get to know the crew.
You know anywhere nice?

283
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,275
- Hi. Hi.
- See you guys later!

284
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,229
Let me get this out of the way...

285
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,039
- I'm a big fan.
- You are?

286
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,590
The way I see it,
your show's capable of so much more.

287
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,717
We'll try harder, OK?
Give us a second chance.

288
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,360
Don't cancel us
without a second chance.

289
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,238
Garth, come on, relax, all right?
Your pills?

290
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,232
He can't cancel us.
We're on public access.

291
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,551
Can I be honest?
My job, it's usually such a bore.

292
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,598
But the other day something
incredible happened.

293
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,796
- What happened?
- Noah Vanderhoff,

294
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,873
owner of the largest video arcade
chain in Chicago, is in my office.

295
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,873
He asks me, "What's with this
Wayne's World I hear so much about?"

296
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,112
Well, I have all your shows on tape.
Like I said, I'm a fan.

297
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,317
I put a show in.
He literally jumped out of his seat.

298
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,389
Cool!

299
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,189
He wants to sponsor the show,
put you on our station,

300
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,157
and pay you guys a huge salary.

301
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,869
He doesn't realise you're artists,
not interested in money.

302
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,714
- No, we're not interested in money.
- That's what I told him.

303
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,112
But he said, "Take two cheques anyway
so they know I'm serious."

304
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,910
I may be wasting my time,
but here I am with the contract

305
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,312
and two cashier's cheques
for $5,000 each.

306
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,153
Exsqueeze me? Baking powder?

307
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,357
You're going to pay us
for doing Wayne's World?

308
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,113
Give me the word.
I'll tear up these cheques.

309
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,236
He shoots, he scores!

310
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,676
Well. Would you like
to look at the contracts?

311
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,637
- Yes.
- Do you have a lawyer?

312
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,076
Yes. Uh...no.
We're between lawyers right now.

313
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,311
Our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly.

314
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,435
That's right.

315
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,071
I walked right into that office,
I grabbed him by his big fat head,

316
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,709
and I said, "I'm not going to jail
for you or anybody!"

317
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,916
Exactly.

318
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,877
Can I peruse that contract
before we sign it?

319
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,518
Yes... Yes.

320
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,830
I like what you've done here.

321
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,713
Yes... Yes...

322
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,631
I dropped my pen.

323
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,396
I'm not so sure about...
Oh, I see. I see.

324
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,029
Hi. Um, does this seem weird?
Why does he have contracts?

325
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,476
Ever see the Twilight Zone
where the guy signed a contract

326
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,438
and they cut out his tongue
and it wouldn't die,

327
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,990
it grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues?

328
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,915
- Pretty cool, huh? I gotta go.
- Oh, I like this part.

329
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,595
Well, I feel we can work with you
on this project.

330
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,116
Well, you've made Mr Vanderhoff
a very happy man.

331
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,631
- To Wayne's World.
- To Wayne's World.

332
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,156
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

333
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,916
We got $5,000, we got $5,000...

334
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,831
Hey, Wayne. Check it out.

335
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,435
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

336
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,872
Party!

337
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,277
Great party, huh, guys?

338
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,312
Uh-oh. Stacy alert!

339
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,389
We've been spotted and we're being
pulled in by her tractor beam.

340
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,311
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

341
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,476
God, she's amazing.

342
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,555
Wayne, Wayne,
Garth told me about the show, man.

343
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,710
I love you, man.

344
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,836
Yeah, and I love you, too, Terry.

345
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,878
No, I mean it, man. I love you.

346
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,476
- No, I mean it. I love you.
- No, you don't, man.

347
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,958
Garth, come over here! I think
Terry has something to say to you.

348
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,270
I love you, man.

349
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,078
Thank you.

350
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,874
Your vocals are incredible.

351
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,632
Thanks.

352
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,676
You have a very interesting look.

353
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,675
Oh, I'm not trying to pick up on you.

354
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,909
Good thing.

355
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,118
No, I'm producing a TV show.
It's in Chicago. Very late night.

356
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,832
We need a music act. Here's my card.
Is there a number I can reach you at?

357
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,990
We got fliers at the door.

358
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,708
Hello.

359
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,429
- Hi. Wanna go somewhere and talk?
- Sure.

360
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,393
- What's going on in there?
- Just a minute!

361
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,996
We'd like to go to the bathroom,
please...in this century.

362
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,119
- How long you been waiting?
- Like, an hour now.

363
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,873
- Hi, Garth.
- Hi.

364
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,393
I'm looking for Wayne.

365
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,472
He seems to be going through
a difficult phase.

366
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,711
- You know what I think it is?
- That you're mental?

367
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,711
You know him best. What should I do?

368
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,836
Get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

369
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,797
Get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

370
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,438
Yeah, thanks. OK, great.

371
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,594
Hi.

372
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,196
So who's this guy Benjamin?

373
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,999
Only one of the most important
producers in TV.

374
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,117
He's way ahead of his time.
We've signed with him.

375
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,829
- He's based in Chicago.
- He's interested in the band.

376
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,718
Of course. I love your band.
You guys wail.

377
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,758
- Thanks.
- You kick ass. Double live gonzo!

378
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,229
Intensity in 10 cities.
Live at Budokan.

379
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,118
If you got a break,
you could make it.

380
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,510
And if a frog had wings,
he wouldn't bump his ass hopping.

381
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,752
Interesting.
Where did you learn English?

382
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,116
College.
And the Police Academy movies.

383
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,674
Cassandra...

384
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,558
I've got something
I want to say to you.

385
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,432
Campbell, that's amazing!

386
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,557
You learned to say I look pretty
in Cantonese.

387
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,111
And you are a handsome man.

388
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,035
Slowly, I'm still learning.

389
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,238
I can't get over it, you're learning
Cantonese. Even your accent is good.

390
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,878
- Hi, Wayne!
- Hello, Stacy.

391
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,996
Here, sit right here.

392
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,834
- Who is that?
- My ex-girlfriend.

393
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,111
She has very nice legs,
but no self-esteem.

394
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,239
The irony is,
I feel partly responsible

395
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,959
for her self-nullifying behaviour.

396
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,629
You're allowing yourself
to be victimised.

397
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,790
Have you been
effectively assertive?

398
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,759
I've made a confident declaration
in defence of my rights,

399
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,035
but it does not seem to do any good.

400
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,953
If I help her
out of feelings of obligation,

401
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,110
I may find myself resenting her.

402
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,555
Besides, she's a psycho hose beast.

403
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,989
That is very funny. But labelling
people can be dangerous.

404
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,279
Was it Kierkegaard
or Dick Van Patten who said,

405
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,195
"If you label me, you negate me?"

406
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,675
- You make me laugh.
- Can I call you?

407
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,557
Any time.

408
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,678
Excellent.

409
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,795
Look out!

410
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,116
Sometimes I wish I could boldly go
where no man's gone before.

411
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,634
But I'll probably stay in Aurora.

412
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,392
- What are you thinking about?
- Cassandra.

413
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,674
She's a fox.

414
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,194
In France, she'd be called la renard.

415
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,078
Hunted, with only her cunning
to protect her.

416
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,913
- She's a babe.
- She's a robo babe.

417
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,798
In Latin, she'd be called
Babia Majora.

418
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,758
If she were a president,
she'd be Baberaham Lincoln.

419
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,471
Did you find Bugs Bunny attractive
in a dress playing a girl bunny?

420
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,718
No.

421
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,474
No.

422
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,120
Neither did I. I was just asking.

423
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,115
OK. OK. Keep looking up!

424
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,189
OK.

425
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,753
Guys, I will be talking
to the cameramen on the headset.

426
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,796
Terry will give you hand cues.

427
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,839
Excuse me, Russell, but I believe
I requested the hand job.

428
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,030
Let's go on.
The cue is - watch carefully...

429
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,392
Five, four, three...

430
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,479
You didn't say two or one.

431
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,757
- You don't say two or one.
- Why not?

432
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,834
You just don't, OK? Now, it goes...

433
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,836
Five, four, three...

434
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,475
- Good! OK, good.
- Ow! All right!

435
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,030
Now, we're ready for rehearsal,
unless there are questions.

436
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,510
Yeah... Does this
seem weird to anybody else?

437
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,637
I mean, we're looking down
on Wayne's basement,

438
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,439
only that's not Wayne's basement.

439
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,556
Isn't that weird?

440
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,029
- That's twisted.
- That's weird, man.

441
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,429
Garth, that was a haiku.

442
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,916
- Control room.
- Russell.

443
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,276
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Finishing with the Vanderhoffs.

444
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,989
They'd like to visit rehearsal,
see we're not wasting their money.

445
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,520
Not...a good idea, sir.

446
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,794
Great!

447
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,031
Come in. Your landing gear is down.

448
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,076
- Just...put that down.
- Ow.

449
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,391
Just go away, guys. Go to the set.
Hey, hey, hey!

450
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,109
- He's excited you'll see the studio.
- Oh, the studio.

451
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,158
- That's where the magic happens.
- You work in TV?

452
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,949
- No, but I watch a lot.
- Of course you do. You're creative.

453
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,508
She came up with the name
Noah's Arcade.

454
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,273
I just opened my mouth
and out it came.

455
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,555
You're a lucky man, Mr Vanderhoff.

456
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,634
All right, can we bring in
the blue screen? Let's try one.

457
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,188
Ready to cue Wayne and Garth, and go.

458
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,956
- OK.
- In five, four, three...

459
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,717
Good, Terry.
Uh, Wayne, Garth, don't count along.

460
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,155
We see your mouths moving. Again.

461
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,118
In five, four, three...

462
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,079
Guys? You're nodding.
Once again, Terry.

463
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,995
In five, four, three, two...

464
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,359
Welcome to Wayne's World.

465
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,317
- Party on, Garth.
- Party on, Wayne.

466
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,356
A new feature on Wayne's World

467
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,238
allows us to travel
through time and space.

468
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,676
It's called chromakey,
and it's handy for going to...

469
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,954
New York.

470
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,874
- Hey, we're in New York!
- I got a gun. Let's hit Broadway.

471
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,918
- I guess kids get this?
- Oh, they love it.

472
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,355
Or maybe you prefer Hawaii.

473
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,911
Mookalakaheeki. Come on, you wanna
lei me. Pass the poi, Mahalo.

474
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,956
Or say you want to go to Texas.

475
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,635
Howdy, partners.
Let's raise and rope broncos.

476
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,598
- Let's go down.
- Howdy, y'all.

477
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,434
Or imagine being magically
whisked away to...

478
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,397
Delaware.

479
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,995
Hi. I'm in Delaware.

480
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,877
Noah and Mimi Vanderhoff, say hello
to Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar.

481
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,951
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

482
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,430
So, Garth, how do you like
being in a real studio?

483
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,478
It's like a new pair of underwear.

484
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,518
At first it's constrictive,

485
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,478
but after a while,
it becomes a part of you.

486
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,878
- I gotta go.
- OK. OK.

487
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,150
No, no, no. Please.

488
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,630
Wayne, I used to be in meat packing.
Lips and hooves.

489
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,269
One day, I had a four-hour layover
in Tulsa.

490
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,751
These airport kids kept pumping
quarters into a game called Pong.

491
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,717
They must've blown 50 bucks.

492
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,271
I sat there watching and I said,
"Hell, I'm in the wrong business."

493
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,318
15 years later, I'm a millionaire.

494
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,917
- It's so huge!
- Thanks.

495
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,158
- Do I frighten you?
- No.

496
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,151
Do you want me to?

497
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,312
- Noah, I love you on that couch.
- You think?

498
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,436
Noah does all his own commercials.

499
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,557
Yeah, I got a new one where I rap.

500
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,313
Come bust a move
where the games are played

501
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,551
It's chill, it's fresh,
it's Noah's Arcade

502
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,596
What do you think of that?

503
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,193
I'd have to say...

504
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,114
- Asphinctersezwhat?
- What?

505
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,557
- A sphincter says what?
- What?

506
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,312
Exactly.

507
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,435
We've got a lunch.

508
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,239
- That's what I think of it.
- OK.

509
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,595
Well, it's been a pleasure.

510
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,830
May I say I've had a thrilling day.

511
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,319
- You may.
- Shall we?

512
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,118
And may I say your wife's a babe.

513
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,589
- Thank you.
- We have a table.

514
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,392
What is it, girl?

515
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,915
Aliens have kidnapped Wayne?

516
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,435
Oh, I misunderstood.
Wayne's outside. Thanks, girl.

517
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,629
OK! Game on!

518
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,631
- Game on!
- Game on!

519
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,119
He shoots, he scores!

520
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,873
- One for one!
- Crowd is going wild!

521
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,552
Car!

522
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,151
- Game on!
- Game on!

523
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,473
- OK.
- Let's go.

524
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,279
Worseley cuts down the angle.

525
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,830
- Gretzky shoots!
- Oh, Gretzky is denied!

526
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,638
Choked in the open net.

527
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,192
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

528
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,635
Do you feel Benjamin's not one of us?

529
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,633
Good call. It's as if Benjamin
wants us to be liked by everyone.

530
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,792
Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes
everyone liked.

531
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,711
They left that to the Bee Gees.

532
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,033
Car!

533
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,630
- Game on!
- Game on!

534
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,153
Uh-oh. Incoming. Stacy, ten o'clock.

535
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,832
Hi, Wayne.

536
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,594
Hi.

537
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,030
Hey, are you all right?

538
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,912
And she's OK!

539
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,558
- Game on!
- Yeah, game on!

540
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,676
You know, Garth, you and I
have never really talked.

541
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,037
OK.

542
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,839
You know, I love
what you do on the show.

543
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,435
I look at you
and I just laugh and laugh.

544
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,351
Uh-huh.

545
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,910
Let me run this by you
because you're...a sharp guy.

546
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,470
I'm thinking about giving Vanderhoff
a weekly interview.

547
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,120
How would you feel
about making a change?

548
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,519
We fear change.

549
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,551
Cassandra, I have to say it,
you look excellent.

550
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,200
Thanks. I've been so busy
with my band,

551
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,635
I thought I was getting meningitis.

552
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,188
I thought I had mono
for an entire year.

553
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,748
Turned out I was just really bored.

554
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,399
Excuse me?

555
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,552
I'm sorry. It's the last song
I heard this morning.

556
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,119
I hate when that happens.

557
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,872
I'm gonna put on some tunes.

558
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,709
- When did you get the CD player?
- When we got the money.

559
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,798
There it is...Excalibur.

560
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,755
'64 Fender Stratocaster with triple
single coil pickups and a whammy bar.

561
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,876
Pre-CBS Fender corporate buy-out.

562
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,430
I'd raise the bridge and
take the buzz out of the low E.

563
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,919
God, I love this woman.

564
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,198
- Hi, Garth.
- Hi.

565
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,554
Where's the clerk?

566
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,438
I know. I'll use
the "may I help you" riff.

567
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,998
May I help you?

568
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,229
Yes, my good man.

569
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,993
I'd like to see this
Fender Stratocaster.

570
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,593
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

571
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,954
- Again?
- Yes.

572
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,999
Be careful.

573
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,353
No Stairway. Denied!

574
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,073
Wow. You're...amazing, dude.

575
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,628
Thanks. I like to play.

576
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,790
Excuse me. Wayne?

577
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,394
Can I put
the Fender back now, please?

578
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,313
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

579
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,517
I think I'm gonna buy it.
Do you accept...cash? Cha-ching.

580
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,790
Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

581
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,111
Yes. Briefly.
He was not very receptive.

582
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,519
Oh, really?

583
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,672
Well, I'll explain
that it's in his contract.

584
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,833
Oh. Well, Wayne will understand
that right away.

585
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,558
Not!

586
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,952
Excuse me.

587
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,192
I mean, there's two Darrin Stevens,
Dick York, Dick Sargent.

588
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,636
Sh'yeah! Right!
As if we wouldn't notice.

589
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,914
Well, hold on.

590
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,198
Dick York, Dick Sargent,
Sergeant York. Wow, that's weird.

591
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,238
Wayne. Listen, we need to have
a talk about Vanderhoff.

592
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,151
The fact is, he's the sponsor.

593
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,596
You signed a contract
guaranteeing him concessions,

594
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,159
like a spot on the show.

595
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,959
That's where I see things
differently.

596
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,112
Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

597
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,639
I'm sorry you feel that way,
but it's the nature of the beast.

598
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,756
Maybe I'm wrong on this one,

599
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,230
but for me, the beast
doesn't include selling out.

600
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,708
Garth, you know what I mean, right?

601
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,349
It's like people only do things
because they get paid,

602
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,271
and that's just really sad.

603
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,148
I can't talk about it any more.
It's giving me a headache.

604
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,832
Here. Take two of these.

605
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,514
Ah, Nuprin.

606
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,352
Little. Yellow. Different.

607
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,513
Look, you can stay here in the
big leagues and play by the rules

608
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,751
or go back to the farm club
in Aurora, your choice.

609
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,832
Yes. And it's the choice
of a new generation.

610
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,110
- Anything wrong, Davy?
- Yeah. I got paid today.

611
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,156
Oh, yeah, I know what that's like.

612
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,437
No. You don't understand.
They laid me off.

613
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,069
- I got one of these.
- Yeah. I know how that feels.

614
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,559
Know what I'd like to do?

615
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,029
Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

616
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,999
Find the guy that did it,
rip his still-beating heart out,

617
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,153
and hold it in his face so he can
see how black it is before he dies.

618
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,835
Actually, I was gonna
file a grievance with the union.

619
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,230
Well, the world's a twisted place.

620
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,514
- Hi.
- How's it going, Garth?

621
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,511
Good.

622
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,796
Hey. There she is.

623
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,834
I must've slipped.

624
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,711
Wayne, what do you do if every time
you see this one incredible woman,

625
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,677
you think you're gonna hurl?

626
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,197
I say hurl. If you blow chunks
and she comes back, she's yours.

627
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,989
If you spew and she bolts,
it was never meant to be.

628
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,558
Oh, I'm not ready yet.
I gotta be comfortable with me first.

629
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,870
Why don't you talk to her?

630
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,638
Why don't you just go talk to her?
Go talk to her? Go talk to her?

631
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,072
Garth?

632
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:12,153
Camera one, camera two.
Camera one, camera two.

633
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,115
Don't.

634
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,233
Tell me,
when that first show is over,

635
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,233
will you still love me when
I'm an incredibly humongoid star?

636
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,469
Yeah.

637
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,632
And in my
hanging-out-with-Ravi-Shankar phase?

638
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,914
Yeah.

639
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,551
And in my sequin-jumpsuit,
young-girls-in-white-cotton-panties,

640
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,995
waking-up-in-a-pool-of-vomit,

641
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,197
bloated-purple-dead-on-a-toilet
phase?

642
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,352
- Yeah.
- OK. Party. Bonus.

643
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,991
Yeah? Oh, hi, Anthony.

644
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,833
- Who's Anthony? Who's Anthony?
- My drummer.

645
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,069
OK.

646
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,909
You what?

647
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,549
No, I told you next week
we'll be doing a music video.

648
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,111
Do you mind? This is business.

649
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,839
Hey, you wanna be a busboy
the rest of your life?

650
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,036
Well, then, talk to your boss.

651
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,437
Look, this guy Benjamin's putting up
serious money for this. Yeah.

652
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,637
Happy birthday

653
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,950
Mr President

654
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,349
Happy birthday

655
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,590
To you

656
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,233
Work it out, OK? Just...
No, just be there.

657
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,958
OK, bye.

658
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,758
You asshole!

659
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,673
Excellent.

660
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,034
Hey. All right.
Glad you could make it.

661
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,269
Yes!

662
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,352
- Cool.
- Yes.

663
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,116
This is definitely what I'm gonna get
when I move out of my parents' house.

664
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,953
- Oh, you have a terrace!
- Yeah. Go on out.

665
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,871
I'll get the Dom Perignon.

666
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,237
What floor is this?

667
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,629
Um...the 23rd.

668
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,831
You know, Cassandra...
from this height...

669
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,388
you could really
hawk a lugie on someone.

670
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,592
You know, I feel so free up here!

671
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,194
Costs a lot to live this free.

672
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,191
This might be a tangent

673
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,317
but it's something
I've been thinking about...

674
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,833
Hi.

675
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,230
If Cassandra was my girl,
I wouldn't bring her here.

676
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,314
I mean, look at this place.
This is a fully functional babe lair.

677
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,039
Chicks are helpless
against its powers.

678
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,553
Let's check it out.

679
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,359
I don't believe
I've had French champagne.

680
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,876
Actually, all champagne is French,
after the region.

681
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,394
Otherwise, it's sparkling white wine.

682
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,869
Americans ignore the convention,

683
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,033
so they call their sparkling
whites champagne, though they're not.

684
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,556
Ah, yes. It's a lot like
Star Trek: The Next Generation.

685
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,758
It's often superior, but will never
be as recognised as the original.

686
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,517
Aha. What's this?
"How To Pick Up Chicks".

687
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,955
"How To Meet Women". He's smooth.

688
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,109
"Daily reminder...Thursday.

689
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,716
"Purchase feeble public access cable
show and exploit it."

690
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,349
Whoa. I feel sorry
for whoever that is.

691
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,839
Let's look over here.

692
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,440
"Ribbed for her pleasure."

693
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,192
Well, the show looks great.

694
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,352
Mr Vanderhoff's excited.
I'm very excited.

695
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,558
I think the show's gonna be a
huge hit all over the Chicago area.

696
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,789
For you and Garth -

697
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,111
tickets to Alice Cooper
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

698
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,236
Backstage passes!

699
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,074
All-access backstage
with Alice Cooper?

700
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,833
- Thank you.
- Take the day off. Enjoy yourselves.

701
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,399
What about Cassandra?

702
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,118
She and I have work to do.

703
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,391
- Here's to your success.
- No. Here's to Benjamin.

704
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,314
Who wants Chinese takeout?
I know a great place.

705
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,119
I'll have the cream of sum yung guy.

706
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,516
Cassandra, why don't you order?

707
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,478
No. I'm sure whatever you order
will be fine.

708
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,959
Oh, OK.

709
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,272
This guy is good.

710
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,113
Picked up a little Cantonese
in the Orient.

711
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,351
You sound more like Kowloon Bay
than Hong Kong.

712
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,510
I was born in Kowloon Bay.

713
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,079
There you have it.

714
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,549
This guy's really good.

715
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,039
Sounds great!

716
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,997
- Thanks.
- You got a minute?

717
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,230
Sure. Hey, you guys, hang out.

718
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,392
I came by to drop off
the contract for the video.

719
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,029
Oh, great. I never really got a
chance to say thank you.

720
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,829
- You've been very generous.
- It's been my pleasure.

721
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,708
Listen, if you're done, we could
spend the afternoon together.

722
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,199
We should be close
to Milwaukee by now.

723
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,633
- Look! There's Shotz brewery!
- Cool!

724
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,474
Hey, wait a minute.
What are we doin'?

725
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,518
Yeah! We got backstage passes
for Alice Cooper!

726
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,757
Do you want to go backstage?

727
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,393
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

728
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,954
Where you going?

729
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,268
Got a pass.

730
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,236
Uh-oh. I think we took a wrong turn,
cos we're outside now.

731
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,276
Whoa! Look!

732
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,872
Is this Alice's limo?

733
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,793
It belongs to Frank Sharp,
head of Sharp Records.

734
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,836
Good friend of Alice's.

735
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,674
Wow. That's, like, way bigger
than a normal size car.

736
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,116
Well, it has to be.
He drives everywhere.

737
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,033
Hates to fly. He's going across
the country right now

738
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,793
to look for new acts
to sign to his label.

739
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,438
Next stop is St Louis.

740
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,513
Then he'll come back through Chicago
on his way to Detroit.

741
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,033
Thanks.

742
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,995
For a security guard, he had an awful
lot of information, don't you think?

743
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,828
Thank you, Milwaukee!

744
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,678
Whoa, whoa, ladies.
I'm sorry. No...

745
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,990
Oh, you got pass...
All right. Come on.

746
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,390
- Let us through, please!
- Can't let you in.

747
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,477
Alice. Is this cool?

748
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,357
Yeah. Come on in.

749
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,839
Sorry to bother you,

750
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,878
but we had to tell you
how much we enjoyed the show.

751
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,678
Didn't we, Garth?

752
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,552
Oh. Thanks.

753
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,757
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

754
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,149
My name is Wayne and this is Garth.

755
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,310
Nice to meet you guys.

756
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,234
So do you...come to Milwaukee often?

757
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,477
Well, I'm a regular visitor,

758
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,075
but Milwaukee has certainly
had its share of visitors.

759
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,550
French missionaries and explorers
came in the late 1600s

760
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,108
to trade with the Native Americans.

761
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,237
- Isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?
- Yes, Pete, it is.

762
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,278
Actually, it's pronounced
mee-lee-wah-kay,

763
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,476
Algonquin for "the good land".

764
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,278
I was not aware of that.

765
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,158
One of its most
interesting aspects is that

766
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,109
it's the only major American city to
have elected three socialist mayors.

767
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,794
Does this guy know how to party
or what?

768
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,470
OK. Well, we gotta get going.

769
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,516
No, stick around. Hang out with us.

770
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,592
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay and
hang around with you, us...

771
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,318
with Alice Cooper.

772
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,917
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!

773
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,797
We're not worthy!

774
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,713
We're scum! We suck!

775
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,190
Our first big show
and we almost didn't make it.

776
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,999
I really hope
Cassandra's watching.

777
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,037
The couch works perfect. Hey.

778
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,078
- How's it going?
- Tonight's the night.

779
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,199
A lot of people in the Chicagoland
area will be watching the show.

780
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,794
You know what?
I know it's gonna be a hit.

781
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,155
I'll be in the booth.

782
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,515
Mr Vanderhoff is your first guest.

783
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,079
Oh, hi, boys.

784
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,957
What the hell is this?

785
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,474
Can we fly in the sign, please?

786
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,357
That's it. Bring her down.

787
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,399
Don't tense up. You'll be great.

788
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,119
Garth, have you got a second?

789
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,519
Simply read the cards.
You're going to be wonderful. Really.

790
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,318
OK?

791
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,278
Oh, Russell,
can I borrow your marker?

792
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,669
I, uh...need to make some notes.

793
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,830
Sure.

794
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,558
Good luck.

795
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,473
My guys. You're my guys!

796
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,153
Your name is pronounced Algar, right?

797
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,391
OK. Wayne!

798
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,433
- He'll be fine.
- Good.

799
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,399
This is it, honey.

800
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,029
In five, four, three...

801
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,511
Wayne's World is
brought to you by Noah's Arcade.

802
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,749
Party on, Wayne.

803
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,159
It's Friday. It's 1 1 :30.

804
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,153
It's time to party with
your excellent host Wayne Campbell,

805
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,151
and with him, as always, Garth.

806
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,038
Party on, Wayne, and party on, Garth.

807
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,431
OK. Welcome to Wayne's World.

808
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,432
- Party on, Garth.
- I guess.

809
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,839
OK. OK, first of all,

810
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,596
we'd like to take a moment
to welcome our sponsor.

811
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,195
He's the owner of a fine chain
of Noah's Arcades...

812
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,956
Noah Vanderhoff. Nice name...not!

813
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,315
Now, uh, Mr Vanderhoff...

814
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,391
He's using the cards. Yes!

815
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,277
I told you he'd fall in line.

816
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,272
What is your most popular video game
right now?

817
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,958
Desert Storm Commando Warriors.

818
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,918
About that limited skirmish
in the Middle East?

819
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,035
Yes.

820
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,678
What the hell's he doing?

821
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,911
Aren't there long lines
for the popular games?

822
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,033
Well, at Noah's arcade,
we like to say

823
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,873
there's two of everything,
so there's never a line.

824
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,838
OK. Now, Noah,
I've always wanted to know...

825
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,549
what is the difference between
Pac-Man and Ms Pac-Man, really?

826
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,437
Well, she has a bow on her head.

827
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,635
That's it?

828
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,953
- Get right out of town.
- No, that's it.

829
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,399
Thanks for being on Wayne's World.
It was informative and stimulating.

830
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,596
Now a word from our sponsor.

831
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,679
We're at commercial.

832
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,751
Oh, that was fun.

833
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,035
- I'll see you next week.
- I hope.

834
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,554
Wayne, come to the booth, please?

835
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,552
Oh, honey, you were incredible.

836
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,790
I think it went really well.

837
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,759
Absolutely. There was a huge response
in that little room.

838
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,435
Those phrases were not on the cards
when I gave them to him.

839
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,398
Wayne. What the hell is going on?

840
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,358
- What are you doing?
- Same thing we always do.

841
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,749
You've publicly
humiliated the sponsor.

842
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,637
- Yeah.
- You're fired.

843
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,474
Fired? For that?
Sh'yeah! Right!

844
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,358
I'm out of here,
and I'm taking my show with me.

845
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,273
- We own the show.
- Aw, bite me.

846
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,433
OK.

847
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,115
- Are we back?
- Stand by.

848
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,475
- Coming back?
- And go.

849
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,279
Five, four, three...

850
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,954
I'm having a good time...not.

851
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,152
Ever see Scanners
when that dude's head blew up?

852
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,753
- Hello?
- Hello.

853
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,034
It's Benjamin.

854
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,235
Oh, hi.

855
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,595
Listen, did you see the show tonight?

856
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,151
I was working, so I only saw the
first part, but I laughed my ass off.

857
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,392
We had some technical difficulties
and we're playing with the format.

858
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,038
Has Wayne talked to you?

859
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,832
About what?
Why? Are you cancelling my video?

860
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,195
No, I called
to make sure we're still on.

861
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,669
Well, we got a deal, right?

862
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,513
Absolutely. I'll see you in Chicago.

863
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,556
OK. Bye.

864
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,395
You really pissed me off tonight.

865
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,711
Garth, you've never been mad
at anything in your life.

866
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,076
You shouldn't have walked out.
I handled it OK,

867
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,631
but you shouldn't walk out on your
friend without telling him first.

868
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,075
So I have to
run everything by you now?

869
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,754
Yeah, you have to
run everything by me now.

870
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,389
What am I, a chimp?
"With you, as always, is Garth?"

871
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,152
Jim to your Marlin Perkins?

872
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,879
You know, Benjamin had you so snowed.

873
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,076
You know, he's got it for Cassandra.

874
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,628
- No way.
- Way.

875
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,393
Sh'yeah! Cassandra's
not interested. As if.

876
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,600
OK, pop quiz. Cassandra is
not interested in Benjamin because

877
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,432
A: chicks think he's handsome,

878
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,511
B: has cool car,

879
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,875
C: has lots of cash,

880
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,632
D: has no visible scars,

881
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,518
E: does not live with parents.

882
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:04,515
OK, how about F: you're a gimp.
Know what you can do with your quiz?

883
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,955
Know what you can do with your show?

884
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,871
You can take a flying...

885
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,436
..until the handle breaks off

886
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,637
and you have to find a doctor
to pull it out again.

887
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,790
Kiss your mother with that mouth?

888
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,872
You've gone mental.
I'm getting out of here, Damien.

889
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,678
- Fine, then. Go.
- I'm gone.

890
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,239
- Go, then.
- I am.

891
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,469
- Go.
- I'm gone.

892
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,913
- Go, then.
- I am.

893
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,759
Where you been? I waited up for you
last night, and you never showed.

894
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,559
- Where are you going?
- Chicago.

895
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,837
Benjamin set up the video shoot
for three days.

896
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,480
I guess Benjamin will be there, too.

897
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,438
He's producing it.
And what does that mean?

898
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,512
He's been paying you
a lot of attention lately.

899
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,478
Well, maybe he thinks
I've got some talent.

900
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,917
- Maybe he's pokin' ya.
- What?

901
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,309
You think that's the way I get a gig?

902
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,393
Well, first he screws me, then you.
It's Dutch door action.

903
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,230
Could you be any more insulting?

904
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,151
Yeah.

905
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,311
I think you'd better leave.

906
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,868
Fine. I'm outta here.

907
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,832
Oh, man.

908
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,116
What the hell's going on?

909
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,352
I lost my show, I lost my
best friend, I lost my girl.

910
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,034
I'm being shit on,
that's all, shit on.

911
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,873
And do you know
what really pisses me off?

912
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,953
Where are you going?
OK, OK, come on back. Come on back.

913
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,270
Things aren't as bad as they seem.

914
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,954
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to dump on you.

915
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,713
I'll figure something out. OK?

916
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,475
Mr Donuthead,
who's trying to kill you?

917
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,391
I don't know but they better not.

918
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,234
If you stab a man in winter,
steam will rise up from the wounds.

919
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,910
That's not good!
I'm not happy! Oh, no!

920
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,390
Indians believed it was his soul
escaping from his body.

921
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,072
Right, Glen.

922
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,232
Hi.

923
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,669
Hi.

924
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,230
I'm sorry about what I did.

925
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,878
Buds?

926
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,708
Buds.

927
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,192
Officer Koharski.

928
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,876
Damn shame how they screwed up
your show. Nice little programme.

929
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,349
Not that I ever watched it.

930
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,078
Here you go.

931
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,550
- So, uh, how you doing?
- 'K, s'pose.

932
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,790
Just wish I had Cassandra back.

933
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,270
She's in Chicago
shooting a video with Benjamin.

934
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,555
So...

935
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,473
- what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

936
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,312
I do have one plan.

937
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,916
What are you gonna do
with these guys?

938
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,877
Oh, nothing, really.

939
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,748
I always wanted to open a door
to a room of people being trained

940
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,478
like in James Bond movies.

941
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,710
- Wicked.
- Yeah.

942
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,873
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

943
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,155
I just don't think she wants me to.

944
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:02,199
Let me tell you a little something
I've learned about women.

945
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,840
They want you to come get them.

946
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,395
They love it.

947
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,952
I wish there was something
I could offer that Benjamin couldn't.

948
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,871
You'll think of something.

949
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,520
Wait a minute!

950
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,158
No.

951
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,514
Wait a minute!

952
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,797
Wait a minute! I know!

953
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,759
The guy in the limo, Mr Big,
the guy who owns Sharp Records.

954
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,071
If we could just get him to listen
to Cassandra play.

955
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,879
Halt. Halt.
Remember the security guard?

956
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,669
He said Mr Sharp was driving back
through Chicago on Friday.

957
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,432
That's right. Wow.

958
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,990
Aren't we lucky we were there
to get that information?

959
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,196
It seemed extraneous at the time.

960
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,750
OK, first I'll access the
secret military spy satellite

961
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,957
in its geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

962
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,828
Then I'll ID the limo by the vanity
plate "MR BIGGG".

963
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,875
Yes.

964
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,430
Then I'll reposition the
transmitter dish in the truck

965
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:08,069
to 1 7.32 degrees east,
hit Westar 4 over the Atlantic,

966
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,152
bounce the signal down into
the Azores, up to Comsat 6,

967
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,834
beam it back to Satcom 3
transponder 1 37,

968
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,117
and down to the dish
of Mr Big's limo.

969
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,236
It's almost too easy.

970
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:25,430
We can only pray he's watching TV
in his limo at that exact moment.

971
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,034
- We'll need help.
- We'll help!

972
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,554
You get Cassandra! We'll do the rest!

973
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,234
To the mirthmobile!

974
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,356
OK, this is a take, everybody.

975
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,670
I think the snake fell asleep!

976
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,879
Playback!

977
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,237
Looking good!

978
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,079
- This snake weighs a ton.
- It looks great on you.

979
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,596
- I'm coming down now.
- I'm telling you, you're hot!

980
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,355
Yes, officer? Is something wrong?

981
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,556
Have you seen this boy?

982
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,275
You know, you're exactly right.
Why leave the hotel?

983
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,909
We'll have dinner sent up,
you can have a hot bath.

984
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,831
Hold this.

985
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,278
- We have to talk.
- I don't want to talk to you.

986
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,749
I've set up an audition
for your band.

987
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,115
My show is back.
You've got to be on it.

988
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,112
- Wayne, go home.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

989
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,952
Cassandra, I love you.

990
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,600
You may not believe it,
but I love you.

991
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,673
Am I supposed to just
turn my back and leave?

992
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,194
Am I supposed to be a man?

993
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,273
Am I supposed to say,
"That's OK, I don't mind.

994
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,715
"I don't mind."

995
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,553
Well, I mind! I mind big time!

996
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,839
And you know what
the worst part of all is?

997
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,673
I never learned to read.

998
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,348
Is that true?

999
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,318
Yes. Everything except
the reading part.

1000
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,512
Nice speech but we're busy.

1001
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,276
Oh, of course.
Her music video. Very clever.

1002
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,191
But where is her band?

1003
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,679
Hi, Wayne.

1004
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,991
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't see you there.

1005
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,914
Well, I guess you've thought
of everything, huh?

1006
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,719
Nothing left for me to do
but just go home.

1007
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,189
Bye-bye, Wayne. It's bedtime.

1008
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:57,638
But both you and I know
that there is no film in this camera.

1009
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,748
Jimmy!

1010
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,030
Wayne...go home!

1011
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,954
Sometimes people outgrow one another.

1012
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,793
It's very sad
but you can't let it drag you down.

1013
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,838
Is that you...or the snake?

1014
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,358
Campbell, wait up!

1015
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,718
Cassandra, I know I don't have
his looks, I don't have his money,

1016
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,395
I don't have his connections,
his knowledge of fine wines,

1017
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,233
when I eat I get
this clicking in my jaw...

1018
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,039
Shut your yap and get in the car.

1019
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,348
Excellent.

1020
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,950
That's right, girl. Mr Big's limo
is right where we want it.

1021
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,358
Gentlemen, this is it. Let's go.

1022
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,953
Down now!

1023
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,994
Wait up, guys. I fell on my keys.

1024
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,072
- Freeze!
- Oh, hi, Russell. How's it going?

1025
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,835
- Hold it! Hey! Hey!
- Watch where you're pointing that.

1026
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,037
Give me the flashlight, Russell.
Give it to me.

1027
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,758
You can help us, Russell.

1028
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,354
No! I'm supposed to stop you.

1029
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,237
What are you gonna do?

1030
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,278
You gonna be Benjamin's monkey boy
all your life?

1031
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,033
- Benjamin's my friend.
- No.

1032
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,874
Benjamin is no one's friend.

1033
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,997
If Benjamin were
an ice cream flavour,

1034
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,072
he'd be pralines and dick.

1035
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,473
It's OK!

1036
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,914
He's gonna be...OK.

1037
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,668
Hi.

1038
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,478
Hi. How's it going?

1039
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,313
- I love you, man.
- I know.

1040
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,751
No, you don't.

1041
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,990
I...love you, man.

1042
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,310
I know.

1043
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,436
Just say thank you.

1044
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,555
Thank you. All right.

1045
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,315
I understand you're doing your job,
but I'm very late.

1046
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,836
Would you mind placing your hands
on the hood, son?

1047
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,071
There's just one other thing
I've got to check.

1048
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,873
OK, this is a special
Wayne's World, OK?

1049
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,556
It's for an audience of one.
So Mr Frankie Sharp of Sharp Records,

1050
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,074
if you like what you see,

1051
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,596
we're at 2234 Pine Way
in Aurora, Illinois.

1052
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,557
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1053
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,757
I give you Cassandra
and Crucial Taunt!

1054
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,759
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

1055
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,308
I've seen a lot of acts in my day,

1056
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:29,871
and although you're very beautiful,
I just think it's the wrong time.

1057
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,678
I'm sorry.

1058
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,318
You screwed my career!

1059
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,989
I always knew you were small-time.

1060
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,278
Wayne, I'm pregnant.

1061
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,669
That's why I've been so moody.

1062
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,310
Whoa! Look! Fire!
Let's get out of here!

1063
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,512
Why, God?

1064
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,671
Why?

1065
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:22,477
Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.

1066
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,516
You were terrific.

1067
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,910
You didn't really think
she'd end up with Wayne, did you?

1068
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,954
As if.

1069
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,634
As if we'd end the movie
like that. Sh'yeah!

1070
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,950
- The Scooby-Doo ending!
- Good call.

1071
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,072
Hi. Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

1072
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,639
Wow! We got through!

1073
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,792
Well, that wraps it up,
but there's one last thing.

1074
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,917
Let's just see who
you really are, mister.

1075
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,558
Old man Withers
from the haunted amusement park!

1076
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,394
I woulda got away with it, too,
if not for you snooping kids!

1077
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,519
- Good one, Shaggy.
- Excellent Scooby-Doo ending.

1078
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,434
- We should do the megahappy ending.
- That's doable.

1079
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,316
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

1080
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,675
I must tell you, it was terrific.

1081
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,039
In fact, I think it's so good,
I'm gonna give you a six-album deal.

1082
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,553
See you in my office.

1083
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,632
- I love you, Wayne.
- I love you, Cassandra.

1084
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,551
- I love you, Garth.
- I love you, dreamwoman.

1085
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,159
Ever since I did your show,
kids look at me in a whole new way.

1086
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:22,440
- I love you, man.
- And I love you.

1087
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,197
Because I've learned that platonic
love can exist between two grown men.

1088
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,396
And I've learned something, too.

1089
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,756
I've learned that
a flawless profile, a perfect body,

1090
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,831
the right clothes and a great car

1091
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,718
can get you far in America,
almost to the top,

1092
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,916
but it can't get you everything.

1093
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,197
Isn't it great
that we're all better people?

1094
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,431
Fished in! Fished in!

1095
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,189
Excellent movie. All right.

1096
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,508
Good one.

1097
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,955
Well, that's all the time
for our movie.

1098
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,919
We hope you found it entertaining,
whimsical yet relevant,

1099
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,639
with an underlying
revisionist conceit

1100
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:54,679
that belied its emotional attachments
to the subject matter.

1101
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,832
I just hope you didn't think
it sucked.

1102
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,957
OK. Thank you for coming.
Good night and party on.

1103
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,600
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

1104
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,072
You know, I don't think anyone's
gonna tell us when to leave.

1105
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,230
Yeah. Good call, Garth.

1106
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,675
I'll bet we're just gonna sit here,

1107
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,036
and when they're finished,
they'll fade to black.

1108
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,354
I can't believe they did that.

1109
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,032
I told ya.
