1
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,122
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

2
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,197
<i>Okay, women,</i>

3
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,533
<i>let me see you move.</i>

4
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,206
<i>We got a lot of nice girls out there.</i>

5
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,725
<i>What a party we got here, yeah!</i>

6
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,853
<i>You're looking hot.</i>

7
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,872
You can't believe it?
I'm telling you, this is the place to be.

8
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,799
And we got four days here?
This is unbelievable.

9
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,003
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

10
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,377
<i>Yeah, you're looking good, baby.</i>

11
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,176
Oh, my God!

12
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,876
<i>All right!</i>

13
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,156
<i>Yeah, let me see what you can do, girl.</i>

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,525
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

15
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,099
<i>Let me see you dance, people.</i>

16
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,282
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

17
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,882
<i>Hey, girl, bring it to me, baby.</i>

18
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,591
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

19
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,665
<i>Give it to me now. Yeah, bring it on.</i>

20
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,896
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, baby.</i>

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,200
It's fine.

22
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,971
<i>Let me see you move.</i>

23
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,254
<i>All right now.</i>
<i>Let me see you get your hands together.</i>

24
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,030
<i>Look at that.</i>

25
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,931
<i>All right.</i>

26
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,395
<i>Move it, baby. Move it now.</i>

27
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,206
<i>Hey, girl, bring it to me, baby.</i>

28
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,807
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

29
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,851
<i>Give it to me now. Yeah, bring it on.</i>

30
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,551
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, baby.</i>

31
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,594
Watch this.

32
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,407
<i>All right now.</i>
<i>Let me see you get your hands together.</i>

33
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,149
<i>Look at that.</i>

34
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,245
Oh, honey, meet Johnny.

35
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,787
Hey!

36
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,428
Gin and tonic. That'll be $6.50.

37
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,500
$6.50?

38
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,405
Can I help you guys?

39
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,007
Two beers.

40
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,409
Good thinking.

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,004
- $12.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,250
Gentlemen.

43
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:19,348
This party is for resort guests only.

44
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,786
You'll have to come with me.

45
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,927
Absolutely.

46
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,100
Excuse me.

47
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,296
Geek!

48
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:40,140
Hotel security.
And he takes his job very, very seriously.

49
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,477
- I'd say so.
- I bet he does.

50
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,648
Hey, Tony, I need two vodka tonics,
one white wine.

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,483
And nine kamikazes.

52
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,883
Okay, you got it?

53
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,722
She's something.

54
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,062
No way, man, she works here.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,466
Look around this place.
It's the Promised Land.

56
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,298
We're gonna have an insane time,
I'm telling you.

57
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,039
- Hey!
- Hey!

58
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,103
I already warned you to stop doing that!

59
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,580
Okay, okay.

60
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,014
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
but you ought to know by now.

61
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,853
You're talking to me, the best.

62
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,017
You know what they call me?

63
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,061
<i>Yeah, yeah, listen to me. I'm sorry, okay?</i>

64
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,755
What do they call me?

65
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,092
<i>The Maestro.</i>

66
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:09,100
That's right. The Maestro. So don't worry.
I always do the job.

67
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,861
I'm watching the old broad right now.

68
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,566
<i>I just don't want you wasting time</i>
<i>looking at tits.</i>

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,666
I'm telling you for the last time.
I'm getting ready.

70
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,769
Gonna give my hair a little trim,

71
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,179
and then I'm gonna kiss that rock
off that old lady's throat.

72
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,741
And if that doesn't work, I'll rip it off,
neck and all.

73
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,149
Whatever it takes, the rock's in your pocket.

74
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,712
<i>It better be!</i>

75
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,552
Very tough guy.

76
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,463
Baby, did you find me the barber?

77
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,432
He's in the room setting up right now.

78
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,471
He expects to meet you
at 2:00 on the button.

79
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,030
Good. How about another pink flamingo?

80
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,473
All right.

81
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,539
Watch the hair! Don't, no! Watch... Water!

82
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,962
I'm so sorry.

83
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,301
I wasn't watching where I was going.

84
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,035
Oh, no problem. Happens here all the time.

85
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,443
Patti, what are you doing to this guest?

86
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,741
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm okay.

87
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,409
Look, she spilled something on you.
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,553
- Apologize to the man.
- No, it's okay.

89
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,519
I enjoyed it.

90
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,782
I'll see you later. Okay?

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,819
Stay away from the hotel guests.

92
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,556
Especially jerks like that.

93
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,726
It was an accident.

94
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,229
You know, this should come out
of your paycheck.

95
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,466
But I'm gonna let it go.
Only because I like you.

96
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,301
Remember, you owe me one.

97
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,936
Maybe we could get together tonight
after work. What do you say?

98
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,077
We'll see.

99
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,624
Hey. What are you doing, man?

100
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,724
- See her?
- See who?

101
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,956
The waitress. I'm in love.

102
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,394
Come on, man, I told you.

103
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,924
She's here to work. We're here to play.

104
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,535
- Take a look at that.
- Hey, Edna.

105
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,076
Look at this.

106
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,738
Observe the master, okay?

107
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,215
- Hi, Edna.
- Hi.

108
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,120
Listen, I'd love to get to know your friend.
You know, if she's available.

109
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,188
- What about it?
- Maybe.

110
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,627
- Here, let me help you out.
- Sure.

111
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,903
Hey, what, are you causing trouble again?

112
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,305
No, I'm trying to give her...
Could you help me here?

113
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,034
Hi. Hi, honey.

114
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,737
Here you go, honey.

115
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,954
Oh, heck!

116
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,356
Georgie!

117
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,556
Remember, you can't go swimming.
You just ate!

118
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,962
Okay, Mom.

119
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,235
Look at that!

120
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,203
Wait a minute.

121
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,676
George!

122
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,709
Why don't you take a nice swim?

123
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,346
Mommy says I can't. I'll get cramps.

124
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,824
- Good.
- Hey, get off me! Get off!

125
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,120
Get off me!

126
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,161
Get off! Come on, no!

127
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,431
I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,297
Well, I guess I was.

129
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,096
But it's a good thing
you fellows woke me up.

130
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,901
I think I'm getting a sunburn.

131
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,067
You look a little red.

132
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,905
Well, that always happens to gals
with skin like mine.

133
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,448
Really? That happens to me, too.

134
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,411
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

135
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,511
Listen, I've got the best sunburn stuff
in the world.

136
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,449
Why don't you come on up to the room?
I'll even help you put it on.

137
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,185
Well, thanks a bunch, sugar,

138
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,922
but I never go to strange men's rooms.

139
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,729
Okay, I'll bring it to your room.

140
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,699
Are you always this forward with strangers?

141
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,064
Only with beautiful women.

142
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,867
Well, you're kind of cute yourself.

143
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,142
With all these good looks in common,
we should get together.

144
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,382
Sounds like fun, but Bobbie Sue's gotta run.

145
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,980
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

146
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,650
She loves us, she loves us.

147
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,221
Hey, look, she forgot her key.

148
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,527
- Excuse me, miss!
- No, no, no.

149
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,758
- Wrong.
- What?

150
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,597
She didn't forget her key.

151
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,729
She left it for us, let's go.

152
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,500
- You're crazy.
- Right now.

153
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,943
Boy, I'd pay to see this.

154
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,857
Fore!

155
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,194
Oh, God!

156
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,274
Hello! Is anybody home?

157
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:57,313
Anybody home? She's not here.

158
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,680
What are you doing?

159
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,222
What am I doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?

160
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,849
This babe's hot.
You think she brought us up here to talk?

161
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,792
- You're nuts. I'm going.
- No, Ben! Don't leave.

162
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,190
I'm telling you, when she gets here,

163
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:15,063
she's not gonna wanna waste
a lot of time, you understand? Just relax.

164
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,761
Are you sure she left the key for us?

165
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,032
Of course she left it for us.
What do you think?

166
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,541
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

167
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:25,634
How do I look?

168
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,038
Great.

169
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,173
Really? That's great.

170
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,415
That's her! You tell her I'm in here.
I'll be in the bedroom, okay?

171
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,197
Hi.

172
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,040
Hang this up, close the door.
Come on, let's get to work.

173
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,806
- You're early.
- Early?

174
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,040
- My wife tell you about my hair?
- Your wife?

175
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,076
Well, you're the barber, aren't you?

176
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,208
Barber?

177
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,379
What, do I hear an echo here?
Are you the barber or not?

178
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,614
Yeah, I'm the barber.

179
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,214
All right. Well, let's go. Let's cut the hair.

180
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,021
This is a very important job.

181
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:17,391
I don't want it to look
like I just had a haircut. All right?

182
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,828
Just want a little trim from the side,
a little from the top.

183
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,560
Hey, come on,
put the cloth on me, come on.

184
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,232
Come on, let's go, let's go.
I don't have all day.

185
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,032
- How long you been doing this?
- Not long.

186
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,232
What?

187
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,739
At this hotel. Not long at this hotel.

188
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,211
My hair is very, very important to me,
do you understand?

189
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,338
All right.

190
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,280
- I don't want you to experiment or anything.
- No. No.

191
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,181
I want you to be very, very careful here.

192
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,913
Just a little bit off the side,

193
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,420
- a little bit from the back.
- Yeah.

194
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:47,015
Make sure it's very, very even
down the back of my neck, all right?

195
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,424
Just be careful. Take your time.

196
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,430
Give me that phone,
come on, give me the phone, kid.

197
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,966
Give me that phone.

198
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,566
Hello. Yeah.

199
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,272
Listen, do you want me to kill her?

200
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,437
All right, I'll kill her.
I'll get the rock. But don't bother me!

201
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,404
Now look, I'd... Hello?

202
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,178
Hello? Hello? Get the door. Get the door.

203
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,217
Now give me a bourbon, kid.

204
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,616
Come on, I don't need this job.

205
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,921
Can you imagine that?
The guy hung up on me.

206
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,222
Thanks.

207
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,796
That must be my little Hubie-boobie.

208
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,230
Don't call me that in front of the kid, here.

209
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,794
Oh, honey.

210
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:32,994
This is your little Bobbie-boobie talking.

211
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,766
Now, I'm gonna...

212
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,539
I'm gonna take a little nap.

213
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:43,837
And you know how Bobbie Sue hates
to sleep alone.

214
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,315
I'll be there in a minute, baby.

215
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,286
Give me that drink, kid.

216
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,288
I'll be waiting, sugar.

217
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,793
I'm getting sleepy.

218
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,751
No, no.

219
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,982
What are you doing here?

220
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,049
- What do you mean? You left us your key.
- Are you crazy?

221
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,356
My husband will kill us both
if he finds you here.

222
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,398
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, get dressed.

223
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,762
I can't.
Your husband's sitting on my clothes.

224
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,571
Ben!

225
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,382
Come here. Ben.

226
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,486
Come here. Get my clothes.

227
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,416
Get them!

228
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,873
Oh, boy!

229
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,776
- Are you done already?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:27,978
What's this?

231
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,113
Don't take that off. Leave it on for one hour.

232
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,624
All right. Let me give you a tip.

233
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,951
- No, that's okay.
- No, no, no.

234
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,997
Come on, I always take care of my people.

235
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,528
My husband's coming!

236
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,198
Come on, come on.

237
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,444
You know, I fell asleep out there?

238
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,482
Is everything finished up out there, honey?

239
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,018
Yeah, yeah. Strange kid, but nice.

240
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,214
I hate to tell you, baby,
but you need a shave.

241
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,087
You're getting a little hairy.

242
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,902
Good afternoon, sir. I am the hotel barber.
You sent for me?

243
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,063
I changed my mind. Thanks a lot.

244
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,501
You cannot change your mind.

245
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,171
I had to cancel several other appointments
to fit you in.

246
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,780
Just put it on my bill.

247
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,716
I'm sorry. It must be cash.
Those are the hotel rules.

248
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,292
Get off of me! I don't want a haircut.

249
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:44,717
Damn.

250
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,162
- I must insist.
- Get out of here!

251
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:52,364
You put your money in the other drawer.

252
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:59,309
Barber's a strange kid.
Strange. But he's nice. He's all right.

253
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,609
Kids these days. I don't understand.

254
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,909
Just...

255
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,647
These kids these days, you know, I just...

256
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,982
What a day, huh?

257
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,285
- This is crazy!
- Sorry.

258
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,518
How could you do this to me?

259
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,595
Who's this guy?

260
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,357
Good afternoon, sir.

261
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,490
My name is Jacques.
Would you like a manicure?

262
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:22,726
Never mind.

263
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,166
- Can I see them?
- No. Here.

264
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,294
Here's a tip for the both of you.

265
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,928
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, sir.

266
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,973
It's all right. Go ahead, kid. Thanks a lot.

267
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,302
No, don't, it's not dry!

268
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,741
Oh, don't worry about it. It's fine.

269
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,109
Is something wrong, sir?

270
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,285
<i>Ole!</i>

271
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
Come back here! Come back here!

272
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,039
What is going on around here?

273
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,613
That's what I want to know. Who are you?

274
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,845
- I am the head of the hotel's security.
- Oh, yeah?

275
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,910
Look what your hotel barber did to me!
Look at this.

276
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,680
This is all your fault!

277
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,281
Yeah, right,
Mr. Create-a-little-part-down-his-head.

278
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,757
Two, three, four,

279
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,054
five, six, seven, eight.

280
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:33,829
In and out. In and out.

281
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,566
In and out. In and...

282
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,337
All right, guys, is it in or out?

283
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,708
- What?
- In or out?

284
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,804
We have a class going on.

285
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,612
In or out?

286
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,674
We gotta run. Thanks, anyway.

287
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,646
On second thought, yes, we'll stay.

288
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,136
Turn around, and work out with the class,
or get out!

289
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,967
Down. Do the deep knee bends, ladies.

290
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,567
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

291
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,636
Doing the best I can.

292
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,371
Eight, down, up.

293
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:22,175
Down, up. Down, up.

294
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,557
If you're gonna do it. Do it right!

295
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,996
You made my back go out, you cow!

296
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,032
All right, that's it!
Out of my class. Now! Right now!

297
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,434
First, I'm gonna kill that barber,
then I'm gonna come back and get you!

298
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,036
Everybody, arms out.

299
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,999
Flat back. Squeeze.

300
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,600
All right, he's gone. Let's get out of here.

301
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,339
Two, three...

302
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,574
No way. I'm in love.

303
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,310
...seven, eight.

304
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,979
And reach. Two, three, four,

305
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,455
five, six, seven, eight.

306
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:11,963
- Miss?
- Yes?

307
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,095
This hotel has a dress code
in its public areas

308
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:19,269
and I'm afraid that that swimsuit
is a bit too revealing.

309
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,837
It's just a bikini.

310
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:26,344
Nobody else complains when other girls

311
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,148
wear their bottoms like this.

312
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,390
Stop that! And fix this...

313
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,653
Oh, I'm so sorry!

314
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,794
What are you? Some kind of a pervert?

315
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:46,062
Reeves, you are a disgusting filthy animal!

316
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,632
Not so fast, <i>Herr</i> Nagel.

317
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,267
There's been a very serious complaint.

318
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,473
You massacred a very distinguished guest.
And he's very upset.

319
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,846
You know nothing! You are nothing!

320
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,852
I am being a barber for 22 years!

321
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,753
And you still haven't gotten it right!

322
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,792
I can no longer tolerate insolence

323
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,494
from a house dick, a pervert, a...

324
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,395
- You trying to insult me, Nagel?
- Yes!

325
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,561
I'm warning you.

326
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,394
Go ahead.

327
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:22,835
Make my day.

328
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,161
If it wasn't for you and that stupid key,
I wouldn't be...

329
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,167
All right, all right, one little mistake.

330
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,102
But just because some idiot gorilla
with a gun hates our guts,

331
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,038
are you gonna let that spoil
our whole weekend?

332
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,809
Sit down, sit down.

333
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,771
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

334
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,041
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I gotta run.

335
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,487
How about you?

336
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,114
You look great.

337
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,418
Oh, thanks.

338
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,758
Listen, I hope I didn't get you
in any trouble before

339
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,558
when I knocked over your tray.

340
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,960
Oh, no.

341
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:25,299
I just started work here this week,
so he's taking it easy on me.

342
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,232
Good. Seemed like that guy
was giving you a hard time.

343
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,633
Well, he thought I was flirting with you.

344
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,412
Actually, I'll have something with a lime.

345
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:41,012
- What, is he your boyfriend?
- No. Something with a lime?

346
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,886
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

347
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,689
I dropped something.

348
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,260
Listen, can I take you out tonight?

349
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,400
What time do you get off?

350
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,636
Oh, I can't.
It's against the rules to date the guests here.

351
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,042
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

352
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,912
I would like to, really, but I just can't
go out with any guy who asks.

353
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,079
I'm not any guy. Come on.

354
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,253
Well,

355
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,318
okay.

356
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,956
I get off at 11:30.

357
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,460
But I don't know if this is such a good idea.

358
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,496
Patti, what are you doing under there?

359
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,796
Oh, no!

360
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,037
There are guests waiting for service.

361
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,236
Come here. Right back, sir.

362
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,681
All right. What the hell was that?

363
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,414
I mean, every time I look around
you're with that guy.

364
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,819
He lost his watch.

365
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,153
Yeah, well,
you're about to lose your job, okay?

366
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,888
Just stay away from that guy.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

367
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,554
- Really.
- Thanks.

368
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,492
Wait, wait, wait.

369
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,496
Can I still give you a ride home tonight?

370
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,735
I've already got a ride. Thanks, anyway.

371
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,540
Right.

372
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,238
Dude, excellent coat.

373
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,507
You should try something in a red, though.

374
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,948
This place is insane! I'm having a great time.

375
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,813
A mom and a dad! I'm home.

376
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,424
Is this place always this crowded?

377
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,767
Wait till we get to the sauna.

378
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,181
You are a pervert!

379
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,757
- Who's that girl, right there?
- Dana Rawlings.

380
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,058
I gotta get to that girl.
You know anything about her?

381
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,757
Oh, just everything.

382
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,261
- Everything.
- Right.

383
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,070
Now to get to her,
first you gotta get through her.

384
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,573
That's the grandmother.

385
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,507
Now she won't let just anybody
get near Dana.

386
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,206
You gotta be a, you know,
a lawyer, or a doctor, or both.

387
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,115
I'm neither one of those.

388
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,649
Oh.

389
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,121
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you don't know.

390
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,237
Excuse me, is there a Dr. Marshall here?
I have a phone call.

391
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,972
Phone call for a Dr. Marshall.

392
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,812
- Dr. Marshall?
- That's me.

393
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,181
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

394
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,211
Hello, Dr. Marshall here.

395
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,189
No, no, I don't operate on Mondays.

396
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,249
Yeah, I operate on Tuesdays.

397
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,851
Say that again?

398
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,693
Yeah, well, I'll see you in surgery, huh?

399
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,392
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

400
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,062
Gotta really stay on top
in this business, you know?

401
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,233
You must be very important there, Doctor.

402
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,470
Jack. Jack Marshall.

403
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,978
Jack Marshall.

404
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,538
- Of the Philadelphia Marshalls?
- Yes, that's right.

405
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,414
How wonderful!

406
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:44,888
You know, your father and I
once knew each other very well.

407
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,120
I'm Amanda Rawlings.

408
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,226
You're Amanda Rawlings.

409
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,529
How nice. Dad talks about you all the time.

410
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,765
There's Dana.

411
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,796
- Hello.
- Hi.

412
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,895
Hi, sweetheart.

413
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:08,076
This is my granddaughter.
Dana, this is Dr. Marshall.

414
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,172
- Jack, I believe we've already met.
- Yes, we did. Sort of.

415
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,514
You've met? How nice!

416
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,614
Exactly what kind of doctor are you?

417
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,815
What kind do you need?

418
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,320
Dana, this is such an odd coincidence.

419
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:27,763
I've known Dr. Marshall's family forever.

420
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,560
He's just the kind of young man
you should be dating.

421
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,867
Are you busy tonight?

422
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,739
Oh, no.

423
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,104
Excellent! Dana would love
to see you this evening.

424
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,976
- Great.
- And so would her cousin Shirley.

425
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,984
- Who?
- My other granddaughter. Lovely girl.

426
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,620
- You don't mind if I bring a friend?
- No, no. That'd be great.

427
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,719
Great.

428
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,127
I don't want to be here.
You keep getting me into trouble.

429
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,221
Come on, pal, don't let me down.

430
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,098
Look, if you don't keep her cousin busy,
I'll never get Dana alone in my bedroom.

431
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,796
I told you I have a date at 11:30.

432
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,930
No problem. Just wait till you meet her.
She's a knockout.

433
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,271
- I hope so.
- Here we go.

434
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,506
Hi, come on in.

435
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,618
Dana, this is my buddy, Ben.

436
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,950
Hi, Ben. Are you a doctor, too?

437
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,786
One of the best. He works in the morgue.

438
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,987
How interesting.

439
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,923
- Where's Shirley?
- She'll be right out.

440
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,689
Shirley.

441
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,358
- What do you think?
- Very nice.

442
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,095
- I know how to pick them, huh?
- You do.

443
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,797
Shirley, hurry up, your date is here.

444
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,074
Oh, my God!

445
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,936
Oh, there you are.

446
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,705
- Deal's off.
- No, Ben. Come on!

447
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,416
Jack, Ben, this is Shirley.

448
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,581
Hi, Shirley.

449
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,385
Call me Hali Zumba.

450
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,459
That's her spirit name.

451
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,059
Hali Zumba.

452
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,624
My cousin studies the teachings
of Babi Rami Nani.

453
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,600
That's Baba Rama Nana.

454
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,967
He's the greatest of all spirit forces.

455
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,935
No kidding! Fascinating.

456
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,135
Very interesting.

457
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,441
So, what do you say we hit the street?

458
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,607
Sounds great.
Are you ready, cousin Zumba?

459
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,673
Oh, I don't feel like going.

460
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,316
But you go ahead and have a good time.

461
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,515
Okay.

462
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,025
Ladies first.

463
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,490
- Whoa, where are you going?
- I'm not staying here with that nutcase.

464
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,432
- We made a deal.
- Yeah, and you said she was a knockout.

465
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:48,265
Come on, Ben, you're embarrassing me!

466
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,399
All right, so she's not Miss America.
Give her a chance.

467
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,603
Maybe you'll learn something
about Nana Banana.

468
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,305
You might even get laid.

469
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,348
Come on. She's an ice cube.

470
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,711
Oh, God. Ben, stay here.

471
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,746
Look, a couple of these will put her in heat.

472
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,820
Aspirin?

473
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,084
Quaaludes! The love drug.

474
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,719
I'm telling you,

475
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,321
one pill will make her so horny
she'll melt in your hands.

476
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,368
- Jack. Jack, are we going?
- Yeah, we're gone.

477
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,592
Come on, Ben!

478
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,870
Don't get too crazy, you two.

479
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,675
Okay, Jack.

480
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,377
And don't forget those aspirins.

481
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,409
I like your name.

482
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,329
Why do you take aspirin?

483
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,154
I have a headache.

484
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,056
Care for one?

485
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:22,765
Excuse me,
but my eyes could not believe me.

486
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,267
Such a lovely flower like you here, my dear.

487
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,463
Beer?

488
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,269
No, no, I'm drinking champagne.

489
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,509
The bubbly.

490
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:38,240
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Count Igor Kaminsky Repulsky.

491
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,520
But you can call me Rip.

492
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,620
Would you care to dance?

493
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,713
What?

494
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,985
Dance, dance. Would you care to dance?

495
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,754
I beg your pardon?

496
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,785
Dance! Dance!

497
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,824
I'd love to.

498
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,196
Wonderful. Please. Please come.

499
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,929
The broad's deaf.

500
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,878
Yes.

501
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,853
Beautiful.

502
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,620
One more time.

503
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,560
You glide like a butterfly.

504
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,281
Count. What are you doing?

505
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,723
I couldn't resist giving you a little hug.

506
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,785
You naughty man.

507
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,292
- What happened to your hair?
- It's a long story.

508
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:11,565
Will you excuse me, please?
I think I'm getting a terrible headache.

509
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,702
Wait, perhaps we could...

510
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,914
Thank you for the dance.

511
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,849
Dude. Hey, nice hair.

512
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,122
- Get out of here, kid.
- Hey, thanks, dude.

513
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,994
- Nice hair, who does it?
- Get out of here.

514
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,277
How is your headache now, Raga Lama?

515
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,447
Gone.

516
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,182
Good.

517
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:04,823
Listen, this has really been interesting.
Thank you. But I have to go.

518
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,692
To get rid of a headache is not enough.

519
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,926
You must strive to be happy.

520
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,263
I'm happy.

521
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,168
No, that is not a happy body.

522
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,100
Not until you are totally free.

523
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,379
Be free with me, Raga Lama.

524
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,850
You must lose your artificial layers.

525
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,757
Oh, my God!

526
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,766
- You mean my clothes?
- Yes!

527
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,700
Quickly. They hold back
the joining of our souls.

528
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,981
Now remove the final shell.

529
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,588
Final what?

530
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,349
Your underwear.

531
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,171
Gaze upon the face of Baba Rama Nana.

532
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,805
Can you see the beautiful light
shining from his eyes?

533
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:33,873
Beautiful.

534
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,114
Can you feel your spirit growing?

535
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,424
Yes, I can.

536
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,888
So, Jack,

537
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,022
I hope your friend behaves himself
with cousin Shirley.

538
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,156
Why?

539
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,895
Well, Baba Rama's totally against sex.

540
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,899
How do you feel about sex?

541
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,632
Oh, I think it's fine.

542
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,502
But never on the first date.

543
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,773
You're still gonna need a full checkup.

544
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,355
Please, Baba Rama, come into my soul.

545
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,492
Come to me.

546
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,256
- Come to me.
- Yes, come to me.

547
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,423
- Come to me.
- Yes, come to me.

548
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,160
- Come to me.
- Yes.

549
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,562
- Come to me. I can't take it!
- Yes! Yes!

550
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,934
No! What are you doing?

551
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,767
Flesh cannot touch flesh
in the master's presence!

552
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,969
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

553
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,012
Believe me, I swear. Really. I swear.

554
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,604
I didn't know.

555
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,082
Now I must re-purify myself in the night air.

556
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,853
Okay.

557
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,789
Close your eyes.

558
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,362
Approach the master.

559
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,228
Now repeat, come to me.

560
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,641
Come to me.

561
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,109
Come to me.

562
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,876
Come to me.

563
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,145
Come to me.

564
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,646
Come to me.

565
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,049
Come to me.

566
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,752
Come to me.

567
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,150
I'll be back soon.

568
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,057
Come to me.

569
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,560
Come to me.

570
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,830
Listen, Baba Rama,

571
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,797
please,

572
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,399
let me screw her.

573
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,136
My head.

574
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,072
Count Igor Repulsky.

575
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,243
So suave.

576
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,350
And so sophisticated.

577
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,246
What a shame about his head.

578
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:56,150
I hope I didn't offend him by running away.

579
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,287
Because I do have a splitting headache.

580
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:09,464
Come to me. Come to me.

581
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,479
Come to me.

582
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,614
- Let me out.
- Get away from me.

583
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,519
Baba Rama, help!

584
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,851
Ouch! Please.

585
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,088
Get out of here, you vile, degenerate scum.

586
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,561
Get away from me! Get away from me!

587
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,531
Get out of here!
Out of here, you degenerate!

588
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,800
Aspirin. What angel left these?

589
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,403
I'd better take four.

590
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,688
Hi, how are you doing?

591
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,122
Good evening, sir.

592
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,755
Jack, let me in! Jack!

593
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,392
- Jack!
- Ben?

594
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,766
Yeah, it's me! Let me in!

595
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,203
Come on, buddy, Dana's starting to weaken.
Give me a half hour.

596
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,264
Jack, if I don't put something on, I'm gonna
get in a lot of trouble. Now come on!

597
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,810
Those Quaaludes are killers, huh? Hang on.

598
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:24,314
- Just a minute, young man!
- Hi, how are you?

599
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,009
That's pretty unusual evening wear.

600
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,886
This? Bathing suit.
I was just going down to take a swim.

601
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:36,415
That's odd. It looked to me
like you were trying to break into this door!

602
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,453
- No. It's my room.
- May I see your key?

603
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,460
Here you go, buddy. Have fun.

604
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,668
You pervert! Choo-choo, Twinkie, attack!

605
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,238
Go on.

606
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:57,270
Get them off me! I can't stand these dogs!

607
00:41:58,215 --> 00:41:59,648
Please!

608
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,321
You bastard! You bastard!

609
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,816
Kill!

610
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,063
Kill! Kill! After him!

611
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,096
Come over here. I'm in a spot.
Could you help me out here?

612
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,826
Come here.

613
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,199
Could you help me a second?
Come over here.

614
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,794
Just come over here. Right here. That's it.

615
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,504
How are you? Just help me out.
Stand right here.

616
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,567
And help bring this up. That's it.

617
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:01,736
- Hold tight.
- That's it.

618
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:05,248
Help bring... That's the way.
There you go. That's very good.

619
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,308
I've never seen
a gentleman hung upside down before.

620
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,511
- Okay.
- Okay.

621
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,181
Thank you very much. God!

622
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,282
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

623
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,690
- Bring it all the way up.
- Yes.

624
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,423
All right, thank you. All right.
Here. Here. Here. Okay, here you go.

625
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,133
- Here, quick. Leave. Go.
- God bless you.

626
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:38,613
Through hanging around, sugar?
Oh, honey, I hope that thing's working.

627
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,845
- Now sit and eat your din-din.
- I'm not hungry.

628
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,961
I came so close
to getting that diamond, so close!

629
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,865
If it wasn't for this lousy haircut,
I would've had it!

630
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,665
If I catch that barber,
I'm gonna blow his head off!

631
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,707
I'm gonna slice him up
like a goddamn salami!

632
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,169
Honey, relax. Relax.

633
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,747
- Just relax.
- Yeah, relax. Relax.

634
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,907
Your hair will grow back.

635
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,747
Go on. If I don't get that stone,
I'm gonna be a dead man.

636
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,219
Oh, sweetie, everything's gonna be all right.

637
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,950
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will.

638
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,288
Why don't you go take that nice, hot bath
I ran for you?

639
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,793
- I don't wanna.
- I'll join you in a minute.

640
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,887
We'll play "peek-a-boobie."

641
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:32,699
"Peek-a-boobie"? Really? All right.

642
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,902
All right, honey, what took you so long?
Come on in here.

643
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:10,407
Daddy's been waiting for you. That's it.

644
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,102
It's peek-a-boobie time!

645
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,915
What the...

646
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,053
You! You!

647
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:41,434
- Your barber was here again!
- Yes, sir, and he made you look much better.

648
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,530
Morons everywhere! Morons!

649
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,615
My grandmother's probably home by now.

650
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,914
She can take care of herself.

651
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,585
Be right back.

652
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,705
- Hey, Ben, had a wild time, huh?
- Yeah. Thank you!

653
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,713
What's wrong with you?

654
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,825
- You still here, huh?
- Yeah.

655
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:44,631
- What happened to your big ride?
- I don't know.

656
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,530
Well, my offer still stands.

657
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,798
If you wanna go.

658
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,233
Come on, Patti,
I mean, you can't wait here all night.

659
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,711
Let me just give you a ride home.

660
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,375
- All right. Okay.
- Great. My car is right here. Check this out.

661
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,679
See, I got the custom pinstripes
and wheels there. Like it?

662
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:07,849
Yeah.

663
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,789
I guess you could
call this our first date, huh?

664
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,365
It's just a ride, Scott. Okay?

665
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,933
I want to make sure
that you understand that.

666
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,201
Okay, okay, I was just kidding.

667
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,969
But you never know what might happen.

668
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,147
I think I need another aspirin.

669
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,894
I love a man in uniform.

670
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,531
Hello, sailor. Looking for a little fun?

671
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,511
Mrs. Rawlings, please, you...
Mrs. Rawlings!

672
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,346
I am the barber in the hotel! Mrs. Rawlings!

673
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,749
Will you please control yourself!

674
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:54,254
I like it! I like it! I like it!

675
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,992
Mrs. Rawlings! Mrs. Rawlings!

676
00:48:56,133 --> 00:49:00,593
Don't worry about the pain, <i>Liebchen!</i>
I have aspirin!

677
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,303
I like it!

678
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,544
Hey, Ben. How are you doing?
Been looking all over for you.

679
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,978
- Can I help you guys?
- Beer.

680
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:15,175
I tell you honey, lust is a crazy thing.

681
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,249
I'll be right back, sweetie.
Don't you go away.

682
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,030
I should've known, Curt.

683
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,227
Our first night here
and you're already hitting on other girls.

684
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,701
You've got it all wrong, babe.

685
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,261
I'm just sitting around,
having a couple of beers

686
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,365
with these guys, right?

687
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,900
- Yeah.
- There, you see! Why so suspicious?

688
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,606
You want to stay here and chase girls?
That's fine with me.

689
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:51,147
Because I'm gonna go out there
and pick up on the first guy I run into.

690
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,851
Yeah. Beautiful.

691
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,396
- Come here. Do me a favor.
- What?

692
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,060
If this guy tries to leave, you stall him, okay.

693
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,228
Why?

694
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,966
Because all I have to do
is be the first guy that she runs into.

695
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,474
You're crazy, man. Look at the size of him.

696
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,671
Look, just don't let him
go back to his room, all right?

697
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,546
- Did you miss me?
- Oh, yeah.

698
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,389
Did you really mean it?
I mean, about the first guy you run into?

699
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,490
- I sure did.
- What room are you in?

700
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,593
My boyfriend may show up there.

701
00:50:41,273 --> 00:50:45,332
It's got to be your room. Come on.

702
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,138
How you doing?

703
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,780
See the blonde over there?

704
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:59,313
Pretty nice, huh?
Wants me to take her back to my room.

705
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:03,426
- Your room? Don't do that.
- Why not?

706
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,292
Here. Take her to my room. Okay?

707
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:08,298
Your room. Hey, thanks a lot.
That'll help me out.

708
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:11,767
Why don't you do me a favor?
Walk her up there for me.

709
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,565
This way I don't get caught.

710
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:17,540
- You're kidding?
- No, man. This is serious.

711
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:24,474
Come on in.

712
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:31,449
- Oh, what a cute place.
- Thanks. Make yourself at home.

713
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,459
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Yes. Right there.

714
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,389
Thanks.

715
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:47,404
Jack, I think I'm going to be sick.

716
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:49,669
Why does this have to happen to me?

717
00:51:52,043 --> 00:51:54,170
- Oh, no.
- What?

718
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,973
- Her boyfriend is on his way up here!
- How could you do this to me?

719
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:03,452
What could I do? He was going to his room.
You said you were gonna be there!

720
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:11,019
- How's about a drink, sailor?
- That's just what you need.

721
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:16,229
- Who is it?
- It's him. We're dead.

722
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:20,502
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

723
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:27,702
Hi. Come on in.

724
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:33,874
Hey, nice place. Fruit and everything.

725
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,413
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. We're sharing the place.

726
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,478
Yeah.

727
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,421
I'm kidding.

728
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:44,891
Oh, hi, Curt.

729
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:49,127
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Honey.

730
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:55,839
Hold all my calls, okay?

731
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,342
Funny guy.

732
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:05,880
- This is it, this is it.
- Right here?

733
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:10,478
- This is the place.
- You are so strong.

734
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,256
What should we do?

735
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:21,893
Go, go. Hurry up.

736
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:33,968
One second, honey.
Honey, I'll be right back, I promise.

737
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:37,545
Hey, you guys got something to drink?

738
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,781
- Sure.
- Great.

739
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,615
- Gin, okay?
- Fine.

740
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:52,023
Seems you had enough to drink already.

741
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:54,860
- Help yourself.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

742
00:54:00,038 --> 00:54:03,735
- You guys really know how to party.
- Yeah, we're celebrating. It's Ben's birthday.

743
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:07,141
- How nice. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

744
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,608
Honey?

745
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:19,517
Look,

746
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:23,720
one more thing.
You guys got some protection?

747
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:25,861
Protection?

748
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:31,026
- Is that enough?
- Yeah. For now.

749
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,367
Thank you.

750
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:39,700
Thanks a lot.

751
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:42,509
You're a great guy, you know that?

752
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,070
- Thanks.
- I mean that.

753
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:47,276
- You are, too.
- No, no, no, you.

754
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:50,787
- Thanks.
- Hey, look on your shoulder.

755
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,491
Thanks. Thanks.

756
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:56,654
Honey?

757
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:02,763
If we get out of this alive, I swear
I'll never do anything for anyone again.

758
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,859
- Who is it?
- Maid service.

759
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:06,426
Just a minute!

760
00:55:20,018 --> 00:55:22,509
Good evening, gentlemen,
is there anything you need?

761
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,578
- No.
- Everything's fine, thanks.

762
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:27,022
Good. Then I'll just
turn down your beds for you.

763
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,719
Don't! We like to do it ourselves.

764
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:37,166
That's his sister. She's sick.

765
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:40,261
So thanks for everything.
You've been really wonderful.

766
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,272
Why don't you come back
when you have more time?

767
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,365
You're very cute.

768
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:59,748
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, fellows!

769
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,685
- To the balcony.
- To the bar, man! Go.

770
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:09,832
Come here, you animal.

771
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:16,169
I'll be right back.

772
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:23,941
Hey, guys, you got some cigarettes around?

773
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:28,814
- Yeah, yeah, we got some cigarettes.
- Sure, right in here. Come on. Right in here.

774
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,083
Hey, hey, hey! Don't push.
Come on, come on!

775
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:11,923
Where is she?

776
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,892
- You lying son of a bitch!
- Help!

777
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:14,989
Who is this slut?

778
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:18,160
- I'll kill you! I've had enough...
- Is there a problem here?

779
00:57:18,236 --> 00:57:19,863
- No.
- You son of a bitch.

780
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,598
- No problem.
- I'll kill you!

781
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,332
I thought I heard screams.

782
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,534
Who is she?

783
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:28,442
Who do you think you are?

784
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,341
No! Everything's fine!

785
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,911
You little punks! You set me up!

786
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:37,347
Go!

787
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:40,683
- Come back here!
- You creep, I hate you.

788
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,591
Another round?

789
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:10,180
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Going home.

790
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,245
I thought you were here
for the whole weekend.

791
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:13,415
I changed my mind.

792
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:17,894
Oh. I guess you also changed your mind
about meeting me last night.

793
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:22,365
Oh, yeah, me. I was here.
I saw you leave with that guy.

794
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:26,233
Well, you were a half an hour late
and I needed a ride.

795
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,406
Believe me, I really wanted to go with you.

796
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:34,267
- Really?
- Yeah.

797
00:58:35,046 --> 00:58:36,104
Yeah?

798
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:37,770
No.

799
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:41,948
You know, you can always
change your mind again and stay.

800
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:43,813
What for?

801
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,416
- Tonight might work out better.
- Yeah?

802
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,353
Really?

803
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:50,953
Okay.

804
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,193
Patti, let's go. You got work to do.

805
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,257
- Okay. One minute, Scott.
- No. Right now.

806
00:58:57,335 --> 00:59:00,736
- Okay, I'll be right there. Okay?
- Excuse me.

807
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:07,969
- Let go of me. Hey, that hurts!
- So what? I told you not to talk to that guy!

808
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,809
- Just let go, okay?
- Hey, let her go.

809
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:13,009
You stay out of this, okay?
It's none of your business.

810
00:59:13,084 --> 00:59:14,517
Yeah, it is.

811
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,249
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm...

812
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,311
- Come on.
- Scott! No!

813
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,355
No! No, stop! Please!

814
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:26,190
You keep your nose out
of other people's business.

815
00:59:26,264 --> 00:59:28,858
- And you, I'll talk to you later.
- You jerk.

816
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:32,132
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

817
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:37,797
- I'm so sorry I got you involved in all this.
- That's all right. That's all right.

818
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,035
Sorry.

819
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,271
Thank you.

820
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:19,942
- Hello, my darling.
- Count! What an unexpected pleasure.

821
01:01:20,211 --> 01:01:22,042
And just in time for brunch.

822
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,778
- Are we alone?
- Just the two of us. Isn't it romantic?

823
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:31,553
Can I get you anything?
I have orange juice, coffee,

824
01:01:31,622 --> 01:01:33,749
even a bit of champagne.

825
01:01:33,825 --> 01:01:35,759
My dear, but I think

826
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,158
you know what I want.

827
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:45,062
- You don't mean?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

828
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:48,401
I'm sorry if I led you on.

829
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:53,042
I wasn't myself last night.
I'm flattered that you're interested in me,

830
01:01:53,111 --> 01:01:56,410
but I have other commitments.

831
01:01:56,581 --> 01:01:59,015
No. I don't think you understand.

832
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:01,046
I want your diamond.

833
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:02,945
What?

834
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:06,418
Now listen good.
I don't want brunch, I don't want romance,

835
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:07,753
I want that diamond!

836
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:10,419
- Rip!
- Rip, my ass! Give me that diamond!

837
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:15,189
- No way, buster!
- Come on. I don't have time to play games.

838
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:16,733
Give me that diamond.

839
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:20,930
I got you now. Come on.

840
01:02:21,506 --> 01:02:22,530
Count Rip.

841
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:25,838
- Okay!
- Okay. No more Mr. Nice Guy!

842
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,878
Now I'm gonna have to hurt you. Come on.

843
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:41,751
And stay out!

844
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,298
Count, my ass!

845
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,793
Hello, operator?

846
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,304
Could you give me security, please?

847
01:03:01,312 --> 01:03:05,112
Security? Oh, yes. I...

848
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:08,243
Put it down. Come on, put it down.

849
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:11,378
All right, lady. Playtime's over.

850
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:14,488
First, you're gonna give me that diamond.

851
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,050
Yeah, then I'm gonna
lock you in the bathroom.

852
01:03:17,128 --> 01:03:21,064
Then you can karate the shit out of yourself.
How's that sound?

853
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,736
Yeah. "Count, my ass," huh?

854
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:28,294
Come on. It's noon already.

855
01:03:28,606 --> 01:03:31,939
Besides, you said
you'd take me to the fashion show.

856
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:35,135
Come on, I'll race you to the shower.
Come on.

857
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:38,339
You win.

858
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,941
- Good morning.
- Sure is.

859
01:03:52,463 --> 01:03:54,522
- Surprise!
- Hi.

860
01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:03,034
Hi, Ben.

861
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:07,041
- Hi. I missed you.
- It's only been seven hours.

862
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:08,305
I know.

863
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:15,112
I missed you, too.

864
01:04:15,887 --> 01:04:19,755
- How did you know I was so hungry?
- I didn't. You ordered all this stuff.

865
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:21,849
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

866
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:23,450
Oh, I did, Ben.

867
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,397
Oh, I see.

868
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:32,793
Well, sorry to interrupt you two. See you.

869
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:34,796
Patti.

870
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:38,672
- Patti, come on, let me explain!
- Just leave me alone, okay?

871
01:04:38,743 --> 01:04:40,506
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- You know it is.

872
01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:42,205
It's the barber!

873
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:47,343
- Oh, Hubie, let the poor kid go!
- Grab a cab. I'll meet you out front!

874
01:04:47,418 --> 01:04:48,544
Hubert!

875
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,645
Come here! I'm not gonna hurt you!
Just gonna kill you!

876
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,957
Let him live!

877
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,934
Let's see, how are we doing over here?

878
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,507
Hurry up, girls! We're starting in one minute.

879
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,975
Come on ladies, let's line up.

880
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:21,776
- May I help you?
- I'm just looking for somebody.

881
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:25,512
Oh, the Merry Widow! Come on, get in line!

882
01:05:25,723 --> 01:05:28,851
Everyone's ready except for you.
Oh, honey.

883
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,485
Honey, would you zip her up, please?

884
01:05:31,796 --> 01:05:35,129
With pleasure. I love widows.

885
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:39,626
Girls, make this your best show ever.

886
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,167
Let's go.

887
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:44,841
I've seen them all, baby.
But you're definitely a 10.

888
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,240
They call me The Maestro.
What's your name?

889
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:52,112
You know, you look like somebody I...
What's the matter? I say something wrong?

890
01:05:52,183 --> 01:05:53,810
Wait, let me walk you.

891
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:59,378
Oh, I don't know what's taking him so long.

892
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,983
He ought to be here by now.

893
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:07,429
Hey, wait a minute.
Now where are you going in such a hurry?

894
01:06:07,498 --> 01:06:09,659
You don't have to run away from me.

895
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,597
You're the quiet type, huh?
That's good. That's good.

896
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,367
I've been looking for you all my life.
No, I mean it, baby.

897
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,775
We'd look great together, just great.

898
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:24,744
Listen, if I... Excuse me.

899
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,713
We have bodybuilders over here?
What is this?

900
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:30,777
I'm serious, baby. When I like somebody,
I really like them, doll.

901
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:33,585
Now, just a little kiss.
I want just a little kiss.

902
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:41,498
Well, hello.

903
01:07:15,566 --> 01:07:18,729
You son of a bitch! Get out of here.

904
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,103
No, don't leave me, baby.
Don't get scared now.

905
01:07:22,173 --> 01:07:24,664
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I wouldn't hurt you, baby.

906
01:07:24,742 --> 01:07:28,178
Here. I got something to show you. Here.
You like this? Look at that.

907
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:32,911
Ice is nice. Ice is nice. Look at that.

908
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:38,583
Yeah, ice is nice. Oops.
Wait, wait, whoa, wait. Wait, wait.

909
01:07:38,656 --> 01:07:42,615
I need that. All right? I need that.
But first, give me a kiss.

910
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:43,715
Give me a little...

911
01:07:44,562 --> 01:07:45,620
You!

912
01:07:45,963 --> 01:07:47,260
Son of a...

913
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:54,336
- Help me catch that barber. He's a thief.
- That's a woman, sir.

914
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:57,636
You moron, that's a faggot barber
and he's got my diamond in his tits!

915
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:58,834
Come on.

916
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:02,501
Come on.

917
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:06,148
Come on.

918
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:14,618
All right. He went that way.

919
01:08:14,692 --> 01:08:16,250
- Right.
- Let's go.

920
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:28,393
Hey, babe.
What, are you crazy coming here?

921
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:32,169
My girlfriend's in the room over here
and your boyfriend puts a gun to my head.

922
01:08:32,243 --> 01:08:33,574
I mean, hey, look, look.

923
01:08:33,644 --> 01:08:36,772
- Maybe we could go to your place, huh?
- Maybe some other time.

924
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:38,041
Jesus.

925
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,416
Thank you, Baba Rama Nana.

926
01:08:53,831 --> 01:08:55,355
All right, give me this!

927
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:57,525
All right, give me the diamonds!
The diamonds. Come on.

928
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:58,761
You want my what?

929
01:09:15,286 --> 01:09:16,378
Choo-choo, Twinkie.

930
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,982
Kill! Kill!

931
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,454
Kill! Kill!

932
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:26,962
Freeze!

933
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:34,797
- Get that barber. Let's go. Come on.
- Sir, he's definitely not the barber.

934
01:09:34,872 --> 01:09:39,002
I'm not talking about occupations here.
He's got my diamond. Come on.

935
01:09:39,076 --> 01:09:40,509
Come on. Come on.

936
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,110
Jesus!

937
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:50,176
Jack, Jack, help, help.
They're trying to kill me.

938
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:51,278
Lady, I don't know you.

939
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:52,447
- It's me, it's me.
- Ben?

940
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:54,013
Let's go. Run.

941
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:58,822
- Stop, or I'll shoot.
- Shoot first and then yell stop, you idiot.

942
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:06,001
Come on. Come on. Let's move it. Come on.

943
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,259
Come on.

944
01:10:15,012 --> 01:10:17,981
No! Wait. No!

945
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:34,761
I hope my Hubie-boobie's behaving himself.

946
01:10:37,134 --> 01:10:38,431
Move!

947
01:10:51,282 --> 01:10:53,773
- Hollywood.
- Hollywood.

948
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:57,754
What's so funny, huh?
What's so goddamned funny?

949
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:02,656
- What...
- Dude, what a look.

950
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:04,785
You got to show me how to do that.

951
01:11:04,862 --> 01:11:07,456
There. That's how to do it.

952
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,732
Shirley!

953
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:18,032
Shirley, behind the door.

954
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:20,743
Can you hear me? Behind the door.

955
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:22,142
Baba Rama.

956
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:27,581
First the flowers
and now to hear your spirit voice.

957
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:33,453
Shirley! Cut the bullshit and open this door!

958
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:34,883
Baba?

959
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:38,394
Split up!

960
01:11:52,009 --> 01:11:54,876
Help! Help! Girls, girls.
There's a man in there.

961
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:04,581
All right. This time you've gone too far.

962
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:07,020
Oh, not you again.

963
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,558
Get him, girls.

964
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:33,240
Come on.

965
01:12:33,317 --> 01:12:34,978
- Where?
- Upstairs.

966
01:12:41,892 --> 01:12:44,326
So, the big lover is a small time crook, huh?

967
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:58,903
Hold it.

968
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:00,204
There they go.

969
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:01,636
Out of the way.

970
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:03,543
Come on. Hey, you, come on.

971
01:13:12,323 --> 01:13:14,985
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill somebody.

972
01:13:15,226 --> 01:13:16,625
No kidding!

973
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:50,686
Please, everyone, no need to panic.

974
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:52,888
Everything is under control.

975
01:14:20,157 --> 01:14:21,146
Patti!

976
01:14:21,258 --> 01:14:24,455
- Leave me alone. We're through.
- No, let me explain what happened.

977
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,155
I know exactly what...

978
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:29,126
Patti! Patti!

979
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,328
- Are you crazy? You'll get killed.
- What the hell are you doing?

980
01:14:38,442 --> 01:14:39,431
Ben!

981
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:44,571
Ben, Ben.

982
01:14:44,849 --> 01:14:48,512
I'm so sorry. Say something, please.
Say something.

983
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:52,186
I love you.

984
01:14:57,728 --> 01:15:01,494
Party's over, punk.
Come on, get up. Give me the diamond. Up.

985
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:03,864
Come on. Let's go now.

986
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:07,232
Let go of the diamond. Let's go now!

987
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:10,236
Go ahead, you wanna dance, kid?

988
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:13,677
Come on. Get over there.

989
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:17,812
Good work, sir. You captured the crooks.

990
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,548
My back, you moron.

991
01:15:21,752 --> 01:15:26,086
I'm sorry, sir, but don't worry.
I'll keep them covered.

992
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,986
Dude. Dynamite move.

993
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,051
This guy. How are you doing that?

994
01:15:32,129 --> 01:15:35,360
- All right, what's going on here?
- Everything's under control.

995
01:15:35,432 --> 01:15:36,763
These boys stole a diamond.

996
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:38,825
Yes, that's right. They stole a diamond.

997
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:40,564
- We did not.
- They didn't.

998
01:15:40,638 --> 01:15:41,798
Let's go, downtown.

999
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:46,309
- Hold it. That man stole the diamond.
- Oh, no.

1000
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:50,645
- Grandmother? Grandmother!
- Wait a minute.

1001
01:15:50,748 --> 01:15:54,582
Wait a minute. It's just...
Now, just take it easy, please.

1002
01:15:54,752 --> 01:15:56,743
No, please. No, no, don't.

1003
01:15:57,588 --> 01:16:00,455
My neck. My neck. My neck.

1004
01:16:11,802 --> 01:16:13,030
Hubert.

1005
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:18,270
Hubert, honey. Honey...

1006
01:16:19,343 --> 01:16:22,471
- Hubie-boobie.
- Don't call me that.

1007
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:24,973
Are you gonna be very long?

1008
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:28,074
That meter's ticking.

1009
01:16:29,153 --> 01:16:30,211
Mike?

1010
01:16:31,422 --> 01:16:33,185
A real grandma.

1011
01:16:33,257 --> 01:16:36,522
Granny, you're gonna love this place.
It's Jamaica, it's a party city.

1012
01:16:36,594 --> 01:16:37,720
You'll fit right in.

1013
01:16:37,795 --> 01:16:40,787
Oh, I hope they have
this wonderful aspirin there.

1014
01:16:40,864 --> 01:16:44,891
They've got boatloads and truckloads.
Believe me, more than your share.

1015
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:49,301
- I hope I'm not nuts quitting my job.
- What's a lousy job next to a great vacation?

1016
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:51,841
After all these vacations,
I'm gonna need a vacation.

1017
01:16:51,909 --> 01:16:55,037
Okay, dudes. You ready to blast off?

1018
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:59,173
No, no, wait. We can't go yet.
Someone is missing.

1019
01:17:01,452 --> 01:17:04,546
Dana, dear, where is your cousin Shirley?

1020
01:17:04,622 --> 01:17:09,582
Be free with me, Raga Lama.
You must strive to be happy.

1021
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:11,154
Hey, I'm happy.

1022
01:17:11,228 --> 01:17:15,130
No, that is not a happy body.

1023
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:19,267
Baby, if this isn't a happy body,
then my name isn't Big Rick.

1024
01:17:19,603 --> 01:17:21,127
Check this out.

1025
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:28,911
You must remove all your artificial layers.

1026
01:17:34,018 --> 01:17:35,918
You asked for it, baby.

1027
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:46,191
Not in front of the Baba Rama.

1028
01:17:46,864 --> 01:17:49,264
Shirley, what are you doing?

1029
01:17:49,633 --> 01:17:52,193
I'm meditating.

1030
01:17:52,269 --> 01:17:54,703
Well, come on dear. We're leaving now.

1031
01:17:54,772 --> 01:17:57,639
Not now. I'm meditating.

1032
01:17:57,708 --> 01:18:02,338
And you know that meditation
is the most important thing in my life!
