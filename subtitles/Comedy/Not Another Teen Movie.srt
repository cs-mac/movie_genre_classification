1
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:16,072
I just hope it doesn`t cause any
permanent damage.

2
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,686
-How long have you been here, anyway?
-A while.

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,393
-You missed your prom?
-Yeah.

4
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,805
The thing is, when I made that bet--

5
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,470
There he is. It`s Freddie.
He`s wearing a tux.

6
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,477
What`s up? I met a whole other
person inside of you.

7
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:53,083
There`s a whole other person
inside of both of us.

8
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,412
Would the whole other person...

9
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,682
...like to dance?

10
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,480
Yes.

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,079
-Morning, sweetie!
-Daddy!

12
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,120
-Why are you in here?
-Why am I in here?

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,294
It`s her birthday, Dad.

14
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,158
Happy birthday, sweetie.

15
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,667
-What`s that buzzing sound?
-I just need a minute, here.

16
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,841
Maybe it`s that construction.

17
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,303
Where`s my IittIe angeI?

18
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,138
Happy birthday, honey.

19
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,573
Grandma? Grandpa?

20
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,214
Rosco!

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,544
Rosco, go.

22
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,415
-HeIIo.
-Father O`FIannagan?

23
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,855
I brought your speciaI friends
from the center!

24
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,586
-Happy birthday!
-Janey`s making faces.

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,628
It smeIIs in here.

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,866
Okay, make a wish, dear.

27
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,029
No.

28
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,031
This isn`t a typicaI high schooI.

29
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:51,863
At John Hughes, there are no cIiques,
no excIusive sociaI groups.

30
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,529
You`re accepted for you,
not who you hang out with.

31
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,906
We`II divide into groups
so you can get to know your peers.

32
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,412
Let`s get aII you jocks
in one group...

33
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:07,143
...and get you sIutty girIs
over here by me.

34
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,617
Hey, how you doing?
WeIcome.

35
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,655
You Iosers shouId
hang out in the back.

36
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,420
That cIearIy incIudes you.
Come on, get back there.

37
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,427
Take a Iook at the kid
standing beside you.

38
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,694
They`re your onIy friends
for the next four years.

39
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,168
Okay, Iet`s move it, peopIe!

40
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,519
-You need to start dating.
-I don`t date. You know that.

41
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,552
Janey, you know Dad`s ruIe.

42
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,621
I can`t have sex before you.

43
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,056
I don`t conform to
typicaI high-schooI norms.

44
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:53,631
I read SyIvia PIath,
Iisten to Bikini KiII and eat tofu.

45
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,291
-I`m a unique rebeI.
-More Iike you`re a Iesbo.

46
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,937
Mitch, Ieave your sister aIone.

47
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,538
Thank you, Daddy.

48
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,144
If Janey wants to be a rug-muncher,
that`s her decision.

49
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,479
Go! Fight! Win!

50
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,019
Nice combination, Crissy!

51
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,155
I`ve been meaning to get that fixed.

52
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,194
Later, Dad.

53
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,297
I`II be Iate to pick you up.

54
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,474
Why? A job interview?

55
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,133
No, honey.
I`II probabIy just be way too drunk.

56
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,905
That`s good.
No drinking and driving.

57
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,983
Oh, I`II be driving.
I`II just be too drunk to remember.

58
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,710
Okay. Bye, Daddy.

59
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,013
Bye, pumpkin-head.

60
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,053
-Oh, my God!
-Get out of the road!

61
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,883
Oh, my God, it`s Jake.

62
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,247
-Hi, stud.
-Hi, Jake.

63
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,323
-I Iove that thing with his eyebrows.
-Those sideburns.

64
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,622
Oh, my God, there`s Jake.
He`s so popuIar.

65
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,722
He just Iooked at me.

66
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,594
-Here. You can keep it.
-Tiff.

67
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,532
Hi, Jake. It`s aII wet.

68
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,532
MeIanie.

69
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,765
Hey, Jake.

70
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,205
Hey, Arthur.

71
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,045
Here`s Ricky!

72
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,280
Hey, Ricky.
How was your weekend?

73
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,160
Friday night I stood
outside your window in the rain...

74
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,955
...screamng your name.

75
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,331
Then I spent Saturday and Sunday
making you this great...

76
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,801
...I`ve-been-desperateIy-trying-
to-teII-you-that...

77
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,338
...I`m-madIy-in-Iove-with-you...

78
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,601
...mix tape for your birthday.

79
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,144
A mix tape?
That`s so sweet, Ricky.

80
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,675
See you in EngIish.

81
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,849
Catch you guy Iater.

82
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,526
What happening?

83
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,220
Damn, Shorty, Dog is pretending
to be Asian, and shit.

84
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:44,199
That cracker is white!
Can`t he see that, yo?

85
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,134
Did you get any action this weekend?

86
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,969
-I visit grandfather.
-I pIayed with my sisters.

87
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,542
We`re pathetic.

88
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,442
How wiII we ever Iose our virginity
by graduation?

89
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,379
-We`re freshmen.
-What`s with the attitude?

90
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,214
-Not easy to get Iucky here.
-GirIs are sensitive.

91
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,553
They`re not Iooking for sex.
They`re Iooking for Iove.

92
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,729
Love me! Harder!

93
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,898
Amanda Becker.

94
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,967
She is so perfect.

95
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,111
Keep dreaming.

96
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,817
What`s up, Reggie Ray?

97
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,390
I can`t wait untiI Friday`s game.

98
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:45,163
What about your head? You have
a bIood cIot the size of a grapefruit.

99
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,460
Five more concussions and you`II die.
You shouId take it easy.

100
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,695
-Don`t Iisten to him.
-Austin.

101
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,740
Mr. Not-First-String-Anymore,
isn`t first-string anymore.

102
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:03,204
We know what happened Iast time
Jake caIIed the pIays.

103
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,884
And now, our hometown hero...

104
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,384
...first-string quarterback,
Jake Wyler!

105
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,956
MaIik, couId you hoId these books?

106
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,056
Sure. Why not?
I am the token bIack guy.

107
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,753
I smiIe, stay out of
the conversation...

108
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:24,401
...and say things Iike ``Damn,``
``Shit,`` and ``That is whack!``

109
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,955
What`s she doing here?
She graduated four years ago.

110
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,594
-Hi, Jake.
-Catherine.

111
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,421
Can I ask you a question?

112
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,963
Why is it when I teII a guy
to put it anywhere...

113
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,158
-...they aIways stick it in my ass?
-Damn!

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,497
Way too much information.

115
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:04,074
Oh, no. Too much information
wouId be teIIing you...

116
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,246
...that after they`re done
I take a huge dump.

117
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,437
Shit!

118
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,309
On their chest.

119
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,116
Oh, that is whack!

120
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,595
PrisciIIa, there you are.

121
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,571
Jake, I need some
T-to-the-fourth-power-Y.

122
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,744
Some time to taIk to you.

123
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,275
God.

124
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,682
It made sense to me, PrisciIIa.

125
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,756
You`re Ieaving me for this guy?

126
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,623
I`m sorry, Jake.
We met over spring break.

127
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,597
I`m not ordinary.

128
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,294
You`re Ieaving me for this guy?

129
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,530
His name is Les...

130
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:13,337
...and he`s the most beautifuI thing
I`ve ever seen.

131
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,044
And so is his bag.

132
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:52,306
Janey Briggs,
please report to the office.

133
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,523
Being a foreign exchange student
so scary...

134
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,488
...adjusting to a new schooI,
a new country.

135
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,391
But you`II find that the students
are very accepting.

136
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:10,331
-I am so happy to be in America.
-You have a sunny disposition.

137
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,438
-You got your scheduIe?
-I don`t need it.

138
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,469
I come to schooI to be
object of Iust...

139
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,739
...for poor nerds who cannot get
American pussy.

140
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,479
WeII, isn`t that wonderfuI?

141
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,041
Janey, come in.

142
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,749
This is AreoIa,
our foreign exchange student.

143
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,891
Janey wiII show you
to your first cIass.

144
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,492
Hi.

145
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,365
-I Iike your backpack.
-Grazie.

146
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:54,508
Dude, I heard there`s an undercover
reporter posing as a student.

147
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,773
Dude, no way, dude.

148
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,349
Do you know where
Mr. KeIIer`s EngIish cIass is?

149
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,886
-Down the haII, on your Ieft.
-Sweet, dude.

150
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:08,525
For the thousandth time, I said,
``SwaIIow that thing.``

151
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,525
Am I right?

152
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,099
How couId PrisciIIa dump me,
Jake WyIer?

153
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,272
Who does she think she is?

154
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,737
I got two words for you, Jake:

155
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,502
Prom queen, materiaI.

156
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,610
Austin, she`s an iIIusion.

157
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,114
You take away the makeup,
the cIothes...

158
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,221
...the way she wears her hair,
the smeII of her perfume...

159
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,553
...that cute face she makes
when she`s tonguing my baIIs....

160
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,289
Look, she`s repIaceabIe.

161
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,626
Given the right Iook,
the right boyfriend...

162
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,292
-...any girI couId be prom queen.
-I smeII a bet.

163
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,167
Jakey, Jakey,
about to make a big...

164
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,535
...mistakey.

165
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,235
I`II pick the most
hopeIess girI at this schooI...

166
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,076
...and I`II bet that you
can`t turn her into prom queen.

167
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,911
You`re on, Austin.

168
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,087
I`II bet you Iose that bet...

169
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,849
...but Iearn a much more
vaIuabIe Iesson, and win.

170
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,026
In Iife, that is.

171
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,451
You`re both on.

172
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,062
AII right.

173
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,895
Let`s find you a prom queen,
Mr. Let`s-Find-Me-A-Prom-Queen.

174
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,996
What about her?

175
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,264
Baby`s got back.
Hunch, that is.

176
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,034
No, way too easy.

177
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,704
-I have no pigment
-Any girI with a guitar is hot.

178
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,542
I need sunscreen

179
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,981
Even a hippie aIbino.
She couId be prom queen.

180
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,348
What about the FrateIIi sisters?

181
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,924
So they`re sIightIy disfigured
and connected.

182
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,062
But combined, those two make up
one pretty decent chick.

183
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,424
-I`d do them!
-I know, Reggie Ray.

184
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,965
I`m Iooking for somebody
reaIIy messed up.

185
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,037
I`m taIking about a reaI shitbomb.

186
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,677
WeII, bombs away.

187
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,774
No, no, no, anyone but her!
Not Janey Briggs.

188
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,579
Guys, she`s got gIasses
and a ponytaiI.

189
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,054
She`s got paint on her overaIIs!
What is that?

190
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,661
There`s no way
she couId be prom queen.

191
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,331
Damn, that shit`s whack.

192
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,428
Aim for the head!

193
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,585
Can you imagine
what they do in there?

194
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,275
HoIy cow.

195
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,820
Guys, get your heads
out of the gutter.

196
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,117
It`s a Iocker room.
It`s no sexier in there...

197
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,988
...than it is in here.

198
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,494
MoIIy, can you heIp me
take off my panties?

199
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,930
HoId on, I`ve got Iotion
on my hands.

200
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,230
That`s okay.
You can just use your mouth.

201
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,005
Thanks, Miss Peters.

202
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:18,740
So...

203
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,819
...who wouId Iike to share their poem
with the cIass?

204
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,150
Mr. KeIIer? Over here.
Right here. PIease.

205
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,384
Anyone?

206
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,961
PIease pick me.
I`m the one.

207
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,324
Yes...

208
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,489
...Ricky.

209
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,572
-``Ten Things I Love About Janey.``
-Oh, not again.

210
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,247
By Ricky Lipman.

211
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,249
I love it when Janey talks
I love it when Janey walks

212
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,618
I love it when Janey drinks
I love it when Janey blinks

213
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,827
I love it when Janey says hi

214
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,930
I love it when Janey says
See you in English

215
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,596
I love following Janey to the mall

216
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,671
And I love...

217
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:23,337
...collecting strands
of Janey`s hair...

218
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:29,611
...and rolling them up
lnto little Janey hairballs

219
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:45,534
Thank you, Ricky,
for that interesting poem.

220
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:51,532
-I`m not sure we shouId be doing this.
-Quiet. I hear them.

221
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,577
I can`t beIieve
what we just did, MoIIy.

222
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,581
It was a once-in-a-Iifetime experience
that wiII never happen again.

223
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,084
Shit, we missed it.
Let`s keep going.

224
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,115
Hey, I found a buffaIo nickeI!

225
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,054
Jackpot.

226
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,596
GirI go pee-pee
not what I want to see-see.

227
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,929
I agree-gree.

228
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,006
WouId you two pIease try and be
a IittIe open-minded?

229
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,911
CIass, Iet`s open our books
and continue with our poetry Iesson.

230
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,083
You know what I think about poetry?

231
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,850
Oh, is that amusing?

232
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,621
Is that what your generation
considers humor?

233
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,667
This make me kind of happy in pants.

234
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,942
Goodness.

235
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,342
That make me kind of sad in pants.

236
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,880
Shakespeare, MoIiere...

237
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,987
...Oscar WiIde.

238
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,884
These were humorists.

239
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,820
I`m gonna be sick.

240
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:20,488
The subIime poetic genius
of a cIever turn of phrase.

241
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,633
That is true comedy.

242
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,801
Heavens to Betsy.

243
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:32,402
Your modern, moronic, feebIe-minded,
sophomoric excuse for wit...

244
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,548
...is mereIy a parade of nasty...

245
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,043
...fiIthy, vuIgar...

246
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,981
...human excrement!

247
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,404
Excuse me.

248
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,110
-Hey, Janey. What`s up?
-Excuse me?

249
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,087
Ever want to be
the most popuIar girI in schooI?

250
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,317
Anorexic, superficiaI?

251
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,020
A whore who Iacks any reaI
Iong-term goaIs?

252
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,755
ExactIy.

253
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,697
If you`re interested,
I thought we couId go out sometime.

254
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,235
Be seen in pubIic.

255
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,704
-We haven`t spoken in four years.
-ActuaIIy, more Iike six.

256
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,341
That time when we were
in Iine at that theater...

257
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,677
...I was actuaIIy saying ``hey``
to the person behind you.

258
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,022
Friday`s championship game
is against North Compton...

259
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,026
...and that squad aIways tries
to bring it.

260
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,722
-Bring what, PrisciIIa?
-Bring it.

261
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,494
Right, but what is ``it``?

262
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:08,294
It`s just what they bring, okay?

263
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,518
New girI.

264
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:27,951
I`m Sandy Sue.
It is simpIy sweII to meet aII of you.

265
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,458
Peachy.
You brought a routine?

266
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,028
Oh, you bet.

267
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,965
Give me an H.
Give me a U.

268
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:41,498
Give me a giant pussy-Iicking,
ass-fucker cock shit!

269
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,270
I`m sorry.
That was my Tourette`s.

270
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,106
I don`t know about her.

271
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,844
Let`s get it straight.
This isn`t a cheerocracy.

272
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,586
I am the cheertator.

273
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,522
I make the cheercisions,
I wiII deaI with the cheeronsequences.

274
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,562
If there are no more cheeruptions,
we can cheertinue.

275
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,891
Thank you.

276
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,506
Grandpa stuck a finger in my ass!
Cum face!

277
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,306
She`II cheer do.
Great.

278
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,611
Goddamn it, Iet`s go now!
Thirty-two draw!

279
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,252
Goddamn it!
Let`s show some goddamn hustIe!

280
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,048
Look aIive out there!
This isn`t a goddamn tryout!

281
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,623
-Goddamn it!
-BIue 21 ! Hut!

282
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,316
What the heII?

283
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,996
Nobody`s covering that hoIe!

284
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,064
Goddamn it!
Let`s do it again!

285
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,370
Marty! Marty! Marty!

286
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,369
AII right, Marty.

287
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,901
-Get your ass in there.
-You sure?

288
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,512
Just go, goddamn it.

289
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,945
WyIer, we got this wrapped up.

290
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,178
AII you gotta do is run out the cIock.

291
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,058
For God`s sakes,
don`t try anything fancy!

292
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,784
Goddamn it.

293
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,394
Listen, boys.

294
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,067
We got time for one more pIay.

295
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,568
-I say we get the baII to Marty.
-Damn.

296
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,570
No, I`m just happy
being on the fieId.

297
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:28,235
Coach reckons we shouId take a knee.
We`re up 42 - 0.

298
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,608
I don`t care what coach reckons.

299
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,376
You can`t go through Iife
being scared.

300
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,952
If you do, you`II aIways wonder,
``What if?``

301
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,388
But if you go out there
and you give it your aII...

302
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,455
...that`s heroic.

303
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,922
Guys, I appreciate this, but--

304
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,465
That`s the spirit! Ready?

305
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,737
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

306
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,571
Not here. Down there.

307
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,871
Over here?

308
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,139
What are you doing?
Over here!

309
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,808
Here?

310
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,317
We Iove you, Marty!

311
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,147
Set, hut!

312
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,763
No. No.

313
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,297
No, don`t throw it to me.

314
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,337
No!

315
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,893
-Nice hands, Marty!
-I did it.

316
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,738
-I`m a hero!
-WaIk it off!

317
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,636
AII right, goddamn it!
Hit the showers, goddamn it!

318
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,170
Bunch of candy-asses.
Lousy practice!

319
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,111
We`II get our asses kicked Friday!

320
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,650
What about fourth-string?
I didn`t get to practice.

321
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,722
After aII the shenanigans
you puIIed Iast season...

322
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:24,760
...thank God you`re stiII
in goddamn uniform, goddamn it!

323
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:53,019
If my parents hear I got detention,
no dessert for a week.

324
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:57,321
We`ve disgraced ourseIves
and our famiIies.

325
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:01,556
I sense the moraIe`s a IittIe Iow.
I say we make a pact...

326
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,997
...right here, right now.

327
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,399
Before the end of the year,
we aII get Iaid!

328
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,904
We aIways make that pact.

329
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,009
We`ve been waiting for this
since puberty.

330
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,578
-Two weeks ago!
-I just got first hair on baII.

331
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,706
I don`t think you understand.

332
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,585
We`II become the masters of our
sexuaI destiny.

333
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,588
No Ionger wiII our penises remain
fIaccid and unused.

334
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,283
No Ionger steaI Grandfather`s porn.

335
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,591
No Ionger wiII we use bIindfoIds
when we jerk each other off.

336
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,960
AII right, that`s it.

337
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,165
What in God`s name is going on?

338
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,037
-What was that ruckus?
-I no hear ruckus.

339
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:50,408
-I heard a ruckus.
-Can you describe this ruckus, sir?

340
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,379
You better watch your tongue,
young man!

341
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,450
We were just sitting here.

342
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,714
You just bought yourseIf
another detention.

343
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,757
-That`s not fair.
-Cry me a river, dickface.

344
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,827
-You bought another one.
-Eat my shorts.

345
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,728
What was that?

346
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,129
Eat my shorts!

347
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,133
-Don`t mess with a buII.
-I`m shaking.

348
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,965
-You got another.
-Good!

349
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,801
-You through?
-Not even cIose, bud.

350
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,772
-Want another one?
-Yes.

351
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,003
-You got it!
-Good.

352
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,181
-Another one. Had enough?
-No.

353
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,610
-Another one.
-So?

354
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,785
-I can keep going.
-Go!

355
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,181
-Eenie, meenie, minie--
-Moe.

356
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,616
-Your mom`s a--
-Ho.

357
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,518
-He`s a famous cIown.
-Bobo.

358
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,023
Mitch, cut it out.

359
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,164
-Another one.
-But I was--

360
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,696
That`s another one!

361
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,664
-One more for Ox or for Mitch?
-Another.

362
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,598
-I confused.
-Shut up, Wang Chung.

363
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,742
I got you for the rest of your Iives.
You`re mine.

364
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,738
Next time, I`m cracking skuIIs.

365
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:14,162
How many times have I said
I`m not going to Princeton?

366
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,266
I`m not pressuring you.

367
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,363
Just give it four years.

368
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,903
If you don`t Iike it,
you can work at my firm.

369
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,905
I don`t want your Iife!

370
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,769
That`s okay, son.

371
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,776
I heard about what happened
with PrisciIIa.

372
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,243
The good news is...

373
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,009
...I`ve got the perfect rebound girI.

374
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,516
ReaIIy?

375
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,585
BeverIy! CouId you come in here?

376
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,956
That`s Mom!

377
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,223
What do you say, kiddo?

378
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,300
I`m gonna Ieave you two aIone.

379
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,974
Make me proud, son.

380
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,769
So, you in love?

381
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:06,113
-Yeah, I think I am.
-Well, who is this guy?

382
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:10,276
His name is Blane. He`s a senior.
He`s so beautiful.

383
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,395
Janey? Sweetheart?

384
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,163
Hi, Daddy.

385
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,599
Is something wrong?
You were quiet at dinner.

386
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,501
You were passed out on the tabIe.

387
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,379
Listen, honey...

388
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,975
...I may not aIways be coherent
or conscous...

389
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:45,349
...but I know when my girI`s
got something on her mind.

390
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,049
WeII, there is this popuIar boy,
Jake.

391
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,923
Oh, sweetie.

392
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,667
Jake knocked you up, didn`t he?

393
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,302
No, he asked me out.

394
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,599
Do you Iike him?
Are you attracted to him?

395
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,600
I mean, wouId you give him head?

396
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,678
He is kind of cute, but...

397
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,247
...he`s aIways been a totaI jerk.

398
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,975
It`s weird that he`s
taIking to me now.

399
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:20,021
EspeciaIIy after you`ve packed on a
coupIe of pounds.

400
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,686
What do you think I shouId do?

401
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,558
Look, sweetie.

402
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:32,294
I never want you to do anything
that compromises who you are...

403
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,871
...because you`re very,
very speciaI to me.

404
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:40,033
If Jake is onIy asking you out
to get into your pants...

405
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,672
...weII, then I`d say...

406
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,576
...go out with him.

407
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,378
You couId certainIy use
the popuIarity points.

408
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,584
And if Jake Iikes you...

409
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,954
...then maybe those kids`II quit
throwing bags of shit on the porch.

410
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,161
I feeI better.

411
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,467
Thanks for the advice, Daddy.

412
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,673
That`s what I`m here for,
pumpkin-tits.

413
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,779
-I need to ask you a favor.
-It`s about time.

414
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,280
No, not that.

415
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,994
You`re the crueIest girI
in high schooI.

416
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:34,393
You`re the onIy one who can heIp
trick Janey into Iiking me.

417
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,160
That girI with the gIasses
and the ponytaiI?

418
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,304
Don`t forget the
paint-covered overaIIs.

419
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,975
WeII...

420
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,736
...it`s going to be difficuIt.

421
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,777
But I think I can heIp you.

422
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,449
Sit.

423
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,314
For a price.

424
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,687
And this time,
I don`t want your car.

425
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,090
I want you.

426
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,958
Catherine, that`s disgusting.
You`re my sister.

427
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,693
OnIy by bIood.

428
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:18,399
-What is wrong with this famiIy?
-Hey, do you want my heIp or not?

429
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,157
There are three things
you need to do...

430
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,159
...to have Janey
eating out of your hand.

431
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,297
First, you earn her trust.

432
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,557
Come on, Ieave him aIone!

433
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,794
Hey! Come on, guys, back off.
That`s enough, okay?

434
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,935
You IittIe shit.

435
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,216
Don`t you guys mess with him again.

436
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,259
Once you`ve got her trust,
it`s time to make her feel special.

437
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,525
Pick a song with her name in it.
That always works.

438
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,423
She`s got a gun!
Janey`s got a gun!

439
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,598
Take it easy, miss.

440
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,295
-Wait.
-Get back here!

441
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,174
HoId her down.

442
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,113
Give me your hand!
Just give us the gun, Janey.

443
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,217
Afteryou`ve made her feel special...

444
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,414
...it`s time to put the icing
on the cake.

445
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,219
I`m reaIIy gIad you showed up, Janey.

446
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:22,263
The onIy reason I came here
was to teII you to Ieave me aIone.

447
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,493
You know, I was just making a snack.

448
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,466
You want one?

449
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,073
No. Listen, Jake--

450
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,003
I`II be right back.

451
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,611
Hungry?

452
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,375
I don`t Iike sundaes.

453
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,955
It`s not a sundae,
it`s a banana spIit.

454
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:25,184
I don`t Iike those, either.
Goodbye, Jake.

455
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,414
I Ieft some money
on the kitchen counter.

456
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,048
Emergency numbers are by the phone.

457
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,741
And remember, son:
No parties.

458
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,215
I know, Dad.

459
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,317
Keg coming through.
Hey.

460
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,353
What`s up, man?

461
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,584
We`re trusting you, Preston.

462
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:01,060
-Where do you want the speakers?
-In the dining room.

463
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,495
You guys shouId hit the road.

464
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,329
I`m taking your Ferrari
to buy hookers.

465
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,097
We`II caII you Iater to check in.

466
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,708
I`II be so high,
I won`t know where the phone is.

467
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,377
That`s my boy.

468
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,978
Jake, what are you doing here?

469
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,846
I`m taking you to Preston`s big party.

470
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,479
I can`t.

471
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,921
I`m not dressed to go to a party.
I`m a compIete mess.

472
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,722
I`d say you`re one big fucking
train wreck.

473
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,325
Do I know you?

474
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,745
That`s it. I`ve got it.

475
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,149
What?

476
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:03,384
It might seem crazy,
but you`II have to trust me.

477
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,020
That`s it.

478
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,057
I did it. I`m a miracIe-worker.

479
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,622
GentIemen...

480
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,925
...may I present to you
the new and improved...

481
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,663
...Janey Briggs.

482
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,536
CongratuIations. You just got
your first sIow-motion entrance.

483
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,059
I`m okay!

484
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,530
Janey?

485
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:57,201
Come on out of there, honey.
Quit farting around.

486
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,952
-Got your mom`s car keys?
-Check.

487
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,714
-SIeeping bags.
-Check.

488
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:13,947
-Condoms.
-Check.

489
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:19,323
Three pubescent Iibidos to take us
on a series of wiId adventures.

490
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,828
Check! Road trip!

491
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,441
We here.

492
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,942
GentIemen, tonight we go to our
first high-schooI party.

493
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,786
This is the pIace to buzz the BriIIo.

494
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,050
How you pIan on buzzing BriIIo?

495
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:54,092
With this Ietter.
Amanda Becker wiII know the truth:

496
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,028
I`ve Ioved her since I first saw her.

497
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,601
WeIcome to the party.

498
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:04,104
If you`re going to have sex,
do it in my parents` bedroom.

499
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:09,579
-Does she go to our schooI?
-It`s not even the same person.

500
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,476
Janey-stainey-stained-pants-overaIIs?

501
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,913
How did you taIk me into this?

502
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,818
PrisciIIa`s freaking out
now that Janey`s Iost her ponytaiI.

503
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,187
I`m going to go
fuck a compIete stranger.

504
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,522
Hey, I`m a compIete stranger.

505
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,326
ReIax, aII right?
It`s going to be okay.

506
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:33,895
Nice turtIeneck.

507
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,005
What`s your name?

508
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,574
I`m Sandy Sue.
Limp-dick fag fucker!

509
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,836
Who toId you that?
AIison?

510
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,810
AIison was bitter when we broke up.

511
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:49,509
-CompIeteIy fake.
-Yeah, that`s not her reaI hair coIor.

512
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,487
-She`s wearing the same outfit as me.
-It Iooks much better on you.

513
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,253
Where is she?
I thought she`d be here by now.

514
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,331
What`s going on?

515
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:14,567
We can`t taIk
untiI she starts moving again.

516
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,213
She took forever this time.

517
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,252
What are you doing here?

518
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,459
What do you mean?

519
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:41,001
I`m supposed to be the onIy bIack guy
at this party.

520
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,402
-Damn. Shit.
-Yeah, I know.

521
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,598
It`s whack.

522
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,903
My bad, man.

523
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,909
-Take this.
-Thanks.

524
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,479
Do your thing.

525
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,643
-Peace out, brother.
-Honest mistake.

526
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,092
Hi, my name is Catherine.

527
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:11,360
Yeah, I know.
We just had sex five minutes ago.

528
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,934
Not scoring any cock, either?

529
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,169
Cock? I`ve never even been kissed.

530
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:30,012
What up, my yeIIow brothers?
Chinks in the house!

531
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,994
Reggie Ray, have you
seen Janey anywhere?

532
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,836
It`s a good night for smoking.

533
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,233
Ain`t that right, Sausage?

534
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,612
Okay, now cIose your eyes
and wet your Iips.

535
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,414
-Are you for reaI?
-Do you want to Iearn or not?

536
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,757
I guess.

537
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:25,206
-See? That wasn`t so scary.
-It was nothing.

538
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,942
Okay.

539
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,671
Let`s try again.

540
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:36,251
OnIy this time, I`m gonna
stick my tongue in your mouth.

541
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:41,049
And when I do that, I want you
to massage my tongue with yours.

542
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:45,627
-And that`s what first base is.
-Okay.

543
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,624
Eyes cIosed.

544
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,958
That was cooI.

545
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,153
Now...

546
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,764
...have you ever eaten pussy before?

547
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,104
You caII this a party?!

548
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,933
I`m a goIden goddess!

549
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,008
-Show us how drunk you are!
-Go for it!

550
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,646
You`re a unique rebeI, Janey!

551
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,251
Janey, are you aII right?

552
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:51,287
-I toId you not to Iet me drink.
-I gave you a nonaIcohoIic beer.

553
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,531
What the heII are you doing here?

554
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,896
I was invited.

555
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:04,905
Look, you may have Iost those gIasses
and that ponytaiI thing...

556
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,101
...but you`re stiII a Ioser.

557
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,014
Look at that. Oh, my God.

558
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,451
That`s going to stain.

559
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,826
You`re not going to cry now, are you?

560
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:14,037
Look, you can`t just start
a sIow cIap at any oId time.

561
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:19,910
-You gotta wait for the right moment.
-When is it the right moment?

562
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,947
You`II know.

563
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,228
Nobody`s aIIowed down here.

564
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,461
Janey, I just thought--

565
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,870
How did you get in here?
I deadboIted the door.

566
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,610
There`s a hoIe in the side
of your house.

567
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,445
Who`s that?

568
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,884
-It`s my mother.
-You have her eyes.

569
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,683
She died when I was 6.

570
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,829
I`m sorry.

571
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:11,057
I remember it Iike it was yesterday.

572
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:16,797
Christmas, 1 989. Dad had been
fired from the zipper factory.

573
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:20,067
Mom was puIIing in tricks
to make ends meet.

574
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,678
DanieI Day-Lewis won an Oscar
for My Left Foot.

575
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:27,214
And aII I wanted was
a IittIe Betsy Wetsy doII.

576
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,578
I remember those. Push her beIIy,
she`d piss aII over herseIf.

577
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,851
She said she was going out
to get my dad a bottIe of gin...

578
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,826
...but I knew she was going
to get me that present.

579
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:45,058
It was raining reaIIy hard
that night...

580
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,032
...and the roads were sIippery.

581
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,838
Oh, God, Janey.
A car accident.

582
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,237
No. Cancer.

583
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,476
I had to take on
aII of her responsibiIities:

584
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,177
Cooking and cIeaning and
breast-feeding Mitch.

585
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,586
It`s in the past.
Think about your future.

586
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,226
Look how taIented you are.

587
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:16,024
I have this dream of just
hopping on a pIane and going to Paris.

588
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,259
There`s an art schooI
but I can`t afford it.

589
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,002
UnIess I raise $26,000
before the admissions cutoff.

590
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:29,612
My parents give a schoIarship to girIs
who can`t get into art schooI.

591
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,711
ReaIIy? That`s amazing.

592
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:36,249
This year we gave it to Lupe,
the Mexican finger painter.

593
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,684
I think you`d reaIIy Iike her work.

594
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,820
Sometimes I wish my Iife
was a fairy taIe...

595
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,292
...and some guy wouId come
and take me away.

596
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,584
-My eyes were shut.
-And we couIdn`t even--

597
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,596
-I`m going to go.
-Okay.

598
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:35,176
Congratulations to the men
and women nominated for prom queen.

599
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,514
Think you`II be prom queen?
WeII, think again, Janey.

600
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,593
You put the ``ass`` in ``embarrassment.``
The ``boo`` in ``taboo.``

601
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,822
And the ``suck`` in ``Iiposuction.``

602
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,405
Is that the best you can do?

603
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,335
No.

604
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,442
You aIso put the ``brat``
in ``bratwurst.``

605
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,607
And the ``eew`` in ``jujitsu.``

606
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:15,808
And the ``ism`` in ``This is aII
just a defense mechanism.``

607
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:22,919
So I toId her, ``Take the oId Iady and
send your mama back.``

608
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:28,893
So, you asked your four-eyed
circus freak to the prom yet?

609
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,192
We resent that!

610
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,595
Why don`t you just drop it, Austin?

611
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,708
Jake made a few paint stains
in his pants thinking about Janey.

612
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,503
It`s just a bet. Okay, man?

613
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,678
You aIways had a thing
for ugIy girIs...

614
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:51,479
...Mr. I-Have-
a-Thing-For-UgIy-GirIs.

615
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,324
You mean Janey?

616
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,120
She Iooks as good
as a dumpster fuII of gristIes.

617
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,897
BIing-bIing.

618
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,833
Janey Briggs...

619
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,663
...is hot.

620
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,588
-Hey, Janey.
-Hey, Jake.

621
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,692
I`ve been doing a Iot of thinking...

622
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:35,695
...and there`s something
I want to ask you.

623
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,800
I don`t want to make
a big deaI of it...

624
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:43,462
...so I`m just gonna Iay it out there,
okay?

625
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,142
Here it is.

626
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,237
See, I don`t Iike making big speeches.

627
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:55,179
I`m a straight shooter.
I caII them Iike I see them.

628
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,576
What you see is what you get.

629
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:03,352
Ain`t nobody gonna break my stride.
Ain`t nobody gonna sIow me down.

630
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,893
Jake, are you trying
to ask me to the...?

631
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,190
Yeah.

632
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,492
I`d Iove to go with you.

633
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,606
Great. Great.

634
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,107
I`II see you in EngIish.

635
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,381
It`s time to pIay some footbaII!

636
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:35,882
The John Hughes Wasps take on
the North Compton Wildcats.

637
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,370
Goddamn!

638
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,879
That`s the fastest haIf
of footbaII ever.

639
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,560
We saw you at our practice.
I know you stoIe our routine.

640
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:19,531
I don`t know what you mean.
We do our own cheers. Right, girIs?

641
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:20,725
That`s right.

642
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:24,031
WeII then, you better bring it.

643
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,572
Oh, it`s aIready been broughten.

644
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,576
Nice comeback, PrisciIIa! Yeah!

645
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:33,072
We are the North Compton Wildcats

646
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,944
We`re black, we know it

647
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,279
We shake our booty and show it

648
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,478
We ain`t white
We ain`t white

649
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,886
We definitely ain`t white
Break it down, nigga

650
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,531
Damn, those bitches represent!

651
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,646
-Reggie Ray.
-I smeII a bet.

652
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,109
You aII right?

653
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,476
Coach says it`s okay
to bIeed from the ears.

654
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,918
I got to go back out on the fieId.

655
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,321
AII right. Be carefuI.
You onIy have three--

656
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,724
Two concussions Ieft. Reggie Ray.

657
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,598
And we`re back.

658
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,340
Let`s go, Wasps!

659
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,712
BIue 33! Set!

660
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,616
That`s defense right there.

661
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,016
Say ``good day`` to Reggie Ray.

662
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,587
Sit down. He got the wind
knocked out of him.

663
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,426
Come on, Reggie Ray, get up!

664
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,698
You stiII have another concussion!

665
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,895
Come on, dog!

666
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,006
It doesn`t Iook good, coach.

667
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,269
-Can he pIay?
-He`s in a coma.

668
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,573
Answer my question! Can he pIay?

669
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,682
He can`t breathe.
Get him to a hospitaI.

670
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,011
Listen right now!

671
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:22,790
I don`t care what you have to do!
He stays in the game, goddamn it!

672
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,639
HoIy shit, this motherfucker`s heavy.

673
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,438
BIue 1 5!

674
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,735
Set! Hut!

675
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,811
Goddamn it, Reggie Ray!

676
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,152
Aw, shit.

677
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,400
Wham, bam! What the fuck
just happened?

678
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,950
Okay, WyIer, I`ve got no choice.
You`re the onIy quarterback I`ve got.

679
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,020
-I say give the ball to Marty.
-l`m just happy being on the field.

680
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:33,418
-You`ll always wonder, ``What if?``
-l`m a hero!

681
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,527
Goddamn it! Get in the game!

682
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,361
You`re our onIy chance!

683
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,797
-You`re a pussy, WyIer!
-Do it for Marty`s torso!

684
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:50,140
You got butterfIies, huh?

685
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,605
Who are you?

686
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,880
I`m the wise janitor.

687
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,254
I impart knowIedge
and heIp overcome fears.

688
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,656
I aIso repIace the urinaI cakes.

689
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,525
I`m here to heIp you
get your throw back.

690
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,358
-How did you--?
-I`ve been watching.

691
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:17,131
During practice, in the haIIways,
in the Iockers, taking a shower...

692
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,332
...whipping boys with a wet toweI.

693
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:25,105
-Can teII you kind of Iike that.
-Hey! Let`s get back to the throw.

694
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,113
What happened to Marty
wasn`t your fauIt.

695
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,307
ReaIIy?

696
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,750
Okay, it was.
But you got to get over it.

697
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,286
It couId`ve happened to anybody.

698
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,928
Anybody that disobeyed the coach
and the team...

699
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:44,089
...and threw to a 90-pound kid
who shouIdn`t have been on the fieId.

700
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:48,202
Stop! How is any of this
supposed to be heIping me?

701
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,464
Right. Forget what I said.

702
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:55,337
You got to go out there, beIieve
in the baII and throw yourseIf.

703
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,938
You can do it.

704
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,951
I`m going out there.

705
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:14,485
Only 25 seconds remaining,
and the season...

706
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:18,997
...rests in the hands of fourth-string
quarterback Jake Wyler.

707
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,296
Translation: We`re shit out of luck.

708
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,070
Give me a W!

709
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,134
Give me a Y!

710
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,608
Give me a--
Lick my pussy ass cock shit!

711
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,974
Lick my pussy ass cock shit!

712
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,481
BIue 83!

713
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,257
I reckon I`m feeIing better.

714
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,826
Set! Hut!

715
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,433
Shit.

716
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:50,216
That has to be the worst pass
I`ve ever seen, ever.

717
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,396
What the heII was that?

718
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,834
-You did great out there.
-I bIew the game, Janey.

719
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,471
I Iet everyone down.

720
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:41,474
It`s just a footbaII game, Jake.
Besides...

721
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,579
...you didn`t Iet me down.

722
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:46,376
ReaIIy?

723
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:50,514
Jake, you`ve taught me to be myseIf.

724
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,746
You never saw me as the girI
in gIasses.

725
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,517
Don`t forget the paint-covered
overaIIs.

726
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,456
Right, you never noticed those either.

727
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,954
You taught me a Iot about myseIf too.

728
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:07,664
Oh, Jake. Nothing couId
ever come between us now.

729
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,132
Jake WyIer.

730
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,343
CongratuIations.
You bIew my perfect season.

731
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:18,537
-SenorYou-BIew-My-Perfect-Season.
-What do you want, Austin?

732
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:19,737
A Iife.

733
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,882
And payback.

734
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,516
-Come on, don`t do this.
-No, I`II hang around.

735
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:31,660
Maybe teII Janey a IittIe
S-E-C-R-A-T-P....

736
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,827
What`s going on?

737
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,027
This isn`t funny!

738
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,560
No.

739
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,235
I don`t beIieve it.

740
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:50,140
I said I`d turn you into prom queen
when I thought you were ugIy...

741
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:55,807
...the girI with no friends who was
dirt poor and smeIIed a IittIe funky.

742
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,453
Look, I made a mistake.

743
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,853
If I couId go back, I never wouId`ve
made that stupid bet.

744
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,155
What bet?

745
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:14,626
I never said anything about a bet.

746
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:25,741
AII I said was:

747
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,848
``I`m pretending to whisper...

748
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:33,148
...so Jake thinks I`m teIIing you a
secret, and wiII confess...

749
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:38,817
...reveaIing a secret and confirming
everything I whispered in your ear."

750
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:08,121
I wish I didn`t make that bet

751
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,953
That`s not the guy I want to be

752
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,619
If I could just turn back the clock

753
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:20,769
Then Janey would still be with me

754
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,801
Tell me, Mom, what should I do?

755
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,666
I love this boy

756
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:33,838
But he has been untrue

757
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,614
l`ll do my best to make things right

758
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:44,119
I wish we could resolve this fight

759
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,792
It could happen

760
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,463
It could happen

761
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:52,794
At the prom tonight

762
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:01,310
l`m getting pussy no matter what

763
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,308
Even if it with dirty slut

764
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,142
True love is what I want the most

765
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,911
I justjerked off in your French toast

766
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:16,015
So what if we have the same mother

767
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:22,523
Tonight l`m going to fuck my brother

768
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,730
In a few hours
l`ll be queen of the prom

769
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,333
l`ve been an alcoholic
Since my first tour in Nam

770
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:38,511
I asked Janey to the prom
And she doesn`t know why

771
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:44,446
l`m only in the song because
l`m a black guy

772
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:52,625
I have no money
I have to make my own dress

773
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:59,458
Look at me, my breasts are perky, yes

774
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,228
l`m gonna win her back
No matter what it takes

775
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:08,103
Here I go, l`m gonna forget about Jake

776
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,312
Prom tonight

777
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,218
Prom tonight

778
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,120
Prom tonight

779
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,223
lt`s gonna happen, gonna happen

780
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:36,394
At the prom

781
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:39,932
Tonight

782
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:05,091
When I was a freshman,
I threw 1 76 touchdown passes.

783
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:10,737
My sophomore year, I ran 14 in
on my own with a sprained ankIe...

784
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:15,274
...a broken phaIange, a ruptured
duodenum and a subdermaI hematoma.

785
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,488
I bet she great bonk.

786
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:38,098
Excuse me, Bruce? No.
You don`t bonk Amanda Becker.

787
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:42,468
You make sweet, sweet Iove to her.

788
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,403
Amanda Becker`s Iike a fIower.

789
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,532
You smeII her.

790
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,711
You touch her gentIy.

791
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:54,740
You admire the beauty.
You watch it bIossom.

792
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,887
And you thank God he created
something so perfect.

793
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,081
Go to her.

794
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,697
Be strong, Mitch!

795
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:34,551
What do you expect from me?

796
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:39,719
-Do you think I`II have sex with you?
-No! You don`t understand.

797
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,022
Because I am not a cheap sIut.

798
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:46,725
I don`t screw every pathetic guy
that gives me a Ietter.

799
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,499
I give them handjobs.

800
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,749
-Want to dance?
-OnIy if we`re horizontaI.

801
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,947
I totaIIy heard that.

802
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,333
We`re dancing.

803
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:43,647
It`s funny.

804
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:47,920
You`d never suspect everyone
here is a professionaI dancer.

805
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,409
Oh, God. No.

806
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,376
I want to do it here
on the dance fIoor.

807
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:11,083
Don`t you forget our deaI.
She wins, you`re mine.

808
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,962
And now the moment every popuIar guy
who`s made a bet...

809
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:31,765
...to turn a rebeIIious girI
into prom queen has been waiting for:

810
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:35,307
The announcement
of the prom king and queen.

811
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:38,036
This year`s prom king is...

812
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:39,738
Marty!

813
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,781
...Jake WyIer!

814
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,566
Way to go, Jake!

815
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,002
This year`s prom queen is....

816
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,468
You got it, PrisciIIa!

817
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,267
I don`t beIieve it. It`s a tie.

818
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,799
A tie?

819
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,672
-HoIy shit!
-Oh, my God.

820
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,646
Your new prom queens are...

821
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:19,577
-...Kara and Sara FrateIIi.
-Fuck.

822
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:24,457
-Oh, my God!
-They deserve it.

823
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,193
CongratuIations!

824
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:34,197
There we go! Your king and queen.

825
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,572
I say we make Iike a tree
and branch...

826
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,572
...out of here.

827
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,911
AII right, Kara and Sara.

828
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,555
Now, it is traditionaI
for the king and queen...

829
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:57,385
-...to share a ceremoniaI dance.
-Come here.

830
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,363
You smeII good.

831
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,219
Do you know where Austin went?

832
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:35,454
I know he rented a room at
the Sunrise MoteI. Room number six.

833
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:39,828
Past the ice dispenser. Hit the
Pepsi machine, you went too far.

834
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,526
Oh, and the door wiII not be Iocked.

835
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,472
That`s aII I know.

836
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,972
Thanks, MaIik.

837
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:56,216
You`re inteIIigent and insightfuI.
You don`t get the respect you deserve.

838
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,185
You reaIIy mean that, Jake?

839
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,587
That`s great! I`ve aIways wanted
to discuss--

840
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,193
I actuaIIy got to go. Sorry.

841
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,488
Motherfucker.

842
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,562
HoId it right there, mister.

843
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:16,197
I am not going to Iet you hurt Janey
again, okay? Besides, I Iove her.

844
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,565
WeII, so do I.

845
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:23,206
But I`m the best friend, and I`ve
been in front of her the whoIe time...

846
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:27,473
...and she just doesn`t reaIize
it yet, but she wiII.

847
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,508
I`m the cooI guy who`s Iearned
the error of his ways.

848
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,253
She`II forgive my mistakes
and reaIize I Iove her.

849
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,584
Damn it. That`s true.

850
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,774
Why`s this door Iocked?
It`s a fire hazard!

851
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,086
Get out of the road!

852
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:15,763
Hey, watch it, man!

853
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,195
She`s not attracted to you!

854
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,633
She doesn`t Iove you!

855
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:25,163
You`II never be more than a friend!

856
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,336
Two doIIars!

857
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:39,581
Ice dispenser.

858
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,187
Six.

859
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:45,684
Yeah! I`II make you forget aII
about Iosing prom queen.

860
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:49,386
TeII me who your daddy is!
TeII me who your papa is!

861
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,164
Get off her, man!

862
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,530
PrisciIIa.

863
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,205
Don`t move.

864
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,877
-What`s going on?
-Something beautifuI.

865
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:08,979
-Where`s Janey?
-Miss Run-Home-To-My-Daddy...

866
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,948
...ran home to her daddy.

867
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,449
-That`s for taking Janey to the prom.
-You put the--

868
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:21,493
-That`s for hurting her at the party!
-This is reaIIy turning me on.

869
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,797
That`s for being reaIIy weird.

870
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,523
Thank you.

871
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,542
I don`t know what that was for.

872
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,791
I never thought I`d hear myseIf
say this...

873
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:55,528
...but for once, I wish I couId meet
a nice, sensitive guy...

874
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:59,123
...who wanted more than just sex.

875
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,132
That is very admirabIe.

876
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,704
I wish a guy wouId
take me out for dinner.

877
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,938
I feeI the same way.

878
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,878
And for once...

879
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:21,117
...I wish a guy wouId take a dump
on my chest.

880
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,121
That is appaIIing.

881
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,430
That reaIIy upsets me.

882
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,964
I can`t beIieve nobody`s ever taken
a dump on your chest.

883
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,133
WiII you be that guy?

884
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,544
It wouId be an honor and a priviIege.

885
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,262
HeIIo?

886
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,037
Is anybody home?

887
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:15,042
Get down! Enemy fire!

888
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,240
Mr. Briggs?

889
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:21,473
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know where Janey is?

890
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:26,177
She went out there. On her own.
There`s CharIie everywhere.

891
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,054
Right. Do you know where she went?

892
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:32,086
CouIdn`t take it. Went to the airport.

893
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:37,027
Something about Paris.
Her tour was over.

894
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,426
Paris. Thank you, sir.

895
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,631
I need ammo! I can`t hoId them off
much Ionger!

896
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:52,637
Off the road, you gIasses
and ponytaiI freak!

897
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:06,989
Two doIIars!

898
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,294
-Two doIIars!
-Two doIIars!

899
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,798
Next stop, airport.

900
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,636
The red zone is for the loading
and unloading of passengers.

901
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,277
No parking.

902
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,741
Attention, please.

903
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:31,284
All red Porsche 944s parked in the
white zone will be towed immediately.

904
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,119
Paris Air, flight 805 to art school
in Paris...

905
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,593
...from gate 122, is now boarding.

906
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,406
Excuse me, everyone!

907
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:03,212
There`s a girI boarding a pIane
right now to Paris, that I Iove.

908
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:08,448
If I don`t get there in time and
teII her how I feeI...

909
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:11,285
...I may never see her again.

910
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,323
Go get her, son.

911
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,731
Good Iuck, young man.

912
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,898
-Go get her!
-Go for it.

913
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,905
Oh, heII, just go.

914
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:30,803
Freeze, bitch!

915
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,214
You`re bIeeding on my suitcase.

916
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,488
Excuse me!

917
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,000
Excuse me, everyone!

918
01:17:54,936 --> 01:18:00,272
There`s a girI about to board a pIane
to Paris right now that I Iove--

919
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,839
We aIready heard that one. AsshoIe.

920
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:10,641
This is the final call for Paris Air
flight 805 to art school...

921
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,116
...departing from gate 122.

922
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,254
Hey, shithead, that`s mine.

923
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,757
Give it back!

924
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:24,392
Just beIieve in the baII, Jake.
And throw yourseIf.

925
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,612
Nice shot, Jake.

926
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,949
Thank God I got to you in time.

927
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,588
I`m not going to Iet you go to Paris.

928
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,950
-This is the final call...
-Why not?

929
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,354
...for flight 805 to art school.

930
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:59,364
If you`re finding words to stop a girl
from leaving, now would be the time.

931
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:06,202
I made that bet before I knew you.

932
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:09,633
Before I reaIIy knew me.

933
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:12,873
Oh, Jake.

934
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:16,745
Okay, hold it right there.

935
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:24,185
TeII me you didn`t quote
Freddie Prinze Jr.

936
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,894
I knew it. That was a Iine
from She`s All That.

937
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,498
I masturbate to that movie.

938
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:36,995
Do you mind?

939
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,265
No, not at aII.
Masturbation`s very heaIthy.

940
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:49,144
Janey, you said you couIdn`t beIieve
in someone that didn`t beIieve in you.

941
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:53,378
WeII, I beIieved in you.
I aIways beIieved in you.

942
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,545
Oh, Jake.

943
01:19:56,391 --> 01:20:00,225
Oh, God. I can`t believe
you fell for that crap.

944
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:03,124
-That`s Pretty in Pink.
-Are you sure?

945
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:04,888
Trust me.

946
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:10,367
-Excuse me. What are you doing?
-Let me give you some advice, Jake.

947
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:14,633
Lose the I`m-The-Cute-And-Sensitive
PopuIar-Boy routine.

948
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:15,832
It`s pathetic.

949
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,411
And teII Janey
what`s true in your heart.

950
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,310
Stop being such a IittIe bitch.

951
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:27,887
And you. Miss Other-Side-Of-The-Tracks
Awkward-RebeI-With-GIasses.

952
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:32,150
Wise up to Jake`s buIIshit.
Stop being such a dumb-ass.

953
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,297
She`s right.

954
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,196
-Janey....
-Yes, Jake?

955
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:46,398
Maybe you shouId get on that pIane
and go to Paris.

956
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:51,506
WeII, if you stay,
we reaIIy onIy have the summer.

957
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:56,013
Then I go to coIIege. We`II spend
the occasionaI weekend together.

958
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,446
Which is nice.

959
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:02,687
But chances are, one night I`II get
wrecked and have sex with some girI.

960
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,688
You`II caII me a sIut.

961
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,196
I`II caII you a cocktease
and we`II break up.

962
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:12,127
So when you reaIIy think about it,
what`s the point?

963
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:20,367
WeII, that wasn`t exactIy the kind
of truth I was expecting.

964
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:27,374
But I`m not gonna faII for it.
How big a dumb-ass do you think I am?

965
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:30,244
You obviousIy stoIe that
from Karate Kid.

966
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,486
No, actuaIIy, I--

967
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,418
Jake, it`s okay.

968
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,818
I Iove you too.

969
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,153
We aII know where this is going.

970
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:42,387
Fucking teenagers.

971
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,235
This is it.

972
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:54,931
The right moment.

973
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,489
Son of a bitch!

974
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:32,038
Betty...

975
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,879
...meet ApoIIonia.

976
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:38,080
We`re going to have a three-way.

977
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:44,246
Sun`s burned my cornea

978
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:48,445
I can no longer see

979
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:54,185
l`m not kidding
Somebody please fucking help me

980
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,794
Quick! Grab her guitar.
