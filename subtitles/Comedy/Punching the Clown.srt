1
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,382
Hey, you guys,
you can't play in there. Jack.

2
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:04,258
It's dangerous.
There's nails and stuff!

3
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,511
Should've dumped them
all off at Chuck E. Cheese.

4
00:01:06,677 --> 00:01:08,888
That place
is a nightmare.

5
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,182
I hate clowns.

6
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,059
Yeah, well, it's what
he wanted. He's seven.

7
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:16,269
When I was seven,
I thought clowns were creepy.

8
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:18,980
Well, you can tell that to
the clown when he gets here.

9
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,232
OK. You need a drink.

10
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,109
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

11
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,195
Meg?

12
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:29,197
You're not?

13
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:31,366
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,369
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,329
You can't say
anything to Kent, OK?

16
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,580
- It's a total surprise.
- Huh?

17
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,582
- What surprise?
- Hey, Dad.

18
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:42,793
He is...he is coming, isn't he?

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,920
Yes. He's just
running a little late.

20
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:48,297
Just checking. Denise,
pour me a beer, will you?

21
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:51,384
Hello.

22
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,847
You're kidding.

23
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:02,310
Well... Is there
somebody else you could send?

24
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,479
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,814
Oh, no, it's no problem at all.

26
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:09,900
Oh, it's my pleasure. OK. 'Bye.

27
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,153
Ooh!

28
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:19,117
OK, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

29
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:23,371
Hey, honey.
I'm headed out the door.

30
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:26,290
- Is Jack excited?
- Yeah. Listen.

31
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:28,333
The Party Emporium
people screwed up

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,086
and...there's no clown coming.

33
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:32,963
I thought you had a backup.

34
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,131
Who double-books a clown?

35
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:37,216
Listen. Just hurry up
and get home, OK, babe?

36
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,803
- Kent?
- OK, listen.

37
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,097
It's... Everything's gonna be fine.
I'll be home soon.

38
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,059
Hello?

39
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,154
Hey, everybody!

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,296
Ohh!

41
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:25,343
Where's Daddy?
He's gonna miss the clown.

42
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:28,929
Listen.

43
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:31,097
Oh...

44
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:33,600
It seems like there was
a little bit of a kerfuffle, alright?

45
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,143
Ladies and gentlemen!

46
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,811
- May I have your attention?
- He's here!

47
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,646
Please gather around,
one and all,

48
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:44,109
for the wacky, the wonderful,
Dummo the Clown!

49
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,948
Let's get
this party started, huh?

50
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,661
Where's the number one
birthday boy?

51
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,578
Well, give it up for Jack!

52
00:03:56,745 --> 00:03:59,665
Let's make this
the best birthday ever!

53
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:25,062
OK, Jack.
I've gotta go back to the circus.

54
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,022
Time for bed.

55
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:31,235
Mmm... I know it's you, Dad.

56
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:35,405
No. My name is Dummo.

57
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:40,076
I hear your dad's
a pretty great guy, though.

58
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:45,038
Go, go, go, go.

59
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,717
Oh, God. I forgot I was a clown.

60
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:04,055
You were perfect. Jack loved it.

61
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,393
- Where did you find this thing?
- Ahh...

62
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,650
Where's the zipper?

63
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,819
Slipped right on.

64
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,946
- I have big news for you.
- Oh, yeah?

65
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,240
- Mm-hm.
- Didn't know it was MY birthday.

66
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,203
Ohh...

67
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,830
I...

68
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,457
Mm.

69
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,250
What?

70
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,586
This might be
just a little too weird.

71
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:43,549
Come on. Make a little...
make a little clown baby, huh?

72
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:46,469
Yeah... You watch TV.

73
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,470
I'm gonna go take
a shower first.

74
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,347
Don't...

75
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:52,641
You take that thing off,
I'll give you your present.

76
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:26,253
Shh!

77
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:38,431
Kent!

78
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,143
Better not be clown marks
on the couch, sweetie.

79
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,729
Yeah, still a clown!

80
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,649
What time is it?
I think this wig is stuck.

81
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,526
Yeah, you shouldn't
have slept in it, maybe.

82
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,236
Hey, guess what.
The clown is driving you to school today.

83
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:55,113
- Cool!
- Yeah, cool.

84
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,532
- No, wait. Honey, I have...
- Hurry. Jack's late for school.

85
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,784
I have a crew waiting.
I have to get changed...

86
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,576
'Bye. Love you.

87
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,620
Love you!

88
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,331
Hurry up and eat. Come on.

89
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,090
Dad, hurry!
I'm gonna be late!

90
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,134
Coming!

91
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,136
Ugh...

92
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,894
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

93
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,564
Jack, your lunch!

94
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:37,317
Jack! Your lunch!

95
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:43,239
Thanks, Dummo.

96
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,619
Great.

97
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,873
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

98
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,417
It's just tearing the carpet
out on the first floor.

99
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:57,918
Then we'll talk
about the hardwood.

100
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:02,923
- Who are you?
- I'm Kent, the realtor.

101
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,009
I talked to Miguel.
I'm sorry. Are you Miguel?

102
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:09,179
Why are you dressed
like a clown?

103
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,308
You guys have kids?

104
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,293
Ohh!

105
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,254
Arggh! Fuck!

106
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:49,840
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

107
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:54,928
Fu...

108
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,683
Ohh!

109
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,363
Oh, yes!

110
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,224
- Can I use this?
- What are you doing in there?

111
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:48,100
- Need some help?
- No, no, no, no,no.

112
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:52,271
I got it. It's...
it's looking great, by the way.

113
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,363
Ow.

114
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,032
Oh, this...

115
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,450
..this is a bad idea.

116
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,420
Arggh!

117
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:16,387
Oh, Dad.
What are you doing?!

118
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,640
I wanted to surprise Jack
with the swing set.

119
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,724
Oh, you scared the crap
out of me.

120
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,809
Well, I wanted
to surprise you too.

121
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:26,104
Dad, Kent was gonna do this.

122
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:29,815
Yeah, well,
I'm just trying to help.

123
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,692
Yeah, right. It's freezing.

124
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,737
- Let's go inside.
- I'm making dinner.

125
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,114
The damn instructions
are in Chinese.

126
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,207
Hey, babe!

127
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,668
You just missed Dad.

128
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,670
I thought we were
having family dinner,

129
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,546
but Jack just went down.

130
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,923
If you wanna run upstairs
you can probably say goodnight.

131
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:03,221
Shadow! Lie down.

132
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,851
You went to work
like that?

133
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:12,896
You don't understand.
I can't get it off.

134
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,814
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

135
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,733
I broke a hand saw.
I cut my wrist open.

136
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,195
And I really...I really,
really have to pee.

137
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,614
OK. OK, OK.
Kent, just calm down.

138
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:27,033
Sweetheart,
I physically cannot get it off.

139
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,952
I've been trying all day.

140
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,246
OK, so...so it's...it's stuck.

141
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,872
It's suffocating me.
I'm serious! This is...

142
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,125
- Alright.
- Ow. Ow.

143
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,210
It's not... It doesn't...
It's not gonna come off.

144
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,963
Why are you laughing at me?

145
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,841
So dumb. Now I know
why they call you Dummo.

146
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,222
Alright. Here we go.

147
00:12:56,852 --> 00:13:00,896
Relax, OK? This is what I do.

148
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,108
And if you're really good,
I'll get you a lollipop.

149
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

150
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,738
- One.
- Ow, ow.

151
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,530
- Two.
- Ow!

152
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:12,782
OK, OK. OK.

153
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,831
Alright.

154
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,877
Alright, I'm just gonna do this.

155
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:28,755
- Are you serious?
- Like a bandaid, OK?

156
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,924
- One.
- Oh! Ohh...

157
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:34,510
- Two.
- Ooh! Ooh!

158
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,222
Three! Three!

159
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,683
- Oh!
- Shadow! Bad dog!

160
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,645
Ohh! Ohh!

161
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:47,897
Sweetie, what did you
do to yourself?

162
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:52,359
Ohh!

163
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:57,030
- Did you dye your hair?
- It's a wig.

164
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,907
No, it's not.

165
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:02,285
Sweetie, did you
dye and perm your hair?

166
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:04,162
I didn't dye my hair!
What the f...

167
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,371
- Daddy?
- Oh, Jack.

168
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,582
Sweetie, let's get you to bed,
alright, honey?

169
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,751
What's Shadow eating?

170
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,753
Daddy's OK.

171
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,712
Ohh...

172
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:27,766
You're just gonna have to
let the adhesive dissolve.

173
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,602
You definitely don't want
to take any more skin off.

174
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,479
Just take some warm showers.

175
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,564
There wasn't any adhesive.
I'm not an idiot.

176
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,401
Maybe someone's
playing a prank on you.

177
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,695
Who would do that?

178
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:44,989
What happened to your wrist?

179
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:48,326
Oh, I, uh...I cut myself.

180
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:50,286
By accident.

181
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,205
Mr McCoy, if you need
to speak with someone,

182
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,332
we have counsellors
that can help you.

183
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:58,669
Funny. No.
You don't understand.

184
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:02,046
There is something going on.
This was a wig.

185
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:06,717
And the white make-up,
uh... It...

186
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,803
What kind of make-up
do you usually use?

187
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,012
I'm not a clown!

188
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:56,386
Come on, Jack. Brush your teeth!

189
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:09,315
Hey, Olive. It's Kent.
Can you do me a favour?

190
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:11,192
Can you check the property files

191
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:14,570
to see if the Oakdale place
lists the previous owner's name?

192
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:18,072
I think the initials are KC.

193
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,158
Uh, OK. Hold...

194
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:23,244
Let me... Give me a sec.
Let me see if I can find...

195
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,335
You know what?
I'll...I'll come in and get it.

196
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:57,566
Ohh...

197
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,652
- Hey, Olive.
- Hey, Kent.

198
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:09,202
Oh...

199
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,994
Oh!

200
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:15,749
Sorry! Oh...

201
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,635
Sonofabitch.

202
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,185
Still hungry?

203
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,562
Eugh, gross.

204
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:43,857
I don't know. It looks old.
It smells weird.

205
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:47,151
- Come on. Anything else? Please.
- I don't know, man.

206
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:51,322
We sell Halloween costumes
and cheap stuff, not like that.

207
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,199
OK, but who does?

208
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:56,994
There's, like, a lot.
They're in here.

209
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,334
That one.

210
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,228
Yeah.

211
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,772
I'm calling about
a clown costume

212
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,649
I think might belong to you.

213
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:33,359
It was found in
Martin Karlsson's basement.

214
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,194
Where's Marty?

215
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:39,073
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry. Uh...

216
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,117
Martin Karlsson passed away.

217
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,076
I'm the real estate agent
handling the...

218
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:47,372
Listen to me. Whatever
you do, don't touch that costume.

219
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,709
You understand?
Stay away from it.

220
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,710
Are you still at the house?

221
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:55,212
I'll be over
as soon as I can.

222
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:59,300
But don't touch
the costume, please.

223
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,594
I'm wearing it.

224
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,429
Hello?

225
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:07,140
Uh, that's fine.

226
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:09,893
Uh, be careful.
It's old and fragile.

227
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,685
It doesn't seem very fragile.

228
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,480
I'm actually having
a pretty hard time getting it off.

229
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:16,857
Don't worry.
That happens all the time.

230
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,734
The heat from your body

231
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,152
can constrict the moisture
trapped in those old fibres.

232
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,905
Makes it hard to get off.

233
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:26,908
Oh, that...that...that
makes perfect sense.

234
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,952
I thought I...
..I thought I was going crazy.

235
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,372
We should meet
as soon as possible.

236
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,499
Can you come to my warehouse?

237
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:39,585
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I can get there.

238
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:42,588
We'll have
that thing off in no time.

239
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,247
Hello?

240
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,591
Hello?

241
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,307
Is anyone here?

242
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:11,250
- Kent.
- Jesus Christ!

243
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,545
- Oh!
- I didn't want to scare you.

244
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:17,256
- I'm Bert Karlsson.
- Nice to meet you.

245
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,216
Tea?

246
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:20,508
Uh...

247
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:24,387
Mm! Thank you.

248
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:29,141
I've been abroad off and on
these last couple of years.

249
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:31,894
I haven't talked to Marty
for ages.

250
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:37,940
Our relationship was, yeah,
complicated.

251
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:41,569
I'm sorry I never met him.

252
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:46,157
That is a very old...
traditional costume

253
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,908
from the Nordic regions.

254
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:52,954
It wasn't until years later
it became a silly character.

255
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:57,416
The original clown,
he was not funny at all.

256
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,588
So, tell me, Mr Karlsson,

257
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:06,382
how are we gonna get
this thing off of me?

258
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:09,928
Very few people know
the true origin

259
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:12,931
of what we call the clown.

260
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:15,015
I can show you here.

261
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:19,436
There.

262
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,232
It lived up in the mountains,

263
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:28,861
with a skin white as snow
and the red nose,

264
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:30,947
blistered by the cold.

265
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:37,202
It lured children out
of the villages into its cave.

266
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:40,747
Five children.

267
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:46,001
One child
for every month of winter.

268
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,674
Over the centuries, the legend
of the cloyne was forgotten.

269
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,802
He became the clown.

270
00:22:56,844 --> 00:23:00,515
His white face and red nose,
to make people laugh.

271
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:04,101
To entertain children.

272
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:08,605
If only they knew!

273
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,031
Why are you showing me this?

274
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,914
So you can understand.

275
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,024
Ugh!

276
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,444
Ugh!

277
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:04,322
Oh, shit!

278
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,827
- Ugh!
- Oh, no.

279
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:13,288
The tea was supposed
to keep you asleep for hours.

280
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:15,414
Ugh!

281
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,459
I'd go get some more,
but I can't risk you getting loose.

282
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:21,045
Oh! Wha... Wha...

283
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,672
It's gonna be alright.

284
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,298
Wha...

285
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:30,136
Decapitation is the only way
to stop the demon.

286
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,805
No, wait.

287
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,098
Wait. Wait.

288
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,433
Wait.

289
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,895
- Ugh! Ugh!
- I'm sorry.

290
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,105
Ugh! Ugh!

291
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,440
Ugh!

292
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:47,234
- Ugh!
- I'm so sorry.

293
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,861
Ah! Ah!

294
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,238
Ah!

295
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,699
What the fuck?!

296
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:58,161
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

297
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:13,383
What the fuck are you doing?!

298
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:17,387
It's not a costume.

299
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,138
It's skin. And hair.

300
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,807
Of a demon.

301
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:38,905
- Honey! Call 911!
- What? Where have you been?!

302
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,824
This maniac tried to kill me.

303
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,535
The guy whose house it was
that had the suit in it.

304
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:45,078
Look. He thinks I'm a demon.

305
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,788
Honey, we have to
go to the cops.

306
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:51,125
But you have to come with me,
'cause they're gonna think I'm crazy

307
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,793
if I'm dressed like a...clown.

308
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,878
What the fuck?!

309
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:56,963
Are you wearing make-up?

310
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,550
Let go of her, Kent!
What the hell is wrong with you?

311
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:04,137
Walt, I know this seems
a little crazy, a little nuts,

312
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:05,929
but this guy's a maniac.

313
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:07,806
If this is a joke,
it's not very funny.

314
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,559
- It's not a joke!
- So take off the clown suit.

315
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,519
I can't!
You think I'm making this up?

316
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:14,730
He chopped my neck
with a butcher knife!

317
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:17,857
- Is this blood?
- Yes, it's my blood!

318
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:19,900
He chopped me
with a butcher knife!

319
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:21,736
Who did?

320
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:31,244
Who the hell is that?

321
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:33,704
He tried to cut off my head.

322
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:38,792
He thinks I'm...
I'm turning into a demon.

323
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,129
Baby, he...he's crazy.

324
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:44,881
This is his suit. He did this.
All of it.

325
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:47,508
Just take the fucking thing off!

326
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,929
- Arggh!
- Oh, Jesus, Dave!

327
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:56,016
Are you fucking
out of your head?

328
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,894
Baby...

329
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,061
Meet me at the police station.

330
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:03,189
Please.

331
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,828
You're going to jail, man.

332
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,246
You are going to jail.

333
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,627
I'm trying to help you.

334
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:35,510
Oh! Oh!

335
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,480
It's...happening.

336
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,528
What are you doing to me?!

337
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:49,242
Kill...yourself...

338
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:53,579
..before...

339
00:29:06,924 --> 00:29:09,844
Hey, man. You OK? You OK, man?

340
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:23,814
Kill yourself.

341
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:27,902
Kill yourself.

342
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:55,551
- Ms McCoy?
- I'm sorry, what?

343
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,011
Right, one last question.

344
00:29:58,178 --> 00:30:01,473
Do you remember what he was wearing
the last time you saw him?

345
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:05,018
Like a...

346
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:10,022
..a long coat and a...dark hat.

347
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:13,484
OK.

348
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:17,946
If you hear something, you call.

349
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,282
Thank you.

350
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,203
Maybe it's a chemical thing.

351
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:28,997
You know.

352
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:31,208
He seems like
Mr Perfect Dad,

353
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,668
but then, suddenly...

354
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:40,174
Meg, I want you and Jack to
come stay with me for a while.

355
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,385
You got to
think of your family, Meg.

356
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,260
You can't baby him.

357
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:48,765
You got to tell Jack
his dad's dangerous.

358
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,725
I don't have to
listen to this anymore.

359
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,434
I'm just trying to
make it clear that...

360
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,144
Dad.

361
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,063
He was scared.

362
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,618
Mom... Is this my fault?

363
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:15,122
No! It's not your fault.
It's no-one's fault.

364
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,999
Just get some sleep.

365
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:20,876
Goodnight, doll.

366
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:57,451
Pipe down, fellas. Let's go.

367
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:19,387
Hey. You left your dirty plate
by the fire.

368
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:21,681
- Go clean it up.
- Oh, crud.

369
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,601
Don't get lost, lard-ass.

370
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:27,394
Zip it, Dickinson!

371
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:57,046
Do you have any food?

372
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:03,802
All I want is some food.

373
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:09,933
I've got these.

374
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:48,800
..should pick him up
are me or my neighbour Denise.

375
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,636
So you got my cell phone.
And my dad's first name's Walt.

376
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:54,180
So... Try him too.

377
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:56,432
Thanks. Appreciate it.

378
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,187
Oh, hey, sweetie. Come here.

379
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:04,231
I'm gonna go, OK?

380
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,190
But who's gonna
pick you up today?

381
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:08,484
- You or Denise.
- Mm-hm.

382
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:10,361
And if you see Daddy?

383
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,363
Is Daddy bad?

384
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,866
No. No, no, no, no, no.

385
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:18,285
He just... He has to do
some grown-up stuff today, OK?

386
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:20,203
But if he comes
to pick you up?

387
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,540
Say that the teacher
wants to talk to him

388
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:25,749
and that he should call Mommy.

389
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:26,917
And...

390
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:28,669
And that's it.

391
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,462
Mm-hm.

392
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,840
Daddy's coming home soon, OK?

393
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:36,843
Mwah. 'Bye, doll.

394
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,097
'Bye, doll!

395
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,797
Hey, honey, it's me. It's your dad.

396
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:22,550
I'm calling to make sure
everything's OK.

397
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,553
See if you heard anything.

398
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,347
Please give me a call and...

399
00:35:27,513 --> 00:35:29,389
Give me a call, OK?

400
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:13,304
Alright, people.
10 minutes, we're leaving.

401
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:34,572
- Oh, it stinks in here.
- Oh, gross. What is that?

402
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:36,241
Hello?

403
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:40,287
There anybody in there?

404
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,122
Door's locked.

405
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:44,748
Hello?

406
00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:52,880
Hello?

407
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:03,640
Ugh!

408
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,309
Kids, kids!

409
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,686
Just stay away from me!

410
00:37:50,223 --> 00:37:52,184
Are you a clown?

411
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:57,229
My name's Robbie.
What's your name?

412
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:01,650
Whoa! You're really hungry.

413
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:07,655
If you wanna eat, I got some
Cookie Crisps and waffles

414
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:11,409
and Cinnamon Toast Crunch
and chocolate chips

415
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:15,621
and chips and some jelly beans
and some beef jerky...

416
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:17,748
..and some cookies...

417
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:21,585
..cheese and fries
and ketchup and...

418
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:23,295
Stay away.

419
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:18,636
Hi. Want some cereal?

420
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,017
Mr Clown?

421
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:31,355
Mr Clown?

422
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:36,944
Mr Clown!

423
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,464
He's acting crazy.

424
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:04,051
Well, maybe it was
something he ate.

425
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:06,261
Is it 'cause he ate
Daddy's clown nose?

426
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:10,056
Jack, stay right here.

427
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:12,225
- Stay here.
- Is that Daddy?

428
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:15,519
Hello? Kent? What's going on?

429
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:18,689
Jack really misses you.

430
00:40:18,856 --> 00:40:21,025
I'm so sorry.

431
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:24,195
Tell me where you are.
Tell...tell me you're OK.

432
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,029
I can't take this.

433
00:40:26,196 --> 00:40:27,739
I'm sorry.

434
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:31,743
This...this is the only way.

435
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:37,289
Hello?

436
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:43,377
Mom...

437
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:47,507
When is Daddy coming home?

438
00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:51,177
Tonight, Jack.

439
00:40:51,344 --> 00:40:52,719
Don't worry.

440
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:55,305
Daddy's gonna be OK.

441
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:33,130
Oh!

442
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,300
Thank you.

443
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:40,262
It's gonna take you all night.
Are you sure?

444
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,847
Yeah. I'll find him.

445
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,476
Yeah, our last big fight,
I was bawling my eyes out.

446
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,811
Kent was hanging out
at one of his properties.

447
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:52,690
- What an asshole.
- Yeah.

448
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:07,703
You building a fun house?

449
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:30,348
Kent?

450
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:50,491
Are you in here?

451
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,626
Whoa. Oh!

452
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:00,679
Ugh!

453
00:44:00,845 --> 00:44:02,305
Oh!

454
00:44:03,348 --> 00:44:05,558
- Mr Clown!
- Oh!

455
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:07,476
No!

456
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:28,870
Oh, no!

457
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:31,331
Oh... Oh...

458
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:34,959
Oh. Oh!

459
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:27,548
Kent?

460
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:38,974
No!

461
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:40,768
Don't open the door.

462
00:45:42,394 --> 00:45:44,855
Kent...it's OK.

463
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:47,565
No.

464
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:51,986
You don't...
You don't understand.

465
00:45:52,153 --> 00:45:54,572
I just want to
get you home, Kent.

466
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:00,368
Look...

467
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:05,665
..I know something crazy
is happening to you, OK?

468
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,625
I believe you.

469
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:11,170
OK? I believe you.

470
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:15,298
We're gonna
figure this out together.

471
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:18,384
Jack needs you.

472
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,056
I need you.

473
00:46:29,144 --> 00:46:30,270
Kent...

474
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,649
..I'm pregnant.

475
00:47:02,507 --> 00:47:04,175
Take me home.

476
00:47:04,342 --> 00:47:05,552
Please.

477
00:47:33,702 --> 00:47:35,704
OK. It's OK.

478
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:38,163
Oh...

479
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,631
I can feel myself changing.

480
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:54,846
What do you
want me to do?

481
00:47:57,097 --> 00:48:01,476
No matter what I say,
you don't let me out.

482
00:48:02,936 --> 00:48:04,479
Promise me?

483
00:48:06,856 --> 00:48:08,399
Promise me.

484
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:11,152
Promise.

485
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:15,822
Until we can get you fixed.

486
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:18,617
OK?

487
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,987
Dr Martin Karlsson.

488
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:07,243
Children's cancer ward.

489
00:49:28,304 --> 00:49:31,139
Karlsson.

490
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:55,704
Do you know who I am?

491
00:49:57,997 --> 00:50:00,332
I just wanna talk to you.

492
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,139
I don't know what happened
between you and my husband,

493
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,391
but I just want him back.

494
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:42,662
I don't know. He, um...

495
00:50:42,828 --> 00:50:44,705
The police are looking for him.

496
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:47,332
No.

497
00:50:53,713 --> 00:50:55,256
Alright.

498
00:50:57,842 --> 00:51:02,971
Because the suit,
it does things to people, doesn't it?

499
00:51:12,563 --> 00:51:15,483
How do you get the suit off?

500
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,861
How do you
get the suit off?!

501
00:51:21,362 --> 00:51:23,239
How did you get it off?

502
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:32,915
Who are you?

503
00:51:40,254 --> 00:51:43,174
If you don't wanna help me out,
I'll find another way.

504
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:44,717
Ma'am, you can't be in there.

505
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:48,178
I'm leaving.

506
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:00,606
Hello?

507
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:35,929
Hello?

508
00:54:46,545 --> 00:54:50,258
Awww. What's wrong, doll?
Are you crying?

509
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:52,342
Shut up!

510
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:55,679
You're such a little bitch.

511
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,597
What's wrong?

512
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:02,268
Don't you wanna look like a clown,
just like your fag dad?

513
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,939
Ow! Fuck! He bit me!

514
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:17,084
Mom?

515
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,754
Mom?

516
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:23,507
Jack?

517
00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:25,050
Hello?

518
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,427
I'm in the basement, buddy.

519
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:31,431
Daddy? Is that you?

520
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:34,892
Sure is, sport.
Did you miss Daddy?

521
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:39,146
Mommy said if I saw you,
I had to tell the teacher.

522
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,856
Is she here?

523
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,733
I don't think so.

524
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:46,986
Good. Come downstairs.
I need help.

525
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,615
Mommy says it's OK.

526
00:57:04,043 --> 00:57:07,338
What are you doing
down there, Daddy?

527
00:57:07,505 --> 00:57:09,215
Come downstairs.

528
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:13,009
I wanna see
my number one birthday boy.

529
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:15,720
- Hello?
Meg?
- Yeah?

530
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:17,972
I was picking Jack up
at school today, right?

531
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,890
Yeah, Denise. Thanks for that.

532
00:57:20,057 --> 00:57:23,602
No, I mean, I'm at the school,
and...and he's not here.

533
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:34,404
Daddy?

534
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,198
I'm stuck, Jack.

535
00:57:37,365 --> 00:57:39,908
I need help.

536
00:57:40,075 --> 00:57:43,036
Oh. Are you crying, buddy?

537
00:57:45,163 --> 00:57:49,083
Hey. Come on, now.

538
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:54,296
You know you can
always talk to Dummo.

539
00:57:56,756 --> 00:58:02,429
At school, some kids tried
to put paste on my face.

540
00:58:02,595 --> 00:58:05,515
They're always doing that stuff.

541
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,349
Who is?

542
00:58:08,392 --> 00:58:10,769
Colton.

543
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:14,565
You know what I did
when I was bullied?

544
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:21,612
I hid, so that
they couldn't find me.

545
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:27,909
And then, after a while,
you know what happened?

546
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:32,581
They left you alone?

547
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:43,047
Hey, Jack. You know
where the bolt cutters are?

548
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:06,819
Kent?!

549
00:59:10,906 --> 00:59:13,658
J... Jack?!

550
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,665
Oh, Jack.

551
00:59:21,832 --> 00:59:24,710
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

552
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:26,378
Why'd you leave school?!

553
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:29,047
Don't ever do that to me, OK?!

554
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:30,590
Jack!

555
00:59:30,757 --> 00:59:32,300
Where's Daddy?

556
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:35,011
Where is he?

557
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:41,433
Yee-ahh!

558
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,101
Shit, dude, don't kill me.

559
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:45,395
Guys?
You guys really...

560
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:49,398
I just wanna tell you something.
You guys suck balls.

561
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:52,401
- Yeah, your mom's balls.
- Come on, man!

562
00:59:52,568 --> 00:59:55,363
Duh. Look at me.
I'm Colton.

563
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,906
- Look, a rocket launcher.
- I don't know where it is.

564
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:01,201
Don't give a shit
where the rocket launcher is.

565
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:03,078
- Oh, shit!
- Shit, shit, shit!

566
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:05,038
Bitch!

567
01:00:05,205 --> 01:00:07,164
Don't come at me
with that rocket launcher bullshit.

568
01:00:07,331 --> 01:00:09,250
Yeah,
rocket launcher's cheap, dude.

569
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:11,210
Rocket launchers
are for bitches, man.

570
01:00:11,377 --> 01:00:13,212
Shit! Guys, don't kill me.

571
01:00:13,379 --> 01:00:16,214
Stop bitching.
After that bullshit you just pulled?

572
01:00:18,758 --> 01:00:22,512
Come on, Colton. How long
does it take to change a tampon?

573
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:29,518
Guys, I think
there's someone in here.

574
01:00:29,685 --> 01:00:32,813
Probably Master Chief.

575
01:00:42,822 --> 01:00:44,656
Hey, check this out.

576
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:52,122
Oh, man - that reminds me
of what I did to Colton's mom last night.

577
01:00:52,288 --> 01:00:55,082
Mr McCoy? Is Jack here?

578
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:57,042
Colton, where are you?

579
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:59,295
- Bet he's in trouble.
- Why?

580
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:02,213
We were ditching class
and we saw this kid Jack

581
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,841
crying on the steps, so Colton
made him act like a clown.

582
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:07,927
And he called his dad a fag.

583
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:10,013
So Colton took
this bottle of glue

584
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:12,389
and was gonna rub it all over
the little douche's face.

585
01:01:12,556 --> 01:01:13,932
Guys, shut up!

586
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:16,226
But then he grabbed
Colton's hand and bit him.

587
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:17,811
Colton's gonna beat his ass...

588
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:19,895
Guys, shut up!

589
01:01:20,062 --> 01:01:21,772
You're done, man.

590
01:01:29,696 --> 01:01:31,906
Grandpa's excited to see you.

591
01:01:36,953 --> 01:01:39,622
You don't want
your little friend anymore?

592
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:46,211
Jack. Say something.

593
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:53,217
Jack, come on! We gotta go!

594
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,639
Shadow?

595
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,730
Shadow?

596
01:02:07,897 --> 01:02:09,440
Shadow, what happened to your...

597
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,371
Where is he?

598
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:29,375
Oh, my God!

599
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,210
Stay the hell away from us!

600
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:32,920
Don't want to hurt you.

601
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:36,089
You stay away from us!
You killed my fucking dog!

602
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:40,843
Please, you've gotta help me
find your husband!

603
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,887
- Get the fuck outta my house!
- No, you don't understand.

604
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:50,268
That's the detective.

605
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:57,692
I'm the only one
who can get that costume off.

606
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:17,876
I found that fuckin'
goddamn costume by accident.

607
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:22,505
Hundreds of old costumes
used to come through my shop.

608
01:03:22,672 --> 01:03:25,633
One day, there was
a shipment from Iceland.

609
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,554
An estate sale
from some Icelandic aristocrat.

610
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:34,975
When I opened the crate,
everything was rotted away,

611
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:39,061
but this costume,
it was perfect.

612
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:42,189
I'd never seen anything like it.

613
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:45,109
I was about to sell it
to the Moscow Circus,

614
01:03:45,276 --> 01:03:48,278
but I wanted to put it
to some good use first.

615
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:50,363
My brother was a doctor

616
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,949
working with children
with terminal illnesses.

617
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:55,618
He was always trying
to give them hope,

618
01:03:55,785 --> 01:03:58,620
so I thought,
"Why not cheer 'em up?"

619
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:08,379
When the transformation started,
I asked my brother for help.

620
01:04:08,546 --> 01:04:11,466
He swore he would find a cure.

621
01:04:12,508 --> 01:04:15,635
That's the last thing
I remember.

622
01:04:18,096 --> 01:04:21,433
When I woke up,
the suit was off.

623
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,935
The curse had been broken.

624
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:29,148
My brother had given the demon
what it demanded.

625
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,901
He had smuggled out
from the hospital

626
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:36,070
five children close to death,

627
01:04:36,237 --> 01:04:40,825
one child
for every month of winter.

628
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:46,997
So that's it? That's the cure?

629
01:04:47,164 --> 01:04:48,749
I've spent all these years

630
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:52,835
trying to find a clue
how to kill this evil thing.

631
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:56,214
My brother never left the house,

632
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,800
guarding this costume
with his life.

633
01:05:01,635 --> 01:05:04,304
I didn't even know
that he had passed away

634
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:07,724
when...your husband called me.

635
01:05:08,892 --> 01:05:11,894
Well, why didn't you destroy it?

636
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:13,979
Don't you think we tried?

637
01:05:14,146 --> 01:05:18,150
We tried burning it. We tried to
dissolve it in acid, everything.

638
01:05:18,317 --> 01:05:20,276
Nothing helped.

639
01:05:20,443 --> 01:05:22,904
We couldn't just toss it
in the ocean and bury it, could we?

640
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:24,697
What if someone else found it?

641
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:29,785
Even the smallest piece
carries the curse.

642
01:05:34,873 --> 01:05:37,209
You have to cut off its head.

643
01:05:37,376 --> 01:05:42,547
You can't destroy the costume,
but you can stop the demon.

644
01:05:43,756 --> 01:05:47,051
My husband would never do that.

645
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:55,308
This belongs to
a child, seven, eight years old.

646
01:05:55,475 --> 01:05:58,143
Where did he go?

647
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,354
Huh?

648
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,231
I don't know. I...

649
01:06:02,398 --> 01:06:05,442
You don't know?

650
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:08,528
He went to Colton's.

651
01:06:08,695 --> 01:06:10,655
Where's Colton?

652
01:06:10,822 --> 01:06:11,698
Jack.

653
01:06:11,865 --> 01:06:14,117
He's gotta be stopped.

654
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:15,868
Jack?

655
01:06:16,034 --> 01:06:18,787
- We have to kill your daddy.
- Hey!

656
01:06:18,954 --> 01:06:21,707
Listen to me. Alright, Jack?

657
01:06:21,874 --> 01:06:23,500
It's not Daddy. It's not.

658
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:26,127
It's that suit.
It's making him do bad things.

659
01:06:26,294 --> 01:06:28,337
But no-one's gonna
hurt Daddy, OK?

660
01:06:28,504 --> 01:06:31,048
You tell us
there's another way.

661
01:06:32,717 --> 01:06:34,801
Help me catch him.

662
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:38,013
We'll lock him up...

663
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:40,891
..continue searching.

664
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:48,355
Hey, buddy, what's...

665
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:50,065
Shh.

666
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,570
Hey, sweetie. Everything OK?

667
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:57,363
Yeah, I... Dad, I gotta go.

668
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,574
I can't get into it all right now.
I'm sorry.

669
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:02,242
- It's just...
- I gotta go, Dad.

670
01:07:17,465 --> 01:07:20,675
Careful.
He could still be in here.

671
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:27,766
Hey. Hey!

672
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:36,190
Oh!

673
01:07:36,357 --> 01:07:37,900
Oh...

674
01:07:39,442 --> 01:07:42,320
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

675
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:46,616
Don't touch anything, OK?

676
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:48,992
We have to call the police.

677
01:07:51,453 --> 01:07:52,829
Tell 'em what?

678
01:07:52,996 --> 01:07:56,500
He must have digested him
by now.

679
01:07:56,667 --> 01:07:58,751
Spit out the bones.

680
01:07:58,918 --> 01:08:00,628
Oh!

681
01:08:00,795 --> 01:08:03,005
Couldn't have gone far.

682
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:06,424
It's seven o'clock
on a Thursday.

683
01:08:06,591 --> 01:08:12,389
Where could a clown go
where he's not being seen?

684
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:16,016
Oh, no.

685
01:08:17,351 --> 01:08:18,978
What?

686
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,468
Hey! You can't go in there
like that.

687
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:57,012
Why not?

688
01:08:57,178 --> 01:08:59,556
You look like
an escaped mental patient.

689
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:01,266
Ah.

690
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:09,523
Listen. You can't trust
your husband.

691
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:12,025
- Don't.
- My brother, he shouldn't...

692
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:14,193
You don't know him.

693
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,071
- You don't know what Kent...
- I wish he had killed me.

694
01:09:18,823 --> 01:09:21,491
- If you love him...
- I know.

695
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,619
I'll bring him to you.
I promise.

696
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:13,038
Happy birthday!

697
01:10:39,228 --> 01:10:40,896
Shit.

698
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:51,239
There's no sign of him.

699
01:10:56,993 --> 01:10:59,079
Cannonball!

700
01:10:59,246 --> 01:11:00,997
Oh! Gross!

701
01:11:01,164 --> 01:11:03,666
Somebody peed in here.

702
01:11:05,584 --> 01:11:08,671
Greg? Greg?

703
01:11:08,838 --> 01:11:10,381
Greg?

704
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,425
Greg?

705
01:11:14,592 --> 01:11:17,262
Greg, Mom said we have to go.

706
01:11:18,471 --> 01:11:20,139
Greg?

707
01:11:27,187 --> 01:11:29,106
Greg?

708
01:11:35,528 --> 01:11:37,071
Greg?

709
01:11:38,405 --> 01:11:40,490
Greg, where are you?

710
01:11:47,247 --> 01:11:48,789
Greg?

711
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:53,210
Greg, where are you?

712
01:11:56,963 --> 01:11:58,590
Greg?

713
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,855
Greg!

714
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:27,324
Don't go up there.

715
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:36,457
Greg?

716
01:13:08,736 --> 01:13:09,779
There you are.

717
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:18,703
No! No!

718
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,538
Let go of him!

719
01:13:23,249 --> 01:13:25,542
Run, Greg, run!

720
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:38,679
Mom! Mom!

721
01:13:38,845 --> 01:13:40,764
- Mom, the clown!
- What is it, honey?

722
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:43,016
- Up there!
- What?

723
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:06,537
Excuse me. What happened?

724
01:14:06,704 --> 01:14:08,747
There's a maniac dressed as a clown
loose in there.

725
01:14:08,914 --> 01:14:10,291
Get your kids.

726
01:14:27,139 --> 01:14:29,808
Hey. Come. Come on.

727
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:36,647
See?

728
01:14:38,024 --> 01:14:40,359
It means he's close.

729
01:14:46,781 --> 01:14:48,491
What's that for?

730
01:14:49,743 --> 01:14:51,828
For protection.

731
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:56,790
Ah.

732
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:36,910
Kent?

733
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,722
Kent?

734
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,519
Where am I?

735
01:16:10,856 --> 01:16:13,359
We're here to help you.

736
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:15,568
I know you're scared.

737
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:19,364
We're gonna find a way
to stop it, OK?

738
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:22,575
We just have to get you
outta here first.

739
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:25,536
Karlsson's here.
He...he wants to help you.

740
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,330
OK, baby?

741
01:16:29,873 --> 01:16:31,917
I remember him.

742
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:35,253
He's crazy.

743
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,296
He's not.

744
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,050
He's gonna make sure
no-one else gets hurt.

745
01:16:41,217 --> 01:16:43,010
- Enough!
- Kent, look out!

746
01:16:47,055 --> 01:16:48,598
Kent.

747
01:16:48,765 --> 01:16:50,392
No!

748
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,309
Kent, no.

749
01:16:52,476 --> 01:16:54,311
He's gonna help you.

750
01:16:55,855 --> 01:16:58,232
Uh, Kent, I just...

751
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:00,985
Let me help you, please.

752
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,113
I know you're
still in there. I...

753
01:17:06,197 --> 01:17:08,825
Come on.
There's gotta be another way.

754
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,455
Bring me a child.

755
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:18,500
Kent?

756
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,962
Bring me one more child

757
01:17:23,129 --> 01:17:26,132
and you can have
your husband back.

758
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:29,885
Uh... Uh...

759
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:31,970
A child!

760
01:17:32,137 --> 01:17:34,681
I can't. I can't.

761
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:37,684
Perhaps I'll find another.

762
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:40,227
What's his name?

763
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:42,396
Ah, yes.

764
01:17:42,563 --> 01:17:44,732
Jack!

765
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:48,485
No.

766
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:53,490
Find a child
and bring him to me.

767
01:17:53,656 --> 01:17:58,619
Bring him to...
to our favourite spot, babe.

768
01:18:00,496 --> 01:18:02,581
I'll be waiting.

769
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,250
- Wait.
- Open the door!

770
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:09,462
Come out with your hands up.

771
01:18:11,047 --> 01:18:12,965
Alright. We are coming in.

772
01:18:21,014 --> 01:18:23,266
Police! Stay down!

773
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:25,851
Stay down on the ground!

774
01:18:26,018 --> 01:18:28,354
Throw your weapons down!

775
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:30,064
Put it down!

776
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:32,316
Put it down, motherfucker!

777
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:03,927
Dad! You got Jack with you?

778
01:19:04,094 --> 01:19:05,470
Yes. Of course he's with me.

779
01:19:05,637 --> 01:19:07,013
He's fine.
Don't worry about it.

780
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,849
He's being awfully quiet.
I was thinking of taking him home.

781
01:19:10,016 --> 01:19:12,309
No, you can't go home.
OK, just...just take Jack...

782
01:19:12,476 --> 01:19:14,395
Just take him and...
and you gotta leave.

783
01:19:14,562 --> 01:19:16,981
Is Kent at the house? Meg?

784
01:19:17,147 --> 01:19:20,066
What did Kent do?

785
01:19:21,693 --> 01:19:24,028
No. It's not Kent, Dad.

786
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:25,572
Kent didn't do anything.

787
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:27,615
Sweetheart,
please tell me what's going on.

788
01:19:27,782 --> 01:19:29,700
I'm here to help you.

789
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,910
Dad, I have to...

790
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:36,540
Meg?

791
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:38,333
Meg!

792
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:41,502
I have to go.

793
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:57,683
Hunter!

794
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,810
Oh, thank you so much.

795
01:19:59,977 --> 01:20:01,854
Are you looking
for your kid?

796
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:06,232
Um, no. He's safe.

797
01:20:11,988 --> 01:20:13,448
Police have confirmed

798
01:20:13,615 --> 01:20:15,866
that there have been
two fatalities so far,

799
01:20:16,033 --> 01:20:17,576
both of them children.

800
01:20:17,743 --> 01:20:20,078
And now we've received
confirmation that

801
01:20:20,245 --> 01:20:23,707
the authorities do have
at least one suspect in custody,

802
01:20:23,874 --> 01:20:27,001
a 59-year-old man
named Herbert Karlsson.

803
01:20:27,168 --> 01:20:30,504
No word yet on whether or not...

804
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:33,090
You work
at the dentist's, right?

805
01:20:33,257 --> 01:20:35,175
Yeah.

806
01:20:35,342 --> 01:20:38,053
I'm Annie.
I used to go there.

807
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:41,181
- OK.
- I was at Chris's birthday party.

808
01:20:41,348 --> 01:20:43,099
Everything went totally crazy.
And I can't find anybody.

809
01:20:43,265 --> 01:20:45,809
And my mom dropped me off,
and I don't know where she is.

810
01:20:45,976 --> 01:20:48,520
I saw you, and I remembered
that you used to be really nice,

811
01:20:48,687 --> 01:20:50,064
even though the dentist
was kinda scary.

812
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:53,483
You used to call him chrome dome
when he left the room.

813
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,443
Uh-huh.

814
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:57,195
Can you drive me home?

815
01:20:57,362 --> 01:20:59,280
I'm scared.

816
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:03,575
You want a ride home?

817
01:21:03,742 --> 01:21:06,745
Please.
I don't know anyone else.

818
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,877
You're so nice.

819
01:21:43,152 --> 01:21:45,071
Sorry I don't know the way.

820
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:47,615
Oh, it's alright.
We'll... I know your street.

821
01:21:47,781 --> 01:21:49,825
So we'll find your house.
Don't worry.

822
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:51,410
You're so nice.

823
01:21:51,576 --> 01:21:53,745
Well, you...

824
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:57,456
You know, I...think
if it were my son in trouble,

825
01:21:57,623 --> 01:22:01,711
I'd wish someone
would help him out, so...

826
01:23:08,896 --> 01:23:10,272
Are we here?

827
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:12,356
Yeah. This is it.

828
01:23:13,983 --> 01:23:15,693
You're home.

829
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:25,827
This isn't...

830
01:23:31,624 --> 01:23:33,292
This isn't my house.

831
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,920
This isn't my house!

832
01:23:38,339 --> 01:23:42,133
Hey, it's scary out here.
Unlock it, please!

833
01:23:45,303 --> 01:23:47,930
Please. Unlock it, please.

834
01:23:50,599 --> 01:23:52,017
There's someone out here.

835
01:23:52,184 --> 01:23:54,645
Please. Please unlock the door.

836
01:23:54,812 --> 01:23:57,188
Please! PLEASE!

837
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:59,690
There's someone out here.
Please unlock the door!

838
01:23:59,857 --> 01:24:01,776
Please unlock it!

839
01:24:01,943 --> 01:24:04,195
Unlock the door, please!

840
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:06,571
Unlock it, please!

841
01:24:11,576 --> 01:24:13,870
Please!

842
01:24:14,037 --> 01:24:16,372
Get in the car! I'm sorry.

843
01:24:16,539 --> 01:24:19,208
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

844
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:21,126
It's not safe out there!

845
01:24:21,293 --> 01:24:23,087
Hey!

846
01:24:23,254 --> 01:24:24,796
No.

847
01:24:28,049 --> 01:24:30,343
Hey. Wait here.

848
01:24:41,019 --> 01:24:42,396
Jack.

849
01:24:46,858 --> 01:24:48,943
Dad, call me back.

850
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:50,486
OK?

851
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:52,238
Where are you and Jack?

852
01:24:54,447 --> 01:24:56,533
Home at last.

853
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,162
OK, let's go and have
a little chat with your dad.

854
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:06,959
Stay close to Grandpa.

855
01:25:46,912 --> 01:25:49,705
Dad! I told you
not to come back here.

856
01:25:49,872 --> 01:25:51,582
- Where's Jack?
- He's OK.

857
01:25:51,749 --> 01:25:53,125
He's up in his room.

858
01:25:53,292 --> 01:25:55,461
Dad, I made a...
I made a mistake.

859
01:25:55,628 --> 01:25:57,170
Listen. I don't know
what happened.

860
01:25:57,337 --> 01:25:58,713
I don't care what happened.

861
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,715
I just don't want you
implicated in this.

862
01:26:00,882 --> 01:26:04,010
Whatever Kent did, it's OK.
I'm gonna help you, OK?

863
01:26:04,177 --> 01:26:05,803
I'm gonna help you.

864
01:26:07,179 --> 01:26:09,222
What are you talking about?

865
01:26:09,389 --> 01:26:11,683
I'll clean up the blood.

866
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,560
No-one'll know.

867
01:26:13,727 --> 01:26:17,021
Baby, you're my little girl.
I love you.

868
01:26:17,188 --> 01:26:19,857
I...

869
01:26:30,075 --> 01:26:34,912
One...child...more!

870
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,333
Ah!

871
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,326
Run, Jack!

872
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:07,578
Jack!

873
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:36,145
Clown motherfucker!

874
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:42,610
Arggh!

875
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:44,402
Ahh!

876
01:31:48,233 --> 01:31:49,943
Mom?

877
01:31:50,109 --> 01:31:51,778
Don't watch, Jack.

878
01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:53,821
OK, we got him.

879
01:31:56,157 --> 01:31:58,033
Meg...

880
01:32:02,788 --> 01:32:04,539
..help me.

881
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:09,335
We got him.

882
01:32:09,502 --> 01:32:11,045
Jack?

883
01:32:12,129 --> 01:32:14,966
Jack. Go get that book.

884
01:32:15,132 --> 01:32:17,342
What?

885
01:32:17,509 --> 01:32:20,178
The book Daddy found.

886
01:32:20,345 --> 01:32:22,430
And...and go get more chains.

887
01:32:22,597 --> 01:32:24,516
Why?

888
01:32:24,683 --> 01:32:26,767
Don't you wanna help Daddy?

889
01:32:26,934 --> 01:32:29,645
That's not Daddy.

890
01:32:59,797 --> 01:33:01,756
Jack, I'm sorry.

891
01:33:01,923 --> 01:33:04,426
I'm so sorry.

892
01:33:16,687 --> 01:33:18,355
Ugh! Ugh!

893
01:33:49,674 --> 01:33:52,010
Mom.
