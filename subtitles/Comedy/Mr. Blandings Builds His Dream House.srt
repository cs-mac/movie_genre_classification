1
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,037
<i>Manhattan.</i>

2
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,375
<i>New York.</i>

3
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,674
<i>U.S.A.</i>

4
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:41,049
<i>In any discussion of</i>
<i>contemporary America...</i>

5
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:45,381
<i>... and how its people live, we must</i>
<i>inevitably start with Manhattan.</i>

6
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:47,819
<i>New York City, U.S.A.</i>

7
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:52,555
<i>Manhattan, glistening modern giant</i>
<i>of concrete and steel...</i>

8
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,428
<i>... reaching to the heavens</i>
<i>and cradling in its arms 7 millions.</i>

9
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,999
<i>Seven millions.</i>

10
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,631
<i>Happy beneficiaries of the advantages and</i>
<i>comforts this great metropolis has to offer.</i>

11
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:12,445
<i>Its fine, wide boulevards facilitate the</i>
<i>New Yorker's carefree, orderly existence.</i>

12
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,255
<i>A transportation system second to none</i>
<i>in passenger comfort.</i>

13
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:31,900
<i>Quaint little sidewalk cafés</i>
<i>make for leisurely, gracious living.</i>

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:37,867
<i>For its nature lovers,</i>
<i>the peace and privacy of a day in the sun.</i>

15
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,371
<i>The city offers delightful changes</i>
<i>in climate.</i>

16
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,124
Well, I'll tell you.

17
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,060
Jim Blandings is part
of the fabric of this town.

18
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,833
Born and raised right here, he's as typical
a New Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet.

19
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,534
At least, he was.

20
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,808
If you wanna know the real story, I guess
I'm your boy. My name's Cole. Bill Cole.

21
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:16,377
I'm Jim's lawyer and "best friend."

22
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:19,711
Jim's one of those bright young fellas
you see around.

23
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:25,480
College graduate, ad business, lovely wife,
two fine kids, makes about 15,000 a year.

24
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,152
<i>Jim and Muriel Blandings are just like</i>
<i>thousands of other New Yorkers:</i>

25
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,918
<i>Modern cliff dwellers.</i>

26
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,893
<i>The morning it all started was just another</i>
<i>of those crisp September mornings.</i>

27
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,626
<i>And the Blandings were still asleep.</i>

28
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,546
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,765
- Betsy?
- <i>Okay, Dad.</i>

30
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,506
- Joan.
- Okay, Dad.

31
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,567
No. Good morning, Theodore.

32
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,367
- Good morning, Mr. Blandings.
- Good morning, Gussie.

33
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,509
Thank you.

34
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,425
Thank you.

35
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:38,771
Looking for something?

36
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,438
My socks.

37
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,306
Why don't you look in your sock drawer.

38
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,406
That's where I found my underwear.

39
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:54,585
- Well, try your underwear drawer.
- I am in my underwear drawer.

40
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:07,496
Well, they must be somewhere. Socks don't
get up and walk away by themselves.

41
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,905
Muriel, I thought we had it
clearly understood that these two...

42
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:16,170
Two and a half top drawers were mine.
I thought... Why do...?

43
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,740
The closet. That's where they are.
We put them in the closet.

44
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,284
- Put what in the closet?
- Your socks.

45
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:27,786
- There wasn't room in the drawers.
- There's a lot in the closet.

46
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:32,724
So Gussie and I decided that from now on
we'd keep them in a basket on the shelf.

47
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,128
Basket.

48
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,570
This? This.

49
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,650
Jim, dear, I do wish you'd try
to make a little effort.

50
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,589
I'll try, dear.

51
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:36,156
Father, just one morning,
I wish you'd knock.

52
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,620
I beg your pardon.

53
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,551
Washcloth, dear.

54
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,656
Thank you.

55
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,075
Towel, dear.

56
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,887
- Lf you don't mind, dear.
- One moment.

57
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,660
Take your time.
I can spare the blood.

58
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,569
- Did you cut yourself?
- I cut myself every morning.

59
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,470
I kind of look forward to it.

60
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:18,306
- Why don't you use an electric razor?
- Can't get used to them.

61
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,145
Silly.

62
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:24,375
- Bill Cole's been using one for years.
- He hasn't got my beard.

63
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:30,053
- Bill's beard is just as coarse...
- I am not interested in discussing...

64
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,856
...the grain and texture of Bill Cole's
hair follicles before I've had my breakfast.

65
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,931
All I said was, why don't you use
an electric razor?

66
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,469
Because I prefer the clean sweep
of the tempered steel as it glides smoothly...

67
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:45,402
No advertising copy, please.

68
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:49,208
- And hurry up. You'll be late for breakfast.
- Yeah. Sure.

69
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,484
- Who did it? Yes?
- I did.

70
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:06,492
Haven't I repeatedly told you not to cut up
the paper until I've read it?

71
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:09,062
I'm sorry, Father.
It's necessary research.

72
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,758
What? Another of Ms. Stellwagon's
so-called progressive projects?

73
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,926
Coming through, Theodore.

74
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,666
Does Theodore have to have breakfast with
us? Can't you take him to the living room?

75
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,236
Dear.

76
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:25,312
Why send your children to
an expensive school...

77
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,917
...if you undermine the teacher's authority
in your dining room?

78
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:32,752
I'm not undermining anything.
I'm in the advertising business.

79
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,322
Keeping abreast of the times is important.

80
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,049
So is your child's education.

81
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,421
- That's not the point.
- It certainly is.

82
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:42,723
- Not.
- Bicker, bicker, bicker.

83
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,429
You drink your milk.

84
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,095
Joan, every time Father and I have a lively
discussion, we aren't necessarily bickering.

85
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,773
What is it, Betsy?
Another English composition?

86
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,934
Ms. Stellwagon has assigned us
to take a classified ad...

87
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,409
...and write a human-interest theme on it.

88
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,176
I found one typical of the disintegration
of our present society.

89
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:05,377
I wasn't aware of the fact
our society was disintegrating.

90
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,351
I didn't expect you to be, Father.

91
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:11,391
Ms. Stellwagon says middle-class people
like us are prone to overlook...

92
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,620
Muriel, this is asking a lot,
but just one morning...

93
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:18,597
...I would like to sit and have breakfast
without social significance.

94
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,793
You must take more interest
in your children's education.

95
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,235
Can't squeeze blood from a turnip.

96
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,840
All right. I listen.

97
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:33,073
- Shoot.
- It's just 16 words.

98
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:36,809
I'm going to call it
<i>A Minor Tragedy of Our Times</i>.

99
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,421
Well?

100
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,750
"Forced to sell.
Farm dwelling.

101
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,759
Original beams.
Barn.

102
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,489
Apple orchard.
Trout stream.

103
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:53,362
Seclusion.
Superb view.

104
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,066
Will sacrifice."

105
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,597
- Go on.
- That's all.

106
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:02,938
- That's all?
- You don't see it, do you, Father?

107
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:06,081
A fellow wants to sell his house,
he puts an ad in the paper.

108
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:09,979
What'd you expect him to do,
take it to the United Nations?

109
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:13,511
There's more to it than that,
isn't there, dear?

110
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,592
Certainly, Mother. What some people
don't see is the whole sordid picture.

111
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,720
A poor, honest farmer
pushed to the wall by hardship.

112
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:27,335
Until finally, in desperation,
he's forced to sell...

113
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:31,371
...and stoops to the crass commercialism
of newspaper advertising.

114
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, indeed. Newspaper advertising?
Crass commercialism?

115
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:39,739
Ms. Stellwagon says advertising
is a basically parasitic profession.

116
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,177
You don't say.

117
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,842
Ms. Stellwagon says advertising
makes people who can't afford it...

118
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,854
...buy things they don't want
with money they haven't got.

119
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:53,017
Oh, she does, does she? Well,
perhaps your Ms. Stellwagon is right.

120
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,062
Perhaps I'll quit this
basically parasitic profession.

121
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,098
Which at the moment is paying
for your fancy tuition.

122
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,829
And those extra French lessons.
And that progressive summer camp.

123
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:06,168
To say nothing of the very braces
on your back teeth.

124
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,866
You shouldn't discuss money
in front of the kids.

125
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,137
Why not?
They spend enough of it.

126
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:12,871
Bicker, bicker, bicker.

127
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:16,779
Girls, get your things and run along.
You'll be late for school.

128
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,610
Bye, Daddy.

129
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,050
Give my regards to Ms. Stellwagon.

130
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,459
I'll get it.

131
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,659
- Hello. We haven't seen you in ages!
- Morning, Bill.

132
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,063
- Betsy, is your mother up?
- She's in there.

133
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:34,930
- Come on, Betsy.
- Wait.

134
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,628
Bye.

135
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,741
- Morning, Muriel.
- Good morning, Bill.

136
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,500
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Bill.

137
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:45,340
- Aren't you going to Lillie and Paul's?
- I am. They'll get me soon.

138
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:49,917
I thought I'd return these in case you want
to go through with that Funkhauser deal.

139
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:52,686
- Thanks.
- Cup of coffee, Bill?

140
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:54,652
- Yeah, thanks. I will.
- Gussie.

141
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,986
Personally, I think he's
2, $3000, out of line.

142
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,559
Yes, I suppose so.

143
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:03,824
Of course, you could save that amount by
not tearing out the living room wall.

144
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,594
- Sort of impractical anyway.
- I guess so.

145
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,465
What wall? Who are you talking about?
Who's Funkhauser?

146
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,769
- Bunny Funkhauser.
- Who?

147
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:17,309
You remember Bunny Funkhauser, dear.

148
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:21,609
That clever, young interior decorator
we met at the Collins' cocktail party?

149
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,912
You mean that young man
with the open-toed sandals?

150
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:27,153
What about him?

151
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,116
Well...

152
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,219
You know how long we've said...

153
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,557
...we've got to do something about
fixing up this apartment.

154
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:39,295
Well, a couple of weeks ago,
he called.

155
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,403
And I asked him to come over.

156
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:47,031
And he had some
simply wonderful ideas.

157
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,133
And...

158
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:54,112
...I didn't want to bother you
with sketches and estimates...

159
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,683
...until I knew whether
we could afford it.

160
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,616
So I sent them over to Bill.

161
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,090
How much?

162
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:06,318
Why ask how much until you know
what you're going to get?

163
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:09,191
I've seen Bunny Funkhauser.
I know what I'm getting.

164
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:13,960
- I think he's got some interesting sketches.
- He's terribly clever. Look.

165
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,399
Here's how he sees our living room.
Isn't it charming?

166
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,268
What's that, a shoeshine stand?

167
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:22,001
It's a cobbler's bench, dear.

168
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:25,476
The room's Colonial. Breakfront.
Hooked rug.

169
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:29,947
Student lamp. Pie cooler. And over here
is a Martha Washington desk.

170
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,984
And where do I keep my powdered wig?

171
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,992
I think it's perfect. It's us.

172
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:41,419
Bunny says we're very American.

173
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,761
Very grassroots.
Very blueberry pie.

174
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,698
Well, don't look at me.
Bunny said it.

175
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,336
Now, here in the hall...

176
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,374
How much is all this going to cost?

177
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:57,910
Well...

178
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,742
...the figure isn't accurate,
because it includes...

179
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,611
How much?

180
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:07,850
- Well, $ 7000, Jim, but...
- $ 7000!

181
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:10,253
Well, that includes tearing out a wall.

182
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,394
- And I quite agree with Bill...
- Oh, you do?

183
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,154
You're some lawyer.

184
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,164
A defenseless woman without any
conception of the value of a dollar...

185
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:22,701
...comes to you for advice
and you've got her tearing out walls.

186
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:26,739
I am on record as being opposed
to tearing out walls, and so is the woman.

187
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:30,070
- Lf you'd only listen...
- $ 7000 dollars?

188
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,737
I wouldn't put 7 cents into
this broken-down rattrap.

189
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,884
Jim, how can you talk that way?

190
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:39,509
This is our home. Betsy was practically
born in this apartment.

191
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,384
That does not make it a national shrine.

192
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:47,221
Now, wait. When I came in this morning,
I had no intention of sending you to Reno.

193
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,694
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- He was.

194
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:53,392
He was showing you how to save $3000
by not tearing out a wall.

195
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:56,594
I can save $ 7000 by not doing
anything at all.

196
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:00,264
Yeah. You can save another 3500
by not buying her that mink coat.

197
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:04,776
- You don't take a cruise to the West Indies...
- All right, Bill. All right.

198
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,070
Not a bad day.

199
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:12,084
You've already saved $ 15,000
and it's not even 9:00.

200
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:14,814
See you next week. Bye, Jim.

201
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,584
- Bye, dear.
- Have a nice weekend.

202
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,250
- Wait, I'll go down with you.
- All right.

203
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,862
Seven thousand dollars.

204
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,391
Blueberry pie.

205
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,802
- Morning, Mary.
- Morning.

206
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,876
- What's that?
- Seems we're in the midst of a situation.

207
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:44,411
"W-H-A-M. Wham. A whale of a ham."

208
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:47,555
- Why's it here? That's Johnson's headache.
- Not anymore.

209
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:52,023
Mr. Johnson is no longer with us.
Mr. Johnson lost the touch.

210
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,128
- Guess whose headache it is now?
- Oh, no.

211
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,265
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.

212
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,993
On your desk you will find a directive
from the high command.

213
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:05,037
What a morning. Bunny Funkhauser,
blueberry pie and Wham.

214
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:06,606
How's that?

215
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:11,269
Nothing, Mary. Just a private joke between
me and whoever's going to be my analyst.

216
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:16,110
They sent down Mr. Johnson's handiwork
before he was drummed from the corps.

217
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:20,846
July: "When you've got the whim,
say, 'Wham."'

218
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:26,593
August, <i>House and Stream</i>:
"For a grand slam in ham, try Wham."

219
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,698
I have some more over here.
Balance of last year's campaign.

220
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,858
September's the little gem
that cost him his job.

221
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:35,965
Just a minute.

222
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,230
Mary.

223
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:44,505
Would you spend $ 7000 to tear out
someone else's walls...

224
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,979
...when, for a few thousand more, you could
find a nice old place in Connecticut...

225
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:53,178
...fix it up and have the dream
house you've always wanted?

226
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:54,845
I beg your pardon?

227
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,652
<i>Well, that's the way it all started.</i>

228
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:04,097
<i>The ad was enough to convince Jim.</i>

229
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,600
<i>But Muriel was a little tougher.</i>

230
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,704
<i>I guess the corsage did it.</i>

231
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,904
<i>There they are.</i>

232
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:20,777
<i>Two little fish from New York out in</i>
<i>the deep waters of Connecticut real estate.</i>

233
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,747
<i>That's Smith, the real estate salesman.</i>

234
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,320
<i>Mighty shrewd cookie,</i>
<i>in a quiet sort of way.</i>

235
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:31,624
<i>Yes, sir, he knows a sucker</i>...
<i>I mean customer, when he sees one.</i>

236
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,321
<i>He sees one.</i>

237
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:41,302
<i>Well, Smith, looks like you're finally gonna</i>
<i>unload the old Hackett place.</i>

238
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:46,095
<i>The old, very old Hackett place.</i>

239
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,602
Well, folks. There she is.

240
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,606
It's charming.

241
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,617
That is, for an old house.

242
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:01,813
You understand, Mr. Smith, we're just
window-shopping. Nothing definite.

243
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,117
Oh, perfectly all right.

244
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,758
Not a bad-looking house.

245
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,692
But it's a lot older than anything
we had in mind.

246
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,834
Well, she's no spring chicken.

247
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:16,897
But that's just what
makes her such a buy. Yep.

248
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:21,475
A man's got just about everything
he'd need here. A nice big hay barn.

249
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,841
Couple of fruit orchards
just over the hill.

250
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:30,708
Virgin stand oak grove other side
the trout stream there.

251
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:35,585
The trout stream will give you your own
pure, clear, cold mountain water.

252
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,784
Paved highway right to your door.

253
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:42,495
Grocer from town delivers twice a week.

254
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:44,662
Easy commuting distance, yeah.

255
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,734
58 minutes from New York City.

256
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,535
Brand-new high school
right down the road.

257
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:55,699
Yes, sir, 50 mighty pretty little acres.

258
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:58,346
Fine old house too.

259
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,974
Four family bedrooms,
plenty of closet space.

260
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:07,844
However, it's not just all these,
you know.

261
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:11,515
- You're buying a piece of American history.
- Really? How's that?

262
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:17,222
Why, first year she was built, General Gates
stopped right here to water his horses.

263
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,298
Old General Gates, huh? Civil War.

264
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,902
Revolutionary War.

265
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,306
Oh, that General Gates.

266
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:31,376
But I'm not trying to sell you anything,
understand. All I'm saying is that one day...

267
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:35,812
...someone with a little imagination's gonna
come along and steal this place.

268
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:38,475
And I mean steal it.

269
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,654
I don't have to tell you,
Mrs. Blandings...

270
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:45,259
...what a woman's touch could do
to a place like this.

271
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,738
Yes, sir.
You've certainly got to visualize.

272
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:04,039
Couple coats of paint,
a little pointing up here and there.

273
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,825
Shall we go up and take a look at her?

274
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,898
Well, I suppose as long as we're here.

275
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,499
I guess it doesn't hurt to take a look.

276
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:32,563
I'll just see if the keys are
up there where I left them.

277
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:36,175
It has possibilities.
You think we can get it?

278
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,107
Like taking candy from a baby.

279
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,717
- Now, don't lose your head.
- You just keep quiet, dear. Let me handle it.

280
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:47,715
Tell me, Smith, what kind of price
is the owner asking for this old place?

281
00:26:57,465 --> 00:27:00,093
What do you think, Bill?
Steal, huh?

282
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,694
"Steal" is an understatement.

283
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,029
"Swindle" might be more appropriate.

284
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,197
Oh, well...

285
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,438
What do you mean?

286
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:14,411
Every time you get tight, you weep on my
shoulder about the advertising business.

287
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:20,145
How it forces a sensitive soul like yourself
to live by bamboozling the American public.

288
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:25,949
I would say a small part of that victimized
group has now redressed the balance.

289
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,958
- What are you talking about?
- You.

290
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:31,360
You got taken to the cleaners,
don't even know your pants are off.

291
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,229
Darling, I told you.
I said we ought to call Bill.

292
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:38,133
Now, Muriel. All right,
just what's wrong with this deal?

293
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,435
First time around, you offered $ 10,000
for 50 acres, right?

294
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,908
- What of it?
- That's $200 an acre.

295
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,742
I know that part of Connecticut.
$ 100 an acre...

296
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,750
...is standard top-gouge price
to city slickers.

297
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,048
When the natives sell to each other,
it's around 40 or less.

298
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,485
Forty!

299
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:58,649
The man's entitled to a fair profit.

300
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:01,295
Not 284 percent.

301
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:06,025
Besides, you're not getting 50 acres,
you're only getting 35, more or less.

302
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:10,103
- Where does it say that?
- I refer to a rather obscure postscript...

303
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:14,105
...on the back of the second letter
from friend Smith.

304
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:21,248
"Incidentally, Mr. Hackett has been a little
optimistic about the acreage.

305
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,544
It will probably survey somewhere
in the neighborhood...

306
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,815
...of 35 acres, more or less."

307
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:31,891
All right, so it's 35.
What's the difference?

308
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,188
Do you know how many tennis courts
you can get on 35 acres?

309
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:38,924
You're not spending $ 11,500
for tennis courts.

310
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,762
- That's not the point.
- That's precisely the point.

311
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:46,236
We'll write Hackett a strong letter.
Tell him he can kick in those 15 acres...

312
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:49,206
...reduce the price
or find another sucker.

313
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:53,609
We'll do no such thing. I'm not gonna queer
this deal over 15 broken-down acres.

314
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:57,047
- You just don't understand business.
- You mean extortion.

315
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:59,948
Now, wait a minute.
Now, put that thing down.

316
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:02,951
Look, you can't measure everything
on a slide rule.

317
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:06,059
- This house has intangibles.
- Like what, for instance?

318
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:08,058
Like antique value, for instance.

319
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:10,356
It just so happens that General...

320
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:13,660
...Gates stopped at that very house
to water his horses.

321
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:18,238
I don't care if General Grant dropped in
for Scotch and soda, you're getting rooked.

322
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,636
That was a different war.

323
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,678
I think Bill's absolutely right.

324
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,807
Let me explain something to you both.

325
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:31,247
For 15 years I've been cooped up
in a four-room cracker box.

326
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,752
Just getting a morning shave
entitles a man to the Purple Heart.

327
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,981
That still doesn't make it a good buy.

328
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,625
Bill.

329
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:42,957
Muriel and I have found what I'm not
ashamed to call our dream house.

330
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:46,764
It's like a painting.
You buy it with your heart, not your head.

331
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,927
You don't ask, "How much
was the paint? The canvas?"

332
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,671
You look at it. And you say,
"It's beautiful. I want it."

333
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,811
And if it costs a few more pennies,
you pay it and gladly.

334
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:58,673
Because you love it.

335
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:02,374
And you can't measure the things you love
in dollars and cents.

336
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,947
Well, anyway, that's the way
I feel about it.

337
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:12,320
When I sign on Saturday, I can look
the world in the face and say, "It's mine.

338
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,462
My house. My home.

339
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,995
My 35 acres."

340
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:23,093
Our house. Our home.

341
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:26,001
Our 35 acres.

342
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,306
More or less.

343
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,778
<i>So Jim cashed in his government bonds.</i>

344
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:42,013
<i>Gave old man Hackett a $ 6000 mortgage...</i>

345
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,919
<i>... and bought the place.</i>

346
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,821
<i>Then they drove me out to see it.</i>

347
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:49,755
This isn't the way we came
with Mr. Smith.

348
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,525
What in the world are "Shrunk Mills"?

349
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,260
Probably mills that have shrunk.

350
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:59,170
Seems to me we go left.

351
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,005
Over the bridge and turn right.

352
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,438
Left.

353
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:25,061
Congress ought to pass a law.

354
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:30,569
When a man buys a house in Lansdale,
there's a prize. 10 percent off if he finds it.

355
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,735
- Over the bridge and turn right.
- Left.

356
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:01,035
If you really want to find that house,
it's no problem.

357
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:04,933
Pretend you're one of General Gates'
horses and you're very thirsty.

358
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:07,336
Where would you go for a drink of water?

359
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:37,165
Well, I must admit,
it's a very beautiful thing.

360
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:42,168
The house and the lilac bush at the corner
are just the same age, Bill.

361
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,470
If a lilac can live and be so old,
so can the house.

362
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,205
It just needs someone to love it,
that's all.

363
00:32:52,186 --> 00:32:55,747
It's good there are two of you.
One to love it, one to hold it up.

364
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,921
What'd your engineer say
about the foundation and the roof?

365
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:05,657
Who needs engineers?
This isn't a train.

366
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,828
I just saw it move.

367
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:12,000
It's stood since the second year
of the Continental Congress.

368
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,199
You take one look at it
and shingles start to fall off.

369
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:20,203
Let me do you a favor. I've got a client,
structural engineer, Joe Apollonio.

370
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,406
Practically built
the George Washington Bridge.

371
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,609
Thanks a lot, but we're
not building a bridge.

372
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,851
He advised the government
not to raise the <i>Normandie</i>.

373
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,355
They didn't listen, cost them $5 million.

374
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:34,222
You have my word.
If I were raising the <i>Normandie</i>...

375
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:38,126
...I wouldn't make a move without
Apollonio. Would you like to come in?

376
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:39,928
No, thanks.

377
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:52,505
Muriel!

378
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,210
Muriel!

379
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:59,012
I think you'd better get in touch
with Mr. Apollonio.

380
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:04,449
The house has charm,
hasn't it, Mr. Apollonio?

381
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,618
Any small changes would have to conform
to the character of the countryside.

382
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,264
And still be functional.

383
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:17,331
What is your professional opinion?

384
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:24,569
- Tear it down.
- Tear it down?

385
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:28,807
If your sills were shot and your
timbers was okay, I'd say fix her up.

386
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,680
If your timbers were shot and sills
was okay, I'd say fix her up.

387
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,651
But your sills are shot
and your timbers are shot.

388
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:38,519
I'll show you.

389
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,693
Take a look at the way
what she leans. Here.

390
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,334
It has to be level.

391
00:34:53,506 --> 00:34:58,500
So I say, don't throw good money
after bad. Tear it down. Good day.

392
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,643
- Thanks a lot.
- That's okay.

393
00:35:03,816 --> 00:35:05,784
And I send my bill to your office.

394
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,978
Bill Cole and his experts.

395
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:15,525
Never mind, darling.
We'll get our own experts.

396
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:19,496
<i>And so they got their own experts.</i>

397
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:23,226
- <i>Mr. Simpson said:</i>
- Tear it down.

398
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:28,935
- <i>On the other hand, Mr. Murphy said:</i>
- Tear it down.

399
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:33,275
<i>That's how our friend</i>
<i>Mr. Simms came into it.</i>

400
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,474
<i>He said it was possible</i>
<i>to fix up the old place.</i>

401
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,777
<i>But why not build</i>
<i>a new house, same size?</i>

402
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:43,820
<i>It certainly wouldn't cost any more.</i>
<i>"Why not look at a floor plan?"</i>

403
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:47,287
Here we are. Something like this.

404
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:50,622
First floor, living room,
dining room, study...

405
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:54,493
...kitchen, breakfast room,
service porch, maid's rooms.

406
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:58,603
Upstairs, three family bedrooms
with two adjoining baths.

407
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,699
Well, it's very nice.

408
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:06,806
But don't you think
it's a little conventional?

409
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:09,106
Yes, Mr. Simms, of course...

410
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:12,739
...if we were going to build a house,
we'd want it...

411
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,886
...well, just a little bit different.

412
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:17,716
Yes. Of course,
this is just a point of departure.

413
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,654
You don't have to adhere
to any of this.

414
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,028
Well, I don't think we're
at all ready to commit ourselves.

415
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,563
- Oh, no.
- Of course not. I understand.

416
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:31,032
Well, now,
if this were my house, I'd...

417
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:33,899
Well, I mean...

418
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:40,134
Now, here, for instance...

419
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:44,907
Now. In the study...

420
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:48,781
...if we could push out this wall
a little and put in a built-in bar...

421
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:50,581
Excuse me, dear.

422
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:52,519
These bedrooms are too small.

423
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:55,524
And we'll have to have
a little dressing room.

424
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:58,356
Yeah, and closets, Mr. Simms,
plenty of closets.

425
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,296
- One thing this family needs is closets.
- Lf I might make a suggestion...

426
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:03,992
And bathrooms, Mr. Simms.

427
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:07,036
Each bedroom must have
at least one bathroom.

428
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:10,869
But that would be four bathrooms,
Mrs. Blandings. I better point out...

429
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:15,002
I was wondering, do you think we
could manage a playroom in the basement?

430
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,774
You know, nothing tremendous.
Something like this.

431
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,784
Well, of course, it's always possible.
But our fundamental problem...

432
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:24,354
And I've always wanted
a little sewing room.

433
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:27,083
A little utility room upstairs...

434
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:31,389
...where I could be alone and sew
or sulk on a rainy afternoon.

435
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:34,532
Pardon me, dear.
Now, Mr. Simms, about that playroom...

436
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,194
...not too small. Plenty of room for dodge,
Ping-Pong, nice big poker table.

437
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:41,566
Yes. If you don't mind...

438
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,073
- Off the kitchen, a flower sink...
- There should be a terrace...

439
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:48,907
...a stone floor and shelves...
...an awning and fireplace...

440
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:53,347
...and a closet for gardening things...
...a barbecue thing. A roasting thing.

441
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,384
A rotisserie.
For Sunday afternoons.

442
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:02,722
Well, let's see what we have here.

443
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,156
In the first place, I'm afraid...

444
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:13,905
In the first place, you've got the upstairs
about twice as big as the downstairs.

445
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:17,770
- It's all those bathrooms.
- It's all those closets.

446
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:23,839
By extending that breakfast room,
you've eliminated the possibility of stairs.

447
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:27,383
I've allowed for that.
You can put them in behind the pantry.

448
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:32,724
Mrs. Blandings, on that sewing room,
the way you have it there...

449
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:35,758
...the chimney stack would
come up through the room...

450
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:38,692
...leaving you with the shape
of a square doughnut.

451
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:42,800
Which might be very warm in winter,
but otherwise of doubtful utility.

452
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:45,368
Can't you put the chimney
somewhere else?

453
00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:49,198
Look, I think I know just about
what you two have in mind.

454
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,638
Suppose I go ahead
with preliminary plans...

455
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,904
...and we get together in a week.
- All right. You do that.

456
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,310
- Fine.
- Holy smoke!

457
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,417
I'm afraid we didn't realize.

458
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:03,487
Well, Mr. Simms. Don't you forget,
we've got to hold it down under 10,000.

459
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:06,089
That, I can tell you right now,
is impossible.

460
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:08,954
Even with trimming
of the things you've indicated...

461
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:12,962
...I don't see how we can bring it in
for less than 12 or 12,500.

462
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:15,730
Twelve thousand, five hundred?

463
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:20,064
I guess we won't quibble about
a few pennies one way or the other.

464
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:25,970
By the way, have you any notions as to how
you'd like the old place taken down?

465
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:28,636
Why don't we just blow on it.

466
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:43,159
Well, so far it's cost us $ 13,329.45.

467
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:48,859
But we have the nicest vacant lot
in the state of Connecticut.

468
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:55,670
Something will have to be cut.
These plans are too elaborate...

469
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:58,401
...for the money you have to spend.
- All right.

470
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:00,909
I'll make the sacrifice. You can cut it out.

471
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,604
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- What's happening?

472
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:05,943
Dad just lost his playroom.

473
00:40:06,118 --> 00:40:10,452
Muriel, as the house stands now,
it's over $ 15,000.

474
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:13,386
- Mother, may we put Theodore to bed?
- Yes.

475
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,290
It just doesn't seem possible
for a house with such small rooms.

476
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:22,058
I've already explained. It's not so much
the size of the rooms as it is the number.

477
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:24,566
Is it essential for each
of your daughters...

478
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:27,603
...to have her own room
with two closets and a bath?

479
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,035
Yes.

480
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:32,871
You see, my daughters
are approaching womanhood and...

481
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:36,014
I didn't realize they were
approaching it quite so fast.

482
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:40,675
Perhaps what you need is not so much
a house as a series of little bungalows...

483
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,913
...each with two closets
and a private bath.

484
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:48,482
Well, what about that silly flower sink?
We could lose that.

485
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:50,256
I beg your pardon.

486
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:52,624
Or that sewing room. That's a waste.

487
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:56,791
May I suggest that neither of these
are really major eliminations?

488
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:00,700
- Lf you could do with one less bathroom...
- Sorry, we couldn't possibly.

489
00:41:00,873 --> 00:41:03,034
A simple bathroom, 8 by 10 by 8...

490
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,041
...with grade-A fixtures
will cost around $ 1300.

491
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:10,841
I refuse to endanger my children's health
in a house with less than four bathrooms.

492
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:16,181
For $ 1300, they can live in a house
with three bathrooms and rough it.

493
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:25,122
- Why, Bill!
- Hello, Muriel.

494
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:26,924
Well, you've done it again.

495
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:31,365
Once, just once, why don't you
come to me and find out if it's legal...

496
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,994
...before you go barging off
and run yourself into another jam?

497
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:38,540
- What's eating you?
- Simms, I hold you equally responsible.

498
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,144
- What happened?
- I don't understand.

499
00:41:41,313 --> 00:41:44,339
- Did you let this idiot tear down that house?
- What of it?

500
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:47,178
Reconstruction was unsound
and totally impractical.

501
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:50,788
But you're dealing with a man
who doesn't think before he acts.

502
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:53,288
- Who goes off half-cocked.
- What did I do?

503
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:56,154
You're an architect.
You were aware of the legality.

504
00:41:56,328 --> 00:41:59,092
- What legality?
- There was a mortgage on that house.

505
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:02,563
- I assumed as much.
- What are you talking about?

506
00:42:02,734 --> 00:42:05,430
- What did you do?
- I don't know. They won't tell me.

507
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:08,368
Certainly, but since you
were his lawyer, I assumed...

508
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,474
With a guy like this, don't assume.

509
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:13,076
Just a minute.
I'm entitled to know what I did.

510
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:16,305
This is America.
A man is guilty until proven innocent.

511
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:18,312
It's the other way around, Father.

512
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:20,678
- You go to bed.
- Girls.

513
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:24,413
Bill, would you mind telling me in clear,
concise English...

514
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,819
...just what crime I've committed and why?

515
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:30,052
In clear, concise English,
you tore down a house...

516
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:34,426
...on which another man holds a mortgage
without getting his written permission.

517
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,567
Well, l... I did?

518
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:41,035
And in such case, the mortgagee
can demand full payment of said mortgage.

519
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:43,436
Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands.

520
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:45,803
Six thousand clams.

521
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,605
And he wants them now.

522
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:49,542
- Now?
- You've got 10 days.

523
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:54,015
Ms. Stellwagon says the parents' problems
should be the children's problems.

524
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:58,418
Well, you keep that in mind, dear,
it'll help prepare you for motherhood.

525
00:42:58,857 --> 00:43:02,520
- We'd better let the plans go for now.
- No, Simms. I'll work this out.

526
00:43:02,694 --> 00:43:06,721
- Go ahead and let's see some estimates.
- Very well. You'll hear from me soon.

527
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:09,162
- Good night, Mr. Cole.
- Good night.

528
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:12,167
- Six thousand dollars.
- Good night, Mr. Simms.

529
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:13,633
Good night.

530
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:16,740
What are you gonna do
about the collateral on your loan?

531
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:19,433
Turn in my insurance policies or something.

532
00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:22,870
- Jim, you can't do that.
- Why not?

533
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:26,984
Why, if anything should happen,
the children would be left unprotected.

534
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:30,250
- I'm not dead yet.
- Well, of course you're not.

535
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:34,821
I'll see the boys at the bank. Maybe you
can put up your insurance as collateral.

536
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:36,858
If necessary...

537
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:39,396
...l'll sign a personal note.

538
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:41,599
Thanks, Bill.

539
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:44,634
Well, I gotta run along.

540
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:46,766
Jim, do me a little favor.

541
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:50,965
The next time you're gonna do anything
or say anything or buy anything...

542
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:53,168
...think it over very carefully.

543
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:57,543
When you're sure you're right,
forget the whole thing.

544
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:04,050
- Good night, Muriel.
- Good night, Bill.

545
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:12,587
What a wonderful friend.

546
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:16,160
What's with all this kissing
all of a sudden?

547
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,824
What's that?

548
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:23,031
Just because a man helps in a business way
doesn't give him privileges with my wife.

549
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:26,109
That's a fine thing to say
about a friend of 15 years.

550
00:44:26,278 --> 00:44:29,042
Well, I just don't like it.

551
00:44:29,214 --> 00:44:33,207
Every time he goes out of this house,
he shakes my hand and he kisses you.

552
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:35,853
Would you prefer it
the other way around?

553
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:41,691
Why is he always hanging around?
Why doesn't he ever get married?

554
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,092
Because he can't find another girl as pretty
and sweet and wholesome as I am.

555
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:54,870
Darling, let's not be silly about this.

556
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,942
It isn't Bill,
it's the house that's upsetting you.

557
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:01,836
I suppose so.

558
00:45:02,314 --> 00:45:05,579
- Do you think it's worth all this?
- Of course it is.

559
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,277
It isn't a house we're building,
it's a home.

560
00:45:09,454 --> 00:45:12,252
For ourselves and our children.

561
00:45:12,424 --> 00:45:15,154
Maybe our children's children.

562
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:19,827
Each with two closets and a private bath.

563
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,530
Well, here are the estimates.

564
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:29,867
Before you look,
I think I better explain.

565
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,307
Don't bother, Mr. Simms. We're getting
to be old hands at this sort of thing.

566
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:44,583
Of course, these bids
are obviously way out of line.

567
00:45:44,756 --> 00:45:47,884
That is, all except
John Retch & Son at 21,000.

568
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,823
- Twenty-one thousand!
- With some judicious cutting...

569
00:45:50,996 --> 00:45:55,592
...I think we could pare that down to 18.
- We've asked for the barest necessities.

570
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:58,930
- Frankly, with all the extras...
- Never mind, Mr. Simms.

571
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:02,733
Send us a bill for your services.
I'll see it's taken care of.

572
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:05,536
- Goodbye, Mr. Simms.
- But one moment.

573
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,974
- In the first place...
- In the first place...

574
00:46:08,146 --> 00:46:12,606
...I am going out to get my head examined.
If I don't jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...

575
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:17,084
...l'm going to find the owner of our
apartment building and sign a 20-year lease.

576
00:46:17,255 --> 00:46:18,847
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

577
00:46:19,024 --> 00:46:21,993
- Goodbye, Mr. Simms.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Blandings.

578
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,686
Do you think you could keep
it down to 18,000?

579
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:32,454
- Well, things are certainly humming.
- What?

580
00:47:32,631 --> 00:47:34,565
I said, "humming."

581
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:40,163
Oh, there's my contractor, Mr. Retch.
I'll introduce you.

582
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:42,431
We ordered that a month ago.
Get down...

583
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:45,007
- Hello, Mr. Retch.
- Hi. Put a tracer on it.

584
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:49,078
- We need that stuff.
- Got a lot on his mind.

585
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,179
Hey, get out of the way.
Wanna get killed?

586
00:48:03,662 --> 00:48:08,099
- What's going on over there?
- That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging our well.

587
00:48:15,173 --> 00:48:17,971
- How long does that go on?
- Three weeks now...

588
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:20,634
...at $4.50 a foot.
- Yeah, right.

589
00:48:20,812 --> 00:48:24,179
I think I'd better have a little talk
with Mr. Tesander.

590
00:48:26,484 --> 00:48:28,577
Mr. Tesander?

591
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:32,887
Mr. Tesander!

592
00:48:35,093 --> 00:48:37,118
- Yep?
- How's it coming?

593
00:48:37,295 --> 00:48:39,422
It's coming.

594
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:45,665
Mr. Tesander?

595
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:53,241
- Yep?
- What I meant was...

596
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:54,878
...how far down are you?

597
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:58,243
Oh, about 130 feet.

598
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:01,884
- Isn't that pretty deep?
- Yep.

599
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:06,183
I mean, do you think perhaps
you ought to try another spot?

600
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:07,653
Up to you.

601
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:11,822
Haven't you hit anything yet at all?

602
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:15,797
Hit some limestone yesterday.

603
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:18,197
- That's good?
- That's bad.

604
00:49:19,404 --> 00:49:22,999
Right now, looks like
we're coming into some shale.

605
00:49:23,174 --> 00:49:26,041
- That's bad?
- That's good.

606
00:49:26,378 --> 00:49:30,747
- But it might turn out to be sandstone.
- That's bad.

607
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,550
Can't tell.

608
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:36,084
Might be good, might be bad.

609
00:49:36,488 --> 00:49:41,187
One thing you know: You got plenty shale,
sandstone and limestone.

610
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,827
- I see.
- Mr. Tesander.

611
00:49:43,995 --> 00:49:45,826
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

612
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:49,660
Just for the record, of course,
what happened to water?

613
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:52,462
Oh, it's there, all right.

614
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:55,162
Just got to be patient.

615
00:50:02,714 --> 00:50:06,616
- What's wrong with the steam shovel?
- I better go and take a look.

616
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:09,476
- Jim!
- Come here.

617
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:12,818
Thank you.

618
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:22,962
- What's the matter? Is something wrong?
- How do you like that?

619
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:26,467
I broke my bucket.
Two times this week, I broke my bucket.

620
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:31,003
- What did you do, hit a boulder?
- That's no boulder. That's a ledge.

621
00:50:31,176 --> 00:50:34,236
- What does that mean?
- Means we gotta blast.

622
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:37,313
- Blast?
- Blast, with dynamite.

623
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:40,885
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, "what do you mean"?

624
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:45,318
Mr. Zucca explained, he has to use
dynamite to blast to get rid of the rock.

625
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,685
That's no rock. That's a ledge.

626
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,260
What Mr. Blandings means is,
what precisely is a ledge?

627
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:55,195
A ledge is like a big stone,
only it's bigger.

628
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,362
- Like a boulder.
- No, like a ledge.

629
00:50:59,304 --> 00:51:01,898
- Like a ledge.
- But you don't have to worry.

630
00:51:02,073 --> 00:51:06,737
It only costs $6 a cubic yard,
plus the dynamite and the fuse.

631
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,172
How far will you have to blast?

632
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:15,752
Hard to tell. Might be a little baby ledge,
might run the whole top of the mountain.

633
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:18,920
At $6 a yard,
do you realize what that means?

634
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,183
It means we gotta blast.

635
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:29,597
With a few minor deviations,
I know exactly where every penny is going.

636
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:32,258
- Is that all?
- Yes, thanks.

637
00:51:35,006 --> 00:51:37,270
- Hi.
- Hello, Bill. Come in.

638
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:41,139
I've been going over the Knapp contracts
with old man Dascomb.

639
00:51:42,347 --> 00:51:45,373
While I was in there,
the conversation got around to you.

640
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:49,247
- Oh, what is it?
- Well, he didn't say in so many words...

641
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:53,584
...that since you started with that house
you haven't come up with one slogan.

642
00:51:53,758 --> 00:51:56,283
- But?
- But...

643
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:58,294
- Where is it?
- It's there.

644
00:52:00,632 --> 00:52:04,693
But since the Wham account
is the backbone of this agency...

645
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:07,770
...I kind of felt that he kind of felt...

646
00:52:07,939 --> 00:52:13,138
...that if I kind of told you, you'd know that
he knew that you knew, or something...

647
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:16,712
What's he worrying about?
The deadline is six months off.

648
00:52:19,317 --> 00:52:22,081
- Yeah?
- <i>Mrs. Blandings calling from Lansdale.</i>

649
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:23,584
Okay.

650
00:52:24,022 --> 00:52:26,149
Yes, Muriel? What?

651
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:31,123
Tesander struck water?
Say, that's wonderful!

652
00:52:31,296 --> 00:52:34,356
- Bill, we've got our well!
- Congratulations.

653
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,631
What?

654
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:38,096
What's that?

655
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:40,931
What do you mean,
we've got two wells?

656
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:47,605
I'll be right out.
Come on, Bill.

657
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:14,997
So you hit a spring, a bubbling spring,
right here in our cellar.

658
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:17,869
It has to be diverted
before Retch can pour cement.

659
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:21,341
May take a while.
Pumps are over in Jersey.

660
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:29,747
- Water, Mr. Tesander.
- Yep.

661
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:32,014
At 6 feet.

662
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,623
Yep.

663
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:39,923
And just over there, you had to go down
227 feet to hit the same water.

664
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:44,657
- Yep.
- Now, how do you account for that?

665
00:53:44,836 --> 00:53:48,670
Well, the way it appears to me,
Mr. Blandings...

666
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,243
...over here, the water
is down around 6 feet.

667
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:55,345
And over there...

668
00:53:55,513 --> 00:53:59,916
...it's down around 227 feet.
- It's down around 227 feet.

669
00:54:00,084 --> 00:54:02,245
Yep.

670
00:54:56,574 --> 00:54:59,134
What's this, another closet?

671
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:02,505
- This happens to be our living room.
- This isn't it.

672
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,673
- Living room's across the hall.
- Then where's the dining room?

673
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:09,376
Well, I think it's...

674
00:55:09,554 --> 00:55:12,523
- Maybe it's this little room.
- That's the breakfast room.

675
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,353
That isn't the breakfast room,
that's the powder room.

676
00:55:16,527 --> 00:55:21,430
- Just where is the dining room?
- It was right here a minute ago.

677
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,898
- We couldn't just have lost it.
- Better put an ad in the paper.

678
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:27,037
I don't get this Blandings at all.

679
00:55:27,205 --> 00:55:31,505
If you build on the windiest hill
in Connecticut, why pick the windiest side?

680
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:36,545
You know those New York millionaires.
Easy come, easy go.

681
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:45,589
- Now, here is the living room. Right?
- Yes. There's the fireplace.

682
00:55:45,757 --> 00:55:49,022
- Come right in.
- After you, Rockefeller.

683
00:55:49,193 --> 00:55:51,661
- Hey, mister. You the owner here?
- Yeah.

684
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:54,161
Just the man I want to see.

685
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:57,233
I'll browse around upstairs.

686
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:05,532
The second-floor lintels between
the lally columns, should we rabbet them?

687
00:56:10,014 --> 00:56:12,482
The second-floor lallies?

688
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,175
Second-floor lintels between the lallies.

689
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:19,415
Oh, the lintels between the lallies.

690
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,890
Yeah, from the blueprints you can't tell.
You want they should be rabbeted?

691
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:29,967
- No, no, I guess not.
- Okay, you're the doctor.

692
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:36,334
Hey, fellas! If you got any of them
rabbeted lintels set, rip them up!

693
00:56:44,315 --> 00:56:48,046
It sounded less expensive to say no.

694
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,311
Stop it! Stop it!

695
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:56,188
Okay, fellas, let's quit!

696
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,761
Now look what you've done.

697
00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:04,765
Look, men!

698
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:07,268
Mrs. Blandings didn't mean anything.

699
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:11,067
There's no point in walking off a job
because a woman makes a remark.

700
00:57:11,242 --> 00:57:14,405
Look, mister, it's Saturday.
We quit at 12:00.

701
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:16,911
Unless you want us to go on overtime.

702
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:20,608
No, no, no. Very kind of you, I'm sure.

703
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:23,117
See you Monday, fellas.

704
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:29,458
I'm sick.

705
00:57:29,627 --> 00:57:32,596
From the outside, this place
looks like a grain elevator.

706
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:36,893
On the inside, everything's miles too small.

707
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:38,960
- What's that?
- What's what?

708
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:43,095
That noise. It's upstairs.

709
00:58:07,131 --> 00:58:10,225
- What happened?
- The door blew shut. I got locked in.

710
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:13,461
Impossible. I had this closet built
especially for myself.

711
00:58:13,638 --> 00:58:17,665
- The lock opens from the inside.
- Maybe for Houdini, not for me.

712
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:21,573
Nothing to it, a child could do it.
Look, I'll show you.

713
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,172
See? It just takes some
good old Yankee know-how.

714
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,808
It's possible, darling, the lock works
for you and not for Bill.

715
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:32,785
- Ridiculous. Even you could do it.
- Thank you.

716
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:34,652
Come on, I'll show you. Get in.

717
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:39,855
Now go ahead, dear. Just open the door.

718
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,802
- I don't seem to be able to...
- Well, it's perfectly simple.

719
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:54,843
You just take the knob
and turn it clockwise.

720
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,929
Nothing like that
good old Yankee know-how.

721
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:19,397
Hey!

722
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,869
Somebody let us out of here!

723
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:35,950
Oh, dear.

724
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:48,494
If I could just get over to that scaffolding.

725
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,773
Seems a shame, but I guess
it's the only way to do it.

726
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:03,243
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't get panicky. I'll get you out of here.

727
01:00:03,414 --> 01:00:07,680
Stand up, Bill.
Hold that over the window.

728
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,755
Stand back, Muriel.

729
01:00:13,024 --> 01:00:15,925
- Ready?
- Roger.

730
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:30,840
In case of emergency, break glass.

731
01:00:31,175 --> 01:00:33,040
Come on, Bill.

732
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:42,013
That's funny. There's no reason
why that shouldn't work.

733
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,361
- Wham again.
- Yes, sir.

734
01:01:01,539 --> 01:01:05,373
- Muriel, I thought we'd agreed...
- Gussie, no more Wham for Mr. Blandings.

735
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:09,406
- What about the rest of us?
- I'm sure there are other substitutes.

736
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:13,038
- Bacon, sausages...
- The children like Wham.

737
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:16,084
- There must be other...
- Mrs. Blandings likes it too.

738
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:19,780
- Just the same...
- And I consider it very tasty.

739
01:01:19,957 --> 01:01:22,983
Gussie, I spend eight hours every day...

740
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,391
...trying to cram this stuff down
the throats of millions.

741
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:30,000
I know all about it.
Its succulent goodness.

742
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:34,501
- Its sugar-smoked tenderness. Its...
- You don't have to sell me. I like it.

743
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:39,634
Oh, thank you.

744
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,835
Just bills.

745
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,173
Darling, I'm going out
to the place this afternoon.

746
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:48,079
Bill's driving me up
to see about the landscaping.

747
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:50,345
That'll be nice.

748
01:01:50,688 --> 01:01:54,215
- What do you mean, Bill's driving you?
- Why do you ask...

749
01:01:54,391 --> 01:01:57,519
...when you know what I mean
and what you mean?

750
01:01:57,828 --> 01:02:01,662
I mean, the moment I turn my back,
Bill Cole's driving you someplace.

751
01:02:01,832 --> 01:02:04,494
- He's being helpful.
- I thought he was a lawyer.

752
01:02:04,668 --> 01:02:08,536
- Why isn't he out suing somebody?
- Bicker, bicker, bicker.

753
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:17,571
- Well, we'll just see about that!
- What is it?

754
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:24,550
- What's the matter, Jim?
- Mr. William Cole, please.

755
01:02:25,556 --> 01:02:27,854
Hello, Bill.
They can't get away with this.

756
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:30,050
I know my rights as a citizen.

757
01:02:30,227 --> 01:02:33,060
Why, this notice from
the owner of this building.

758
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:37,394
He wants our apartment.
He's ordering us to move in 30 days.

759
01:02:37,568 --> 01:02:40,833
How can I move into a house
that isn't even finished?

760
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:44,441
There are no windows, no plaster, no paint...

761
01:02:44,608 --> 01:02:47,634
Listen to me.
I have no intention of moving in 30 days.

762
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:53,113
This is not legal. I'll fight it and
I don't care if it takes every penny I've got.

763
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:56,776
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

764
01:02:56,954 --> 01:02:58,922
- All right.
- Well?

765
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:01,887
We're moving in 30 days.

766
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:09,096
<i>So came 30 days. And they moved.</i>

767
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:14,604
<i>That is, we moved.</i>

768
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:18,774
<i>Well, there she is, bright and shiny.</i>

769
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:22,379
<i>And just about complete.</i>

770
01:03:22,546 --> 01:03:27,313
<i>The residence</i>
<i>of Mr. And Mrs. James Blandings.</i>

771
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:30,751
<i>"All right, everybody out."</i>

772
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:35,982
<i>Guess you can't blame them</i>
<i>for feeling just a little bit proud.</i>

773
01:03:37,728 --> 01:03:40,390
<i>Even Theodore's proud.</i>

774
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:45,534
<i>"All right, men. Let's have a little action."</i>
<i>"Okay, Mac."</i>

775
01:03:50,441 --> 01:03:52,932
<i>The big moment.</i>

776
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:56,939
<i>Look. He wants to carry her</i>
<i>across the threshold.</i>

777
01:03:57,114 --> 01:03:58,672
<i>Isn't that romantic?</i>

778
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:07,389
<i>Watch that sacroiliac.</i>

779
01:04:07,558 --> 01:04:11,085
<i>Fifteen years since you've done</i>
<i>this sort of thing.</i>

780
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:15,463
<i>Nice work, Tarzan. Now let's see</i>
<i>if you can make it into the living room.</i>

781
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:18,793
<i>That's right. Go right in.</i>
<i>Don't pay attention to the sign.</i>

782
01:04:21,472 --> 01:04:24,908
<i>"Look where you're going!</i>
<i>Can't you see I'm varnishing?"</i>

783
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,875
<i>"Stop painting that floor</i>
<i>and put some planks down in here!"</i>

784
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:34,507
<i>"Okay, Mac, but take it easy.</i>
<i>The Republicans ain't in yet, you know. "</i>

785
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:45,355
<i>"There. I'll just see Simms about this."</i>

786
01:04:45,529 --> 01:04:49,556
<i>"Oh, Father! Wait till you see</i>
<i>what we found. "</i>

787
01:04:52,303 --> 01:04:54,032
<i>"Now what?</i>

788
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:57,706
<i>Oh, fine. No windows.</i>

789
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:01,003
<i>Well, we'll just see Simms</i>
<i>about that too. "</i>

790
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:05,843
- Where's Simms?
- Around back, figuring out them windows.

791
01:05:06,016 --> 01:05:09,349
- What's the problem? You put windows up.
- These don't fit.

792
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,852
Oh, they don't, don't they?

793
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:15,891
Mr. Blandings, you'd better
take a look at these bills.

794
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,824
- What about the windows?
- There's been a slip-up.

795
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:21,897
These windows belong
to a Mr. Landing in Fishkill.

796
01:05:22,066 --> 01:05:25,160
- I spoke to him on the phone.
- Well, has he got mine?

797
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:30,706
No. He seems to have some windows that
belong to a Mr. Blandsworth in Peekskill.

798
01:05:30,874 --> 01:05:34,139
- Where are my windows?
- As near as we can find out...

799
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:37,007
...they've been sent
to a Mr. Banning in Danbury...

800
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:39,376
...or a Mr. Bamberger in Waterbury.

801
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:43,713
Shall we spend the rest of our lives
in a house without windows?

802
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:45,821
It will only be a few days.

803
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:50,323
- What's a "Zuz-zuz water softener"?
- How should I know?

804
01:05:50,494 --> 01:05:52,724
You've got one.

805
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:59,428
"Furnishing and installing
one Zuz-zuz water softener, $285..."

806
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:02,663
- I didn't order that!
- I authorized that, Mr. Blandings.

807
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,104
- To save your boiler and water pipes.
- From?

808
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:07,800
Rust. The plumber says
the water in your well...

809
01:06:07,978 --> 01:06:10,947
...is the most corrosive
in his entire experience.

810
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:14,380
- Another first.
- Well, if it's necessary, put it in.

811
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:16,951
- We're moving in today...
- It's in.

812
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:20,056
- Then get me the bill for it.
- You've got it.

813
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:22,522
Well, all right, then.

814
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,735
- That's right, upstairs in the bedroom.
- Mother!

815
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:41,708
- The moving vans just left...
- Never mind. Help Gussie in the kitchen.

816
01:06:41,879 --> 01:06:45,042
- Now, Mr. PeDelford, we'll discuss painting.
- Okay.

817
01:06:45,215 --> 01:06:49,413
I had some samples.
Here we are.

818
01:06:49,586 --> 01:06:51,918
Now, first, the living room.

819
01:06:52,089 --> 01:06:55,388
I want it to be a soft green.

820
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:58,528
- Not as blue-green as a robin's egg.
- No.

821
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:02,631
But not as yellow-green as daffodil buds.

822
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:06,699
Now, the only sample I could get
is a little too yellow.

823
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:09,600
But don't let whoever does it
get it too blue.

824
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:14,801
- No.
- It should be a sort of grayish yellow-green.

825
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:19,014
Now the dining room. I'd like yellow.

826
01:07:19,183 --> 01:07:21,845
Not just yellow. A very gay yellow.

827
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:25,011
Something bright and sunshiny.

828
01:07:25,189 --> 01:07:28,852
I tell you, if you'll send one of
your workmen to the grocer...

829
01:07:29,026 --> 01:07:34,362
...for a pound of their best butter and
match that exactly, you can't go wrong.

830
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:38,365
This is the paper we'll use in the hall.
It's flowered.

831
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:41,971
But I don't want the ceiling
to match any colors of the flowers.

832
01:07:42,139 --> 01:07:44,767
There are some little dots
in the background.

833
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:47,342
And it's these dots I want you to match.

834
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:51,311
Not the little greenish dot
near the hollyhock leaf.

835
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:56,146
But the little bluish dot between
the rosebud and the delphinium blossom.

836
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,084
Is that clear?

837
01:07:59,256 --> 01:08:02,157
Now, the kitchen's to be white.

838
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:05,591
- Not a cold, antiseptic, hospital white.
- No.

839
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:11,359
A little warmer, but still, not to
suggest any other color but white.

840
01:08:11,535 --> 01:08:15,437
Now, for the powder room in here,
I want you to match this thread.

841
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:20,475
And don't lose it. It's the only spool
I have and I had an awful time finding it.

842
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:23,579
As you can see,
it's practically an apple red.

843
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:28,548
Somewhere between a healthy Winesap
and an unripened Jonathan.

844
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:31,620
Oh, excuse me.

845
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:37,984
- You got that, Charlie?
- Red, green, blue, yellow, white.

846
01:08:38,161 --> 01:08:39,890
Check.

847
01:08:45,869 --> 01:08:47,302
Oh, Joan.

848
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:49,733
I'm awful sorry.

849
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:53,001
You knew Father was supposed
to carry the heavy things.

850
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:56,304
Father disappeared.
I haven't seen him for an hour.

851
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,210
Where's Uncle Bill, Mother?
He'll miss his train!

852
01:08:59,383 --> 01:09:02,978
If they've run off somewhere,
it certainly isn't very...

853
01:09:04,254 --> 01:09:06,245
Heavens.

854
01:09:14,197 --> 01:09:17,826
- I thought you were going to take care of it.
- I thought you were.

855
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:22,165
You're gonna miss your train, Uncle Bill.
It leaves Lansdale in 25 minutes.

856
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:25,007
I hate to leave this little place.

857
01:09:25,175 --> 01:09:30,169
Just four walls and a couple of nail kegs,
but to me it'll always be home.

858
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:36,782
- Isn't there a later one?
- Not till tomorrow morning at 6:15.

859
01:09:36,954 --> 01:09:39,650
- You mean 7:15.
- No, Dad, 6:15.

860
01:09:39,823 --> 01:09:42,792
What about the 7:15
I'm supposed to take to the office?

861
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,420
There's a little asterisk. The 7:15 runs
only Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

862
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:50,533
What? Bill, let me see that.

863
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:56,538
- Muriel.
- Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it wrong.

864
01:09:56,707 --> 01:10:00,973
That's fine. I'll have to get up
at 5 in the morning to catch the 6:15...

865
01:10:01,144 --> 01:10:05,342
...to get to my office at 8. It opens at 9
and I never get there until 10.

866
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:08,109
Maybe if you start earlier
you can leave earlier.

867
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:11,448
To get home earlier to get to bed earlier
to get up earlier?

868
01:10:11,622 --> 01:10:15,285
Maybe you can get it pushed to 4:15.
Then you won't have to go to bed.

869
01:10:15,459 --> 01:10:18,428
- You'll miss your train.
- I'll drive you to the station.

870
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:20,062
I can drive him!

871
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:24,326
No, dear. You'd better save your strength.
You have to get up at 5.

872
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:36,178
It would be nice if you could
spend your vacation up here, Bill.

873
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:38,814
We'll see how things work out
at the office.

874
01:10:38,982 --> 01:10:44,215
I tell you, I'll scour around and see
if I can find you a cottage in Lansdale.

875
01:10:44,388 --> 01:10:49,087
If you can't find me a cottage,
I can always move back into that closet.

876
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:04,171
- Father!
- Now look what you've done.

877
01:11:10,714 --> 01:11:15,174
Father, the first principle of lighting a fire
is to see if the flue is open.

878
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:18,685
- A 3-year-old child knows that.
- Next time we want a fire...

879
01:11:18,855 --> 01:11:22,586
...l'll send out for a 3-year-old child.
Get that stuff cleaned up...

880
01:11:22,759 --> 01:11:26,525
...then help Gussie set the table.
It's getting late.

881
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:31,825
- Look, Dad. Your fraternity pins.
- Pins? I only had one.

882
01:11:32,002 --> 01:11:35,938
- There are two of them here.
- All right, just put them away.

883
01:11:36,106 --> 01:11:40,099
Funny. This one says
"W.C." on the back of it.

884
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:44,737
W.C.? William Cole!
It must be Uncle Bill's.

885
01:11:44,915 --> 01:11:47,247
Let me see that.

886
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:57,619
- What's that?
- It's Mother's diary from college.

887
01:11:57,794 --> 01:11:59,728
- It's slightly torrid.
- Let's see.

888
01:11:59,896 --> 01:12:01,727
That's none of your business.

889
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:05,356
I'd say Mother and Uncle Bill
were somewhat of an item.

890
01:12:05,535 --> 01:12:08,095
People do not read other people's diaries.

891
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:11,206
That's not a very nice thing to do.
Now, go help Gussie.

892
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:14,002
- What about...?
- I'll take care of that.

893
01:12:28,191 --> 01:12:30,250
Excuse.

894
01:12:39,302 --> 01:12:42,203
Muriel, do you have to do that now?

895
01:12:42,372 --> 01:12:46,035
There's no need to be irritable
because you have to shave at night.

896
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:51,078
- I'm not irritable.
- You haven't said a civil word all evening.

897
01:12:51,248 --> 01:12:54,740
Sometimes a man doesn't feel like talking.

898
01:12:55,218 --> 01:12:58,710
- What is it, dear? Something at the office?
- No.

899
01:12:58,889 --> 01:13:03,417
- You got the new slogan for Wham?
- It's not due yet.

900
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:09,056
It's something.
You're certainly upset about something.

901
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:11,792
I can always tell.

902
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:14,163
I'm not upset.

903
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:19,832
It's just that I don't approve of falsehood
and deception, particularly in my own wife.

904
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,810
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing.

905
01:13:24,147 --> 01:13:29,585
I distinctly remember you saying you gave
Bill back his fraternity pin 15 years ago.

906
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,614
- What?
- Did you or didn't you?

907
01:13:34,024 --> 01:13:37,050
- Did I or didn't I what?
- Give it back to him.

908
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:40,018
Well, of course I did.
If I said I did, I did.

909
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:48,400
Then perhaps you'll have the goodness to
explain how this fell out of your jewel box.

910
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:59,979
- What's so funny?
- You.

911
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,243
You're jealous!

912
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:08,656
If you were so crazy for him,
why didn't you marry him?

913
01:14:08,825 --> 01:14:12,818
- Because I wasn't in love with him.
- That's not what you said in your diary.

914
01:14:12,996 --> 01:14:15,430
Now you've been reading my diary!

915
01:14:15,866 --> 01:14:19,199
It just happened to fall open.
And I happened to look at it.

916
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:22,998
- It just happened.
- I'll just bet.

917
01:14:23,173 --> 01:14:25,835
- It's all over the book!
- The children.

918
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:29,944
Then why don't you admit it.
You were in love with Bill Cole.

919
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:34,675
Of course I was in love with Bill. Those days,
I was in love with a new man every week.

920
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:38,287
- Then why did you marry me?
- I'm beginning to wonder.

921
01:14:38,455 --> 01:14:42,323
Maybe it was those big cow eyes
or that ridiculous hole in your chin.

922
01:14:42,492 --> 01:14:46,121
Maybe I knew you were gonna bring
me out to this $38,000 icebox...

923
01:14:46,296 --> 01:14:50,824
...with a dried-up stream and no windows.
Maybe I happened to fall in love with you...

924
01:14:51,001 --> 01:14:53,595
...but for heaven's sakes,
don't ask me why!

925
01:15:07,517 --> 01:15:10,111
What time is it?

926
01:15:10,287 --> 01:15:12,778
- 9:20.
- Thank you.

927
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:17,052
Muriel, would it do any good
to say I'm sorry?

928
01:15:17,761 --> 01:15:21,424
- I don't know.
- Well, I am.

929
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:28,498
I've behaved like a schoolboy
and I'm sorry.

930
01:15:30,373 --> 01:15:32,568
Oh, Jim.

931
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,621
Why don't you take the soap
out of your ears.

932
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,725
Why do I love you so much?

933
01:15:55,498 --> 01:15:58,524
Darling, it's awfully late.

934
01:16:01,304 --> 01:16:04,273
Maybe you ought to go down
and lock the doors.

935
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:07,774
What for? The windows
are all open anyway.

936
01:16:10,747 --> 01:16:13,910
You have to get up at 5:00.

937
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,645
Yeah, I guess so.

938
01:16:22,759 --> 01:16:24,920
Good night.

939
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:28,121
Good night.

940
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:52,078
<i>So the days sped by.</i>
<i>And the bills and the extras.</i>

941
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,951
<i>And as autumn reared its lovely head...</i>

942
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:57,457
<i>... so did the deadline for Jim's slogan.</i>

943
01:16:57,627 --> 01:17:00,095
<i>It was practically a photo finish.</i>

944
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:06,195
Send out for sandwiches and coffee.
Looks like an all-night session.

945
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:09,395
- What did Mr. Dascomb say?
- He said, "Blandings...

946
01:17:09,572 --> 01:17:13,167
"...I want that slogan on my desk
by 9 in the morning. Check?"

947
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,642
- I said, "Check."
- You'll have to dream something up...

948
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:22,012
...good or bad.
- I got the impression that it better be good.

949
01:17:24,554 --> 01:17:27,421
Funny how you look forward
to the little things.

950
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:29,956
Rain, for instance.

951
01:17:31,094 --> 01:17:35,895
For a month now I've been looking forward
to the first rainy night at the house.

952
01:17:36,132 --> 01:17:40,933
Big, blazing fire.
Muriel pouring coffee.

953
01:17:41,638 --> 01:17:43,765
Me in my new smoking jacket.

954
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:48,309
With my pipe and slippers,
reading my newspaper.

955
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:50,376
Well.

956
01:17:52,849 --> 01:17:55,818
Do you suppose my clothes are dry yet?

957
01:17:56,352 --> 01:17:58,946
Thank heavens. The children.

958
01:17:59,122 --> 01:18:02,455
Sit still. You look too comfortable.

959
01:18:07,163 --> 01:18:09,791
What a night!
I'm Harry Selby from down the road.

960
01:18:09,966 --> 01:18:12,025
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

961
01:18:12,202 --> 01:18:15,228
I'm afraid I'm gonna get your place all wet.

962
01:18:15,405 --> 01:18:19,364
I just came in to tell you that
the kids are safe, Mr. Blandings.

963
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:23,270
Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings.
Cole's the name. Bill Cole.

964
01:18:23,446 --> 01:18:26,904
Friend of the family.
Just came in out of the rain.

965
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:31,415
- I'm Mrs. Blandings.
- Oh, how do?

966
01:18:32,088 --> 01:18:35,080
Mrs. Williams called and says
your phone is out of order.

967
01:18:35,258 --> 01:18:39,524
She wanted me to tell you the water's
rising. They've got the bridge roped off.

968
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:44,292
- Your girls will spend the night at her place.
- Thank you. I was beginning to worry.

969
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:47,698
- She'll take good care of them.
- May I get you some coffee?

970
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:52,274
No, thank you. I'd better get back
before I have to swim for it.

971
01:18:52,442 --> 01:18:55,104
- Night, Mrs. Blandings.
- I'm very grateful.

972
01:18:55,278 --> 01:19:00,375
- Not at all. Night, Mr. Bland...
- Cole. Bill Cole. Friend of the family.

973
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:02,245
Just came in out of the rain.

974
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:08,018
- Well, good night.
- Good night. And thank you.

975
01:19:12,762 --> 01:19:15,663
No bridge. That's fine.

976
01:19:15,832 --> 01:19:19,700
- How do I get back to Lansdale?
- You'll just have to spend the night here.

977
01:19:19,869 --> 01:19:23,464
Muriel, really? With your husband
in New York and your children away?

978
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,235
- Think of my reputation.
- Don't worry, Snow White.

979
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:32,143
You'll be as just pure and unsullied in the
morning as you were the night before.

980
01:19:32,315 --> 01:19:34,977
That's the story of my life.

981
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:18,319
<i>Compare the price</i>
<i>Compare the slice</i>

982
01:20:18,494 --> 01:20:20,928
<i>Take our advice</i>
<i>Buy Wham!</i>

983
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:53,185
<i>If you'd buy better ham</i>
<i>You'd better buy Wham</i>

984
01:20:53,363 --> 01:20:54,955
It's Boyle Petroleum.

985
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:58,032
<i>If you'd buy better oil</i>
<i>You'd better buy Boyle</i>

986
01:20:58,968 --> 01:21:00,765
Yeah.

987
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:25,921
<i>This little piggy went to market</i>
<i>As meek and as mild as a lamb</i>

988
01:21:26,095 --> 01:21:29,622
<i>He smiled in his tracks</i>
<i>When they slipped him the ax</i>

989
01:21:29,799 --> 01:21:32,700
<i>He knew he'd turn out to be Wham</i>

990
01:21:35,071 --> 01:21:39,405
Yeah.
"He knew he'd turn out to be Wham."

991
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:43,235
It's gone! I've lost my touch.

992
01:21:43,413 --> 01:21:47,543
Oh, well. Maybe I never had a touch.
Who knows? I can't think anymore.

993
01:21:47,717 --> 01:21:51,244
All I've got on my mind is a house
with an $ 18,000 mortgage.

994
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:55,551
And bills and extras
and antiques and, and...

995
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:59,058
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

996
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:16,402
- Where are you going?
- Home to get some sleep. You do the same.

997
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:18,706
- But you haven't...
- Suppose I haven't.

998
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:22,112
- This isn't the only job in town.
- What'll I tell Mr. Dascomb?

999
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:26,221
Oh, just tell him to...!
Just tell him.

1000
01:22:53,616 --> 01:22:58,053
- I'm sorry Jim isn't here.
- I was on my way to town anyway.

1001
01:22:58,221 --> 01:23:01,884
- Thought I might catch Jim.
- Sure you won't stay to breakfast?

1002
01:23:02,058 --> 01:23:05,619
- No, thanks very much all the same.
- Darling!

1003
01:23:05,795 --> 01:23:08,320
- Good morning, dear.
- You must be exhausted.

1004
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:11,691
- How did it go?
- Fine, fine.

1005
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:15,304
- Everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

1006
01:23:16,172 --> 01:23:19,505
Oh, hello, Henry. What are you doing up
with the morning dew?

1007
01:23:19,675 --> 01:23:22,872
Came to check the blueprints.
Some extras came in from Retch.

1008
01:23:23,045 --> 01:23:25,673
There are a couple things
we should go over.

1009
01:23:25,848 --> 01:23:28,510
- Really? What are they?
- Well, let's see.

1010
01:23:28,684 --> 01:23:32,586
A few things here that are all right, I guess.

1011
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:37,055
- "Mortising five butts, $ 1.98."
- Let's not quibble about it.

1012
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:40,195
A man's entitled to mortise
a few butts now and then.

1013
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:45,892
- "Extra hardware, $3.89."
- Petty larceny, but let them get away with it.

1014
01:23:46,736 --> 01:23:51,764
Now, there's one here that, frankly,
I don't understand. Here we are.

1015
01:23:51,941 --> 01:23:57,208
"Changes in closet, $ 1247."
Did you authorize that?

1016
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:00,281
Well, we probably told him to...

1017
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:04,477
- Twelve hundred and what?
- $47. "Changes in closet."

1018
01:24:04,654 --> 01:24:07,088
That's the end!

1019
01:24:08,124 --> 01:24:11,150
What's this notation?
"Refer to detail sheet 135."

1020
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:16,959
Near as I can remember, that's something
in back of the house. Let's take a look.

1021
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:19,662
Here we are.

1022
01:24:21,804 --> 01:24:25,638
It isn't a closet at all.
It's off the back pantry.

1023
01:24:25,808 --> 01:24:29,005
Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.

1024
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,743
Oh, Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.

1025
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:37,818
You didn't authorize any changes, did you?

1026
01:24:37,987 --> 01:24:41,787
Well, they certainly weren't changes.

1027
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:45,724
- What have you done?
- I haven't done anything.

1028
01:24:45,895 --> 01:24:50,025
All I did was... Just nothing at all.

1029
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:54,203
What have you done?

1030
01:24:54,937 --> 01:24:56,564
Well...

1031
01:24:56,739 --> 01:25:01,836
All I did was, one day I saw four pieces
of flagstone left over from the porch...

1032
01:25:02,011 --> 01:25:06,072
...that were just going to be thrown away.
And I asked Mr. Retch...

1033
01:25:06,249 --> 01:25:09,150
...if he wouldn't put them
on the flower room floor...

1034
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:13,186
...and poke a little cement between
the cracks and make a stone floor...

1035
01:25:13,356 --> 01:25:15,984
...where it might be wet
with flowers and things.

1036
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:18,092
That's absolutely all I did.

1037
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:21,956
- That's all you did.
- Absolutely.

1038
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:25,396
Just four little pieces of flagstone.

1039
01:25:25,568 --> 01:25:30,232
- Did you, by any chance, authorize a drain?
- Of course I didn't.

1040
01:25:30,406 --> 01:25:35,742
All I said was that I wanted
a nice, dry stone floor...

1041
01:25:36,312 --> 01:25:39,804
...and Mr. Retch was just as nice
as he could be and said:

1042
01:25:39,982 --> 01:25:41,745
"Well, you're the doctor."

1043
01:25:41,918 --> 01:25:45,513
And that was all that anybody said
to anybody about anything.

1044
01:25:49,792 --> 01:25:53,421
- Well?
- I think I can tell you what happened.

1045
01:25:53,596 --> 01:25:56,622
First, the carpenters had
to rip out the flooring.

1046
01:25:56,799 --> 01:26:02,704
Those planks run under the width of the
pantry, so Retch had to knock out the wall.

1047
01:26:02,872 --> 01:26:08,003
Then he had to chop off the top of
the joists to make room for the cradle.

1048
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:12,614
I guess he got some iron straps and fastened
them to a large pan to hold the cement.

1049
01:26:12,782 --> 01:26:14,909
With that load on the weakened joists...

1050
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:18,281
...I bet he had to put a lally column
down there for support.

1051
01:26:18,454 --> 01:26:20,979
- I'll bet.
- It was just four little flagstones...

1052
01:26:21,157 --> 01:26:25,184
- Quiet!
- The main soil pipe runs under there.

1053
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:29,897
So Retch had to get the plumber back,
take out a section to get the cradle set.

1054
01:26:30,066 --> 01:26:33,502
And I'll bet he had to change
the pitch of the soil pipe.

1055
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:36,331
- Good morning, Mr. Cole.
- Morning. Morning, Jim.

1056
01:26:36,505 --> 01:26:37,767
Hello, Bill.

1057
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,205
And there are hot and cold water pipes
right under the pantry.

1058
01:26:41,377 --> 01:26:44,073
They'd run to the bathroom
on the second floor...

1059
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:46,737
The bridge was roped off.
Bill had to stay here.

1060
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:49,817
- Slept like a rock.
...about 60 feet of armored cable...

1061
01:26:49,986 --> 01:26:52,216
...between the main panel
and junction box.

1062
01:26:52,388 --> 01:26:54,720
Including the 220-volt cable
to the stove.

1063
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:58,053
Morning, everybody. What a night!

1064
01:26:58,227 --> 01:27:01,924
I never seen so much rain
in all my natural life!

1065
01:27:02,164 --> 01:27:06,100
- Gussie spent the night in Lansdale.
- I passed the girls at the Williams'.

1066
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:10,102
- They'll be on any minute.
- Thank you. You better start breakfast.

1067
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:12,069
Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,878
Where were we?

1069
01:27:17,146 --> 01:27:20,582
We were at the 220-volt cable
that goes to the stove.

1070
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,150
And there are water pipes
hooked to the...

1071
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:26,948
Just a minute. You mean the children
weren't here last night either?

1072
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:30,251
- How could they? The bridge was closed.
- I just came across.

1073
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:33,520
- It was closed last night!
- It's open now.

1074
01:27:33,729 --> 01:27:37,028
Well, if you'll all excuse me,
I think I'll just go upstairs...

1075
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,259
...and slip into something
a little more comfortable.

1076
01:27:43,472 --> 01:27:45,531
I guess that's about the size of it.

1077
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:49,804
Except that Retch had to repair
the pantry wall. And he couldn't possibly...

1078
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:53,710
...have broken through it without...
- All right, we'll take care of it.

1079
01:27:53,883 --> 01:27:58,479
I'll admit, it's a little steep, but I'll try
and get Retch to knock $ 100 off the bill.

1080
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:01,646
- Lf I can't get that, I'll certainly try for 75.
- Fine.

1081
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:06,591
- Lf not 75, I'll make a stab at 50.
- You do that.

1082
01:28:07,897 --> 01:28:11,424
Anyhow, I'm almost sure we can get 25.

1083
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:16,001
- Good day.
- Good day.

1084
01:28:16,172 --> 01:28:17,639
Bye.

1085
01:28:19,909 --> 01:28:21,501
Darling.

1086
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:23,235
You're upset.

1087
01:28:23,713 --> 01:28:25,908
You've got a lot of things on your mind.

1088
01:28:26,082 --> 01:28:29,176
Muriel, there's only
one thing I've got on my mind:

1089
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:31,683
This house and how soon
we can get rid of it!

1090
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:34,220
- That's not what you're thinking.
- Maybe.

1091
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:36,551
Maybe I'm thinking
I was once a happy man.

1092
01:28:36,726 --> 01:28:40,526
I didn't have a closet or three bathrooms,
but I did have my sanity...

1093
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:43,893
...a few dollars, two children
and a wife I could trust!

1094
01:28:44,066 --> 01:28:47,661
- That's a fine thing to say.
- I also had a job at Dascomb and Banton.

1095
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:50,567
- Something I don't have at the moment.
- Jim!

1096
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:54,198
That's right, I've resigned.
We're starting all over from scratch.

1097
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:57,607
- And without this house!
- You love this house.

1098
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:02,649
I hate it. From its rabbeted lintels
to its Zuz-zuz water softener.

1099
01:29:02,818 --> 01:29:05,582
- You know you don't mean that.
- Every word of it.

1100
01:29:05,755 --> 01:29:07,916
Anybody who builds
a house today is crazy!

1101
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:11,958
The minute you start, they put you
on the all-American sucker list.

1102
01:29:12,128 --> 01:29:15,188
You start out to build a home
and wind up in the poorhouse!

1103
01:29:15,364 --> 01:29:19,061
If it can happen to me, what about
those who aren't making $ 15,000?

1104
01:29:19,235 --> 01:29:22,136
What about the newlyweds
who want a home of their own?

1105
01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:27,367
It's a conspiracy, I tell you, against every
boy and girl who were ever in love!

1106
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:29,844
What do you want?

1107
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:37,511
Mr. Blandings,
there's a matter of $ 12.36.

1108
01:29:38,387 --> 01:29:42,289
Twelve dollars and thirty-six cents.

1109
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:45,192
Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander?

1110
01:29:45,361 --> 01:29:48,819
Here, take everything I've got.
Spread it out amongst your pals!

1111
01:29:49,298 --> 01:29:51,562
Perhaps Retch
would like a little something.

1112
01:29:51,734 --> 01:29:56,671
Maybe Zucca could use my new smoking
jacket! It's open house! Help yourself!

1113
01:29:56,839 --> 01:29:59,307
Now, hold on, Mr. Blandings.

1114
01:29:59,475 --> 01:30:03,878
This $ 12.36 you don't owe me.
I owe you.

1115
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:09,277
- What was that?
- Yep.

1116
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:14,184
Found I overcharged you,
almost three feet.

1117
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:18,852
Better count it. I think it's all there.

1118
01:30:20,496 --> 01:30:23,556
Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.

1119
01:30:25,601 --> 01:30:27,125
Well...

1120
01:30:27,636 --> 01:30:29,900
...I guess I better be going.

1121
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,473
You sure got a pretty place here.

1122
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,944
Take good care of it.

1123
01:30:41,217 --> 01:30:44,744
I'll tell Mr. Zucca
about the smoking jacket.

1124
01:30:50,426 --> 01:30:52,553
Darling, what did you mean?

1125
01:30:52,728 --> 01:30:55,788
Are we really going to
have to sell this house?

1126
01:30:57,032 --> 01:31:01,196
I don't know, dear.
I don't know anything anymore.

1127
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:05,503
In case anyone's interested,
I'm leaving for town.

1128
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:10,873
Oh, Mr. Tesander!
Could you give me a lift into Lansdale?

1129
01:31:11,046 --> 01:31:14,015
- Yep.
- Fine, I'll be right with you.

1130
01:31:16,452 --> 01:31:19,580
If you wanna count
the silverware, I'll wait.

1131
01:31:19,822 --> 01:31:21,483
Be patient with me, Bill.

1132
01:31:21,657 --> 01:31:24,319
Maybe one of these days
I'll grow up.

1133
01:31:24,493 --> 01:31:28,452
- What happened to him?
- $ 12.36.

1134
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:31,594
You mind if I say something?

1135
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:35,931
Ever since this thing started, I've been
the voice of doom about the project.

1136
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:40,371
Every step of the way, I've been convinced
you were getting fleeced, bilked...

1137
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:43,534
...rooked, flimflammed,
and generally taken to the cleaners.

1138
01:31:43,712 --> 01:31:47,876
Maybe you were. Maybe it cost you
a lot more than you thought it would.

1139
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:51,213
Maybe there were times
when you wish you'd never started.

1140
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:54,920
But when I look at what
you two have got here...

1141
01:31:55,491 --> 01:31:57,482
Well, I don't know.

1142
01:31:58,427 --> 01:32:02,761
Maybe there are some things you should
buy with your heart, not your head.

1143
01:32:04,033 --> 01:32:07,161
Maybe those are the things
that really count.

1144
01:32:07,403 --> 01:32:09,337
Well, see you around.

1145
01:32:09,505 --> 01:32:10,995
Bye, dear.

1146
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:24,045
- Oh, oh, Uncle Bill!
- Well, hi!

1147
01:32:24,219 --> 01:32:28,485
I heard all about it, you had a wonderful
night. Your mother's in there. Goodbye!

1148
01:32:28,657 --> 01:32:30,420
Bye! Morning, everybody.

1149
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,526
Dad, why aren't you at the office?

1150
01:32:33,896 --> 01:32:37,662
- Well, I'm on a kind of vacation.
- You mean you got fired?

1151
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:41,198
- We'll discuss it later.
- Come and get it, everybody!

1152
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:44,601
- Breakfast is ready!
- Good, I'm starving! What are we having?

1153
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:47,207
Orange juice, scrambled eggs
and you-know-what!

1154
01:32:47,376 --> 01:32:49,970
- Ham?
- Not ham, Wham!

1155
01:32:50,145 --> 01:32:52,943
If you ain't eating Wham,
you ain't eating ham!

1156
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:55,844
Now, you kids go wash your hands.

1157
01:32:56,051 --> 01:33:00,511
Muriel! Darling!
Give Gussie a $ 10 raise!

1158
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:14,726
Drop in and see us sometime.

1159
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:16,632
Yeah, do that.

1160
01:33:57,379 --> 01:33:58,368
