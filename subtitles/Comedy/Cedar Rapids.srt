1
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,655
One of the reasons I love Brown
 Valley so much

2
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,657
is that when you do business here,

3
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,076
chances are good you know the
person you're dealing with.

4
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,789
They're a neighbor or a friend or a
 friend of a friend.

5
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,376
And you can trust them because
they're part of a community.

6
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,213
If there is a bad egg around,
people find out pretty fast.

7
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,884
This is why BrownStar Insurance
has prospered for 25 years.

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,802
We always do right by our customers.

9
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,430
Kurt, Pam,

10
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,932
this policy's gonna save you $400 a year,

11
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,350
and it covers everything you need.

12
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,227
Down the road, you win the lottery,
come back on in here,

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,271
and I'll sell you the spendiest
policy we got.

14
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,441
Seriously, guys, I'm gonna
 take care of you.

15
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,130
Hello, Mrs. Vanderhei.

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,507
It's Macy, Tim.

17
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,425
I told you to call me Macy.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,760
Sorry, I keep forgetting.

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,303
It's a hard habit to break.

20
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,180
Well, you better get it right soon or

21
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,016
I'm gonna have to make you stay
after school.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,648
Bring it. Bring it.

23
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,697
There you go.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,451
Do you realize I used to just stare
and stare at you

25
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,079
when you were teaching us about
the rainforests or whatever?

26
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,081
And I would think,

27
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,625
"I wonder what Mrs. V looks like with
her clothes off."

28
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:13,799
And then, boom, we run into each
other in line at True Value

29
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,552
and, boom, here we are, making love.

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,053
Like, once a week.

31
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,639
It's like it was fate or something.

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,560
Did you ever used to look at me and
think dirty things?

33
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,895
You were 12.

34
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,564
Right.

35
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,276
I got you something.

36
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,747
It's a scarlet tanager. Mmm.

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,083
Like the birds you had in
your classroom.

38
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,212
That's very sweet. Thank you.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,630
Wait, wait.

40
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,591
Look on his wing.

41
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,843
Hmm.

42
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,678
Isn't that pretty? Is that a...

43
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,846
It's a promise ring.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,225
Promising what?

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,561
Well...

46
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,606
We're just having a good time here.

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,109
No, we're not. We're having the best time.

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,410
Hi, I'm Roger Lemke.

49
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,580
At BrownStar Insurance,
 we endeavor to give you

50
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,999
the coverage you need at the
best prices around.

51
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,002
It's the reason that BrownStar
Insurance has been awarded

52
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,504
the prestigious Two Diamond Award

53
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,132
from the American Society of
Mutual Insurers

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,718
for three years running.

55
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,012
Because at BrownStar Insurance,

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,972
we insure your dreams.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,891
Holy Christmas!

58
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,517
You knocked her out of the park.

59
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,604
You knocked it out of the G-D park, buddy!

60
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,981
I'm just a pretty face.
That copy was all you, Bill.

61
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,066
Well, I...

62
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,317
I do have one gripe with you, boss.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,653
Mmm-hmm? If you'd waited till
 after Cedar Rapids,

64
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,072
I could have won the Two Diamonds
for you four years running.

65
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,323
Four years!

66
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,158
How do you it, Roger?

67
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,245
So proud of you, Roggie. Mmm...

68
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,998
Hey, Roger.

69
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,834
Tim Lippe! I didn't even see you there.

70
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,671
Oh, man.

71
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,339
Did you see it?

72
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,049
Yeah. You were so awesome.

73
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,300
Oh! Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

74
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,718
Super awesome. Just...

75
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,303
Hey, Roger.

76
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,347
Watch your back, Brad Pitt.

77
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,059
Thank you for the kind words, buddy.

78
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,438
Wow, cake.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,733
Awesome.

80
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,115
Hello?

81
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,658
Tim, it's Bill.

82
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,867
Hey, Bill.

83
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,119
He's gone! Tim, he's gone.

84
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,079
Oh, God, I can't believe it.

85
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,373
What?

86
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,457
It's Roger.

87
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,459
What are you... What are you talking about?

88
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,378
Gwen found him in the bathroom.

89
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,630
He had a belt tied around his neck.

90
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,215
Oh, my gosh.

91
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,551
He was half naked, Tim.

92
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,760
Oh, jeez.

93
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,536
All this time, Roger was some
 kind of twisted deviant.

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,663
Bill, the way Roger died was an accident.

95
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,708
Believe what you want,
but people are talking, Tim.

96
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,420
Commitment to God is a big part
 of the Two Diamonds.

97
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,255
Big part.

98
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,257
Now, people are talking.

99
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,761
Hey, come here, come here. Here you go.

100
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,182
This was Roger's Two Diamonds presentation.

101
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,976
Yeah, and it's a guaranteed
Two Diamond winner.

102
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,394
And believe me, I'd go myself,

103
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,813
but I'm locked in to my daughter's
wedding over in Gladstone

104
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,523
I got no flex.

105
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,026
What are you saying, Bill?

106
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,944
I am saying, you need to go down there

107
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,738
and give this presentation, Tim.

108
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,448
I can't go to Cedar Rapids.

109
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,450
You can't... You don't want to
send me to Cedar Rapids.

110
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,161
All right, listen to me, you were what, 16,

111
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,871
when I gave you that filing job

112
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,206
right after your mom passed?

113
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,542
You were living on your own,
pretty much. All by yourself.

114
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,421
And I'm thinking, "Now, here's
a kid who's gonna go places."

115
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,799
And then somehow, you just didn't.

116
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,218
I can't. You're all I got, kid.

117
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,263
I need you to go down there and prove
that BrownStar is a good outfit,

118
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,725
an upstanding goddamn Christian outfit.

119
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,605
Now, the only thing you have to
worry about getting good with

120
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,191
is Orin Helgesson.

121
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,943
He's the president.

122
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,529
He's the final decider on the Two Diamonds.

123
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,614
So, near the end of the weekend,

124
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,909
you're gonna sit down
one-on-one with him in his suite

125
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,661
and deliver that presentation.

126
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,957
He needs to be convinced that we're
still worthy of that award.

127
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,252
If we don't fix this,
 our clients will leave us, Tim.

128
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,503
And we'll all be out in the street.

129
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,340
Farmers are confronted with
an unpredictable risk-filled...

130
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,219
Unpredictable world of
risk-filled uncertainty.

131
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,723
- Cedar Rapids.
- Cedar Rapids.

132
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,685
I can't believe that I'm actually
going. But I gotta do it, right?

133
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,311
I mean, it's not just my job.

134
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,314
Six other people's entire
 livelihoods depend on this.

135
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,526
Plus Carol, who does
part-time seasonal work, so...

136
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,819
You'll be fine.

137
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,156
Hey, Charlie. Tim, what's up?

138
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,950
I'm going down to Cedar Rapids
for the big ASMI convention.

139
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,077
Oh, good. Good.

140
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,997
You can keep that for now.

141
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:41,209
So all liquids, gels,
aerosols must be placed in a Ziploc,

142
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,005
and then your computer, we take out of
the case and run through the machine.

143
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,593
It's just me.

144
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,553
Yeah, we gotta do it for everybody, so...

145
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,138
Tim!

146
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,640
Oh, praise Christ you haven't left yet.

147
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,850
Hey, Bill.

148
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,227
Hey.

149
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,646
I can't believe I forgot
to give this to you.

150
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,815
It's an ASMI bible. All right?

151
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,651
It'll tell you who to talk to
and who to avoid,

152
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,529
who best to fellowship with,
 network, you know.

153
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,990
Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point, Wisconsin.

154
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,241
Ziegler.

155
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,911
You know that son of bitch called
one of Lemke's biggest clients,

156
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,412
Joyce Armbruster?

157
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,832
Smeared Roger's name.
Freaking goddang poacher.

158
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,503
Avoid Ziegler like the plague, please.

159
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,922
Now, Ronald Wilkes,
the guy I got you rooming with,

160
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,840
that's who I want you to stick by. Okay.

161
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,301
All right? All right, then,
 come here. Come on.

162
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,059
Well, you lucky ducks have obviously
been seated in an exit row.

163
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,062
I just need to make sure you're willing
and able to assist crew members

164
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,272
in the event of an emergency evacuation.

165
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,734
I've actually never
 been on an airplane before.

166
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,861
Well, you'll do awesome.

167
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,282
Well, if you do need help, I'm in.

168
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,618
Thank you.

169
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,853
Oh, sweet.

170
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,626
Hey, man. Can I bum a heater?

171
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,752
What's that now?

172
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,129
A cigarette?

173
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,173
No, sorry, I can't help you there.

174
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,259
Are you here for the convention? Yeah.

175
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,804
Yeah. Tim Lippe, BrownStar Insurance.

176
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,098
Bree. I'm Bree.

177
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,349
Nice to meet you, Bree.

178
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,059
Old trade secret for you.

179
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,395
If you keep smoking, your premiums
are gonna go through the roof.

180
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,897
Thanks, Dr. Phil.

181
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,193
Hey, instead of a heater,
 how about butterscotch?

182
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,362
Nice.

183
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,658
Listen, Tim, if you wanna party,
you let me know.

184
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,743
I'm always around.

185
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,579
You got it. Party hardy.

186
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,205
Nice chatting with you, Bree. See you.

187
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,964
Wow!

188
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,012
Checking in with us, sir?

189
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,641
Yeah, I am. Pretty excited about it, too.

190
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,726
All right. Can I get your name?

191
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,311
Tim Lippe.

192
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,980
And we just need a
credit card for the incidentals.

193
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,192
Well, Trent, I was under the impression

194
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,361
that you honored traveler's checks.

195
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,198
You bet. We just need
to make an imprint of the card,

196
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,201
just like I say, for the incidentals.

197
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,828
Credit card?

198
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,043
All right.

199
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,588
It's standard.

200
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,344
Don't worry. We are not gonna charge it.

201
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,389
No, see. Looks liked you just charged it.

202
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,765
Just an imprint.

203
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,849
Okay.

204
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,729
Hey, Tim.

205
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:34,234
So I just did the whole check-in rigmarole,
and I'm on my way to my room.

206
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,485
Have you seen the pool yet?

207
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,611
Yeah.

208
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,031
It's incredible. I mean, there's
like palm trees and stuff.

209
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,991
And the whole place smells like chlorine.

210
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,785
It's like I'm in Barbados or somewhere.

211
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,746
Oh, here we are. Mi casa.

212
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,207
Junior suite. Hang on a second here.

213
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,627
Figure out how this deal works.

214
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,963
The key is like a stinking credit card.

215
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,757
What is it? Tim?

216
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,427
There's an Afro-American
 man standing in my room.

217
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,345
What's he doing?

218
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,181
He's smiling at me.

219
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,225
Oh, no. Run for your life.

220
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,310
Are you Tim? Tim Lippe?

221
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,854
I'm Ronald Wilkes.

222
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,732
Bill Krogstad said we
 were gonna be roommates.

223
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,608
Tim, are you okay?

224
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,527
Does he speak your language? Yes.

225
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,987
He actually seems pretty friendly

226
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,488
so I'm gonna call you back later, okay?

227
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,282
You are Tim?

228
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,075
Oh, yes, of course I am.

229
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,119
Just for a minute there,
I was like, "Whoa."

230
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,203
Okay.

231
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,873
You wanna come in and
 take a look at the room?

232
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,249
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,633
Check out these digs.

234
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,720
Hey, look, Tim, the reason we
got the junior suite upgrade

235
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,346
is because the hotel overbooked.

236
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,267
The point being, they were asking
folks to take on a third roommate

237
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,935
to consolidate space.

238
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,480
Now, to me, the savings
of adding a third guy

239
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,273
sounded like a real positive.

240
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,567
If you got any qualms, I hear you.

241
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,487
LNC. That's "Loud and Clear."

242
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,032
Who would share... Who would share beds?

243
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,659
That's a pull-out couch.

244
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,917
This isn't Woodstock, Tim.

245
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,461
I'm sure whoever it is
will be a straight shooter.

246
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,048
Janita, double stock my mini bar, please.

247
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,424
1019, thank you.

248
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,052
Taco Bill, back in the saddle.

249
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,721
Hey, Ned. Get some honey on your stinger?

250
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,889
I love it.

251
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,101
So far, it's just the one
billboard north of St. Cloud.

252
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,313
But at the end of the day, it's NTS.

253
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,898
Not too shabby.

254
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,108
NTS. That's hilarious.

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,367
Ronald Wilkes, I presume. The Ronimal!

256
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,661
Give me some love, my soul brother!

257
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,830
Turn down the volume,
Ziegler. You just got here.

258
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,248
What's the matter, friend?

259
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,416
You've never seen a choco-vanilla
love sandwich before?

260
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,293
Wait till we start the butt fucking. No.

261
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,754
I'm just having fun.

262
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,757
Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point,
Wisconsin. Call me Deanzie.

263
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,636
Tim Lippe, from Brown Valley, Wisconsin.
BrownStar Insurance.

264
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,514
Oh, sure, yeah.
 Bill Krogstad's joint right?

265
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,723
The Kroger!

266
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,933
That's what I call him.

267
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,853
Oh, shit.

268
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,398
I was so sorry to hear about
Lemke's passing up there.

269
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,859
That guy was tits as a rep.

270
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,863
Yeah. Well, Roger
 was just a super great man.

271
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,116
Amen on that. Yeah.

272
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,034
Real tragedy.

273
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,582
Well, I don't know about you wing-nuts,

274
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,959
but the Deanzie could use a drinksy.

275
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,920
What do you say we head straight
to Horizons for happy hour?

276
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,923
You get two-for-one drinks, ten-cent wings,

277
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,301
all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet.

278
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,386
That line was unappealing last year, Dean.

279
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,554
It remains so now.

280
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,638
Ronimal!

281
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,932
I'm gonna watch President Helgesson's
opening remarks.

282
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,976
Oh, God. That smug fuck.

283
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,104
Helgesson's trying to turn ASMI
into a goddamn religion

284
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,148
with all this God and morality bullshit.

285
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,484
All right, you ladies stay
here and do your nails.

286
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,487
But I'm going to Horizon's where
the action is, all right?

287
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,582
I'm Orin Helgesson,

288
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,377
your ASMI Midwest Region Chapter President.

289
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,423
If you haven't picked up your welcome
kits yet, see Mike Pyle.

290
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,758
Mike Pyle.

291
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,470
He owns the sixth largest Allstate
agency in the upper Midwest.

292
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,180
The guy's a shark.

293
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,557
I'm more worried about this Ziegler guy.

294
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,852
I was specifically warned
to stay away from him.

295
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,229
Don't worry about him. He's harmless.

296
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,193
I'd like to talk Two Diamonds
 for a minute here.

297
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,071
The Two Diamond Certificate of Excellence

298
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,781
is awarded every year

299
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,576
to the agency that best exemplifies
 the ASMI decree

300
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,996
"to provide high quality insurance,

301
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,959
"while maintaining commitment to
community, country and God."

302
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,336
We have a record number of
 entries this year.

303
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,171
Over 50 agencies. So...

304
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,048
Did he say 50 agencies?

305
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,051
Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year.

306
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:16,099
Hey, come on. You're gonna do fine. Relax.

307
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,644
Thanks.

308
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,187
Hey, baby girl.

309
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,690
Hey, Tim. How's it going?

310
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,983
I'm in over my head.

311
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,987
You'll do fine. I'm putting
you on speaker, sweetie.

312
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,155
I just really wish you had come with me.

313
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,659
Oh, no. This is your thing.
You'll do a good job.

314
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,661
Well, I gotta run in a sec.

315
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,789
I'm meeting some folks for
fish at the Eagles.

316
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,290
I really miss you.

317
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,084
You'll do fine.

318
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,585
Thank you. I'll try.

319
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,462
I really miss you.

320
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,922
Okay, bye, honey.

321
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,757
I'll dream of you in my heart.

322
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,489
You were checking me out.

323
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,866
What?

324
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,909
I'm gonna have to tell the hotel

325
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,119
there's some pervo in fitness center

326
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,245
hitting on innocent women.

327
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,705
What? Whoa! No.

328
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,292
I wasn't doing that.

329
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,085
I'm, like, pre-engaged with somebody.

330
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,462
Unbelievable.

331
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,963
That poor woman should
 know what you're up to.

332
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,133
I'm not up to anything. I swear, I'm not...

333
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,718
Oh, man.

334
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,056
I'm totally messing with you.

335
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,266
I'm sorry. Oh, my God, I'm such a jerk.

336
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,769
Okay, yeah.

337
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,145
Well, that's different.

338
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,815
I'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox.

339
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,443
Hi. Hi.

340
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,445
Tim Lippe. Hi, Mr. Lippe.

341
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,405
I'm in town for the ASMI convention.

342
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,241
I'm here for ASMI, too. I'm from
"Oh, my God," Nebraska.

343
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,826
Omaha. Yeah.

344
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,289
Well, I'm gross,
 so I will bid you a farewell, Mr. Lippe.

345
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,999
Okay. See you at Horizon's tonight?

346
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,376
Yeah, I don't... Well, maybe.

347
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,545
A girl can dream.

348
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,391
How are you doing? Good.

349
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,060
Um...

350
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,437
I really enjoyed your speech,
President Helgesson.

351
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,107
Oh. You were in there. Marvelous.

352
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,526
I don't think we've met.

353
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,112
Tim Lippe.

354
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,239
Down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin,
BrownStar Insurance.

355
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,450
Oh, boy. Tim,

356
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,786
I don't know what to say. I'm just...

357
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,122
We're all feeling it.

358
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,791
I'm so sorry for the loss.

359
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,293
Yeah, it's been really hard.

360
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,171
Come here, son. Come here.

361
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,722
Now, Tim, let me give you

362
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,269
a few extra drink coupons for Horizon's.

363
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,815
You go down there and fellowship and
network with your colleagues. Huh?

364
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,650
Thank you, President Helgesson.

365
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,443
No, please. Orin.

366
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,872
Hey, Bree isn't it?

367
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,665
Yeah, the butterscotch dude right?

368
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,791
Yeah.

369
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,878
That's me, Captain Butterscotch.
You guys want some?

370
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,046
Yeah.

371
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,092
Tim Lippe, BrownStar Insurance.

372
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,094
Glen Lindstrom. Lindy.

373
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,139
Lindy Lindstrom. Excellent to meet you.

374
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,308
What are you guys up to?

375
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,943
Timbo!

376
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,236
Right here, roomie.

377
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,197
Party headquarters, right here.

378
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,448
How's it going, Tim?

379
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,616
Hi, Ronald.

380
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,825
Dean?

381
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,951
Come on. Call me Deanzie.

382
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,286
What can I get you?

383
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,454
Do you have root beer?

384
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,080
You want a nipple on that?

385
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,208
Ha-ha. No.

386
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,502
The sooner you learn to ignore this
 degenerate, Tim, the better off you'll be.

387
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,755
Degenerate! I love it! That's me!

388
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,257
Okay, Big Time Tim,

389
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,470
what exactly are you looking for,
pussy-wise, in Cedar Crapids?

390
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,640
Nothing, actually.

391
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,644
What? Why are you showing
me a picture of your mom?

392
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,687
She's hot. No offense.

393
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,439
She's not my mom. Okay?

394
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,816
She's my girlfriend,
and we're basically pre-engaged.

395
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,152
Whoa, whoa. My bad.
Beautiful woman, in any case.

396
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,529
Wait a minute, what's "pre-engaged"?

397
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,865
'Cause if I was "pre-engaged,"

398
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,826
I will be pre-porking
anything with a pulse.

399
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,621
Where's your moral compass, Ziegler?
You're married yourself.

400
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,290
Was married, Ronald. Was.

401
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,834
Oh, jeez, you and Patti split up?

402
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,169
Oh, I'm sorry.

403
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:01,300
She's an asshole. Ass-fucking-hole.

404
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,221
Seventeen years of marriage,
straight down the shitter.

405
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,100
Lucky if one of them was decent.

406
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,064
What was I talking about?
Who wants to get wasted!

407
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,232
Choo-choo!

408
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,568
Hubba-hubba, check out those studs!

409
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,988
Whoo! Joan Ostrowski-Fox.

410
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,366
Oh, Ron Ronald, you look Rontastic.

411
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,326
This one. Oh, I could just

412
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,203
squeeze you to death,
 you little firecracker!

413
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,414
How are you sweetheart?

414
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,999
Oh, so good.

415
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,627
Oh, Lippe. My lippies are sealed.

416
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,296
You know this guy?

417
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,798
Oh, that's right. From the fitness center.

418
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,050
Yeah. I was really naughty
 with you down there.

419
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,302
I'm really sorry, Tim.

420
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,178
Oh, no. She's not. Oh, no. I'm not.

421
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,889
Shots. Let's do it. What do you want guys?

422
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,057
Jäger time. Jäger for me.

423
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,226
Twist my arm. Drambuie.

424
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,811
Lippe? I'm a non-drinker.

425
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,937
Oh, that's a bummer.

426
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,981
Timbo, you gotta strap on a set of gords.

427
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,065
Yeah. All right?

428
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,483
Come on, one won't kill you.

429
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,944
Jeez, okay.

430
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,864
If you guys are gonna beat me up...

431
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,742
Cream sherry.

432
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,119
Cream sherry? You're insane.

433
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,164
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

434
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,915
This one's weird.

435
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,292
Ready? Here we go.

436
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,462
In your hole!

437
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,426
You be careful not to get
too loaded there, Lippe.

438
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,094
I might have to take advantage of you.

439
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,680
Hey. Excuse me.

440
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,015
Come on, I'm just razzing.

441
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,141
Cut it out!

442
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,936
You know what? It's been a long day.

443
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,271
Oh, come on, Timbo. Relax.

444
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,647
Come on, I didn't mean anything by it.

445
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,524
Good night.

446
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,490
You can squeeze my ass, Joan.

447
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,908
Ouch!

448
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,219
The government currently subsidizes

449
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,097
$935 million worth of insurance policies...

450
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,890
I'm in here! I'm in here...

451
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,309
I know, I know. This needs to be private.

452
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,728
Listen...

453
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,231
Whoa!

454
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,691
Something really didn't
agree with you, huh?

455
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,403
Yeah, I had...
I think it was tainted yogurt.

456
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,907
Listen, meet me in the stair...

457
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,743
Meet me in the stairwell in five minutes.
 All right?

458
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,745
Pinch it off, it's important.

459
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,163
Jesus Christ.

460
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,919
Psst!

461
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,421
Timbo.

462
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,844
We gotta talk.

463
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,679
What? What is going on?

464
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,266
After you left,
I found out some serious shit.

465
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,185
There is a petition going around

466
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,064
trying to take away your company's
Two Diamond Awards.

467
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,274
What?

468
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:08,404
They're saying Lemke's sexual
peccadilloes were not godly,

469
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,905
quote unquote.

470
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,949
Somebody passed it to me, and I'm like,

471
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,535
"Look, Lemke might have
 been a class-A deviant,

472
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,205
"but what the fuck does that have
to do with selling insurance?"

473
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,251
Pardon my French, Dean, but you
are completely full of bullroar.

474
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,921
My boss, Bill Krogstad, told me that
you called Joyce Armbruster

475
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,131
and smeared Roger's name.

476
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,299
No, no.

477
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,303
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Timbo.
That old whore called me.

478
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,264
She's going on about how Lemke's a pervert

479
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,308
and she wanted to take
her business elsewhere.

480
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,186
So I says, "All right,
I'll crunch some numbers for you."

481
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,148
Well, she calls me back later that same day

482
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,985
saying how she got Krogstad
to lower her premiums,

483
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,739
which is exactly what the greasy
twat wanted in the first place.

484
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
So, you didn't call her?

485
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,244
Tim.

486
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,168
Look, I might be a lot of things,

487
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,671
but a poacher ain't one of them.

488
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,050
And I'm proud of that.

489
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,930
You saw this petition?

490
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,517
Yeah, I saw it. I didn't sign it.

491
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,936
I said, "You guys are pussies."

492
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,480
This is terrible.

493
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,191
'Cause the way that Roger
died was an accident.

494
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,776
Look, Lemke could have died

495
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,861
cornholing a crippled kid for all I care.

496
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,031
Not really, of course.

497
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,450
My sister's got one. Down's.

498
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,035
Sad.

499
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,206
Point being, selling insurance
 is a business.

500
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,458
It's not a goddamn Boy Scout troop.

501
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,961
So there's the scuttlebutt.

502
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,921
Deal with it the way you want.

503
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,076
And we thank you, Lord.

504
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:25,666
We are grateful for the bounty you
provide us this breakfast time.

505
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,334
I am so hung over right now.

506
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,837
The variety and the volume...

507
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,006
Big time beer shits this morning.

508
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,385
...Lord Jesus, our truth. Amen.

509
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,679
Amen. Say that again.

510
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,307
I thought Pyle did a nice job, Ziegler.

511
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,100
What's wrong with you, Timbo?

512
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,393
You're like a gloomy Gus this morning.

513
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,853
Come on, leave him alone.

514
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,149
If it's my ex-wife, I'm not here.

515
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,234
I'm pretty sure it's not your ex-wife.

516
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,736
It's my boss. I have to take this.

517
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,446
Tell The Kroger I said, "Hey."

518
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,451
Hello.
- Tim.

519
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,328
I got a call from Orin Helgesson.

520
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,622
He tells me he's worried about you.

521
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,125
Tells me you're palling around
 with Dean Ziegler.

522
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,377
Laughing at his jokes, buying him drinks.

523
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,171
No, Bill. That's...

524
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,964
What's the one thing?

525
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,884
I said, "Steer clear of Dean Ziegler."

526
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,260
Bill, that Dean Ziegler...

527
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,971
No, it is Orin's sworn enemy.

528
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,599
He told me that there is a
 petition going around

529
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,559
to take away our Two Diamond Awards.

530
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,062
What? All right, who the
 Christ signed that, huh?

531
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,397
Who the Christ signed that? God damn it.

532
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,483
God damn it. God damn it!

533
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,485
Bill, I'll handle it. You can count on me.

534
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,404
You just worry about your goddamn
presentation tomorrow, Tim,

535
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,822
and stop fucking around!

536
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,990
I'll handle it.

537
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,575
You take care of it, Lippe.

538
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,416
I swear, I only smoke in Cedar Rapids.

539
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,338
Jeez, what's wrong?

540
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,924
I don't know, like, everything.

541
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,595
So how did you get involved in
the insurance game, Lippe?

542
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,640
Oh, God. "Insurance game."

543
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,686
Look here, see, how did you get
involved in the insurance game?

544
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,522
You're freaky.

545
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,190
Thank you.

546
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,195
It's kind of a weird story, actually.

547
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,450
I lost my dad in a sawmill accident
when I was six years old.

548
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,494
Oh, my God. Yeah.

549
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,956
But the insurance agent fought
like a tiger with the sawmill

550
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,750
to make sure my mom and I were
taken care of, and we were.

551
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,920
And I remember thinking, when I was kid,

552
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,131
I was just like, "This guy is a hero."

553
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,886
I gotta say, I think insurance
agents get a bum rap.

554
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,305
You know?

555
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,101
Like this river, the Cedar River,
flooded a couple of years ago.

556
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,769
A whole city. I know. I remember.

557
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,271
It was a massive disaster.

558
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,232
Massive disaster,
billions of dollars in damage,

559
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,318
and who do you think was in the trenches

560
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,988
trying to get people's lives back in order?

561
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,782
It was insurance agents.

562
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,995
Not all of them,
but a lot of them worked really hard

563
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,080
to get people's lives back on track.

564
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,253
Do you realize you just made it sound
cool to be an insurance salesman?

565
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,007
You are a hero, Lippe.

566
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,676
Shut up.

567
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,720
Come on, we should get back.

568
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,929
No, I can tell.

569
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,848
You're the Superman type.

570
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,308
Kind of dweeby on the outside

571
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,934
but a real frigging stud underneath.

572
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,811
Yeah, dweeby, okay.

573
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,605
They call you Insurance Man

574
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,649
and put a big red "I" on your chest.

575
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,151
Cool.

576
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,614
Well, even if you are totally full
of it, which you clearly are,

577
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,991
it's still a nice thing to say,
and I appreciate it.

578
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,201
You're welcome.

579
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,582
For crying out loud, Dean, you say
the same thing every year!

580
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,709
Because you think you're the Pope, Orin.

581
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,127
And you're not the fucking Pope.

582
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,296
And ASMI is not a church.

583
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,132
There is a separation
between religion and insurance.

584
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,300
It's in the constitution.

585
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,510
Oh, good grief.

586
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,470
You gotta admire Ziegler's style of debate.

587
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,723
Volume, proximity and repetition. Yeah.

588
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,185
I'm doing something right. Timbo!

589
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,896
And O-Fox. Where have you two been?

590
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,649
What is that? You got a
 pube on your cheek, Timbo.

591
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,776
Oh, Jesus, Ziegler. Uncool.

592
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,945
Eating the canned
 tuna from the bottom shelf.

593
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,029
I love it!

594
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,073
Guys, I gotta boogie.

595
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,950
I'll see you later at the scavenger hunt.

596
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,910
Bye-bye. Aye aye, your holiness.

597
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,414
Borin' Orin. Just joshing.

598
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,083
Not.

599
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,585
No, I'm really joshing. Not!

600
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,129
Oh, got him twice.

601
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,006
What's the scavenger hunt?
- Oh!

602
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,175
You are about to find out,

603
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,011
'cause I just signed up you and
O-Fox on the same team.

604
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,346
Oh, yeah? Right on!

605
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,139
I shouldn't.

606
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,433
Tim, I promise I won't molest you.

607
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,519
Yet.

608
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,688
No, I'm kidding,
 I'm kidding. Come on, it'll be fun.

609
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,939
Everyone's doing it.

610
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,859
Okay, folks, the ASMI-Azing Race

611
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,528
is just like The Amazing Race on TV...

612
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,654
No, it's not.

613
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,115
...except that instead of $1 million,

614
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,075
the winning team gets

615
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,912
a $45 gift card to the
Kiku Japanese restaurant

616
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,455
in the Westdale Mall.

617
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,459
So, look for your first clue

618
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,461
under the sea.

619
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,717
And by that I mean in the pool area.

620
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,429
Don't get in the way.

621
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,597
No brakes!

622
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,390
No brakes. Coming through.

623
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,727
Bricks? What the hell is this?

624
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,896
It's a word scramble, you dumb fucks.

625
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,315
Raff... raff. Riff...

626
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,817
Moff. Two letters.

627
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,528
Two more letters. Mo... Moffarts.

628
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,992
I know what it is. Fun Farm!

629
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,537
Yeah, be cool. Be cool.

630
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,916
Golly, I really need to pee.

631
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,752
I told you to go before we started,
you idiot.

632
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,836
Sorry.

633
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,087
Queef.

634
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,924
No Q. No Q, son of a bitch.

635
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,268
Hey, Bree. We're in first place!

636
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,520
Good luck, butterscotch.

637
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,357
Okay, you're gonna make a right on Wilson.

638
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,858
No, that doesn't make any sense.

639
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,027
You're gonna... What?

640
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,029
I'm gonna make a left on Wilson. Oops!

641
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,616
North is north. South is south.
 It's not complicated.

642
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,284
Never Eat Shredded Wheat.

643
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,827
Just remembered.

644
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,954
I never heard that one before.

645
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,706
Yeah, which is ironic because
Shredded Wheat is delicious.

646
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,500
Where are they?

647
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,043
All right, Perry. Eyes on me.

648
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,628
What are you doing here? You
want me to throw you in?

649
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,630
Balls deep, man. Go! Yeah! Go!

650
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,756
All right. What do I got to do?

651
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,466
You have to find a red ball
for your next clue.

652
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,510
I'll give you 40 bucks
for the clue straight out.

653
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,637
Ziegler! Now! Go! All right, let's do it!

654
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,889
Look out, Timbo, I'm going balls deep.

655
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,935
I got it!

656
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,311
Yes!

657
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,149
Fill this thing. I'm gonna win.

658
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,568
Fill it. Fill it. Fill it. Come on.

659
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,239
Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Go! Go!
Eat the next one.

660
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,448
Oh, my God. I'm gonna puke.

661
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,033
No, you're doing great,

662
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,703
and, by the way, you look really good
with a wiener in your mouth.

663
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,957
Did you just make a dick joke?

664
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,584
No. Maybe.

665
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,961
I love it!

666
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,838
Okay, just go! Go! Go! Go!

667
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,716
Look at him. He's like a
 little spider monkey.

668
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,262
Ha-ha! Leaving them in the dust.

669
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,097
You're almost there, bud.

670
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,349
- Reach it!
- Timbo.

671
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,767
You got a death wish pal?

672
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,688
'Cause you're about roughly 20
feet off the ground right now.

673
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,231
Take a look.

674
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,157
Uh-oh. Tim?

675
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,784
Oh, God. Tim, are you okay?

676
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,119
Give me a second.

677
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,460
What do you... Tim, come on
down. We got you, buddy!

678
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,421
I'm gonna be fine!

679
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:10,756
I think we better get him.

680
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,632
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

681
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,801
Why did you do it if you're
 gonna freak out?

682
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,390
Tim, I got you, trust me.

683
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,184
Just give me your hand, bro, lean back.

684
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,311
I don't trust people with pony tails.

685
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,313
Come on, man, give me your
hand. Let's do this.

686
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,065
I'm not extreme like you.

687
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,360
Oh, Tim. Tim!

688
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,904
Oh, my God. Calm down.

689
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,617
Hold on. Hold on to this.
- I got you, buddy.

690
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,660
Guys, just lower him down. I got it.

691
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,497
Come on down to me.
Come on down. I got you, pal.

692
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,248
Relax. Relax.
- Okay. Okay.

693
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,418
We got you. We got you.

694
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,630
Come on, folks. I just saved a life here.

695
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,674
Just saved a life here.

696
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,720
So since no one could
complete the final task,

697
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,515
and since Tim was higher than anyone else

698
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,433
when all this brouhaha occurred,

699
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,979
we're going to award the
 gift card to Tim and Joan.

700
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,690
We won!

701
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,234
Nice. I love it. I love it.

702
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,278
We won We won the scavenger hunt

703
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,696
We won We won

704
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,198
Mmm.

705
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,327
We won today.

706
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,996
Well, congratulations. Thank you.

707
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,706
And I found you a cream sherry.

708
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,542
To dorks.

709
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,878
Okay. Cheers. Cheers.

710
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,130
It's a compliment.

711
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,256
Mmm.

712
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,551
Oh, smooth.

713
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,636
Tim Lippe, I am trying to figure you out.

714
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Oh, boy.

715
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,681
I mean, hopes, dreams, aspirations.

716
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,683
What do you got? Um...

717
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,812
What I really would love someday,

718
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:53,191
is to put a little greenhouse
 in my backyard.

719
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,776
Okay, dream the impossible dream.

720
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,945
Actually, it's far more reasonable
 than you think.

721
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,029
Oh, please.

722
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,489
I checked some out at Fleet Farm. Enough.

723
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,991
They're portable. Stop it.

724
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,075
And they won't break the bank.

725
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,747
Wow, I'm talking, like, fantasy land. Okay?

726
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,835
Like, what does Tim Lippe really want?

727
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,463
Come on! Okay, a family.

728
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,299
Oh!

729
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,676
You know, I wanna be a dad.

730
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,429
So, kids, I guess, is what I really want.

731
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,139
You want mine?

732
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,850
Um... Well...

733
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,477
Not like, you know...

734
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,730
What?

735
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,523
I have kids. You have kids?

736
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,941
Yeah, two.

737
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,236
Tyler is 10. Ashley will be
eight next month.

738
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,572
My little squirrels.

739
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,366
Oh, they are so cool.

740
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,534
Aw, thanks.

741
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,869
And, that's...

742
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,954
My hubby, Rich Fox. Richie.

743
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,415
We met when we were Rotary Exchange
students in high school.

744
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,167
Lived for a semester in Norway.

745
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,920
You've been to Norway? Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

746
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,215
Then we got married when we
were sophomores in college,

747
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,884
and then kids and...

748
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,302
Wow.

749
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,388
If I had to do it all again,
 I don't know what I'd choose,

750
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,225
but I don't have that option.

751
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,978
So this is my fantasy land, Tim.

752
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,565
You know, Cedar Rapids, ASMI. This.

753
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,361
Sometimes a gal just needs
 a little vacation

754
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,447
from who she really is, you know
what I'm saying, Lippe?

755
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,620
Yee-hah!

756
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,541
This is pathetic.

757
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,004
Hey, Mike! I'm bored of the dance.

758
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,714
You love me, Deanzie.

759
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,177
There you two are.

760
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,846
Check out Lloyd.
He's going mental on the place.

761
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:51,685
Oh, and you missed Mike Pyle doing his
Riverdance, hillbilly bullshit again.

762
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,228
Drinks on me.

763
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,437
I like that.

764
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,774
Timbo, have you tagged that yet?

765
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,193
'Cause she's gotta be
as moist as a damp sponge.

766
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,528
Ew, uh...

767
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,281
No, she has a husband.

768
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,241
What is wrong with you, Ziegler? Shit.

769
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,161
What isn't wrong with me? I talk
too much. I drink too much.

770
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,872
I weigh too much. I piss people off.

771
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,209
What's your situation, Ronald?
 Are you married or...

772
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,294
Negative.

773
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,213
I'm pretty well married to
Ronald Wilkes Insurance.

774
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,800
Course I have my guilty pleasures,
 like antiquing.

775
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,677
I'm active in community theater.

776
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,971
And I have to admit, I'm a big enthusiast

777
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,640
of the HBO program The Wire.

778
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,394
But I haven't had a proper
vacation in nine years.

779
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,356
Yeah, you know,
 I never take my vacation, either.

780
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,692
You know what you guys should
do, is take a vacation together.

781
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,361
We can go on one of them gay
cruises with Rosie O'Donnell.

782
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,530
You know what you are, Ziegler?

783
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,240
You're what I call a real Richard.

784
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,037
Mr. Richard Head.

785
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,289
I don't get it.

786
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,249
Dick Head, I get it.

787
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,542
You're a total Richard.

788
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,793
It took me a second.

789
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,920
All right, gents. Kamikazes.

790
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,256
One, two, three.

791
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,507
Down your hole!

792
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,135
Okay time for ASMI's next great talent.

793
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,722
Tim Lip is going to sing a number for us.

794
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,182
Is there a Tim Lip?

795
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,641
Did she just say my name?

796
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,935
Oh, I'm sorry.

797
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,520
She signed you up.

798
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,065
Tim Lip?

799
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,525
You can't do that.

800
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,319
Ladies and gentlemen,

801
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,196
I don't know if you know Tim Lippe here,

802
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,530
it's "Lippe," by the way,

803
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,199
he's down here, it's his first ASMI,

804
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,658
he's up for a Two Diamond Award.

805
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,494
Let's give him a little support. Huh?

806
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,828
Tim Lippe!

807
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,458
Tim! Tim! Tim!

808
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,877
Go be my hero.

809
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,798
Tim! Tim! Tim!

810
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,138
Get up there! Get up there!

811
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:12,742
Okay, I'm gonna sing a song that
I did at our last Christmas party.

812
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,494
Hope you enjoy.

813
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,541
Oh, holy night

814
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,378
Costly premiums have them pining

815
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,174
Term life robs them Of all they are worth

816
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,927
But there is hope

817
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,431
Policy holders now have choices

818
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,142
Behold an agency

819
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,019
That won't leave you torn

820

That was awesome!

827
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,598
Ladies and gentlemen, Tim Lippe.

828
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,642
Take that, Pyle!

829
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,897
Yes! Finally. Oh, God, no more shots.

830
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,440
Let's go. Yes, one more.

831
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,649
No, I'm not having another.

832
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,901
Yes, I don't even wanna hear it.

833
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,278
One, two, three, down your hole!

834
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,741
One-on-ones with Orin are tomorrow.

835
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,327
I can't afford to be off my game.
Neither can you, Tim.

836
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,707
Ronimal!

837
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,000
Sit down, Ronimal.

838
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,504
You tied it in perfectly. Auto,
home, life, you got me!

839
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,255
Yeah, that was great.

840
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,341
Hold on, hold on. I smell free booze.

841
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,842
No, no. Come on, come on. Dean.

842
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,135
Come on, come on.

843
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,306
Oh, my God.

844
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,433
Rug munchers. I love it.

845
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,353
No way.

846
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,854
Gay marriage is legal in lowa.

847
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,648
Come on, you guys. This party sounds good.

848
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,902
Wait. Let's go.

849
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,532
You're crazy, Deanzie.

850
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,283
I love it!

851
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,291

The Robot Man! Yeah!

853
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,009
Whatever floats your boat, man.

854
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,352
Take cover, Ronald!

855
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,566
Come on, follow me, I know where to go.

856
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,192
We're storming the gate.

857
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,904
I told you it closed an hour ago.

858
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,532
No, it didn't. 'Cause I just opened it up.

859
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,201
Come on, we're going swimming.

860
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,327
I'm going to bed.

861
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,371
We got a big day tomorrow.

862
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,832
Yeah, I'll be right behind you.

863
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,251
We're totally going in the pool.

864
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,169
We're totally going in!

865
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,381
Come on.
This is gonna be my seaman's helmet.

866
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,967
Right here. Look!

867
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,677
Look at this! You guys.

868
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,847
I'm Captain Nemo, the muff diver.

869
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,517
I'm going on a mission for bearded clams.

870
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,852
Idiot.

871
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,276
What do you say? Lippe take a dippy?

872
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,485
Come on in!

873
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:38,948
What?

874
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,701
That's German for,
"I can't swim," and I really can't.

875
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,370
Oh, well, it's only 4 feet.

876
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,956
Well, I didn't bring a bathing suit, so...

877
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,626
Oh, yeah? Well, I didn't either.

878
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,962
Timbo, it's business casual.
 Get your ass in here.

879
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,505
Come on, Tim.

880
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,219
Mr. Lippe.

881
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,848
Calling Mr. Lippe.

882
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:04,932
Get in here.

883
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,228
Oh, my gosh. It's kind of chilly, actually.

884
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,401
Oh, my God.
- It's nice.

885
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,071
Dean, you look like R2-D2.

886
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,750
Crazy day, right?

887
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,760
So...

888
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,055
Oh, man.

889
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,231
Your skin is so milky.

890
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,525
It's like ice cream.

891
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,618
I'm having a perfect moment.

892
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,420
What the heck is going on here?

893
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,299
Orin! You ruin everything.

894
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,469
Helgesson,
I got something for you right here.

895
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,306
Suck on it, baby. Right there.
 Full moon, Orin.

896
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,101
You people are such low-lifes.

897
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,478
He happened to come out right then, right?

898
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,066
Yeah, you were watching through
the window, you kinky bastard.

899
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,569
Well, this is a very nice "How do you
do" in the middle of the night.

900
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,406
Go back to your room and tie yourself
up, you kinky bastard.

901
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,741
Will you just shut up?

902
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,451
Whoo! I love it!

903
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,411
Oh, my God. Holy crap.

904
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,329
Oh, my God. We're so dead.

905
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,423
I wanna make love!

906
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,597
Where is everybody?

907
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,435
Timbo? Ronald? Oh, shit.

908
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,233
Making love to you was super,

909
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,778
super awesome.

910
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,785
Do you want to cuddle?

911
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,911
Cuddle?

912
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,747
I love to cuddle.

913
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,500
Okay.

914
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,922
You're special, Joan.

915
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,133
So special.

916
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,194
Calm down, Tyler.

917
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,488
You're not gonna miss the game.
Just put your dad on, please.

918
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,075
Hey, didn't you look at the
schedule on the fridge?

919
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,660
This is the last regular season game.

920
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,955
He actually has a chance to play,
 Richie, Christ.

921
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,749
Okay. Okay, I love you, too.

922
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,920
Tell Tyler to kick some butt for me,
okay? See you.

923
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,677
Good morning.

924
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,179
Sorry, crisis on the home front.

925
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,767
You already told your husband?

926
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,227
Yeah, right.

927
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,897
We have to tell them. No.

928
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,065
Right? I mean...

929
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,233
Tim, I told you,

930
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:46,279
what I do here in
Cedar Rapids, it stays here.

931
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,618
No, I am not a philanderer.

932
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,667
I'm a philanderer.

933
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,961
I'm a philanderer!

934
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,173
I have to tell Macy.

935
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,633
Tim, do not call Macy.

936
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,510
I need... I don't have any clothes.

937
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,972
Tim, calm down.

938
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,017
I can't. I can't live like this.

939
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,397
I'm not like you.

940
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,732
Tim...

941
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,234
I'm sorry.

942
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,070
Don't...

943
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,576
Hey, Tim.

944
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,703
She's not that pretty and she smokes.

945
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,830
Tim?

946
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,665
I made love to a woman, Macy.

947
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,627
Her name is Joan. She's from Omaha,
Nebraska

948
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,837
and her mouth tastes like cigarettes.

949
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,964
You slept with someone?

950
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,343
It was a mistake.
You mean everything to me.

951
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,094
I can't believe you.

952
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,473
You really slept with someone?

953
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,476
Will you marry me?

954
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,936
What?

955
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,187
Will you marry me, please?

956
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,731
Just don't leave. I'll do anything.

957
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,274
Tim, slow down.

958
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,276
Please, let's get married right away. Whoa.

959
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,695
Listen, I've been trying to tell you this,

960
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,531
but you seem to have a
hard time grasping it, okay?

961
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,785
I was married for half my life.

962
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,873
I've been divorced for all of six months.
I wanna enjoy my freedom.

963
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,875
What?

964
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,294
Like, is there someone else?

965
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,837
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

966
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,548
I mean, there's no
 one person in particular, no.

967
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,176
What do you mean,
"No one person"? There's people?

968
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,970
Like, plural, people?

969
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,181
Not a lot, I mean, just a few.

970
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,686
I'm dying.

971
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,105
Tim... I'm dying.

972
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,815
Pull yourself together.

973
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:50,403
I can't... I literally can't breathe.
I literally can't breathe.

974
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,654
Tim...

975
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,990
Tim... I can't breathe.

976
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,074
Timmy...

977
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,867
Yeah, yes?

978
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,953
You know that bird you gave me?

979
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,038
What kind of bird was it?

980
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,001
Scarlet tanager.

981
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,877
And what kind of sound did it make?

982
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,089
Come on, you remember.

983
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,887
That's right. Very good.

984
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,140
And do you remember what we learned about

985
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,933
when the baby birds are born?

986
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,978
When the mommy decides it's
time for them to leave home?

987
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,646
What does she do?

988
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,108
She nudges them out of the nest.

989
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,192
That's right.

990
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,447
But the mommy bird knows that even
though the babies are scared,

991
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,241
it's time for them to fly away.

992
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,703
So, even though your heart hurts very,
very much,

993
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,583
I think it's for the best. It's time
for you to fly away, Tim.

994
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,295
Bye-bye, little birdie Tim.

995
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,797
Bye-bye.

996
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,470
Bye, bye-bye.

997
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,489
I love you.

998
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,573
Yeah, you better love me

999
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,700
if you're gonna fuck me in the
poop shoot the way you done.

1000
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,744
Bill? Orin Helgesson told me

1001
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,913
about your little hootenanny
 in the pool there, Tim.

1002
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,039
What are you thinking?

1003
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,749
You add that to the goddamn petition,

1004
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,958
may as well commit suicide here.

1005
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,168
Father of the bride.

1006
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,170
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1007
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,255
I can fix it, Bill.
Just tell me what to do.

1008
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,340
Oh, what to do.

1009
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,259
You can win the Two Diamonds.
That's what you do, Tim.

1010
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,472
Or so help me, Jesus God, you won't
have a job, you won't have a life.

1011
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,390
All you'll have is my fist up your ass

1012
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,434
and believe you me, that's something
neither of us wants.

1013
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,645
Bill, please,
just listen to me for a minute...

1014
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,897
Ah! Cripes almighty. Worst day of my life.

1015
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,441
Hey, sorry, folks.

1016
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,527
Oh, you look so beautiful, Kim.

1017
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,736
You look like a flower.

1018
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,779
Smile, father.

1019
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:57,947
A gosh dang flower.

1020
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,874
I'm dead.

1021
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,503
Macy broke up with me, Orin called
Bill, I'm gonna lose my job.

1022
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,840
My life is ruined.

1023
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,050
Sit down.

1024
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,265
Your life is not ruined, Lippe.

1025
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,728
Now, I swore I would never tell.
I promised.

1026
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,107
Roger Lemke,

1027
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,654
I know how he won the Diamonds
all those years in a row.

1028
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,157
Yeah, he knocked it out of the park.

1029
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,241
He paid for them.

1030
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,579
He paid Orin cash in exchange
for the Two Diamonds.

1031
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,749
That's not...

1032
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,627
That's not true. It is.

1033
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,713
He told me himself. Roger told me.

1034
00:52:55,797 --> 00:53:00,426
Really? Why, he just told you that?

1035
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,261
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1036
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,762
Why would he tell you that?

1037
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,057
We were together.

1038
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,607
It was stupid.

1039
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,027
It ended two years ago, 'cause he was
getting into some pretty weird stuff,

1040
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,778
as we all know now. No.

1041
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:20,988
Roger was a good man.

1042
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,698
He was a family man, and
 that was an accident.

1043
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,408
Roger was a freak.

1044
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,621
Not to mention a small minded,
egotistical con artist.

1045
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,290
He was a liar, Tim.

1046
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,834
And, yes, he paid for the Two Diamonds.

1047
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,463
My foot!

1048
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,632
I'm sure you seduced him,
just like you did me.

1049
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,717
You ruined my life.

1050
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,969
Are you fucking kidding me?

1051
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,137
I am trying to help you out

1052
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,388
and you are acting like a child.

1053
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,808
Well, I'd rather act like a child
than a prostitute.

1054
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,908
Timbo, red bush?

1055
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,619
Deanzie needs details.

1056
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,787
Lay off.

1057
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,871
What the... What are you doing?

1058
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,540
Timbo, what the hell's
 wrong with you, Timbo?

1059
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,667
What are you doing? Ow!

1060
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,503
Ow! Titty twister!

1061
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,755
Why are you laughing?

1062
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,548
You think my life is a joke?

1063
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,176
I lost my job and my lover

1064
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,096
and my hero paid bribes to
 win the Two Diamonds.

1065
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,515
What did you just say?

1066
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,351
Lemke bought the Two Diamonds?

1067
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,853
You're saying Lemke paid off Orin?

1068
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,522
No, Dean, you can't say anything.

1069
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,232
You can't... Oh, my God.

1070
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,650
Dean, please.

1071
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,027
That holy rolling hypocrite. I love it.

1072
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,196
Timbo, this is pure gold.

1073
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,572
Please don't.

1074
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,871
All right, listen. We look like
a couple of homos out here.

1075
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,457
Let's go in the room
and discuss this like gentlemen,

1076
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,750
over Bloody Mary's.

1077
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,795
You're freaking out.
Your world is crumbling.

1078
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,089
It's your first ASMI.

1079
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,216
I get it.

1080
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,343
Here.

1081
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,387
Welcome to the jungle, Timbo.

1082
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,726
Now, my ex, Patti,

1083
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,146
well-established fact that this broad

1084
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,897
is a serious cunt stain, am I right?

1085
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,943
But she's got it to where
 the kids hate my guts.

1086
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,903
I'm the bad guy.

1087
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:30,909
Except, when our 1 7-year-old daughter
comes home pregnant,

1088
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,661
who's the one who's so depressed

1089
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,040
she can't come out from under the
afghan on the goddamn couch?

1090
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,918
Patti. And who's the one who's
planning the baby shower

1091
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,921
and taking Meg to the gyno
and all that shit?

1092
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,342
The fucking Deanzie.

1093
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,928
What are you talking about?

1094
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,933
What I'm talking about, Tim,

1095
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,605
is, even though I may be a blowhard

1096
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,857
and, let's face it, kind of a jagoff,

1097
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,984
I'm there for the people that need me.

1098
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,820
And I don't spill my friends' beans.

1099
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,614
Now, tell me this.

1100
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,283
Are we friends?

1101
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,537
Yeah.

1102
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,083
Did you feel that?

1103
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,253
Something just happened right now.

1104
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,174
Now, you're with Deanzie,

1105
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,093
and I'm not letting go.

1106
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,595
And believe me, I would love to expose

1107
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,098
Orin Helgesson's hypocritical bullshit.

1108
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,601
But if you're asking me not to, I won't,
because you're my friend.

1109
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,023
Thank you.

1110
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,902
Now you see how dark this place is.

1111
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,323
All right, I got tiger scratches on my back

1112
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,075
from 20 years in this business.

1113
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,536
Let me tell you something.

1114
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,663
If you wanna survive,

1115
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,166
you either gotta fight the tiger

1116
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,919
or you gotta dance with the tiger.

1117
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,671
Like Roger did.

1118
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,466
How do you make the tiger dance?

1119
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,885
You gotta show him a little teat.

1120
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,519
How'd it go with Helgesson, big guy?

1121
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,397
I think I did a fair to middling job.

1122
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,107
Oh, Tim, don't forget,

1123
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,484
your one-on-one with Orin
starts in 10 minutes.

1124
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,422
President Helgesson.

1125
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,050
Come in. Have a seat on the davenport.

1126
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,652
President Helgesson, what I'd
like to talk to you about today

1127
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,988
are risk mitigation mechanisms
available to...

1128
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,908
You came down here to the big show, Tim,

1129
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,660
and you got the little twinklies
 in the eye,

1130
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:23,248
and you succumbed to the call of a floozy.

1131
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,626
I just want to say I'm really sorry

1132
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,961
for my role in the malfeasance in the pool.

1133
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,089
You blew it, Tim. You blew it.

1134
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,260
I need the Two Diamonds.

1135
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,595
Well, you should have thought of that

1136
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,347
before you took off your big boy pants.

1137
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,890
No, no.

1138
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,478
Please, just...

1139
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,313
All right,
now you take a minute to compose yourself

1140
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,273
and then I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

1141
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,742
I'm prepared to show you a little teat.

1142
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,791
Will you dance with me,
 President Helgesson?

1143
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,544
Do you wanna...

1144
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,088
We can dance.

1145
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,134
Tim... I have money.

1146
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,304
I can give you money.

1147
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,687
Interesting.

1148
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,443
You know, Tim, one thing that Roger knew.

1149
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,155
Roger knew that if you want to win, you...

1150
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,366
I like the way you put it,

1151
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,911
you have to be prepared
to show a little teat.

1152
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:58,302
It's a $50 traveler's check.
 It's fully insured.

1153
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,470
Well, so it is. So it is.

1154
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,309
What else you got hiding in there?

1155
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:18,030
I brought $1 ,500 in checks

1156
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,032
in case of an emergency.

1157
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:24,161
Well, this sure seems like
an emergency to me.

1158
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:36,465
Congratulations,
Mr. Two Diamond Award winner.

1159
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,470
Looks like I just found the
next Roger Lemke.

1160
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,309
You remember that petition to recall

1161
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,978
BrownStar's Two Diamond Awards?

1162
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,569
I just made that disappear.

1163
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,906
Poof! Gone. Rainmaker.

1164
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,939
Hey, can I bum a heater?

1165
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,775
Yeah.

1166
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,403
So, you wanna party?

1167
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:41,947
Maybe.

1168
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,116
Maybe later? Maybe later.

1169
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,617
All right, I'll be around.

1170
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,287
Hey, can I bum a heater?

1171
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,706
All right.

1172
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,857
Hey, butterscotch.

1173
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,487
You look like you're in
 serious need of some relaxation.

1174
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,406
Yeah.

1175
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,493
That's okay, I don't have any money anyway.

1176
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,329
No, no, no, I didn't mean that.

1177
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm going to a party at my Uncle
Ken's house. You should come.

1178
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:40,714
I don't know, Bree. I did something
today I don't feel very good about.

1179
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,508
I do that, like, every day.

1180
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,180
How could I do that?

1181
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:53,101
You know, it seems like your subconscious
is all, like, talking shit.

1182
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,978
Like, "Fuck you, man." You know?

1183
01:02:56,981 --> 01:03:00,025
Yeah, I just... I'm a criminal now.

1184
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,152
I mean, that was a criminal act.

1185
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,405
It's kind of like,
you can't keep your emotions

1186
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:09,117
in these little cages like little animals,
you know,

1187
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,454
like coyotes and armadillos and shit.

1188
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,290
It's like, they just want to break
free. Right, Uncle Ken?

1189
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,917
Yeah. Pass me that Q, Bree.

1190
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,088
Whoa.

1191
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,548
Is that...

1192
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,010
You... Wait, you can't...

1193
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,471
I don't know, is that safe?

1194
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,600
This would be marijuana, I take it?

1195
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,271
It'll make you feel better.

1196
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,190
Suck the glass dick, dude.

1197
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,316
It's not...

1198
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,568
Suck that fucking dick, man.

1199
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:57,749
Oh, jeez.

1200
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,628
Yeah! Yeah!

1201
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,172
Butterscotch lit up.

1202
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,938
It's so pretty out here.

1203
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,609
Hey, you're getting fat. Fuck your mom.

1204
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,528
What? Fuck wad.

1205
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,572
Everyone's cool. I promise, man.

1206
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,578
Hey, nice suit, faggot.

1207
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,745
Leave him alone, Gary.

1208
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,872
Fuck you, whore.

1209
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,166
Hey, that's not very cool.

1210
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,877
Yes, it was. It was pretty cool.

1211
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,712
Suck the shit out of my cock, Gary.

1212
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,130
Okay, let's schedule that.

1213
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,133
There we go. Magic's happening. Okay.

1214
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,221
Oh, my God.

1215
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,774
Danny? Danny isn't here, Mrs. Torrance.

1216
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:09,279
Danny's gone away. But, here's Johnny.

1217
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,657
And a shining good evening...
 Where is Timbo?

1218
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,494
This is weird. I wanna know what happened
at that one-on-one today.

1219
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,205
Since when did you care about
 stuff like that, Ziegler?

1220
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,041
Let's just say I'm worried. All right?

1221
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,667
Yeah, I'm a little worried myself.

1222
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,753
He was really pissed at me this morning.

1223
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,254
Oh, I know. Believe me.

1224
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,008
We talk about everything. He's practically
my best friend at this point.

1225
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,676
You just met him two days ago.

1226
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,261
You know what, blow me, Ronald.

1227
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,138
It's not my problem if
you're too goddamn afraid

1228
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,806
to tell another man that you love him.

1229
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,391
What is his cell phone number?

1230
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:39,935
I don't know. I don't have it.

1231
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,061
I've got it.

1232
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,439
Here, no, no, no. I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him.

1233
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,857
He's not gonna recognize your voice.

1234
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,906
Hello?

1235
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,116
Timbo, you're missing the show.

1236
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,201
Deanzie!

1237
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,871
I miss you. I miss your smile.

1238
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,332
Yeah, yeah, I miss your smile,
too. What are you doing?

1239
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,209
I'm high on drugs.

1240
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,462
I'm a 110 % blotto.

1241
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,881
Where are you, buddy?
I'll come meet you right now.

1242
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,591
You wanna party, Deanzie?

1243
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:12,717
Yeah, you know me.

1244
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:13,802
Good.

1245
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:14,886
Bree, Deanzie wants to party.

1246
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:15,971
Yeah!

1247
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,055
How does he get here?

1248
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,642
I used to worship these guys.

1249
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,811
I thought they were like, terrific

1250
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,312
and important and like...

1251
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:30,318
And like, they were good to other people
and they did the right thing

1252
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,822
and they were special like the
Founding Fathers of America.

1253
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,115
Like Thomas Jefferson.

1254
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,866
Yes! NTS.

1255
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,910
Bree, not too shabby.

1256
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,495
Ron... What?

1257
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,330
Is there something wrong with your van?

1258
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,082
No, there's nothing wrong with the van.

1259
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,917
Why is it going so slow?

1260
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,711
I don't wanna mess around and get a ticket.

1261
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,920
Ron, the car's gonna stall

1262
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,171
if you go any slower than this.

1263
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,382
Look, there's a turtle,
that's going faster than us.

1264
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,508
Where?
- She's kidding, Ron.

1265
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:54,592
There he is.

1266
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,053
You're smart. You are.

1267
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:01,599
And you're pretty, and you're
sweet, and you're insightful.

1268
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,518
You're insightful.
 Like a guidance counselor.

1269
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,814
And your smile,
 just then, when you do that.

1270
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:11,609
Don't do that 'cause it makes
me, like, happy. Too happy.

1271
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:16,614
And you don't have to do those things
that you do with, like, strangers.

1272
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,117
You're good, and you don't need to do that.

1273
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,036
You're so sweet, Tim.

1274
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,955
But, you know,
we're all just selling something.

1275
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,876
A fuck, dope, insurance.

1276
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,545
What about that guy you had to bribe
for that award or whatever?

1277
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:33,006
It's like we're all just selling something.

1278
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,760
I know, and it's a major bummer.
You just bummed me out.

1279
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,679
What you said just bummed me out.

1280
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,058
I'm so bummed out right now.

1281
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:51,566
I'm so bummed out.

1282
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,367
Oh, man. This place is bad news.

1283
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,454
All right, look.
You guys go in the front door,

1284
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:05,914
I'm gonna go around back.

1285
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:06,998
Sounds good, Rambo.

1286
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,834
Do you know what an RIP license app is?

1287
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,753
You don't, do you? You don't even know.

1288
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,756
You're probably uninsured.
You have it all figured out.

1289
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,549
I bet you don't even have a toothbrush.

1290
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,592
Come on, Tim, don't.

1291
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,843
What?

1292
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,928
Hey!

1293
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,519
We don't want any trouble. We're
just here to get our friend.

1294
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,813
I got a fucking toothbrush.

1295
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:33,525
That's enough.

1296
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,110
Gary, he's cool. I said he's cool.

1297
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,528
Don't do that to Bree.

1298
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,279
Don't push! Don't push Bree.

1299
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,616
Hey, whoa, whoa. Can we help you?

1300
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,370
Yeah, maybe you can.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

1301
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,790
He's a skinny guy, wearing a suit
and tie. Have you seen him?

1302
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,251
Eat me, cop.

1303
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,294
I'm not a cop, Joan Jett.

1304
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,505
So, clean out your ears and tell
me... You know what, man,

1305
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,465
what's your fucking problem? Really?
I don't have a problem.

1306
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,675
Look, I'm just asking a question.

1307
01:08:58,759 --> 01:08:59,801
You want a little piece of this?

1308
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:00,885
No, I don't... Ow!

1309
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,596
No, stop! Okay, that's enough.

1310
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:04,722
Hey, stop!

1311
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,017
- Here, grab my hand.
- Grab his hand!

1312
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,061
Grab my hand. I'm trying to
help you up. Grab my hand.

1313
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,229
Let him help you.

1314
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,313
What are we gonna do?

1315
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:15,775
Come on.

1316
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,527
Come on?

1317
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,654
Hey. Hey, Hey!

1318
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,575
Who's this motherfucker?

1319
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,620
I may look like some suit
wearing businessman to y'all,

1320
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,248
truth is, I'm straight up gangster.

1321
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,628
And I always keep one in the chamber
in case you pondering.

1322
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,631
So, I suggest for the time being,

1323
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,800
you let my nigger be, motherfucker.

1324
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,850
Come on. Get up.

1325
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:55,607
Indeed.

1326
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,907
Timbo!

1327
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,543
What about Ziegler?

1328
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,545
Ziegler will be coming. Just start the car.

1329
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,215
Bye, butterscotch.

1330
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:21,925
See you tomorrow.

1331
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,593
Butterscotch, come back. Come on.

1332
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:24,886
Just go back inside.

1333
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,763
Here, here, here. Take a beer for the road.

1334
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,809
There he is, there he is. Stop.

1335
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,603
Don't stop. Don't stop.

1336
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:34,896
I'll catch up.

1337
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,856
- Just go slowly.
- Where you going?

1338
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,400
I thought you were gonna
 kick the shit out of us?

1339
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,485
No, no.

1340
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,738
Come on, faggot.
We're just getting to know you, bro.

1341
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,490
Hey, wait, wait up for me, wait.

1342
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,533
Bree, what are you
doing? Bree, get back here.

1343
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,244
Who are you? I'm friends with that dude.

1344
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,662
You're friends with
 Timbo? Yeah. Fuck, yeah!

1345
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,163
I'm his best friend. Get in there.

1346
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,666
Move. Hit it, Ronimal.

1347
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,253
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1348
01:10:58,462 --> 01:10:59,796
My God, you guys.

1349
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,172
You know her? Yeah.

1350
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,298
Yeah, you know me. She's my friend.

1351
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,217
Yes, I've been...
'Cause she's like, "He's my friend."

1352
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,426
I was like, "Yeah, he's my friend.

1353
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,970
"Get in the van." What are we doing here?

1354
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,596
Timbo, what the hell happened back there?

1355
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,765
I don't know.
 I was on the floor getting kicked,

1356
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:12,725
and then I looked up and Ronald was like,

1357
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,144
talking like a ghetto person. He was.

1358
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,855
I don't like to brag,
but I do a pretty convincing Omar

1359
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,233
from the HBO program The Wire.

1360
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,611
"At least those crackers back
yonder seemed to buy it."

1361
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,822
I love it. Crackers.

1362
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,533
That's exactly like they say it, Ronimal.

1363
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,785
Put them up. That's incredible.

1364
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,204
Watch this guy,
 he's got tricks. I'm telling you.

1365
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,748
Good night. Good night.

1366
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,375
Bree! No, Tim.

1367
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,420
Why don't you come back with me?

1368
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:41,671
Oh, no, that's not gonna happen.

1369
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,047
Thanks for being so cool.

1370
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,217
I love you.

1371
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,261
Jesus.

1372
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,805
I love you, too.

1373
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,600
I love you so much.

1374
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,904
You could fuck me in the ass if you want.

1375
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,240
Oh, no. Okay.

1376
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,117
Maybe another time, Timbo.

1377
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,618
I have heard about that.

1378
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:13,870
Good night. I wanna do that.

1379
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,996
Bye-bye. Wait.

1380
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,372
Night-night, Tim. Bree.

1381
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,125
This is a great place you got.
We gotta hit the road.

1382
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:27,759
Her eyes are like round oceans.
- Yeah.

1383
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:28,843
And her freckles.

1384
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,221
But she's a prostitute and
 I sold my soul a little.

1385
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,015
All right, Timbo. Just keep it down.

1386
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,309
Bree sells her body,

1387
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,354
but I sold my soul.

1388
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,564
Okay. Why don't you guys get some sleep.

1389
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,525
I'll stay up with him and make sure
he doesn't chew his arm off.

1390
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,949
Listen, whatever you did,
buddy, you had to do,

1391
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,993
and I ain't saying squat.

1392
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,248
I sold my soul, Dean.

1393
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,708
I know, I know.

1394
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,087
Okay, lie down.

1395
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,263
You promised to bring me a pocket of posies

1396
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:22,480
You promised to bring me a pocket of posies

1397
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,650
Johnny's so long at the fair

1398
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:30,738
Oh, dear! What can the matter be?

1399
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:34,951
Oh, dear! What can the matter be?

1400
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,287
Johnny's so long at the fair

1401
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:43,584
Joan, I'm sorry I called you a prostitute.
You're not a prostitute. I am.

1402
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,795
You're just a really nice lady.

1403
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,131
It's okay.

1404
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,560
Bill? Hey, Ron.

1405
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,895
Bill? What are you doing here?

1406
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,063
Hey, Tim.

1407
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,106
Joan.

1408
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,482
The Kroger. I love it.

1409
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,526
Ziegler, Jesus. What the hell is this?

1410
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,778
Some kind of goddamn pajama
 party or something?

1411
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,321
No, it's a circle jerk, Bill.

1412
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,323
Drop your pants and grab some lube.

1413
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,452
Oh, that's nice. No, I'm here to give
some good news to someone.

1414
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,871
Orin called me. He tipped me off,

1415
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,414
I don't know how the hell you did it,

1416
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,624
but we won.

1417
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,418
And, well, it's the darndest thing,

1418
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,503
it seems like winning four awards in a row

1419
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,047
has made us look pretty attractive
 to certain folks.

1420
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,467
Mike Pyle is buying BrownStar.

1421
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,593
You're selling?

1422
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,553
That's why I drove down here.

1423
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,305
Gonna sign the contracts in the morning.

1424
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,891
Boy, it's a super deal, too. Super.

1425
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,727
Only snag is, and you gotta know,

1426
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,021
I fought like a goddamn wild cat on this.

1427
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,858
Pyle is shutting down the Brown
 Valley office.

1428
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,529
What?

1429
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:58,159
No, don't worry about it. I got Pyle to
fold you in to the Milwaukee office.

1430
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:00,912
Bill...

1431
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,079
No, stop it. Do not thank me.

1432
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:06,417
Do not thank me. You earned it.
You earned it. It was all you.

1433
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,337
Tell you what, why don't you get some
sleep and we'll talk in the a.m.

1434
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,464
Does that sound good to you?
That's what we'll do.

1435
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:12,882
All right. Ron.

1436
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,365
Hello?

1437
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,951
Hey, Kurt Gambsky, it's Tim Lippe.

1438
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,744
Hey. It's Tim Lippe.

1439
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,081
I am awful sorry to
bother you at this hour,

1440
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,377
but, Kurt, I have to ask you something.

1441
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,798
I'm sorry to call you so late.

1442
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,466
I'm calling on behalf of Tim Lippe.

1443
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,635
Oh, Tim Lippe, yes. Go ahead.

1444
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,303
I'm not selling anything,

1445
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,847
I just wanna explain
something to you for two minutes.

1446
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:02,932
Do you have two minutes?

1447
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,016
Of course.

1448
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,936
Well, he certainly values you as a customer
and I was just wondering,

1449
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,271
if he needed to reach out to you,

1450
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,689
would you be willing to help him out?

1451
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:11,148
You bet. Tim rocks.

1452
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:20,324
Here we go.

1453
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:25,830
It is my privilege to announce
the Two Diamond winner,

1454
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,958
our friends from BrownStar Insurance,

1455
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,002
Bill Krogstad, I see you there.
Come on, come on.

1456
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,547
Front row, he's in the front row.
 Let's hear it for him.

1457
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:37,675
Oh, man, this is great. Thanks, Orin.

1458
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,218
This is so great.

1459
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:42,179
I think this is kind of a
bittersweet honor, folks,

1460
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:46,267
because, after 25-plus years,

1461
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,852
I'm gonna be selling BrownStar.

1462
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,688
Yeah, to this son of a gun right here,
 Mike Pyle.

1463
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,106
Let's hear it for him. Come on up here,
 Mike.

1464
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,616
Bill and I wanted to take this opportunity

1465
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,076
to finally put pen to paper on our deal.

1466
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,786
Guys, hold on a minute.

1467
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,497
Tim Lippe, everyone.

1468
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,043
Hi, everyone.

1469
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,881
As you just heard, Mike Pyle wants
 to buy BrownStar,

1470
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,009
but only if it's a Two Diamond
rated agency.

1471
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:23,554
And for good reason,
because the Two Diamond Award

1472
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:27,600
is synonymous with modesty,
 integrity and hard work.

1473
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,188
Which is why it might surprise
you to find out

1474
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,566
what I actually did to win this award.

1475
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:41,197
I went into my one-on-one session with Orin

1476
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:43,699
in the Tiffany Suite,

1477
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:47,995
and we engaged in a filthy act

1478
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,040
of which I am totally ashamed.

1479
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,837
I let Orin inside of me,

1480
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:01,217
where he tainted the most sacred
and special part of me.

1481
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,556
Of course, I'm talking about my integrity,

1482
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,851
which I thought was priceless,

1483
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,105
but turns out it's only worth $1 ,500

1484
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,691
because that's what I paid Orin
 to get this award.

1485
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,318
Tim, I think there's some mistake here.

1486
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:20,444
No mistake.

1487
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,155
No, I think I have receipts for
 the back dues.

1488
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,949
You can't hide from the truth, Orin.

1489
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,036
When I got to Cedar Rapids,

1490
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,163
I was scared and I
 trusted the wrong people.

1491
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,374
I thought, because I was from a small town,

1492
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,959
I couldn't think for myself.

1493
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,877
Boy, was that a mistake.

1494
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,673
ASMI deserves an award that actually
stands for something,

1495
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,843
and I just hope that by the time
I come back next year,

1496
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,637
maybe I will have shown you that

1497
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,682
I really understand what that means again.

1498
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,854
I'm really sorry.

1499
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,906
Hey, Bill, the award was part of the deal.
 I know that.

1500
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,325
This is a problem. We got a real mess here.

1501
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:09,744
Nothing I can't change.

1502
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,246
You don't have the award. A deal is a deal.

1503
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,539
It's right there.
You just saw him give it to me.

1504
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,166
What are you talking about?
 This is a no go.

1505
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:16,959
This is a no go.

1506
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:18,961
I'm proud of you, Tim.

1507
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:20,045
That was the right thing to do.

1508
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,339
Lippe, you freaking goofy bastard.

1509
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,925
After all I did for you, how dare you?

1510
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,094
You fucked up a great deal.

1511
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,513
No, that wasn't a good deal.
 It was a dirty deal.

1512
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:32,850
You lied. Sold us down the river.

1513
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,894
And you know what? I've had enough of it.

1514
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,063
I called a bunch of my clients last night.
They all said the same thing.

1515
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,775
They said they trust me,
and they want to stick by me,

1516
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,276
and I wanna stick by them.

1517
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,529
I'm gonna try to make a go of this
on my own in Brown Valley.

1518
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,156
You listen to me, kid.

1519
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,909
This is my company and I'm selling it.

1520
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,537
All right, well,
 you'll have to do it without my clients.

1521
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,373
I've already got 17 of them committed
to me in writing.

1522
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:59,210
Oh, yeah? Really? We'll see about that.

1523
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,379
It's squeaky clean, Bill.
 I've got the faxes right here.

1524
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,886
Son of a bitch!

1525
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:17,311
You did it.

1526
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:18,395
That's fighting the tiger.

1527
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,397
Wow. Right there.

1528
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,025
Let's get this guy a cream sherry,
 tout de suite.

1529
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,318
Way to stand them down.

1530
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:25,486
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

1531
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:26,695
That was awesome.

1532
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,575
Here you are, Mr. Lippe.

1533
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:33,369
Thank you.

1534
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,578
Knock, knock.

1535
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:36,914
Who's there?

1536
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,708
I don't know. I'm too doggone
tired to answer the door.

1537
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,171
I love it. Classic Ronimal.
 Almost not a joke.

1538
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,550
I'll tell you what, guys.

1539
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,678
My cousin Bob, who is loaded by the way,

1540
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:53,681
has a cottage in Lake
of the Woods in Canada.

1541
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:58,185
This summer, the three of us.
What do you say?

1542
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,521
More time in a tightly
 enclosed space with Ziegler.

1543
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:01,605
Sign me up.

1544
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,983
I think it sounds like an awesome idea.

1545
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,652
Actually, the Ronimal could use a vacation.

1546
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,612
Done and done.

1547
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,281
Give me some sugar.

1548
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,032
Oh!

1549
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,285
Come on, Timbo. I love you, pal.

1550
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,876
There she is. The belle of the ball.

1551
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:24,920
Until the next ASMI, my dear.

1552
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,922
Bye, Deanzie.

1553
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,173
Stay foxy.

1554
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,134
Call you tomorrow, Timbo.

1555
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,970
Bye, Ron. Bye-bye.

1556
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:35,931
See you, Ronimal. Bye.

1557
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:41,854
So, you keep in touch.

1558
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:43,898
E-mail, all that good stuff.

1559
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,317
Yeah, I will. Of course.

1560
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,868
Thanks, Insurance Man.

1561
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:57,953
For what?

1562
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,040
For a good time.

1563
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:33,697
Oh, hey, you.

1564
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:35,741
Jeez, what happened?

1565
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,576
Well, let's see.

1566
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:44,333
I got beat up, and I got completely
blotto on drugs and alcohol,

1567
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,835
and I befriended a prostitute.

1568
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,463
It was awesome.

1569
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:53,133
Well, I guess someone deserves two
bags of honey roasted peanuts.

1570
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,969
Wow, thanks, Sherri.

1571
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,929
You bet. See you next time.

1572
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,557
Two bags.

1573
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:04,812
Awesome.

1574
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:19,410
Why did the psychoanalyst prescribe
anxiety drugs to the anxious doctor?

1575
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:21,996
I don't know.

1576
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,831
Because he had no patience.

1577
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,792
Okay. Ouch! Okay.

1578
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:28,335
That was painful.

1579
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:29,753
Okay, what's brown and sticky?

1580
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:32,089
I don't know. What?

1581
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,590
A stick.

1582
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,430
What do you call an anorexic
 with a yeast infection?

1583
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,266
A quarter-pounder with cheese.

1584
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,143
Oh, man. That's gross.

1585
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:45,436
That's terrible, man.

1586
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,271
Yes, you can.

1587
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,148
No, you can't. I've heard...

1588
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:51,191
No, it's not a wives tale. You can.

1589
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,651
No, you can't really do that.

1590
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,070
The flame would go up into
your bottom and...

1591
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,280
No, no, listen.

1592
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:57,656
...blow you up or something. You know what?

1593
01:23:57,782 --> 01:24:00,993
I got one in the chamber right
now. I got one right now.

1594
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,788
Oh, my gosh.

1595
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,625
It went back up there a little bit.

1596
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,135
Hi, I'm Dean Ziegler.

1597
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,512
Hi, I'm Ronald Wilkes.

1598
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,556
And I'm Tim Lippe.

1599
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,767
There are a lot of risks out there today.

1600
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,977
Which is why you need
 insurance from the best.

1601
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,229
If you live in Wisconsin or Minnesota,

1602
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,441
Top Notch Mutual has your
insurance needs covered.

1603
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,985
Because, no matter what happens...

1604
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,157
We got you. We got you.

1605
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,287
We got you. We got you.

1606
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,919
Don't worry, little girl.

1607
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:53,420
We got you. We got you.

1608
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:55,506
Remember, call anytime...

1609
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:57,549
Day or night. Because no matter what...

1610
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:04,348
We got you. We got you.

1611
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:14,817
Last night I had the strangest dream

1612
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:19,113
I sailed away to China In
 a little row boat to find ya

1613
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:23,367
And you said you had to
get your laundry cleaned

1614
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,452
Didn't want no one to hold you

1615
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,913
What does that mean? And you said...

1616
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:30,124
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride

1617
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:33,919
Nobody gonna slow me down Oh, no

1618
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:36,588
I've got to keep on movin'

1619
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,799
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride

1620
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:42,636
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground Oh, no

1621
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,347
I've got to keep on movin'

1622
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:49,726
You're on the road and now
 you pray it lasts

1623
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:54,064
The road behind was rocky,
but now you're feelin' cocky

1624
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:58,193
You look at me and you see your past

1625
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:02,030
Is that the reason why
you're runnin' so fast

1626
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,200
Never let another girl like you

1627
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,161
Work me over

1628
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,538
Never let another girl like you

1629
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,498
Drag me under

1630
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,876
If I meet another girl like you

1631

I will tell her

1632

Never want another girl like you

1633
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:20,215

01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:31,101
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride

1638
