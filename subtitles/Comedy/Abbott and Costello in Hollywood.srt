1
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,525
Aah!

2
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,693
Whoa!

3
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,397
Operator, haven't you
been able to get me...

4
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,424
the express office
in Florida yet?

5
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,631
Yes, I know it takes time to
call from London to the States.

6
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,800
But please hurry.
It's terribly important!

7
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,310
Answer that phone.

8
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,539
Answer the bell!

9
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,809
Answer the phone!

10
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,443
- Which do you want me to answer first?
- Both of'em.

11
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,716
Both of'em.
Both of'em!

12
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,849
Hold the line, please.
Thank you.

13
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,326
I'd like to have my
grip, please. Yes, ma'am.

14
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,728
Let me see that.
They came in on the last train.

15
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,460
We haven't unloaded the truck yet.
Go out and get the lady's grip.

16
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,402
Hurry up.

17
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,202
Excuse me, please.

18
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,085
Lady, here's your bag.

19
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,049
What are you trying to do, ruin the
lady's baggage? Where is it? This one.

20
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,426
There you are. I'm sorry. Thank you.

21
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,931
Come on, clean this up.
Straighten it out.

22
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,229
Wilbur, darling,
are you all right?

23
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:26,261
Sandra, I hurt
my poor little head.

24
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,136
Your head?
Mm-hmm.

25
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,473
Oh, no.

26
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,603
Does this hurt?
Uh-uh.

27
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,978
Does that hurt?
Uh-uh.

28
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,712
Thank heaven. If anything
happened to you, dearest,

29
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,550
I'd never
forgive myself.

30
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,921
That kiss made everything
all better.

31
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,358
You worry about me
an awful lot, don't you?

32
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,626
You mean an awful lot to me. Tell me more.

33
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,497
I will... at dinner tonight. Okay.

34
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:02,107
Get up and go to work! That is, if
your head doesn't bother you too much.

35
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,042
His head is all right. It is?
But is your head all right?

36
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,739
Certainly. Frankly, I don't get it.

37
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,907
And frankly,
you never will.

38
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,576
I can't understand
that dame.

39
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,420
Of all the guys around here, that classy
dish has to pick out a guy like you.

40
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,460
What's wrong with that? Look at
yourself in the mirror sometime.

41
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,825
Why should I hurt
my own feelings?

42
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:28,856
Go answer the phone.
I'll pick these up.

43
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,599
Baggage room.

44
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,006
London?
Calling here?

45
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,738
This ain't collect, is it?

46
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,246
Oh, all right.
Put him on.

47
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:47,685
Hello? Do you have two crates addressed
to the McDougal House of Horrors?

48
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,245
What's the number on the
checks? Never mind that.

49
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,588
Tonight the moon will be full.
I haven't much time.

50
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,061
Listen closely.
I'm flying out of here at dawn.

51
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,157
Under no circumstances are you to
deliver those crates until I arrive.

52
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,398
Understand?
Under...

53
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,632
Under...

54
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,642
Mr. McDougal, will you stop
gargling your throat?

55
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,576
Hey, you'll have to get your dog away from
the phone. I can't hear a word you're sayin'.

56
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,915
You're silly to call me all the way from
London just to have your dog talk to me.

57
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,259
That's great conversation.
The guy growls like a wolf.

58
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,698
The nerve of some people!
What can I do for you, bub?

59
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,894
I have two crates addressed to my House
of Horrors, and I want immediate delivery.

60
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,995
My name's McDougal. McDougal? I just
talked to you on the phone from London.

61
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,599
How'd you get here so fast? They shoot
you out of a cannon? Are you crazy?

62
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,009
I've been here all the time.
Now get me those crates!

63
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,206
How long you been here? Five minutes.

64
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,681
I've been here five years,
you don't see me yelling...

65
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,744
There's the insurance slip and the
bill of lading. Now get me those crates!

66
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,724
Will you please stop yellin'? Come
here. It's impolite to raise your voice.

67
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,728
Chick! Why didn't you give
me these in the first place?

68
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,731
Chi... Chick, this man
wants these crates.

69
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,893
Insured for $20,000.
We better look these up.

70
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,903
Must be valuable. I'll
say they're valuable.

71
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,666
Wilbur?
Yes, Sandra?

72
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,707
He's busy.
Please.

73
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,573
That little fellow's impossible.
Hurry up with those crates!

74
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,842
Do you know what I've got in
there? Haven't the slightest idea.

75
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,782
The greatest attraction the House
of Horrors ever had, that's all.

76
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,810
One of them's a coffin containing the
remains of the original Count Dracula.

77
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,451
The other's the body
of the Frankenstein monster.

78
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:12,191
That combination's enough to scare the pants...
I mean, shirt right off your back, ain't it?

79
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,098
I don't scare easily. Neither
do I where money's concerned.

80
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,002
I got 'em cheap. European agent
picked my name right out of thin air.

81
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,005
Very interesting.
Yeah.

82
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,639
Mr. McDougal.

83
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,738
Hey, Chick,
here's one.

84
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,181
Darling,
I have to run along.

85
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,481
Something's come up. That means
we'll have to break our date tonight.

86
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,114
It ain't another man, is it?
Of course not.

87
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,124
Silly boy.

88
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,864
Boy, I'm floatin'
on a cloud of love.

89
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,994
You little blimp, I'll let the air
out of you if you don't give me a hand.

90
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,733
You understand that?
Thank you.

91
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,332
Boy, is this kid lost.

92
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,971
Take that rope. Get up on that box
and tie it to that handle up there.

93
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,981
Okay.
Nothing matters no more.

94
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,780
I'm so happy. Go on, get up there!

95
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,127
Here it is.

96
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,896
Hold still now.

97
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,367
Whoa!

98
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,370
Chick!

99
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,204
Stop him! Is he trying to
ruin me? You're insured.

100
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,403
Yes, and if those exhibits are
damaged, I intend to collect.

101
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,641
Whoa!

102
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,177
Well, there you are. Shall
I wrap it up? No, you idiot.

103
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,120
Take those to my House of
Horrors and uncrate them.

104
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,124
If that's the way you handle baggage, I'm
going to have the insurance agent there...

105
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,422
to inspect them
before I accept delivery.

106
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,327
Then it's gonna cost you
overtime because I'm a union man.

107
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:55,595
I work only 16 hours a day. A union
man only works eight hours a day.

108
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,603
I belong
to two unions!

109
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,006
Get those down to my place! All right.

110
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,450
Hey, Wilbur, here's a key. Open the door.

111
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,365
I'm not gonna like this.
Come on, gimme a hand.

112
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,567
Come on,
get it inside.

113
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,372
Pull it! You want me
to do all the work?

114
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,183
Come on, help me
with it, will ya?

115
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,383
Uh-oh. What's the matter now?

116
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,858
Somebody's got a knife
in my back. Oh, nonsense!

117
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,521
Where's the switch?
Here.

118
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,599
Sandra should
see you now.

119
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,398
Turn around. Look what you're afraid of.

120
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,065
Turn around!

121
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,171
I... Come on, get up on
your feet. It's only a dummy.

122
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,648
Dummy nothin'. It was
smart enough to scare me.

123
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,586
Get ahold of the box.
Go ahead.

124
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,419
Come on,
swing it around.

125
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,293
Help a little bit.!

126
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,558
Oh!
Ah, ah!

127
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,999
You fraidy-cat. These things can't
harm ya. They're made out of wax.

128
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,662
People pay McDougal cash to
come in here and get scared.

129
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,729
I'm cheatin' him. I'm
gettin' scared for nothin'.

130
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,639
Go ahead and push.
Don't knock anything over.

131
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,145
There we are. Now we get the
dolly out from underneath there.

132
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,671
Lift up that end.
Lift it up!

133
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,514
Come on, come on.

134
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,520
There you are.

135
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,285
Put it down, put it down.
Do I have to do all the work?

136
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,223
I'll get it down.
Put it down.

137
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,126
Go ahead.
Now open it up.

138
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,892
I'm going out and get the
other crate. And no back talk!

139
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,628
I've got just two words to
say to you. What is that?

140
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,932
Hurry back.
Aah!

141
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,149
Hello?
Yes, Mr. McDougal.

142
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,914
Yeah, the crates are here.
Wilbur's opening one now.

143
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,048
Mm-hmm.
Everything's all right.

144
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,854
Okay, Mr. McDougal.
Good-bye.

145
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,102
Chick?
Oh, Chi... ick!

146
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,729
What's the matter?

147
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,740
Did you turn out the light? Certainly not.

148
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,776
They're out.
So what?

149
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,936
Maybe the lightning
struck the power line.

150
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,277
I get in more messes around
here. Take off that canvas.

151
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,782
Take it off?
Take it off!

152
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,123
Hey, a coffin!
C-Coffin.

153
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,622
Dracula crest.
Dracula's crest.

154
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:14,132
I wonder if Mr. McDougal expects people
to think that Dracula's really in there.

155
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,361
No, don't.
Please don't.

156
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:21,498
Oh, now come, come. Dracula
was just a legendary character.

157
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,099
He never existed. Certainly not. No?

158
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,373
Fold up this canvas. I'm going
out and get the other crate.

159
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,937
If you want me, just holler
"Oh, Chick!" You understand?

160
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,607
Oh, Chick!
What?

161
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,675
What kept you?
I haven't left yet.

162
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,950
The next time, don't take so
long. Fold this up. Get busy.

163
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,703
"Count Dracula sleeps
in this coffin...

164
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,298
but rises every night
at sunset. "

165
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,276
Chick is right.
This is silly stuff.

166
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,973
"Dracula... "

167
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,924
Chick! Chi... ick!

168
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,827
What's the matter? You know that
person you said there's no such person?

169
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:22,664
I think he's in there... in person. I was
reading this sign, "Dracula's Legend. "

170
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,296
All of a sudden I heard...

171
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,533
That's the wind.
It should get oiled.

172
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,703
Stop reading this. That's a lot of
baloney to fool McDougal's customers.

173
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,270
Fold up that canvas.
Get busy. Come on.

174
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,654
"Dracula can change himself
at will into a vampire bat,

175
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,165
flying about
the countryside. "

176
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,565
Flying.

177
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,696
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

178
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,209
Chick!

179
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,110
Chick.!

180
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,546
You're making enough noise
to wake up the dead!

181
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't have to wake him up.
He's up. I saw a hand.

182
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,352
You saw a hand? Where? Right over there.

183
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,049
Let me see it.
Where is it?

184
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,523
I saw a hand there! You don't
know what you're talking about!

185
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,790
You're excited reading
this legend. Listen, Wilbur.

186
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,027
I know there's no such person as Dracula.
You know there's no such person as Dracula!

187
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,694
But does Dracula know it? Listen to me.

188
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,705
McDougal will be here any minute with
the insurance agent. Now get to work!

189
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:55,794
"He keeps himself alive
by drinking the blood... "

190
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,772
Chick. Chick.

191
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,836
Chick.

192
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,372
Chick. Ch...

193
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,218
Ch-Ch-Chick!

194
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,657
Oh!

195
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,160
Listen, this is getting
to be ridiculous.

196
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,459
What?

197
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,193
Are you trying to tell me
that candle moved?

198
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,327
Candles can't move!
This one did.

199
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,929
Watch it.
Keep your eye on it.

200
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,440
Is it moving?
Huh?

201
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,477
It's not moving, is it?
Not now.

202
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,275
Use your brains a bit.
Let's get this job finished.

203
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,080
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

204
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:08,295
"He keeps himself alive by
drinking the blood of his victims. "

205
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:13,930
Hmph. "Count Dracula must return
to his coffin before sunrise.

206
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,908
He, he, he...
H-H-He... "

207
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,345
Chick! Chick!

208
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,510
Oh, Chick!
Ha-ha-ha, Chick!

209
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:31,079
Chick! Oh, oh, oh!

210
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,024
Oh, Chick, come on!
Come on!

211
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,392
All right,
I'm comin'.

212
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,864
Come on, will ya! Wait a
minute. What's wrong now?

213
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,561
Oh, Chick!

214
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,967
You gonna tell me that candle
moved again? Yeah, yeah.

215
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,768
I told you not to read this,
didn't I? I can't help it.

216
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,004
"Count Dracula must return
to his coffin before sunrise,

217
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,637
where he lies helpless
during the day. "

218
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:59,377
That's the bunk! That's what I'm
trying to tell ya. That's his bunk!

219
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,681
Come here.

220
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,121
Don't, Chick. Come here.
Come here! Come around here!

221
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,254
Come over here.
Look in there.

222
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,491
Now,
do you see anything?

223
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,498
No.
Certainly not.

224
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,434
Help me open that crate. Come on. Hmph.

225
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,870
Get with it,
will you please?

226
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,075
You can always...

227
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,580
"Frankenstein's Monster. "
Get a load of this.

228
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,241
"A scientist named Frankenstein
made a monster...

229
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,784
by sewing together parts
of old, dead bodies. "

230
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,786
Do you have to read that stuff? Wait.

231
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:40,291
"Frankenstein gave the monster eternal
life by shooting it full of electricity.

232
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,726
Some people claim it is not
dead even now, just dormant. "

233
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,562
Now who'd be silly enough
to believe that?

234
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,369
Who would be silly enough
to believe that?

235
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,601
Me.

236
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,440
Open up that crate.

237
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,399
Chick,
did you hear that?

238
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,061
Yeah, I heard you pulling
the nails out. Go ahead.

239
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,627
Pulling the nails?

240
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,307
Chick?
Quiet.

241
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,783
I don't want to hear any more
of your foolish questions.

242
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,321
Come on,
open up the crate.

243
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,618
There we are.

244
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,823
You've got it.
Now get ahold of it.

245
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,366
Throw it
right on the side.

246
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:59,336
That's it, fine. Come on,
help me with this excelsior.

247
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,872
Take it all out.

248
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,103
Wow! Look out!
Cover it up!

249
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,237
What's the matter? Cover
the whole... Ooh, ooh!

250
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,805
Aw, stop that!

251
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,818
Uh-oh.
Now you did it.

252
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,047
What are you doing in there
with the lights off?

253
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,055
McDougal!
Now we're in trouble.

254
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,455
Hide that head.
Hurry up!

255
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,601
Master.

256
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,569
Yes.

257
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,700
Come. Follow me.

258
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,348
Don't be afraid.
He won't hurt you.

259
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,359
Come!

260
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,062
Hurry up.
Come.

261
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,158
This better be
a good one.

262
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,136
What's the matter, you
afraid of the dark? No.

263
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,639
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

264
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,537
What is this?

265
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,844
McDougal is here. I... What's the
matter with you? Snap out of it.

266
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,317
Where are my bodies?
There were no bodies.

267
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,411
We opened both crates.
Look in there.

268
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,615
If they're not here, where
are they? They must be stolen.

269
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,920
My company inspected the
contents before they were shipped.

270
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,222
Then they must've been
stolen en route. You saw them?

271
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,525
No, no. Then where did they go?

272
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,963
I don't know. If they're gone,
I want my insurance money.

273
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,831
My company doesn't pay off
until a full investigation.

274
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,700
If you don't produce those bodies,
I'm going to call the police!

275
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,297
Police?
P-Police!

276
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,105
I can do better than that.
Police!

277
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:03,273
I'll get you.
Come on, go on!

278
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,450
Let's take it out.

279
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,629
Come!

280
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,256
Good evening,
Dr. Mornay.

281
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,131
My dear Count,
it's so good to see you again.

282
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,400
And you look more charming
than when I saw you last.

283
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,739
Come in, Count Dracula. Thank you, Sandra.

284
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,076
But the name is Dr. Lejos. I wouldn't
want to frighten your technical assistant.

285
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,673
Professor Stevens?
Don't worry.

286
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,184
He's completely engrossed
in his work.

287
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,381
Besides, he should be out of
here by tomorrow. Excellent.

288
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,118
Yes, except that he's asking
too many questions.

289
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,491
I will take care of that.
Is everything else arranged?

290
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,122
Yes. Where did you leave him? In the cold.

291
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,632
I'll get a wrap.

292
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,247
Nervous, my dear?

293
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,681
This is risky business.

294
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,948
Not as risky as those
curious operations of yours...

295
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,252
that so intrigued
the European police.

296
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,088
Yet much more
profitable.

297
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,688
Restore the monster for me, and
you shall have anything you wish.

298
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,825
In that case, we better start
as soon as possible.

299
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,360
It's dangerous to leave him
in this weakened condition.

300
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,839
Have you mastered
Dr. Frankenstein's notebook?

301
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,902
Let me get my hand on a
scalpel again and you shall see.

302
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,004
And about the brain!

303
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,549
I don't want to repeat
Frankenstein's mistake...

304
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,609
and revive a vicious,
unmanageable brute.

305
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,384
This time the monster must
have no will of his own.

306
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,949
No fiendish intellect
to oppose his master.

307
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,794
There, dear Count, I believe I
have exceeded your fondest wishes.

308
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,323
The new brain I've chosen
for the monster is so simple,

309
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,963
so pliable, it will obey
you like a trained dog.

310
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,907
Good.
How soon?

311
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:22,003
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur
was taking me to a masquerade ball.

312
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,141
But I'm sure he'd prefer to
spend a quiet evening at home.

313
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,086
Bring him
through here.

314
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:42,189
I tell you, Chick, I saw
what I saw when I saw it!

315
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,668
Keep quiet! You babbling
about dead people walking away!

316
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,501
That's why we were arrested
and thrown in jail.

317
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,065
Do you realize we've spent a
whole day and night in jail?

318
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,579
And we'd still be there if
some dame hadn't bailed us out.

319
00:26:55,647 --> 00:27:00,175
Chick, stop calling Sandra
a dame!

320
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,549
I'm tellin' ya,
they were there.

321
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,419
Oh, stop.
Two of'em.

322
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,890
One of'em
was about eight foot tall.

323
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,395
Way up there!
And he walked like this.

324
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,769
Just like that.

325
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,566
Now, that's the way he walked. Stop it.

326
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,575
You don't believe that? Certainly not!

327
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,010
Well, I saw it.
And the other one,

328
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,070
he went like this.

329
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,515
And he kept gettin'
closer and closer.

330
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,614
He had eyes
that were balls of fire.

331
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,889
He kept staring,
eye to eye.

332
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:48,194
Eye to eye!
Staring!

333
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,257
I never saw anything like it
in my life.

334
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,270
Believe me when I tell you
I was scared to death.

335
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,001
Really I was.
I was really scared, Chick.

336
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,369
What's the matter...
Chick?

337
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,116
Oh!
What did I do?

338
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:10,052
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that.
Come on, be just like you used to be.

339
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,954
Ah, go away! Atta boy! I'm happy.

340
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,323
That's just like you used
to be. Stop this nonsense!

341
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,037
You're Wilbur Gray?
Yes, sir.

342
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,039
Then you must be Chick Young. So what?

343
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,371
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been
looking all over town for you.

344
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,742
You didn't have to look far.
We were in jail. Yes, I know.

345
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,839
I'm the one who telephoned you
not to deliver those bodies.

346
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,908
I knew they were alive! Oh! Oh!

347
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:44,443
So you thought I was imagining things when
I told you about the fellow eight feet tall...

348
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:48,049
walking with the stiff legs, and
the other fellow with this here.

349
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,993
Wait! You're crazy,
and so is this screwball!

350
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,463
Look, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.

351
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,796
I followed Dracula
all the way from Europe...

352
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:01,100
because I believe he's going to try
and revive the Frankenstein monster.

353
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,403
We must find him and destroy him
before he can do this! Wait a minute.

354
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,105
Go down to the police, tell them you know
the story about Dracula and the monster.

355
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,478
They'd be very interested. I can't do that.

356
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,985
Because then I'd have
to tell them who I am...

357
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,181
and why I know
what I know.

358
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,852
Soon...
Soon the moon will rise.

359
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,031
I haven't time
to explain.

360
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,731
I've taken the room across the
hall. Here's the key. Lock me in!

361
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,274
Lock you in? Yes, please. Hurry!

362
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,833
It's silly,
but I'll do it.

363
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,845
He's scared too.

364
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,641
Remember, no matter what
you hear or what happens,

365
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,313
don't let me out!

366
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,240
"Lock me in. " That guy
is screwier than you are.

367
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,368
He is not.
He's a nice man.

368
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,311
He's worried about the police getting
him because he knows they're alive.

369
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:20,147
I'm going to bed.
Well...

370
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,379
Hey,
he forgot his bag.

371
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,183
Mr. Talbot,
you forgot your grip.

372
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,194
Mr. Talbot?

373
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:39,327
Mr. Talbot?

374
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,187
Now, how'd he
get out of here?

375
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,420
Hmph.
I'll leave him a note.

376
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,833
I left your bag...

377
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,668
in the bedroom.

378
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,371
Wilbur.

379
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,706
I wonder if
he counted these.

380
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,710
He might've.

381
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,086
Aah!

382
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,823
Maybe he didn't.

383
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,106
A fine insurance company
I'm doing business with!

384
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,109
Outsmarted by
a couple of morons!

385
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,407
Those two crooks
got out of jail on bail!

386
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,606
We know, Mr. McDougal,
but you see we...

387
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,049
In fact, I arranged it. Who are you?

388
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,417
This is Miss Raymond, an
investigator from the home office.

389
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,424
It's my job to find
those missing exhibits.

390
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:46,794
I'm sure I can persuade the chubby
fellow to lead me right to them.

391
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,163
Naturally I couldn't persuade
him very well in jail.

392
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,105
Wilbur, please! I've had
nightmares all night long!

393
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,472
I don't want to hear any more about dead
bodies. I saw what I saw when I saw it.

394
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,410
All right.

395
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,175
Am I glad to see you.
Will you talk to that guy?

396
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,547
Sandra! Darling, I heard what happened.

397
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,451
That's awful. They can't put
my little Wilbur in jail.

398
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,423
They can't, but they did.
Thank you for bailing us out.

399
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,517
I? I only learned
about it this morning.

400
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:21,258
Didn't the policeman tell you
a lady bailed us out? He did.

401
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,699
Wilbur, you haven't been
untrue to your Sandra?

402
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,330
Sandra, how can you look
me in the face and say that?

403
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,898
How can you look him in
the face period? Hmph.

404
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,707
I came by to remind you about
the masquerade ball tonight.

405
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,180
I was getting ready
to pick up my costume.

406
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:42,185
Come by for me early,
dearest. About sunset.

407
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,316
Alone.
Good-bye.

408
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,827
What I'd like to know is, what
has he got that I haven't got?

409
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,489
A brain.

410
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,590
Ahh.
A brain.

411
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,192
I'd like to know
where it is.

412
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,864
Oh. She forgot
to kiss me good-bye.

413
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,972
Mmm! Oh, oh.

414
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,574
Now who is this? She's...
She's... She's beautiful.

415
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,483
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.

416
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,181
I'm the girl who arranged
your release from jail.

417
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,747
Why should you want
to spring us?

418
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,487
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

419
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,019
Well! As long as you
put it that way, I, uh...

420
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,692
That's what happened
to me.

421
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,634
Wilbur, darling!

422
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,976
Miss Raymond, when did this
mad feeling first come over you?

423
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:44,481
The instant I saw you in the baggage
room. I knew then that I wanted to spend...

424
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,517
every minute that
I'm in town with you.

425
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,279
You did?

426
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,651
What are we doing tonight?
He's going to a masquerade ball.

427
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,054
But, uh,
I'm not doing anything.

428
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,889
- In that case, you'll be lonesome.
- Well, naturally...

429
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:02,627
Darling, I haven't been to a masquerade
ball in ages. I was hoping you'd ask me.

430
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,793
Wilbur!

431
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,894
Come here.

432
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:10,998
Miss Raymond,
will you excuse me?

433
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,067
Oh,
you irresistible boy!

434
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,539
Do you want me? Yes, I
want you. Come over here.

435
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,485
I just wanted to get a good
look at you in the light.

436
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,488
I still don't get it.
Jealous?

437
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,582
Wilbur, I'll have to go out
and get a costume.

438
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,627
That's funny.
I was just going too.

439
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:34,529
I'll go to my room, pick up a couple
things and meet you in the lobby.

440
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,931
All right.
In the lobby.

441
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,129
I'll get my hat and coat. I'll
be right with you. Excuse me.

442
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:43,765
Now you've got two dates. What
about Sandra, you bigamist?

443
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:47,470
Sandra? I don't know.
Joan is awful cute.

444
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,639
All right, you takeJoan, I'll
take Sandra. Oh, Sandra sends me.

445
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,411
Then I'll takeJoan.
Joan sends me too.

446
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,385
Listen, you sawed-off Romeo,
in a minute, I'll send you!

447
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,446
You don't even appeal
to me.

448
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,153
Look, Wilbur, we've always
been pals, haven't we? Yes.

449
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,821
We've always shared and shared
alike, haven't we? Mm-hmm.

450
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,457
Let's be reasonable.
Come on.

451
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,592
I've always shared with you. That you have!

452
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,193
If I had two cigarettes, I'd
give you one. That's right.

453
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,104
If I had two pair of shoes, I'd
give you a pair. Don't I know that?

454
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,870
And if I have two girls... Well?

455
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,208
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on
those shoes and take a walk for yourself?

456
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,340
That's what I'm going to do,
but with you.

457
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,193
This key don't fit.
This is Tal...

458
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,256
Talbot's key.
Hey, we forgot about him.

459
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,706
Boy, what a bender
he must've been on last night!

460
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,541
Hey, Mr. Talbot.
Mr. Talbot!

461
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,639
And I thought you were such
a nice man. Look at yourself.

462
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,618
You're a mess.!
Last night...

463
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,918
I went through another
of my horrible experiences.

464
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,687
Years ago I was bitten
by a werewolf.

465
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,422
Ever since,
when the full moon rises...

466
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,124
I turn into a wolf
myself.

467
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,966
Oh, pal,
that's all right.

468
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:24,497
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...

469
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,339
I thought that you were the
only one that would believe me,

470
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,370
that you were the one that
knew I spoke the truth.

471
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,543
You have seen...
the living dead.

472
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,144
Mm-hmm.

473
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,451
I came all the way
from Europe...

474
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,856
because Dracula and the
monster must be destroyed.

475
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,827
Together
we must find them!

476
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,227
Let's not start that
all over again.

477
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,960
I can't go. I've got a date.
In fact, I've got two dates.

478
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:54,403
But you and I... have a date with destiny.

479
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,838
Let Chick go
with destiny.

480
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,273
Won't you please?
Huh?

481
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:11,279
You kids stay here.
I'm going up and get Sandra.

482
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,525
She's mine too.

483
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,387
Pardon me just a minute.
Wilbur!

484
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,457
Look, you've got Joan and
Sandra. You've got two girls!

485
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,026
How about the two girls we had last
week? Let's not talk about that.

486
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,698
You got no kick comin'. You had
the best lookin' one. So what?

487
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,436
Yours had teeth.
Yours had teeth too.

488
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,341
Did you see that tooth?
I happened to see it.

489
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,744
Mine had so much bridgework, every
time I kissed her I had to pay toll.

490
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,748
What's the use?

491
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,683
Wilbur, can't we both
go along too?

492
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,915
Yes, mon amour. That's
Spanish. That's French.

493
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:49,119
How do you like that? I speak
French too. You cute devil!

494
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,127
Stop that.

495
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,130
Come on, lead the way. Come on.

496
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,684
Hello.
Hello.

497
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,379
Is Sandra in?
Who?

498
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,514
Sandra.
You mean Dr. Mornay?

499
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,081
If that's what she is, I'm
just what the doctor ordered.

500
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,093
Come in.
Thank you.

501
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,123
I thought Sandra
was your date.

502
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,793
Or did we both come along
for the ride? No, no.

503
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,769
Perhaps I should introduce
myself. I'm Professor Stevens.

504
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,205
This is Miss Raymond, Wilbur
Gray, and I'm Chick Young.

505
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,799
How do you do, Miss Raymond? How do you do?

506
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,675
I have work to finish, but it
shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

507
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,013
Wait in the library. I'll be right
down. We're here to pick up Sandra.

508
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,417
Of course. I'm sure
she's around somewhere.

509
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,615
Wilbur!

510
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,352
Sandra, hello.

511
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,361
That girl, who is she? Um, mmm...

512
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,956
Uh, she's Chick's date. She's
going to the masquerade with us.

513
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,433
I told you to come here alone.
We'll have to get rid of them.

514
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,131
I'll have to get rid
of somebody.

515
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,065
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.

516
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,043
Joan, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Joan.

517
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,478
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?

518
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,210
Why, the young man
who answered the door.

519
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,548
Oh, Professor Stevens.

520
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,215
I'm on a vacation, you see,
and traveling incognito.

521
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,225
What are you doing here? Same thing.

522
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:33,855
Shall we get going? As
soon as I put on my costume.

523
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,923
Would you like to powder
your nose? I'd love to.

524
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,300
I'll be right back,
Wilbur.

525
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:44,501
I'll be right back, too,
Wilbur.

526
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,509
Toodle-oo!

527
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,780
Oh.

528
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:56,011
Chick, there's a time in everyone's
life... when they get in trouble.

529
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,213
I'm in a mess of it now. What's wrong?

530
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,053
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?

531
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:05,061
"Everything comes in threes. " Suppose a
third girl should fall in love with you?

532
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,326
What's her name? We'll
say her name is Mary.

533
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,333
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.

534
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:14,667
She'd have to be. Now you
have Mary, Joan and Sandra.

535
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,468
To prove to you that I'm
your pal, your bosom friend,

536
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,668
I'll take one of the girls
off your hands.

537
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,372
Chick, you're what I call
a real pal. It's all right.

538
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,905
You take Mary.

539
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,977
We better answer that phone.
They're all upstairs. Hello.

540
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,990
Hello?
Is Dr. Lejos there?

541
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,186
Just a minute. Somebody wants to know
about a Dr. Lejos. I don't know him.

542
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,627
Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is Wilbur Gray.

543
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,757
I thought I recognized
your voice.

544
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,393
This is Talbot speaking.

545
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:49,303
Listen. I just got a line
on Dracula and the monster.

546
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:54,470
Dr. Lejos has been receiving
a lot of electrical equipment,

547
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,514
just the type necessary
to revive the monster.

548
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,414
So what?
I'm way out on an island.

549
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,850
I've got my own problems.
But listen.

550
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,118
I believe you're in
the house of Dracula right now.

551
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,491
You can find the monster,
and I'll...

552
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,030
Hello?
Wilbur!

553
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,761
Come here! Chick, you don't
know what you're doin'!

554
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,269
What's the matter with
you? Shh, quiet. Come here.

555
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,271
- You didn't hang up the phone.
- Let him hang up the phone.

556
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,705
Who? Dracula and the monster live here.

557
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,710
Don't start that again.
Who told you that?

558
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,941
Talbot. He also said we've got
to search the place. Come here.

559
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,449
Come over here.

560
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,509
Listen, Talbot, enough is
enough. Wilbur's scared...

561
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,078
Hello? Hello? He's gone. So am I.

562
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:42,683
No, you don't. I'm gonna settle this thing
once and for all. We'll search this place.

563
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,526
It's past sunset; and if Dracula
is here, he's gonna want breakfast.

564
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,192
And I'm fatter than you, and it
ain't gonna be me! Just a minute.

565
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:54,761
It ain't gonna be me! I'm gonna prove
how crazy both you and Talbot are.

566
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,033
We'll search this place,
right from the basement.

567
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,440
Chick, we'll search it, you and
I together. Now we're talkin'.

568
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,446
Atta boy. You search the basement,
I'll search outside. No, you don't!

569
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,108
All right, I'll search outside. and you
search the basement. That's different.

570
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:09,380
Mm-hmm-hmm. It
worked! Ha-ha! Come on!

571
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,455
Let's look around here.

572
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,186
There's some doors
down there.

573
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,058
You think we oughta tell Sandra
where we're goin'? Certainly not.

574
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,091
You look over there.

575
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,079
Well?
Broom closet.

576
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:42,380
Broom closet? Look out. Mm-hmm.

577
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,478
Come on.

578
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,153
Broom closet?

579
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,925
Come on!
Wait for me.

580
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,123
Whoa!

581
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,661
Chick! Open!

582
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,682
Whoa!

583
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,116
Ooh! Chick!
Ahh! Chick!

584
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:40,994
Ah, Chick!

585
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,802
Aw, stop! It's the truth. Come here.

586
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,435
All I did
was like this.

587
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,748
I tell you, right over
there. Where are they?

588
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,717
They're in there.
Listen.

589
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,481
Wait. I'm gonna
look around.

590
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:08,013
You go ahead. If I don't find
anybody, I'm gonna beat your ears off.

591
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,218
Honest.
They're over there.

592
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:13,388
Oh, no. I ain't goin'
near that place anymore.

593
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,861
Whoa! Ooh!

594
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,002
Open sesame!
Open sesame!

595
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,127
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.

596
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:52,464
Stop. I'm getting sick and tired
of this silly nonsense of yours.

597
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,937
Some guy going around...
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

598
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,998
Another guy goin'... Uh! No, no!

599
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,044
The one guy goes...

600
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,569
And the other guy,
not like that, like this.

601
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,515
All right.
Put your hands down.

602
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,917
Come on, the girls
are waiting for us upstairs.

603
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,720
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.

604
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,727
Will you be long?
Just a few minutes.

605
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,377
Miss Raymond?
Yes?

606
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,080
I'm ready.
Shall we go?

607
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,316
Of course.

608
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,984
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.

609
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,133
Who screamed?

610
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,667
You did! I did? Ha-ha.

611
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,978
Listen, Wilbur, if you don't
stop imagining these crazy things,

612
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,041
I'll take you to a doctor
to have you examined.

613
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,486
But I saw them. And when
I see what I see, I saw it.

614
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:56,788
Mr. Talbot, he saw it too. Talbot!
He's crazy. You're both crazy!

615
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,760
Sandra.

616
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,855
Sandra, I've gotta tell you. I
was downstairs in the basement.

617
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:05,493
Basement? What were you doing
down there? I opened the door.

618
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,333
He opened the door and fell
down the stairs. Fibber.

619
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:12,432
How careless.!
You should be careful.!

620
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,946
A person can get killed! I
hope you weren't disturbed.

621
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,380
It's perfectly all right.
Introduce me.

622
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,781
This is Miss Raymond.
Mr. Young.

623
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,877
And this is Wilbur.

624
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,821
Ahh, Wilbur!

625
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,790
Why!

626
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:33,626
I've heard so much about you, I
feel as if we have already met.

627
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:39,158
I must say, my dear, I approve
very highly of your choice.

628
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,967
What we need today
is young blood.

629
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,008
And brains!

630
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,280
Oh, don't be bashful.
Come.

631
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:56,786
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been
looking for you all day.

632
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,822
Every time I ask Dr. Mornay what that
equipment is going to be used for,

633
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,155
she says to ask you.
Of course.

634
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,854
Didn't I hear that you
were going to masquerade ball?

635
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:09,524
Yes, we have our costumes in
the boat. Oh, you young people!

636
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,002
Making the most of life...
while it lasts.

637
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,834
Thank you.

638
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,933
Professor,
you worked hard and well.

639
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,571
Why don't you join them, and save
your questions until tomorrow?

640
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:28,641
Under ordinary circumstances I'd
say no, but... if you don't mind?

641
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,380
Not at all. Good. I'll get my coat.

642
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,882
Of course that would make
too many for one boat.

643
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,225
But if the professor and this
lady and gentleman go on ahead,

644
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,323
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay
can... I'm afraid I can't.

645
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,927
What's the matter? I've suddenly
developed a splitting headache.

646
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:50,029
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but
you'll have to go without me.

647
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,598
Nonsense! It will pass
as quickly as it came.

648
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:56,339
It's no use, Doctor. I shall
have to go directly to bed.

649
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:02,277
Pardon me. Well, Chick,
there goes your date.

650
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,814
What was that all about?

651
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,690
This is too dangerous. The girl
is an insurance investigator.

652
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,990
Stevens is asking
too many questions.

653
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,624
Wilbur was up to something in
the basement. We ought to wait.

654
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,069
And jeopardize the success
of the operation? Never!

655
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:26,235
I must warn you, my dear Sandra, I am
accustomed to having my orders obeyed,

656
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,268
especially by women
with a price on their heads.

657
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,339
Don't try to scare me,
Count Dracula.

658
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,993
Here. The Secrets of Life
and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.

659
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,890
Memorize them. Operate yourself,
if you're in such a hurry.

660
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:56,200
I have other ways
of securing your cooperation.

661
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:59,401
You're wasting your time. My
will is as strong as yours.

662
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,967
Are you sure?

663
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,044
Look into my eyes.

664
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,352
Look!

665
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,062
Deeper.

666
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,105
Tell me what you see.

667
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:48,849
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the
lockers and change into our costumes.

668
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:51,189
Come on, Professor. We'll
meet you on the dance floor.

669
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,752
Okay.

670
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,357
What did I do?
What do you mean?

671
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,368
He's dancing with my girl! So what?

672
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,894
I'll show her!
I'm in love

673
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,739
Aw, come on. Pick up those
bundles! Let's get dressed.

674
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,712
So, it's you!
He knows me!

675
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,306
McDougal! Listen, fat
boy, where are my exhibits?

676
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,944
Leave him alone! Not until he
tells me where those exhibits are.

677
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,989
Where are they?
Where are they?

678
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,286
Aha! McDougal,
now we've got it on you.

679
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,157
You put us in jail. Now we'll have
you arrested for assault and battery.

680
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,219
See what good it'll do ya.
You haven't got a witness.

681
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,322
I'm a witness! My word's as good as yours!

682
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,129
Your word is better than
his. Keep outta this.

683
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:35,069
I'll get a witness.
Do me a favor.

684
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,265
Will you watch this?
I need a witness.

685
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,537
Go ahead. I'd like to see you do it again.

686
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,272
Did you see it?

687
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,440
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see a thing.

688
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,547
Thank you.

689
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,248
Have you seen Chick Young
or Wilbur Gray?

690
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:56,292
Seen them?
I don't even know them.

691
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:00,352
I've got to know
what they found on that island.

692
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,524
Chick! Wilbur! What did
you find? Was I right?

693
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,366
No! And I wish you'd stop trying to
put those ideas in this boy's head.

694
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,962
He's not used to them.
Go put your things on.

695
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,974
Did you meet Dr. Lejos? Yes.

696
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:16,308
What did he look like? Tall,
aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?

697
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:19,871
All I know is he told us to go out
and have some fun. Why don't you?

698
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,385
Can't I convince you that Dracula
is a very dangerous person?

699
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:28,322
You and Wilbur are just trying
to scare me. Well, it won't work!

700
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,954
I scared ya.

701
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,224
I scared ya, you big
sissy. This is your mask.

702
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,997
No, no, no. Please don't
wear that. What's the matter?

703
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,539
I know you'll think
I'm crazy, but...

704
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:47,337
in a half an hour the moon will
rise and I'll turn into a wolf.

705
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,311
You and 20 million other guys. Listen!

706
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,679
I might tear you limb
from limb! Is that serious?

707
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,446
He'll murder ya.!
That's serious.

708
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,785
It won't be if you'll just
take me and lock me in my room.

709
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,519
Please.
Oh, all right.

710
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,118
Why don't you hire yourself
a keeper?

711
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,892
Come on.

712
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,534
Hey!

713
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,871
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.

714
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:26,009
Is it all clear?
I will take care of the girl.

715
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,676
And you'll take Wilbur back
to the castle.

716
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:32,085
Understand?
Yes, master.

717
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,958
Sandra, you look...

718
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:41,087
So... we meet again,
Count Dracula.

719
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,928
Dracula? Yes. That's who he says you are.

720
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,767
Oh, my costume perhaps. No, Talbot
thinks you're the real thing.

721
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,772
Out of McDougal's
House of Horrors.

722
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,673
What an odd
hallucination.

723
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,907
But the human mind is often
inflamed with strange complexes.

724
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,917
I suggest you consult
your physician, Mr. Talbot.

725
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,249
And take him along with you,
please.

726
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,652
So there you are!

727
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,886
I'm glad to see
you've recovered.

728
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,360
I didn't expect to see you here,
Doctor. Sandra insisted I come.

729
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,867
I need a little relaxation. Miss
Raymond, would you honor me with a dance?

730
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,334
No. No!

731
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,372
I warn you.
He is Count Dracula!

732
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,465
How interesting.
Tell me more.

733
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,136
Let me tell you...
while we dance.

734
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,304
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.

735
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,947
Sandra, do you feel
all right?

736
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,817
Of course. But I must
obey my doctor's orders.

737
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,687
Oh, sure! You gotta do
what the doctor tells ya.

738
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:45,956
I intend to.
Let's have a walk, Wilbur.

739
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,724
Toodle-oo.

740
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,233
Professor,
do you understand women?

741
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,361
I don't even try.
I'm gonna get me a drink.

742
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,150
Sit here.

743
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,987
Sandra, there's something strange
about ya. You're not yourself.

744
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,156
Is there anything I can do to help? Yes.

745
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,599
I want you to go away
with me to the island.

746
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,898
Just me and you?
Yes.

747
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,930
I want to be the only one in your
life. I want to be part of you.

748
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,445
I want to be in your blood.

749
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,779
I think I know
what you mean.

750
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:49,086
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow
than me? No. I want no one but you.

751
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:53,185
You are so full-blooded,
so round, so firm.

752
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:57,427
So fully packed. And I
want to stay that way.

753
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,867
Aah!
Stuck myself.

754
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,565
I'm bleedin'.
Let me see it.

755
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,543
Uh-uh. There ain't enough for the two
of us... if that's what you're thinking.

756
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,580
I'll tell you what I'm
thinking. Look into my eyes.

757
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:15,607
I'm afraid to. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

758
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:18,779
Look. Deeper.

759
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,823
Deeper!

760
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,821
Deeper.

761
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:41,741
I looked deep enough.
I don't wanna look anymore.

762
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,006
Of course you do.

763
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,345
Don't you know what's going
to happen now? I'll bite.

764
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,977
Oh, no... I will!

765
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,182
Wilbur.! Wilbur.!
Joan.!

766
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:58,125
Joan? There he is.
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?

767
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,662
No, but I have definitely
made up my mind.

768
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,164
You can have Sandra, but make
sure you've got plenty of bandages.

769
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,700
Maybe Dracula lured Joan
into the woods.

770
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,760
Chick, do you know what could happen
if I meet Dracula in the woods?

771
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,534
I'll bite. Oh, no. You gotta stand in line.

772
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,702
Let's not waste any time. Yeah, let's.

773
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,213
Joan? Joan?

774
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,918
Joan!
Chick, we can't find her.

775
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,080
Let's keep on looking. Come on. Joan!

776
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,952
Joan?

777
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,863
Aw, Chick, we're
never gonna find her.

778
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,094
Joan!

779
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,837
Joan?

780
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,246
Joan?

781
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,725
Joan?

782
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,092
Joan.!

783
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,537
Joan.!

784
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:26,245
Chick? Chick?

785
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,216
Where did he go?
Chick!

786
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,220
I'm gettin' tired
of lookin' forJoan.

787
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,682
Look at him.

788
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,819
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you
not to put that mask on?

789
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,922
What'd you
put it on for?

790
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,797
Take the mask off!
Come on!

791
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,444
Joan?

792
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:06,652
Chick, what are you lookin' in there
for? You're not gonna find Joan in there.

793
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,659
Now, come on, get up! Get
up! We gotta find Joan.

794
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:16,354
Come on, Chick.
Now, take that mask off!

795
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,423
Take it easy.
I'm your friend!

796
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,174
Help.! Help.!

797
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,411
Help.!

798
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,118
The man's been hurt. Looks
like something attacked him.

799
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:45,217
Get a doctor.

800
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:51,326
You'll be all right, though another half
inch would have severed your jugular vein.

801
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,197
Get him up.

802
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,761
Who did it? It was
somebody in a wolf's mask.

803
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,967
McDougal,
what happened to you?

804
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:05,776
You! It was you! He said
he was gonna get me. Me?

805
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:08,146
That's right. I saw him arguing
with you earlier this evening.

806
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:11,243
That's ridiculous.
I wouldn't...

807
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,551
People, real live people.
That's a boy. Tell 'em.

808
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,593
Chick, what's the idea of
trying to take a bite out of me?

809
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,493
What's the idea? What, did
he take a bite out of you too?

810
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,497
What's the matter? You gone mad? Wilbur!

811
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,590
Don't let that little fellow
fool you. He's an accomplice.

812
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,101
Me?
Let's call the sheriff.

813
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,574
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!

814
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,947
Chick!

815
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,715
Joan, Joan, come on.
We gotta get outta here.

816
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,518
Joan?

817
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:25,027
Joan? Don't tell me
you've gone bats too.

818
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,757
Wilbur.! Wilbur.!
Wilbur.!

819
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,595
Chick! Chick!

820
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,392
Chick, Chick.

821
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:38,194
Quiet. They're after
me. After you? What for?

822
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,134
McDougal was almost killed
last night by either a wolf...

823
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,967
or a man wearing a mask
of a wolf!

824
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,974
It was a wolf.

825
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:49,705
I'm going to give myself up.
It's the only way to clear you.

826
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,408
Then... you were on the level
about that wolf business?

827
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:57,384
Yes. I'm going to
surrender. You can't do that!

828
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:01,480
Dracula's taken Wilbur and Joan
to the island. Are you sure?

829
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,617
I saw what I saw
when I saw it!

830
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,692
Hurry! Follow me!

831
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:32,311
They may come back.
But Dracula?

832
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:35,755
Dracula is helpless until after
nightfall. Maybe by then we'll...

833
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,921
Okay. But after what I saw
there'd better not be any maybe.

834
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,900
Sandra. Sandra?

835
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,663
Sandra.!

836
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:54,238
Junior?

837
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,113
Junior.

838
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,615
Will you help me
get outta here?

839
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:12,393
Sandra!
Junior.

840
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:39,813
Shall we begin?
I've been waiting, master.

841
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,915
Sandra? Sandra?

842
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:57,800
He's growing weaker! Will
he respond to the operation?

843
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,536
If the generators are kept
going. We must start immediately.

844
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,341
I'll get rid of Stevens,
and you'll take care of him.

845
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,217
Sandra, what are you
gonna do?

846
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:14,086
Don't worry. I'm not going
to hurt you. Thank you.

847
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:16,624
Soon, instead of being
short and chubby,

848
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:21,391
you'll be big and tall
and as strong as an ox.

849
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:28,035
And furthermore, you'll live
forever and never grow old.

850
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,265
Oh, Sandra,

851
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:33,502
you still love me.

852
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:38,343
But, Sandra, how are you gonna do all
these things? By a simple operation.

853
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:43,647
I shall remove your brain
and put it in his body.

854
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,950
You're gonna take my brain and
put it in Junior's body? Yes.

855
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:50,514
Ha-ha! For a minute, I didn't
know how you were gonna do it!

856
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,857
Agh!

857
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,199
Good evening, Professor.

858
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:09,108
Is everything under control?
Everything but my temper.

859
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,840
I found Miss Raymond
in Dr. Mornay's room.

860
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:15,543
You should mind
your own business, Professor.

861
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,985
I also found this, which
is very much my business.

862
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:22,148
And after I've taken Joan
back to town, I'm...

863
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,156
Hmm. Excellent.

864
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:31,393
Let's take him to the cellar. We can
dispose of all the bodies at the same time.

865
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:45,545
Well, there's the boat.
Let's look around.

866
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,047
Hey, that must be
the entrance to the castle.

867
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,612
Come on.

868
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,721
Come.

869
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,698
Lie down... here.

870
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,136
Yes... master.

871
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,502
Frankie, don't let 'em
do it to ya.

872
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,104
Frankie boy.
Listen to me, Frankie.

873
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:56,015
Don't let 'em
do it to ya!

874
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,613
Frankie. Frankie! I'm
tellin' ya, it's a bad deal.

875
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:04,716
I've had this brain for 30 years
and it hasn't worked right yet.

876
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,284
Ask me how much one and one
is, Frankie. Go ahead, ask me.

877
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,126
I don't know.

878
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,632
We'll be right back, Wilbur.

879
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,136
Okay, I'll wait.

880
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,186
Chick! Dracula is Dracula! Wilbur!

881
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:43,493
Sandra's gonna use my brain to make
a bigger dummy out of the other dummy.

882
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:47,160
I'll get you out of this.
No kiddin'! Hurry up.

883
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,399
All right.
Atta boy.

884
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,134
Does it hurt? No, no. Go
ahead, a little harder.

885
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,375
What's the matter? All right,
I'm doing the best I can!

886
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:05,148
Wait a minute.
Oh, pardon me, I'm sorry.

887
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,521
There you are. Now, get
outta here. Go ahead.

888
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:16,155
Hey, not that way.
To the left!

889
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,198
Get him out.
Get him out!

890
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:28,437
No door. No door? Come on, get outta here!

891
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,313
Take it easy,
you'll be all right.

892
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,150
We gotta get back to the
castle. Joan's in there. Come on.

893
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:42,918
Come on, Wilbur. Not me.
I'm not goin' back in there.

894
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,186
I've got too much
of what they want: brains.

895
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,455
Get the motor started in
the boat. Hurry up. Okay.

896
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,197
They've escaped!

897
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:02,107
You attend to the monster. I
can handle our fat friend. Come.

898
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,710
Wilbur.

899
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,085
Come back.

900
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,897
Come.

901
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,836
I said... come back!

902
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,677
Come!

903
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,138
Wilbur! We're all set.
You got the boat...

904
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,877
Wilbur!
He's not here!

905
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,511
Now where'd he go?

906
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,384
Look!

907
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,158
They started the operation.

908
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,786
They must've found him.
We've gotta go back.

909
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:29,797
You stay here with Joan.

910
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,959
Please...
give me a little ether.

911
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,091
We don't need it.
You won't feel a thing.

912
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,093
Oh, boy,
am I glad to see you!

913
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,120
Get me off here.

914
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,399
What are you lookin'out the window
for? Somebody else comin'after me?

915
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,697
Hmm?

916
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,730
Hey!

917
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,441
Chick, help! Please!

918
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,877
Chick.!

919
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:50,099
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!

920
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,299
Aah, Chick.!

921
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,207
Chick!
Aah!

922
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,843
Back.

923
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,477
Back!

924
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,486
Chick!
Come on!

925
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:12,686
Chick, do you believe me now? Yes.

926
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,627
Hurry up.

927
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,772
Let's barricade the door.
Get it over there.

928
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,782
Okay, come on.

929
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,715
There.

930
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,481
Put your shoulder to
the door. Hold it tight.

931
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:43,820
We barricaded it.
He can't get in here!

932
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:50,097
Come on, Wilbur!

933
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,735
Come on!

934
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,717
Help!

935
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,564
Back.

936
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,769
Back.

937
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,871
Back.
Yes... master.

938
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,473
He thinks I'm Dracula.

939
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,375
Whew!
Well, we got him!

940
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,703
Joan! Joan!

941
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,976
Are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

942
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:20,841
I gotcha. You're just the one we're
lookin' for. Still want your exhibits?

943
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,908
Of course I do. Here comes one of'em now!

944
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,515
Aah!

945
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,959
Chick!
Come on, Wilbur!

946
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:48,103
Fill that bucket
with gas.

947
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,071
Untie the boat.

948
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:58,752
Untie the boat!

949
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,822
Untie the boat,
will ya?

950
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,230
Untie the boat,
will ya please?

951
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:18,129
Okay!

952
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:56,004
He won't chase us anymore.
And another thing.

953
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,443
The next time I tell you that
I saw something when I saw it,

954
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:02,210
you believe me that I saw it! Oh, relax.

955
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:05,412
Now that we've seen the last of
Dracula, the Wolfman and the Monster,

956
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,455
there's nobody
to frighten us anymore.

957
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:10,423
That's too bad. I was hoping
to get in on the excitement.

958
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:14,826
Who said that? Allow me to introduce
myself. I'm the Invisible Man.
