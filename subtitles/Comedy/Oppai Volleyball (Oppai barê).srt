1
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:53,014
This won't work.

2
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:54,721
It won't?

3
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:59,159
We have to exceed 80km/h
for the boob touch sensation.

4
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:00,921
No way!

5
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,596
That's impossible.

6
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,033
No, it can be done...

7
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,214
Sure we're OK?

8
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,780
Yeah.

9
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,223
Are you ready?

10
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:56,380
Now!

11
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:07,864
Boob touch sensation!

12
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,592
It's great!

13
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:16,895
Oh-oh...

14
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,645
DANGER

15
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,821
I love boobs!

16
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:46,536
Oppai Volleyball

17
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:57,571
...drawing nourishment from its roots,

18
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:00,074
striving upward to the light...

19
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:02,912
60km/h is an 'A' cup.

20
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:06,181
80km/h is a 'B' cup.

21
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:08,120
And...

22
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,853
100km/h is a 'C' cup!

23
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,657
100km/h?

24
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:21,538
Next we'll try it on
Mt Takato's "Hell Hill."

25
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:23,772
You'll die!

26
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,605
...the new teacher at
our Junior High School.

27
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:32,148
Miss Mikako Terashima,
a few words, please.

28
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,858
Good morning.

29
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,000
As the Vice Principal said, I'm the
literature teacher, Mikako Terashima.

30
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:57,972
Nice to meet you.

31
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:05,640
I dropped by the library
as soon as I arrived here.

32
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:10,985
I was glad to see it's so nice,
with a lot of books.

33
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:16,650
I noticed a certain book,
and automatically picked it up.

34
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:22,499
It's by Kotaro Takamura,
and one of my favorite books,

35
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,727
"DOTEI (The Journey)."

36
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:28,134
"DOTEI (Virgin Boys)"?!

37
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:34,875
He write, "In front of me no road
Behind me a road is made."

38
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:42,178
The teacher I respected most in
junior high told me about this book.

39
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,381
Since then, I've always
loved "DOTEI (The Journey)."

40
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,885
She loves "DOTEI (Virgin Boys)"!

41
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,693
A junior high teacher
loves "Virgin Boys"!

42
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:57,022
Please enjoy "The Journey,"

43
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,097
it will make you tremble.

44
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,634
She trembles from "Virgin Boys"?!

45
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:03,899
Try it!

46
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:14,250
I always keep "The Journey"
at my bedside...

47
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:28,130
Hey! You guys keep it down!

48
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:30,097
Control yourselves! Hey!

49
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,370
And finally, I want to say...

50
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,837
Sorry that I caused...

51
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,641
It's all their fault.

52
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:47,979
But don't stimulate them
so much next time.

53
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:50,448
I'm very sorry.

54
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:54,313
Oh yeah, Miss Terashima...

55
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:55,716
Yes?

56
00:06:56,226 --> 00:07:01,186
The Boys Volleyball Club needs
an advisor, can you do it?

57
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,294
Club advisor?

58
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,102
Sure, I'll do my best.

59
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,505
Thank you.

60
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,019
See that adult program?

61
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,826
No, my parents jumped up
and turned it off.

62
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,005
Last night's title was 'Boob Festival.'

63
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,335
I only saw the title listed.

64
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,503
'Boob Festival'?

65
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,782
Wish I'd seen it.

66
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:07,159
Who's first?
Rock, scissors, paper.

67
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:13,391
Big news!

68
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,539
- You scared us!
- Bad timing!

69
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:22,111
Miss "Virgin Boys"
will be our advisor!

70
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:23,736
Really?!

71
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:35,251
Rie, you grew up with Hirata?

72
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:40,194
Don't mention that,
he's the worst thing in my life.

73
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:44,693
We weren't actually friends,
our parents were friends.

74
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:47,827
He said you took a bath together.

75
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,906
In kindergarten!

76
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,243
I wish he'd just die!

77
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,010
Do you have volleyball experience?

78
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:07,522
Yes, as a student in gym class.

79
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,957
It's OK, I'll just advise, not play.

80
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:16,294
But I'll persevere
at their practice.

81
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,632
Well, I've never seen them
actually practice.

82
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:24,535
And 'persevere' means
nothing to them.

83
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,503
A teacher shouldn't say that!

84
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:31,172
We should teach perseverance.

85
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:33,746
Sorry...

86
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,823
Why do you follow me?

87
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:44,019
I'm not, it's my way home.

88
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:48,626
How about having dinner?
I know a good place.

89
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,798
By the way...

90
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,298
Want to ask me something?

91
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:55,794
No, I just...

92
00:09:55,906 --> 00:10:01,503
It's just that we both teach
at the same school...

93
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,846
You have a boyfriend?

94
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,107
I have to go.

95
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,099
Liar.

96
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:30,227
Boys Volleyball Club

97
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,274
Welcome, Miss Terashima!

98
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:44,275
Thanks.

99
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,378
What are you doing?

100
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:50,942
We're having a
welcome party for you.

101
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:54,090
This is your seat!

102
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:59,755
I'm grateful for the party,
but what about practice?

103
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,025
Practice?!

104
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,097
We have to?

105
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,366
Of course!

106
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:11,271
Now get changed!
Hurry, get changed!

107
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,105
1, 2, 3, 4,

108
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,308
5, 6, 7, 8.

109
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,056
You guys go ahead.

110
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,719
No way!
You stay up front.

111
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:47,872
Is everyone warmed up?

112
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:49,673
Shall we piggyback you?

113
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,146
- I'm not ready.
- Ethnic dance?

114
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,217
The 'Oklahoma Mixer.'

115
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:58,751
Alright!
Today you'll play the girls.

116
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,489
Go easy on them.

117
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,087
We can't play them!

118
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,158
Why not?

119
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,497
There are only five of us.

120
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:13,836
See, it's impossible.

121
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,428
Crap! We wanted a match!

122
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,769
Too bad!

123
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,837
If only we had one more!

124
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:29,748
I'm Yoshiki Jo, two grades below.
I want to join.

125
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:34,653
I can't join?
I've played since primary school.

126
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,590
You're experienced?!

127
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,496
Good, now you can have a match!

128
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:44,863
A match? Can I join in?

129
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:49,872
Great!

130
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,599
Let's play!

131
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:55,233
Rie, I'll go easy.

132
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:56,676
No first names!

133
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:01,475
Caught peeping in tennis again?
Bunch of losers!

134
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,085
It can't be...

135
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,056
Way to go!

136
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,855
- Lunch to go!
- Curry to go!

137
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:14,792
You're the volleyball club?!

138
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,356
Sort of...

139
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,301
Can't do 'A quick' shots?

140
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:20,527
What's that?

141
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:22,537
You mean 'A cup'?

142
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,768
Good one!

143
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,933
'A quick'!

144
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,942
I'm quitting!

145
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,435
Jo, wait!

146
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,042
Back to practice!
Spread out, receive!

147
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,675
OK, let's begin!

148
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:39,311
How dare 'Follyball Club' play us!

149
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:40,889
Definitely!

150
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,555
'Follyball... '?

151
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:51,828
Miss, you're late.

152
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:53,459
Let's party!

153
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,368
Well, well, please come in!

154
00:14:57,874 --> 00:14:59,774
You won't go after Jo?

155
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,845
First of all, Miss,

156
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:06,441
let's play...
Twister.

157
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,812
What about volleyball?

158
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:13,513
We've never played.

159
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:19,150
We haven't been able to play
since we joined.

160
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:28,594
There was a scary school
senior called Nakai.

161
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:35,442
He tormented us until
he graduated.

162
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:41,709
To 'relieve tension' at matches,

163
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,914
we had to dance in our underwear.

164
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,991
[And to 'improve teamwork,']

165
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:53,786
We had to draw boob pictures.

166
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,629
So we're called 'Follyball Club.'

167
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:03,934
We can't use the gym,
the girls have the front court.

168
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:09,271
We forgot about volleyball
and just have fun.

169
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,738
You don't mind being made fun of?

170
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,341
Not really.

171
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:19,677
You don't want to win matches?

172
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:22,053
We can't win a match.

173
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,155
You make no effort, but say that?!

174
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,424
You were at assembly.

175
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:32,567
"In front of me no road
Behind me a road is made."

176
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:34,568
"Virgin Boys."

177
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:39,338
If you try hard,
I'll do anything for you.

178
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,238
Anything?

179
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,169
In that case...

180
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:49,709
Good idea.

181
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,717
Perfect!

182
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,310
Smart move.

183
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:55,855
Alright.

184
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,360
If we try hard,
you'll do anything for us?

185
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,594
Yes. What'll I do?

186
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:05,361
If we win a match
at the next tournament...

187
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,693
If you win?

188
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:09,635
You will show us your boobs.

189
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,868
Please!

190
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:23,614
No, I could never do
something like that.

191
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,887
Of course...
Teachers are like that.

192
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:34,354
What do you mean?

193
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:40,560
You said you'll do anything,
but you don't mean it.

194
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:42,929
You're a liar.

195
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:46,772
I'm not a liar!

196
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:49,805
I don't tell lies!

197
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,810
You'll show your boobs...

198
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,319
We did it!

199
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,158
You have to!
You promised!

200
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:08,562
Show your boobs?!

201
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:09,822
Keep it down!

202
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,167
Why'd you promise them that?

203
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:17,368
I don't know,
it just happened somehow.

204
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,470
You don't mind?

205
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,844
Of course I mind,
I hate it!

206
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,847
What a stupid thing to ask!

207
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,377
What are you looking at?!

208
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:32,810
Sorry.

209
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:43,327
It doesn't matter anyway,
they'll never win.

210
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,333
OK if they lose?

211
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:50,963
Of course not,
I'm their club advisor!

212
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:52,132
Sorry.

213
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,334
So what'll you do?

214
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,272
I don't know.

215
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,015
Don't know?

216
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,550
But isn't that a worry?

217
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:08,215
If rumors of that promise spread
around school, it'll be a big deal.

218
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,654
A teacher shouldn't have said that.

219
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:16,628
Don't talk like that,
I know it was a mistake!

220
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:18,825
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,594
Why am I sorry?!

222
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,539
Of course they should
try hard with no promise.

223
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:31,171
Right, those guys had no right
to ask for that.

224
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,510
Tomorrow I'll tell them
the promise is off.

225
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:50,330
Volleyball can be played like that?!

226
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:54,592
We'll never win playing like that.

227
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:58,470
We'll never win playing any way.

228
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,511
After Mikako promised
she'd show us her boobs...

229
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:08,077
How about drugging their lunches?

230
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,311
- That's a crime!
- True.

231
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,412
Maybe a love letter?

232
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:14,148
How?

233
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:18,490
Send our opponents a "meet me"
letter on match day,

234
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:23,055
so they'll skip the game
to meet that girl.

235
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:23,995
That's it!

236
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,431
Idiots!

237
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:27,631
Don't miss it!

238
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:28,965
Sorry!

239
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,242
Are you playing to the death?!

240
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:41,446
All of you run until you drop!

241
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,483
Show some spirit!

242
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,952
They're not like us.

243
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:56,759
To begin,
let's ruin their practice.

244
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:01,431
So many balls!

245
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:04,129
We've only got three.

246
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,834
Somebody's coming...

247
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,772
Hide!

248
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:40,905
What are they doing?

249
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,443
Rhythmic gymnastics?

250
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:47,109
I haven't seen leotards before...

251
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:49,683
Who are you?!

252
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:51,910
From which school?

253
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:55,981
Sorry, I've done nothing.

254
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,825
Miss Terashima...

255
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:03,899
Yes?

256
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,362
Phone call.

257
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:16,768
Hello, this is Terashima.

258
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:26,180
I'm sorry... alright.

259
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,283
How shameful!
What were you doing?

260
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:35,160
We wanted to see the top team,
Ryuo Junior High.

261
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,664
Then why were you peeping?!

262
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:43,137
Well, when you see girls
wearing leotards...

263
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:44,864
Sorry.

264
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:52,837
You tried to puncture their balls,
isn't that shameful?!

265
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:55,683
Otherwise we can't win.

266
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,617
That makes it OK to cheat?

267
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:09,026
You don't try,
you don't work out,

268
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:12,659
you don't desperately
try to see my boobs?!

269
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:15,602
Isn't that insulting to me?

270
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:18,230
You won't get to see easily!

271
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:24,904
Wait...

272
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:27,808
That's not what I mean...

273
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:31,246
What I want to say is...

274
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,812
First, about that promise...

275
00:23:34,924 --> 00:23:35,948
Miss...

276
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,718
We're sorry.

277
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:44,059
What you're saying is true.
It's not fair.

278
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:48,461
You agreed to the promise,
we're sorry.

279
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:49,830
We're sorry!

280
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,634
I didn't agree...

281
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,469
Just like you said now,
we'll work really hard,

282
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:58,877
and win a match in the tournament
to see your boobs.

283
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:00,271
Right?

284
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,418
Let's do it! See her boobs!

285
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,994
Miss Terashima,
can't you stop them?

286
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,351
Let's get one more.

287
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:38,511
Move over!
The tournament's soon.

288
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:42,057
- For us, too.
- You'll lose anyway.

289
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:45,650
- We'll win.
- There's only five of you!

290
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:50,598
We want to have the court
like we used to.

291
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:57,363
I don't know what you told them,
but it's impossible for them to win.

292
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:05,947
It's not impossible.

293
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:10,409
They've started to train hard.

294
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:29,097
VOLLEYBALL
Make a Winning Team

295
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:33,429
First, get to know the ball.

296
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:37,198
Return from your forehead.

297
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:45,505
Chest slide,
back arched like a shrimp.

298
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:02,329
Fight, fight, fight...

299
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,500
26.

300
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,498
27.

301
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:13,405
Keep trying.

302
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,076
28!

303
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,643
Good, that's it.

304
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,496
Come on!
Fight, fight.

305
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,971
Fight, fight...

306
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,434
Sorry, I can't go on.

307
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,773
Boobs!

308
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,579
Boobs! Boobs!

309
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,070
I wonder if Jo will rejoin?

310
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:19,603
Something may persuade him.

311
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:22,807
We can't tell him
about the boobs, right?

312
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:36,623
Wow. Did Jo win all of these?

313
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,084
No, they're mine.

314
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:44,562
I played in junior and senior high,
and in my company.

315
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:49,837
But I had to quit
three years ago due to an injury.

316
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:56,142
My son owes you a lot.
Does he practice hard?

317
00:28:58,814 --> 00:29:02,250
He didn't return from practice yet.

318
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:05,552
He trains hard.

319
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:10,591
We just dropped by to
talk to you about volleyball.

320
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:25,932
You do a great job as coach.

321
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,177
You think so?!

322
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,275
When leaping for the ball,

323
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:35,282
they land from the chest
to avoid knee injury.

324
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,812
Heading is effective.

325
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:42,486
Overhand shots made
correctly from the forehead.

326
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:45,285
Like top team practice.

327
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:49,320
Teams with that base
are the strongest.

328
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,133
Thank you!

329
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:54,395
Want my practice drills?

330
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:56,794
Of course!

331
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:07,716
Is Jo enjoying the club?

332
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:15,316
He simply followed me
around when he was little,

333
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:18,252
and had fun with the game.

334
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:22,093
I had to quit because of

because he knew I'd be pleased.

because we're lousy.

But we've really changed
with the goal of her boobs.

If Jo sees us,
he may change his mind.

Let's persuade Jo!

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,065
Impossible.

505
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:45,805
Everybody cheer up, here.

506
00:47:47,108 --> 00:47:49,338
Thank you.

507
00:47:52,814 --> 00:47:54,076
Let's go.

508
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:02,883
Listen.

509
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:07,160
I'll say this just one time.

510
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,103
Do your best...

511
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:22,600
to see my boobs.

512
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:24,571
Yes!

513
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:26,502
Ready...

514
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:29,848
Boobs! Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!

515
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,024
Please come this way.

516
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:57,077
I'm sorry to be late.

517
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:01,777
What's up?

518
00:49:01,883 --> 00:49:05,046
I was nearby on business,
and thought of you.

519
00:49:06,287 --> 00:49:07,481
I see...

520
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:08,980
Champagne?

521
00:49:09,123 --> 00:49:10,420
Please.

522
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:17,093
You were looking for this.
It was in my stuff.

523
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:19,659
You found it!

524
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:24,504
But I quit smoking.

525
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:28,299
Thank you.

526
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:31,939
You finally quit...

527
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:35,846
Yeah. It seems that
you're still teaching?

528
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:39,682
I'm glad you kept at it.

529
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:56,364
You all like
Sheena & The Rokkets?

530
00:49:56,738 --> 00:49:57,864
- Yeah.
- Great!

531
00:49:57,972 --> 00:50:00,338
- I love them.
- They'll play live soon.

532
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:02,842
I want to see them!

533
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:06,307
Let's go see them together.

534
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:08,175
Great!

535
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,479
Going to a rock concert
just before exams...

536
00:50:12,587 --> 00:50:17,320
wasn't your suggestion,
was it, Miss Terashima?

537
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,220
It couldn't have been.

538
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:23,020
Well...

539
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:31,031
It wasn't my idea.

540
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:39,110
Good morning.

541
00:50:53,728 --> 00:50:55,059
Liar.

542
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:12,607
You must have been surprised
that I didn't want to go to school.

543
00:51:12,713 --> 00:51:18,083
No, I'm just sorry that
I didn't listen more thoughtfully.

544
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,414
It's OK.

545
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:26,251
Are you working hard?

546
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,353
More or less.
I have to, for the new staff.

547
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:37,771
We stopped dating,

548
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:41,633
but still like each other, right?

549
00:51:46,747 --> 00:51:47,839
Actually,

550
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:52,444
I wondered if we could try again.

551
00:51:56,858 --> 00:51:58,553
I came to ask that.

552
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:11,297
Right, you bought all that
ice cream the day before!

553
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:16,570
It was melting from the power failure,
we tried to eat it all!

554
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:18,201
I ate three of them!

555
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,143
Oh yeah, I found a photo.

556
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:23,342
Which photo?

557
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:26,145
A really funny one.

558
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:27,848
Which one?!

559
00:52:27,955 --> 00:52:30,287
Well, maybe I shouldn't...

560
00:52:30,391 --> 00:52:32,825
Which one? Show me!

561
00:52:33,728 --> 00:52:35,559
Not this one!

562
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,154
Throw it away.

563
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:38,755
No, it's mine!

564
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:41,232
- Give it to me!
- No way.

565
00:53:50,037 --> 00:53:56,101
Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!

566
00:53:59,814 --> 00:54:00,576
Stop!

567
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:05,943
They're not...

568
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:09,246
These boobs are not just mine!

569
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:15,087
They're everyone's dream!

570
00:54:20,034 --> 00:54:21,058
Sorry.

571
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:25,663
I'll go now.

572
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:29,869
I'm sorry.

573
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:43,287
What am I doing?!

574
00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:51,427
You're hot, hot lady!

575
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:55,363
You're hot, Mikako!

576
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:03,442
Nakai!

577
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:07,004
You guys are having fun.

578
00:55:22,196 --> 00:55:24,357
That's why you fought me?

579
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:27,056
Yes.

580
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:38,342
Don't worry, I won't tell.

581
00:55:44,352 --> 00:55:45,876
Boobs?

582
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:50,347
Good teacher.

583
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:54,920
Right!

584
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:04,970
You guys!
If you lose now, you're wimps!

585
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:06,632
Right!

586
00:56:11,545 --> 00:56:13,069
Thank you!

587
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:22,649
Just as I suspected...

588
00:56:23,657 --> 00:56:26,592
We're going to win!

589
00:56:37,938 --> 00:56:39,405
Good afternoon!

590
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:43,437
Please change here.

591
00:56:45,713 --> 00:56:48,739
Really use this
intensive training camp.

592
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:50,208
Yes!

593
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:53,618
Start with stretching.

594
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:56,622
Right, we'll do our best!

595
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:57,587
Get started.

596
00:56:57,691 --> 00:57:00,285
Let's go and stretch!

597
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,389
Thanks so much for helping.

598
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:07,694
It's a pleasure to do it.

599
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:10,236
1, 2, 3, 4,

600
00:57:10,438 --> 00:57:12,804
5, 6, 7, 8.

601
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:14,235
Other leg.

602
00:57:14,408 --> 00:57:16,672
You're really working hard.

603
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:18,438
Of course!

604
00:57:21,682 --> 00:57:26,278
Well? Don't you want to win
even without that boobs promise?

605
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:27,486
Not a bit.

606
00:57:27,588 --> 00:57:28,646
Of course not.

607
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:30,951
It's for your boobs.

608
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:33,321
I see...

609
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:37,993
Good pass, way to go,
nice receive.

610
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:41,968
Good, rotate.

611
00:57:44,104 --> 00:57:45,071
Next!

612
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:52,270
Good, next!

613
00:58:32,453 --> 00:58:36,685
Sleeping.
They must be worn out.

614
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:38,185
Thank you.

615
00:58:41,562 --> 00:58:44,395
Is that the training schedule?

616
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:04,741
It's just... you know...

617
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:12,083
It brings back memories of
overnight school stays.

618
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:21,797
Really? I didn't join any clubs
in junior high, so don't know.

619
00:59:21,902 --> 00:59:24,234
Staff Room

620
00:59:32,846 --> 00:59:34,279
Everything OK?

621
00:59:34,381 --> 00:59:35,780
No problem.

622
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:40,609
What?! You shoplifted?

623
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:44,890
I was a too-average kid.

624
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:49,589
I wasn't particularly good at
studying or sports.

625
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:53,895
A school friend asked me to do it.

626
00:59:54,735 --> 01:00:00,298
I didn't want to, but if I said no
I'd seem too straight.

627
01:00:01,008 --> 01:00:04,102
I only did it once, but...

628
01:00:05,479 --> 01:00:06,639
got expelled.

629
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:13,916
But it just meant
self-study at school for a week.

630
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:19,450
The teacher in charge of me
was Mr. Harada.

631
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:26,459
This seems to have been
forgotten by a student.

632
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:32,030
But any book will do,
so read it and write a book report.

633
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:39,639
Mr. Harada didn't scold me,
lecture me, or comfort me.

634
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:44,483
[He just handed me a]
[Forgotten book for a report.]

635
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:46,280
That's all.

636
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:59,021
It seemed boring,
so I just drew doodles instead.

637
01:01:03,404 --> 01:01:08,637
But that's the only way a kid like me
could show defiance.

638
01:01:10,744 --> 01:01:13,508
Here, it's your final day.

639
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:24,484
Then I happened to see a poem
called "The Journey."

640
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:38,036
[In front of me no road]
[Behind me a road is made.]

641
01:01:49,616 --> 01:01:51,106
Terashima,

642
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:58,588
I entered your report "The Journey"
into a writing contest.

643
01:02:00,094 --> 01:02:03,188
Literary Writing Contest

644
01:02:03,297 --> 01:02:07,563
It was the first time I was
given an award,

645
01:02:08,836 --> 01:02:10,701
so I was so happy.

646
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,108
[First Prize]
[Mikako Terashima]

647
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:18,579
[First Prize]
[Mikako Terashima]
People always hold their heads high
when walking forwards,

648
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:19,780
[First Prize]
[Mikako Terashima]

649
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,514
[First Prize]
[Mikako Terashima]
Unlike my nervous glances in the
store while shoplifting.

650
01:02:20,514 --> 01:02:24,507
Unlike my nervous glances in the
store while shoplifting.

651
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:27,512
They never hang their heads.

652
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:31,186
I also want to look forwards.

653
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:34,120
I want to find my own road.

654
01:02:34,995 --> 01:02:39,455
[I'm sure that I can leave]
[My own road behind me.]

655
01:02:42,336 --> 01:02:47,296
[I think the judges chose]
[Me due to my frankness.]

656
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:51,100
I was so happy that...

657
01:02:51,779 --> 01:02:55,647
I visited City Hall daily
while it was displayed.

658
01:03:15,803 --> 01:03:18,397
Maybe you should be a teacher?

659
01:03:20,874 --> 01:03:24,332
Of Japanese literature,
you've got it in you.

660
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,712
I'd never thought about
what I would do,

661
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:36,345
but I felt as if that road
had opened before me.

662
01:03:38,258 --> 01:03:39,247
And so...

663
01:03:39,493 --> 01:03:41,893
if I truly become a teacher,

664
01:03:42,863 --> 01:03:46,355
I want to go and tell Mr. Harada.

665
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:50,369
I see...

666
01:04:03,584 --> 01:04:05,108
Then why not go now?

667
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:11,851
I can't go.

668
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:16,284
I haven't truly become...

669
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:28,701
I think you are
an excellent teacher.

670
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:34,041
I believe that.

671
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:50,991
Thank you.

672
01:05:17,024 --> 01:05:19,083
My first time to watch it.

673
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:21,420
You're still such a kid.

674
01:05:22,663 --> 01:05:24,528
Nosebleed...

675
01:05:25,132 --> 01:05:26,429

All fighting for your cast
in the best places!

682
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:03,460
Those boys have
tried hard lately.

683
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:05,468
I guess so...

684
01:06:06,373 --> 01:06:08,238
They're looking good...

685
01:06:08,342 --> 01:06:10,139
Not at all!

686
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:15,006
You know why they try so hard?
It's disgusting!

687
01:06:15,115 --> 01:06:16,446
Why?

688
01:06:23,323 --> 01:06:24,517

01:06:47,114 --> 01:06:50,106
Previous seniors all
hid things here.

691
01:06:54,087 --> 01:06:56,920
Carry on this volleyball tradition!

692
01:06:57,157 --> 01:06:58,124
Yes!

693
01:07:00,127 --> 01:07:03,426
Game time's getting closer.

694
01:07:07,134 --> 01:07:09,967
I'm glad we joined volleyball.

695
01:07:10,303 --> 01:07:12,965
It'll leave us good memories.

696
01:07:13,073 --> 01:07:16,167
This spirit will also help for exams.

697
01:07:16,276 --> 01:07:17,038
Definitely.

698
01:07:19,413 --> 01:07:22,814
I'll take over our shop
after graduating.

699
01:07:25,852 --> 01:07:27,285
No high school?

700
01:07:27,988 --> 01:07:29,012
No.

701
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:32,758
Actually, I'II...

702
01:07:33,827 --> 01:07:35,920
work at our ironworks.

703
01:07:37,998 --> 01:07:39,363
Is that so?

704
01:07:41,635 --> 01:07:45,264
It may be the last time
to do something together.

705
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:52,842
Maybe thanks to Mikako?

706
01:07:54,481 --> 01:07:56,449
A great memory to end it.

707
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:58,380
Yeah.

708
01:07:58,852 --> 01:08:03,380

Let's see Mikako's boobs!

709
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:08,787
We owe it to her to look
at her boobs.

710
01:08:11,164 --> 01:08:14,759
You'll be the only one
left next year.

711
01:08:15,068 --> 01:08:17,127
Beat Ryuo,
and members will join.

712
01:08:18,305 --> 01:08:19,431
That's true.

713
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,588
VICTORY!

714
01:09:38,985 --> 01:09:40,316
Excuse us.

715
01:09:40,453 --> 01:09:42,182
Excuse us.

716
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:45,989
What's wrong?

717
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:47,992
Don't know...

718
01:09:50,297 --> 01:09:53,460
An odd rumor is spreading,
Miss Terashima.

719
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:00,271
If the boys volleyball team
wins the regional meet,

720
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:02,730
you have...

721
01:10:04,878 --> 01:10:09,440
you promised to show them
your breasts, so they try hard.

722
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:17,481
Is that actually true?
Miss Terashima?

723
01:10:19,693 --> 01:10:20,819
Please answer.

724
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:23,590
Miss Terashima.

725
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:31,031
Actually...

726
01:10:32,138 --> 01:10:34,299
It is true, but not true.

727
01:10:35,976 --> 01:10:37,170
What does that mean?

728
01:10:37,777 --> 01:10:41,304
Us boys in the club
just made that up.

729
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:43,608
She would never agree to that.

730
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,085
That was just a joke, wasn't it?

731
01:10:47,387 --> 01:10:48,684
Right!

732
01:10:50,857 --> 01:10:52,256
Is that true?

733
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:54,156
I just said it was a joke!

734
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:55,285
Shut up!

735
01:10:55,996 --> 01:10:57,190
I asked Miss Terashima.

736
01:11:02,135 --> 01:11:03,830
Miss Terashima.

737
01:11:15,348 --> 01:11:16,508
In fact I...

738
01:11:20,487 --> 01:11:22,114
did make that promise.

739
01:11:22,489 --> 01:11:23,820
I knew it!

740
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,514
Miss?!

741
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,688
I'm sorry,
but I never want to lie again.

742
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:37,632
It's inexcusable.

743
01:11:39,973 --> 01:11:41,964
So that's what happened?

744
01:11:42,509 --> 01:11:46,104
I was so impressed by
their perseverance.

745
01:11:46,212 --> 01:11:48,305
But we were deceived.

746
01:11:48,915 --> 01:11:53,284
Their perseverance is real!
They practice every day.

747
01:11:53,386 --> 01:11:54,978
No more excuses.

748
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:57,787
It's so disappointing.

749
01:11:57,891 --> 01:12:00,018
This is a terrible problem.

750
01:12:02,629 --> 01:12:06,725
VICTORY!

751

[A FOLLYball Club]
[Is a FOLLYball Club!]

752
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:43,564
I told a friend about it.

753
01:12:44,471 --> 01:12:47,167
And then it spread like this.

754
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,711
Oh? Don't worry about it.

755
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,174
But...

756
01:13:00,053 --> 01:13:03,113
you shouldn't have promised that.

757
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:23,001
Wait! Miss Terashima!

758
01:13:25,512 --> 01:13:27,070
Were you fired?

759
01:13:28,348 --> 01:13:29,337
Yeah.

760
01:13:30,483 --> 01:13:33,213
I have to stay away from the club.

761
01:13:34,053 --> 01:13:35,748
It can't be...

762
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:42,023
Thanks for everything.
We won't be talking again.

763
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,097
Why not?

764
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:48,558

Mr. Harada,

773
01:15:02,909 --> 01:15:05,969
as I expected,
I couldn't do it.

774
01:15:08,314 --> 01:15:10,305
I made another mistake.

775
01:15:13,419 --> 01:15:16,320
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

776
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,388
I'm sorry.

777
01:15:24,531 --> 01:15:26,465
And who are you?

778
01:15:32,272 --> 01:15:33,500
His former student?

779
01:15:33,606 --> 01:15:35,403
That's right.

780
01:15:36,142 --> 01:15:39,270
But not in his class.

781
01:15:40,313 --> 01:15:41,405
I'm Terashima.

782
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:44,478
Terashima?

783
01:15:46,152 --> 01:15:50,953
I shoplifted in third year,
and Mr. Harada...

784
01:16:03,002 --> 01:16:08,634
I keep planning to organize it,
but just leave it as is.

785
01:16:10,977 --> 01:16:13,172
What did you tell my husband?

786
01:16:16,616 --> 01:16:21,053
Mr. Harada inspired me
to become a teacher,

787
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:23,846
but I keep making mistakes.

788
01:16:24,457 --> 01:16:27,187
You became a teacher?!

789
01:16:29,028 --> 01:16:30,052
Yes.

790
01:16:30,763 --> 01:16:33,129
Because of my husband?

791
01:16:34,767 --> 01:16:38,999
If he knew,
he would be so pleased.

792
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:46,075
During the time you had to do
self-study for shoplifting,

793
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,478
he'd stand in front of
that bookshelf every morning,

794
01:16:52,919 --> 01:16:57,822
and fret over which book
he would take to you that day.

795
01:17:10,336 --> 01:17:13,237
"The Journey"

796
01:17:30,957 --> 01:17:32,322
You mean...

797
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,817
it wasn't a book
someone had forgotten?!

798
01:17:58,851 --> 01:18:03,845
He wondered what book
would give you strength.

799
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:09,287
Maybe this one, or maybe not,
perhaps it's not the one.

800
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:12,021
He did that every day.

801
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,978
Sir...

802
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,737
He always wanted
students to realize that...

803
01:18:59,112 --> 01:19:03,811
the road they should follow
is right in front of them.

804
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:36,277
It would be great if
you could...

805
01:19:36,415 --> 01:19:41,853
teach your students that
their own road is in front of them.

806
01:19:53,633 --> 01:19:54,895
My...

807
01:20:02,909 --> 01:20:04,501
students.

808
01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:26,764
Don't worry.
Shout and play!

809
01:21:01,634 --> 01:21:03,397
Almost! Nice try.

810
01:21:23,756 --> 01:21:24,620
Huddle!

811
01:21:25,691 --> 01:21:26,919
Huddle!

812
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:29,126
Gather here.

813
01:21:31,664 --> 01:21:35,430
Remember what we practiced,
and use all of it.

814
01:21:35,534 --> 01:21:36,432
Let's do it!

815
01:21:36,535 --> 01:21:37,797
As in practice!

816
01:21:38,738 --> 01:21:40,603
We can take this set!

817
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,743
Get the first point.

818
01:21:54,453 --> 01:21:56,648
Get this point. Come on!

819
01:22:16,876 --> 01:22:18,810
Hey, you guys!

820
01:22:24,383 --> 01:22:25,111
Time!

821
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:35,624
Who said I'd break my promise?!

822
01:22:35,928 --> 01:22:38,021
I didn't say that!

823
01:22:39,265 --> 01:22:43,634
Even if fired from Tobata,
I'm still your teacher!

824
01:22:44,403 --> 01:22:45,370
Right!

825
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,065

826
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,636
Tell us once more!

827
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:00,148
Listening?

828
01:23:08,327 --> 01:23:11,387
Do your best to see my boobs!

829
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:12,521
Yes!

830
01:23:16,002 --> 01:23:17,697
Boobs! Do it!

831
01:23:23,976 --> 01:23:26,308
Alright! Go for it!

832
01:23:30,116 --> 01:23:32,448
Shout out!

833
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:38,147
Boo...

834
01:23:39,225 --> 01:23:40,214
Oobs!

835
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:41,917
Did it!

836
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,391

01:23:58,144 --> 01:23:59,668
They're great!

839
01:24:00,913 --> 01:24:01,971
Boobs!

840
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:06,942
Good! That's the way!

841
01:25:12,418 --> 01:25:13,680
Nice one, Ebu!

842
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:16,620
Jo!

843
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:30,359
Nice boobs!

844
01:25:46,452 --> 01:25:47,942
Nice boobs!

845
01:25:51,557 --> 01:25:53,286
See that?! See that?!

846
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:57,052
Keep it going,
take the third set!

847
01:25:58,364 --> 01:25:59,695
Idiots!

848
01:26:02,268 --> 01:26:05,499
Total member change.

849
01:26:07,306 --> 01:26:09,171
1st string.

850
01:26:16,615 --> 01:26:19,106
That was the 2nd string?!

851
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:27,386
It doesn't matter.

852
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,328
Mikako's boobs are on our side.

853
01:26:31,797 --> 01:26:35,062
Yeah, we will win!

854
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:46,336
Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!

855
01:29:54,032 --> 01:29:55,829
I'm very sorry.

856
01:29:57,002 --> 01:29:58,629
Why apologize?

857
01:30:00,439 --> 01:30:03,704
You know... that promise.

858
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:07,440
It's no big deal.

859
01:30:10,516 --> 01:30:13,041
I knew about it all along.

860
01:30:16,722 --> 01:30:19,054
The reason doesn't matter.

861
01:30:20,526 --> 01:30:24,326
They learned how
great it is to persevere.

862
01:30:24,897 --> 01:30:26,455
Isn't that enough?

863
01:30:30,169 --> 01:30:33,798
Go and be with them now.
They're waiting.

864
01:31:16,815 --> 01:31:18,009
Everyone...

865
01:31:20,486 --> 01:31:22,351
We lost.

866
01:31:29,595 --> 01:31:31,290
Damn!

867
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:40,035
Crap!

868
01:31:53,252 --> 01:31:56,915
Everyone stand, come on.

869
01:31:58,156 --> 01:31:59,180
Stand up.

870
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:02,390
You too, Jo.

871
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:06,191
Stand up.

872
01:32:12,437 --> 01:32:14,029
Chests out.

873
01:32:22,514 --> 01:32:25,142
All of you tried really hard.

874
01:32:30,155 --> 01:32:32,020
You looked great.

875
01:32:33,025 --> 01:32:34,754
That was excellent.

876
01:32:38,463 --> 01:32:39,828
Thank you.

877
01:32:43,969 --> 01:32:45,402
Thank you.

878
01:32:45,504 --> 01:32:47,972
Miss!

879
01:33:31,817 --> 01:33:33,182
Miss Terashima...

880
01:33:34,086 --> 01:33:35,110
Yes?

881
01:33:35,954 --> 01:33:37,922
What will you do now?

882
01:33:39,858 --> 01:33:42,190
I'll continue to teach.

883
01:33:42,928 --> 01:33:48,457
I got fired, but realized that
this is all I can do.

884
01:33:48,967 --> 01:33:50,935
I resolved to improve.

885
01:33:53,038 --> 01:33:54,266
Is that so?

886
01:33:55,974 --> 01:33:59,341
Tell me your new
phone number when you get it.

887
01:34:01,413 --> 01:34:02,471
Why?

888
01:34:03,148 --> 01:34:06,208
You ask me why?

889
01:34:07,486 --> 01:34:09,954
Just joking, I'll tell you.

890
01:34:10,355 --> 01:34:12,346
Thank you.

891
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:33,160
Those guys...

892
01:36:01,733 --> 01:36:03,792
Miss!

893
01:36:10,909 --> 01:36:12,968
Miss!

894
01:36:13,145 --> 01:36:14,578
Miss!

895
01:36:14,679 --> 01:36:20,276
Thank you, Miss Boobs

896
01:36:23,155 --> 01:36:25,715
Miss! Miss...

897
01:36:34,633 --> 01:36:35,964
Thank you!

898
01:36:37,169 --> 01:36:39,296
Miss, thank you!

899
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,664
Boobs are too big!

900
01:36:43,775 --> 01:36:47,302
Take care!
Become fine men!

901
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,010
Thank you.

902
01:36:58,957 --> 01:37:03,417

[Losing that game at all.]

906
01:37:27,586 --> 01:37:32,319
[Because we lost,]
[We could gather at your breasts.]

907

We had practiced that
on Ebu in case we lost,
