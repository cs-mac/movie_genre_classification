1
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,470
Upon completion of the factory,

2
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,148
we will assume dual responsibilities.

3
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,480
Quanta la fabbrica sarà ultimata,
sarebbe duplice responsabilità.

4
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,472
Er... Thee capitalization
will be shared equally.

5
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,352
They put up half, I put up half.

6
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,351
La capitalizzazione
sarà divisa in parti iguali.

7
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,314
Needless to say, I have great
personal Interest In this project

8
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,229
and I'm looking forward to
its earliest consummation.

9
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,955
Inutile dire
che Mr Talbot ha un grandissimo...

10
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,278
- Mr Talbot your call to Rome.
- Ah. Excuse me, gentlemen.

11
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,510
- Lisa
- Mmm?

12
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,269
- È lui. È qui.
- E chi è qui?

13
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,513
Talbot

14
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,353
È qui?

15
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,154
No, al Milano.

16
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,510
Speak English. I don’t want her to hear.

17
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,713
What's he doing here In July?
He never comes till September.

18
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,354
Well, I don't know, but he's here.

19
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,358
I will say to him that 
you are not in house

20
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,959
No, I’ll talk to him.

21
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,836
But Lisa, I tell you, an old love Is
like an empty bottle of champagne.

22
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,474
You don't refill it
You get new bottle.

23
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,716
He has a right to know
I'm marrying.

24
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,799
He comes once a year, stays a month.
You never see him the rest of the year.

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,797
He has no rights.

26
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,117
Send him a letter.
That’s more than most husbands get.

27
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,595
MI scusi, sa. Torno subito.

28
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,597
Lisa


30
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Se parli con queil'uomo
sei comppletamente...

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,711
English I don't want them to hear.

32
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,071
- You've wasted enough time on that man.
- Where's the phone?

33
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,510
- I put him In the dish.
- Oh

34
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,109
Don't
While's he's in there, you're safe.

35
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,471
I am safe whether he is in or out

36
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,639
I will simply tell him the truth.
He went away, I met another man.

37
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,115
He asked me to marry him,
and I accepted.

38
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,594
Davvero?

39
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,438
Va bene.

40
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,714
- Hello?
- Lisa.

41
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,071
- It's wonderful to hear your voice.
- I was going to write...

42
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,510
There’s no need to. I'm here.

43
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,551
Then I'll tell you on the phone.

44
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,399
- Robert, I...
- Ah, ah, ah. Say it again.

45
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,591
- What?
- My name.

46
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,472
- Robert
- Once more.

47
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,435
Robert

48
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,792
If you only knew how often I've thought
about you, how much I look forward to...

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,309
Please, please listen to me. I...

50
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,116
There's nothing to do rather than listen to you.
I couldn't wait until September.

51
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,996
I rearranged my entire schedule
to be here early. Just to be with you.

52
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,556
- Did you?
- Mm-hm. Did you miss me?

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,308
- Yes.
- Well, tell me.

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,797
- I've missed you.
- Oh, Lisa.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,117
Lisa, my sweet, sweet Lisa.

56
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,359
Yes, Roberto?

57
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,829
Now, listen carefully.
Whatever you’re doing, drop it

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,679
- It's not important
- It's not important

59
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,077
Pack your bags.
You can catch the one-twenty.

60
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,511
Pack my bags.
Catch the one-twenty.

61
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,679
- And meet me at the villa.
- At your villa.

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,714
- Goodbye, sweetheart
- Goodbye, sweetheart

63
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,429
I couldn't help it
L'hai visto, no?

64
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,234
English. I don't want them
to know you're a fool.

65
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,035
Anna, please.
I tried to tell him, very hard.

66
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,152
- You heard me
- What were you going to tell him?

67
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,353
That he's not the man for me. He's
always had everything his own way.

68
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,917
He's arranged his life for his comfort,
not mine. I don't intend to live like that

69
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,556
- Then why didn’t you tell him?
- And spoil everything?

70
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,470
Eleven months of the year, you're an
intelligent, good business woman, successful.

71
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,319
He comes here,
and you haven’t got a brain in your head.

72
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,512
Anna, do you know
what it means to be happy?

73
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,395
- Yes, of course.
- But I mean, really happy?

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,239
But that kind of happy
only gets you In trouble.

75
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,432
Guai, guai... Ma che guai?

76
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,915
Lisa, listen to me.

77
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,159
- Basta Permes so.
- In due siete arrivati

78
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,954
e non avete combinato niente!
Ci devo pensare io?

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,994
Spencer, I've thought about it
I've made up my mind.

80
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,555
I can't hurt you.

81
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,796
It wouldn't be fair of me to marry you.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,673
But darling, don't you realise?
Everything's arranged.

83
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,189
My sisters have come all the way from London
for this wedding.

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,234
They’re coming to meet you now.
What on earth am I going to tell them?

85
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,034
Tell them it's best for both of us.
They’ll understand.

86
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,268
Believe me, I know what you're just
suffering from. Pre-marital nerves.

87
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,189
I'm extremely nervous myself. I'll tell you.
Yes, I've had some problems.

88
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,119
My sisters... I had the deuce of job
persuading them.

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,871
it was the accepted thing nowadays
for an Englishman to marry a foreigner.

90
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,517
Here in Italy, I’m not the foreigner.
You and your sisters are foreigners.

91
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,235
Yes, of course. I realize that
but I wouldn't mention it to them.

92
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,149
They’re charming. I'm sure
you'll like them when you meet them.

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,920
- I'd rather not
- Lisa, please.

94
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,634
It wouldn’t work
I'd never be happy in England.

95
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,877
You will, really, you will.
England's not a bad old place.

96
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,517
It's like a cold shower. Once you get
used to it, you feel the better for it

97
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,030
- I don't like cold showers.
- Look darling, we'll compromise.

98
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,310
Six months here and six months there.

99
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,034
Oh, I can't live like a gypsy.

100
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,357
Believe me, Spencer,
I'm doing this for your own good.

101
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,189
Some day, you'll meet girl
who'll enjoy that cold shower with you.

102
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,915
-  Spencer
- Wait, here are my sisters now.

103
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,954
- Lisa, my sisters Katherine and Claire.
- Goodbye.

104
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,550
Via Bellagio 46.

105
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,715
Rather an attractive girl.
But not too friendly.
 
111
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Gee, mister, she's a beauty

112
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,028
Sure don’t see many like that 

113
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,470
I'll bet she's the fastest thing
on the road.


117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,036
Gee, mister, she's a beauty

118
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,276
Sure don’t see many like that

119
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,029
I'll bet she's the fastest thing
on the road.

120
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,879
 

121
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,230
Gee, mister, she's a beauty

122
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,032
Sure don’t see many like that

123
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,630
I'll bet she's the fastest thing
on the road.

124
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,034
 

125
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,473
- Look out
- Oh, my God

126
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,148


127
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,272
Gee, you guys, she's a beauty

128
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,472
You don't see many like that

129
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,470
Yes, sire. I'll bet she's
the fastest thing on the road.

130
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,276
How are you, Dino?

131
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,188
[phone rings]

132
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,431
Hotel La Dolce Vista. Cosa?

133
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,318
Talbot?

134
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,318
Grazie.

135
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,830
Teresa,  Milena,  Maria

136
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,519
Presto!

137
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,231
Now, listen carefully.
Mr Talbot will be here any minute.

138
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,716
Madonna mia.
He'll find out We are lost

139
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,593
God helps those who help themselves.
Thee bedrooms.

140
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,917
You, the bathrooms.
Hide Cedric. Hurry up.

141
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,348
Cedric...

142
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,153
Teresa , Apri, apri, apri

143
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,117
Arriva il Signore Talbot.

144
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,193
- Maurice.
- Mr. Talbot unexpected pleasure.

145
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,277
- How are you?
- A bit surprised.

146
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,472
To see you In July.
You never come till September.

147
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,989
- I wish I'd known.
- My telegram?

148
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,668
- Telegram? No, sir.
- I sent one.

149
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,478
- Get In.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,951
- Isn't that a new colour?
- Pardon?

151
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,390
I said, Isn't that a new colour?

152
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,878
Houses are like women, sir. The older
they get, the more paint they need.

153
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,388
- How's everything been?
- Very quiet.

154
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,309
Like turtles, we withdraw
into our shells until you return.

155
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,277
- What's that?
- Sir?

156
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,314
This... err... bougainvillea.
it wasn’t here last year, was it?

157
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,078
Oh I've done a little...

158
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,477
I've done a bit of landscapping.
If your are displeased...

159
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,434
Displeased?
With what you’ve done with this place?

160
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,473
You're more than a major-domo.
You're a friend.

161
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,069
I hope you'll continue
to think that, sir.

162
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,235
- Signor Clavell. Telegram.
- Oh.

163
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,749
Here, wait minute. I'll get it

164
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,837
- Thank you.
- Grazie.

165
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,037
It's from me.
I'm arriving today.

166
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,994
That's the charm of Italy. It's the only country
where a man can send a telegram

167
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,350
and be sure
he'll be there to receive it

168
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,712
You know, I never realize now much I
miss this place until I come back to it

169
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,196
It's more than a villa. It's a refuge.

170
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,520
It's where a man can...
Lock out the rest of the world.

171
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,069
- Will Miss... err...?
- Yes. She'll be here.

172
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,511
A man doesn't lock the whole world out

173
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,473
Hello, Maria.

174
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,557
...Benedictus sanctus...

175
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,671
Why Is she praying?

176
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,476
A friend of hers, a very fine chap,
Is passing through a severe crisis.

177
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,592
- Well, I hope he makes it
- No more than I do.

178
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,360
I'll take your rooms to your bag.

179
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,989
"La Dolce Vista"?

180
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,954
Must be a new one.

181
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,116


182
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,432
- Hello
- Just get here?

183
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,756
- Yes.
- You'll like it

185
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,956
- What's that?
- Girls.

186
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,196
I know. What’re they doing here?

187
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,632
Sir, if you could have seen them.
Students on tour In a strange land,

188
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,197
their tiny bus disabled.
They’ll be gone In the morning.

189
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,072
They’re staying here tonight?

190
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,432
I know I should have turned them away,
but the quality of mercy's not strained.

191
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,757
It's being strained right now.
Why not send them to a hotel?

192
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,398
There Isn’t a vacant In town. But
if you Insist, I'll tell them to leave.

193
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,875
Well, they have to go somewhere.

194
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,559
What about this new place?

195
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,512
La Dolce Vista.

196
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,358
- Full up, sir.
- Well, they can’t stay here.

197
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,109
- Check around and find something.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,072
Maurice

199
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,989
Oh, we had a splendid hike.
Quite exhilarating.

200
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,714
Miss Allison, Miss Stevens.
Mr. Talbot

201
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,593
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

202
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,429
- HI.
- Miss Allison is the girls' chaperone.

203
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,598
- Where's Cedric?
- I had him carried up to your bedroom.

204
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,713
- Oh, splendid?
- Err... Who's Cedric?

205
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,595
- Miss Allison's parakeet.
- This is such a lovely place.

206
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,156
And the view from the terrace
quite breath-taking.

207
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,593
Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Maurice, make the ladies comfortable.

208
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,635
Well, really
He acts as though he owns the place.

209
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,435
- I was hoping he'd be better this year.
- What's wrong with him?

210
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,632
This is a story
I wish I didn't have to tell.

211
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,149
Years ago, his family owned this place.

212
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,113
There were financial reverses,
they lost it

213
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,278
- That's when you bought it
- Yes.

214
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,316
Then the war came along. He was standing
sentry duty at an ammunition dump.

215
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,158
- Blew up.
- Really?

216
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,716
- It left him traumatised.
- You will not look at him?.

217
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,833
No, It's like looking at
a magnificent castle, with a weak tower.

218
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,669
Isn't it dangerous 
to have him roaming in the house?

219
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,271
No, no, no. He's absolutely harmless
except for one small mental quirk

220
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,675
He thinks he still owns the place.

221
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,555
I let him come every year to stay
a while. It seems to calm his nerves.

222
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,718
If he says something unusual,
just play along.

223
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,151
- What an Interesting case history.
- Has he any money?

224
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,989
Only his government pension.
Naturally, I do what I can.

225
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,318
Oh, Maurice I think
that's why I'm so fond of you.

226
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,670
You're always thinking of others.

227
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,349
I think a psychiatrist
would help him.

228
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,994
Undoubtedly.
But It's none of your affair.

229
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,239
Sandy's a major In psychology.
She's quite a fanatic on the subject

230
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,749
- Dear child.
- Maurice.

231
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,111
- Have these shined, will you?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,630
- Draw my bath. Lay out my clothes.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,070
- Analysis would help him.
- Or good talking to.

234
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,874
He may be shell-shocked,
but he's not helpless.

235
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,390
The ideal treating you
as if you were his servant

236
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,471
Hello.

237
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,158
Hello.

238
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,509
- Mr. Talbot?


239
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,352
- Have you owned this place very long?
- Quite some time.

240
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,753
- You must be very proud of it
- Yes, I am.

241
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,399
Unfortunately, since the war, I've only
been able to come here once a year.

242
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,429
- It must have been a terrible war.
- They usually are.

243
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,550
Yes... I'd like to talk to you
about it some time.

244
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,719
- About what?
- The war.

245
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,876
- The war?
- Yes.

246
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,913
I have a feeling I can help.

247
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,878
I doubt it

248
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,036
It's over.

249
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,839
- What are you doing?
- You told me to lay out...

250
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,999
All right, I'll do it. Get on the phone
and find a place for those women. - Yes, Sir.

253
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,996
Come In.

254
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,228
- Mr. Talbot?
- Yes.

255
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,800
- I was wondering if we could talk now?
- I'm...

256
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,797
Please, It's terribly important

257
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,638
Why don’t you sit down?

258
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,877
No, no, not there. On the couch.

259
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,672
What do you mean?

260
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,394
Now try and relax. Lie down.

261
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,990
- Lie down?
- It's for your own good.

262
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,997
There.

263
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,477
Really, Mr. Talbot
You must try and relax.

264
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,631
Now. Where would you like to begin?

265
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,517
I really don't know.
Where would you suggest?

266
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,551
Well...

267
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,797
Let's start with... the war.

268
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,032
That war really... bothers you,
doesn't it?

269
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,156
You were In the Army.

270
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,799
I thought I was In the Navy.

271
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,912
No, you were In the Army.

272
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,240
Standing sentry duty...
at an ammunition dump

273
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,000
that blew up.

274
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,909
Do you remember that?

275
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,118
All I remember Is
being officer In a PT boat.

276
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,632
Don’t you see? That’s your subconscious
substituting fantasy for fact.

277
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,795
Look...

278
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,912
That’s why you think
you own this place.

279
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,912
Don't I?

280
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,158
No. Really, Mr. Talbot
You must face reality.

281
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,148
Your family lost this house,
Mr. Cavell bought it,

282
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,954
turned it Into a hotel.

283
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,473
- A hotel?

284
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,479
- La Dolce Vista?
- That's right.

285
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,517
- People pay him to stay here?
- Yes.

286
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,513
It's a hotel.

287
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,633
You don't know how happy
you've made me. I knew I could help you.

288
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,831
Oh, you have.

289
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,713
Suddenly, all the pieces
have fallen Into place.

290
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,559
Mr. Cavell will be so thrilled
you've recovered.

291
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,796
- I'll go tell him.
- No, no, no.

292
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,796
Let me tell him.

294
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,674
You can tell Maria to stop praying.

295
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,553
Her friend didn't survive the crisis.

296
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,919
Excuse me. I have some duties.
A major-domo's day Is never done.

297
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,872
Yours Is.

298
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,117
Don't think of your self as a major-domo.

299
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,312
More like a sentry
at an ammunition dump

300
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,750
that's about to blow up.

301
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,911
- Your room or mine?
- Yours.

302
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,759
- You're a thief.
- Yes, sir.

303
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,154
- And a liar.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,952
Completely untrustworthy.

305
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,833
Thief and a liar, yes.
But not untrustworthy.

306
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,918
I really don't think this is the proper time
to talk the matter out

307
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,112
Not while your mind is bristling
with negative thoughts.

308
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,073
I haven’t even begun to bristle.

309
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,751
- Turning my house Into a hotel.
- How easy for you to say "my house".

310
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,474
- You're never here.
- What's that to do with it?

311
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,195
When her windows are stuck do you care?
No, you're In New York

312
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,391
I, Maurice, have to unstick them.

313
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,831
On a cold night when
her radiators knock are you here?

314
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,598
No, I have to warm them up.

315
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,679
And when her plumbing goes out
who's there to unclog her? Maurice.

316
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,316
You're like a husband who's only
with his wife one month a year.

317
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,876
It's the man who's with her the rest
of the year deserves the credit

318
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,470
Well, I don’t care for
what you’ve turned my wife Into.

319
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,240
- What have I done with the profit?
- That's a good question.

320
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,876
Painted her. Put In a new garden wall,
a fountain, a patio.

321
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,072
- I even replenished the wine cellar.
- Not to mention your wallet.

322
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,077
Any personal gain
was of secondary importance.

323
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,556
Your smile of appreciation
when you came here every year.

324
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,797
That was my real... my real reward.

325
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,958
Tell your guests
to find themselves another hotel.

326
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,596
As for you and your accomplices,
pack your bags and leave in the morning.

327
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,031
Sir, I wish you'd sleep
on that decision.

328
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,471
Tomorrow, we'll probably both
laugh about this matter.

329
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,797
We might both be laughing.
But not In the same house.

330
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,436
Sir, may I please ask one last favor?

331
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,474
Margaret, the chaperone. She's been
coming with tourists for some time.

332
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,150
We've become rather close,
even made plans for the future.

333
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,669
She thinks I'm the owner.

334
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,236
Will you please let me explain it to her
In my own way?

335
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,399
All right. But I have the feeling
I'm not doing Margaret any favor.

336
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,591
Thank you. I'll talk to her right away.

337
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,553
We should be leaving in about half an hour to 
pick up Ms. Fellini at the station.

338
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,034
I'll pick her up my self.

339
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,119
Please, sir. As long as I'm here,
I'd like to attend to my duties.

340
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,068
Just for my own Information,

341
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,236
how long has this been a hotel?

342
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,436
Six years.

343
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,754
it was a fine hotel, sir,
with a Triple A rating.

344
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,235
Conrad Hilton
would have been proud to own it

345
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,354
I'm surprised you didn't sell it to him.

346
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,036
The deed Is In your name.

347
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,508
Che piacere rivederla, signorina.

348
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,109
- Grazie Maurice.
- What did he say?

349
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,278
- That It's nice to see me.
- Oh.

350
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,358
- La trovo bene, Maurice.
- Lisa, please.

351
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,791
- Don't pat the servants.
- Maurice? He's more than a servant

352
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,039
Yes, I found that out today.
Keep your eyes on the road.

353
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,629
Robert, you're terribly sharp
with Maurice.

354
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,195
What's wrong?

355
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,678
How would you feel if you found out
Brutus was your major-domo?

356
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,158
Lucrezia Borgia your cook
and Benedict Arnold your upstairs maid?

357
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,713
Cos'hal combinato?

358
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,992
Questa villa resta vuota
Un dici mes al l'anno.

359
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,194
Al lora mi son detto: "Che peccato,
perché non convertirla In un albergo?"

360
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,517
- A hotel
- Filled with tourists.

361
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,996
Look... He even advertises.

362
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,077
Don't laugh, you'll encourage him.

363
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,875
C'é solo una povera vecchia
con sei hambin Indifes.

364
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,435
E lui Il butta fuori, sulla strada.

365
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,232
- È vero?
- È vero.

366
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,998
- I can't believe it
- What?

367
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,953
That you could be so cruel,
to throw out on the street

368
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,789
an old woman
and six helpless children.

369
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,878
- They’re not children, they're...
- What?

370
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,435
- Not children.
- Chie devo solo di lasciarli una notte.

371
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,074
Se ne vada domattina.

372
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,909
Why can’t they stay one night?
They are leaving In the morning.

373
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,352
I don't want anybody there tonight.
Do you?

374
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,519
Roberto, what can one night hurt?

375
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,473
- Ha ragione, cosa importa...
- You keep out of this.

376
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,309
- Don’t you listen to him.
- I've never seen you like this before.

377
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,433
- You're upset.
- Of course I'm upset.

378
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,631
It's 10 months since we had seen each other.

379
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,549
- Whose fault Is that?
- Mi fa male sentirvi litigare.

380
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,311
Isn't he sweet?
He said it upsets him to hear us argue.

381
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,069
There’s nothing to argue about
He's already told them to leave.

382
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,275
You did tell your friend Margaret,
didn’t you?

383
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,155
Come potevo? Stava facendo Il bagno,
non siamo poi così tanto amici.

384
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,396
Don’t talk to her, talk to me.

385
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,639
- What's the big joke?
- He said, how could he tell her?

386
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,674
She was taking a bath,
and they're not that friendly.

387
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,352
I don't think that's funny.

388
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,633
Mi  preoccupa.
Ha perso tutto Il suo spirito.

389
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,231
He said he's worried about you.
You've lost your sense of humour.

390
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,671
Well, I'll get it back when he leaves.

391
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,473
I don't think you should go In with me.

392
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,432
Why not?

393
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,237
The hotel guests.
How will it look if we come In together?

394
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,514
All right. I'll park the car and come In
through the servants' entrance.

395
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,271
I wouldn't want you
to lose your Triple A rating.

397
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,474
Oh, Miss Allison. Signorina Fellini.

398
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,830
- Buon giorno .
- Good afternoon.

399
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,589
- Who's she?
- A school teacher.

400
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,954
She doesn't look like a school teacher.

401
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,754
Margaret, If beauty
symbolizes occupation,

402
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,554
I would mistake you for a star 
from the cinema

403
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,318
Maurice

406
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,953
- Oh, not now.
- Why not?

407
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,549
- She's taking a shower.
- Who Is?

408
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,910
- Sandy.
- Sandy?

409
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,998
The girl with whom I share 
the room.

410
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,514
- You're rooming with someone?


411
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,632
- I'll kill that Maurice.
- It's not his fault

412
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,470
If he moved everyone around so I could
be alone In the room next to yours,

413
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,352
how would it look?

414
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,516
You'd better leave.

415
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,312
- We'll have dinner on my terrace.
- There Isn't room for nine people.

416
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,274
- What nine people?
- They’ll suspect if we eat alone.

417
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,948
Hurry, she might see you.

418
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,832
Be careful.

419
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,556
What am I sneaking around for?
It's my...

420
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,751
- Shhi
...house.

421
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,589


422
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,431
You'd better wait

423
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,478
Miss Allison hasn't made her bed-check.
And she's already suspicious.

424
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,998
- Of what?
- You and Mr. Talbot

425
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,875
- What about us?
- Don’t get me wrong.

426
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,152
I think It's terribly exciting.
All the girls do.

427
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,272
Two people In love.
In a romantic place like this.

428
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,995
It's the dreamiest thing
I've ever heard of.

429
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,079
I'm going downstairs
to get some warm milk.

430
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,555
Warm milk?

431
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,429
He looks more like
the champagne type to me.

432
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,314
Good night, girls. Lights out now.

433
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,194
Err...

434
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,996
I was just going downstairs...
to get some warm milk.

436
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,676
I got the warm milk.

437
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,277
- Sandy.
- Yes, ma'am.

438
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,596
Lights out now.

439
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,957
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

440
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,479
She'll be asleep In ten minutes.

441
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,875
So will I.

442
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,870
But he's waiting for you.
I can hear the music.

443
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,870
I really don't know where
a girl your age gets Ideas like that

444
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,119
I have no Intention
of going to Mr. Talbot's room.

445
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,753
I'm going...

446
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,511
Yes, I'm going to finish my milk
and go to sleep.

451
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,310
Good morning.

452
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,829
- Morning?

453
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,748
- What happened to last night?
- Everybody looked suspicious.

454
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,030
And Sandy knew about us.

455
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,915
I couldn't leave.
it would've been too obvious.

456
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,318
Sandy seems to know about everything.
Now I know what she's doing In Europe.

457
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,876
Her neighbors
decided to chip In and send her.

459
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,270
- What's that?
- They’re getting ready to leave.

460
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,595
Good.

461
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,319
I promised to come down
and say goodbye.

462
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,750
Oh, send them a letter.

463
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,509
- It'll only take a minute
- No, Lisa, come on.

464
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,793
- I think you should come and say goodbye too.
- I'll wave to them from the terrace.

465
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,991
Teenagers are like the H-bomb.

466
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,478
When they go off, It's much better
to observe them from a distance.

467
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,079
- Bye, Mr. Talbot
- Bye

468
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,875
- Goodbye, Mr. Talbot
- Bye, Mr. Talbot

469
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,354
Good morning, sir.
Your orange juice.

470
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,271
Not orange juice, Maurice, champagne.
It's a special occasion.

471
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,436
The hotel Is closing,

472
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,517
you're packing,

473
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,950
and the guests are leaving.

474
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,950
How often does a man get rid
of all his troubles at the same time?

475
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,112
Oh, what's the matter?

477
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,075
I don't understand, Miss Allison.
What are you doing In traction?

478
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,640
Slipped on a champagne cork?

479
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,755
it was an accident
I've sprung my sacroiliac.

480
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,192
Mm? No, I've had this happen before.

481
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,393
Don't worry, I'll be absolutely splendid
by the morning.

482
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,196
The girls can’t go without her.

483
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,511
You will have to let them stay 
until tomorrow

484
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,438
You wouldn’t think a cork this small
could lay out woman that big.

485
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,197
Maria, move Miss Fellini's luggage
into Miss Allison room.

486
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,958
- Teresa and...
- Milena, sir.

487
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,594
Start making sandwiches. Lots of them.

488
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,473
Mr. Cavell will need
all of his strength.

489
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,310
- Where am I going?
- On a long hike. With the girls.

490
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,512
You're going to show them Italy.
All of it.

491
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,029
if you run out of Italy,
show them Sicily.

492
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,629
That ought to take you all the day.

493
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,070
And a good part of the night, sir.

494
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,555
I'm glad we understand each other.

495
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,433
It's a shame the girls
have no place to go today.

496
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,631
They do.

497
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,990
They’re going on a long hike.

498
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,916
Shouldn’t we offer to go with them?

499
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,476
Maurice already volunteered.

500
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,676
Do you want to go?

502
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,949
Hiking could never replace this.

503
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,910
Oh, Robert

506
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,475
One, two, three, four,
ready, set...

507
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,955
- Hey, two, three, four...
- Hup

508
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,196
- Hup
- Two, three, four...

509
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,152
- Hup  Hup  Hup  Hup
- Hey

510
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,637
What's going on here?

512
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,599
Observe.

513
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,476
Hey, look. It's Barney Oldfield.

514
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,671
- Catch, Beagle.
- Hey, two, three, four...

515
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,718
- What are you doing here?
- This is the Hotel Dolce Vista, right?

516
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,831
- Not any more.
- We got reservations.

517
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,156
- They’re cancelled.
- Hold this.

518
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,670
- I got written confirmation from the manager.
- He's cancelled it too.

519
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,835
Sorry.

520
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,749
- All right, out
- Hey, wait a minute. Hold it

521
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,074
Hey, Beagle.
You're gonna be a lawyer, right?

522
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,918
Can he do this to us?

523
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,669
In 1937, there was the case
of Wilson against the Waldorf Astoria.

524
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,190
- And?
- He can do it to us.

525
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,960
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Yeah.

526
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,878
Let's go.

527
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,592
Beagle, give me a coin.

528
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,073
Hey...

529
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,196
That's for parking In your driveway.

530
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,792
We end up In a stream first,
then we're tossed out of our hotel.

531
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,788
- Maybe this country's unlucky.
- We could be In France In a few hours.

532
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,833
- These In favor of leaving, say "Aye'.
- Aye

533
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,997
- These In favor of staying, say "Aye'.
- Aye

534
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,428
Aye

535
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,070
- They’re backing up.
- Don't look around.

536
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,475
- Which one did you like?
- I didn't notice.

537
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,196
- The driver was cute. Nice blue eyes.
- They’re brown and keep away from him.

539
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,989
Err... Bongiorno.

540
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,111
Bongiorno.

541
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,357
- This one Is mine, huh?
- Tell 'me we wanna be friends.

542
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,199
Just wait a minute, let me handle it
and we'll all make out

543
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,391
Where do you live?

544
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,795
Sausalito.

545
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,560
And where Is that near?

546
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,477
San Francisco.

547
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,678
I am very stoopid.

548
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,472
But I'm loads of fun.

549
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,519
- We're from Connecticut
- Where are you staying?

550
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,790
Hotel La Dolce Vista.

551
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,709
Well, Isn't that coincidence?
We're staying right outside the gate.

552
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,435
- But there’s nothing there.
- Give us 20 minutes, will you?

553
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,119
See you.

554
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,832
Call the police.
I want them picked up for trespassing.

555
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,430
Unfortunately, sir,
It's not your property.

556
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,951
They’re like spiders. And they've got
the flies helping them put up their web.

557
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,519
- Why aren’t those flies out hiking?
- They Insisted on going to help out

558
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,388
The moment I saw you,
just came out of my shell.

559
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,116
Well, yes, but you know I really think
we ought to go help the others, Tony.

560
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,153
- Say that again.
- What?

561
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,351
My name.

562
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,869
Tony.

563
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,513
Once more.

564
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,117
Tony.

565
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,835
There’s something about that boy
I don't trust.

566
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,429
I don’t care how you do it,
I want you...

567
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,076
- Ciao!
- What's she doing down there?

568
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,114
Goodbye, I'll see you later.
Ciao, ciao!

569
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,714
La, la, la, la
La la Il, la la, la la

570
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,114
La, la, la, la

571
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,629
What were you doing down there?

572
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,912
Darling, you're going to be so proud
of me. I've arranged everything.

573
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,078
- Like what?
- La, la, la, la...

574
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,511
- Like what?
- The boys need kerosene.

575
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,917
- Why? Who are they planning to burn?
- It is for the stove.

576
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,430
- They’re very nice American boys.
- So was the Dalton gang.

577
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,234
The boys are hurt
They think you don't like them.

578
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,429
They’re right.

579
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,394
They’re college students on their first
vacation in Europe. Go...Make friends.

580
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,354
- I don't want to make friends.
- I don't understand you.

581
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,596
- They’re sweet.
- Sweet.

582
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,153
- Yes
- Yes.

583
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,994
Do you know what the boys are going to do
with the girls this afternoon?

584
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,553
No.

585
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,508
What are the boys going to do
with the girls this afternoon?

586
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,950
Well, I thought,
those girls have nothing to do.

587
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,436
These boys have nothing to do.
So, they could use the sun terrace.

588
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,553
- But Robert wouldn't like that
- No, Robert wouldn't like that

589
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,194
Then I said to my self,
"Wouldn't it be nice

590
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,474
if they all rented motors scooters
and went for a ride In the country?"

591
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,558
That's what you said to your self.
Did you say it to them?

592
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,639
Oh, yes. The boys said it sounded
like it would be a lot of fun.

593
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,751
Well, that sounds like the boys.

594
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,439
- Mr. Cavell.
- Sir?

595
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,712
Go with them and you are not to let those
girls out of your sight.

596
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,992
- Sir, I can't ride a motor scooter.
- Then learn.

597
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,031
I have no sense of balance.

598
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,800
I was the only child, I had to be
strapped to my tricycle.

599
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,150
- I won't let them go out alone.
- Robert

600
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,634
Lisa, please.

601
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,877
I don't know how I let myself get talked Into
all of this, but I'm In it

602
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,234
It's not his hotel, It's my home.
I am the one legally responsible.

603
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,954
- I fully expect your friend, err...
- Margaret.

604
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,878
...to sue me the minute she goes out.
- She wouldn't.

605
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,275
I can be sued for sprung sacroiliac

606
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,948
I can go to jail for what
can happen to those girls.

607
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,869
What can happen to them?
There are four boys and six girls.

608
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,992
That adds up to ten.
And there's safety In numbers.

609
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,395
There’s more to mathematics than adding.

610
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,388
These boys look quite capable
of dividing and multiplying

611
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,675
Oh

612
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,552
Oh

613
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,193
They purposely took this road.
They’re trying to shake us.

614
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,551
I don't know about you,
but I'm pretty well shook.

615
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,832
All right, so It's my fault
I said I'm sorry.

616
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,313
You'd be more comfortable
if you put your head against me.

619
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,791
- What did you wish for?
- It's very bad luck to tell.

620
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,798
I hope you get what you want

621
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,436
That sure Is sweet of you.

622
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,155
You know, this Is a side of you
I've never seen before.

623
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,078
What Is?

624
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,512
This protective attitude towards women.

625
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,790
Women? They’re only 18.

626
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,036
Children, no older than my niece.

627
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,958
- So?
- So?

628
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,513
So?

629
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,598
Would I let my niece
go out with guys like that?

630
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,078
I know those boys.
I know that's on their mind.

631
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,593
Robert,

632
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,314
you have a moral streak.

633
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,030
You know me better than that

634
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,039
Hey, Beagle Beagle

635
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,992
- What?
- Look.

636
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,557
A Papilio glaucus. That’d look great
In your butterfly collection.

637
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,469
- What butterfly collection?
- The one you're starting, now.

638
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,069
- Oh.
- Come on, it went that way.

639
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,792
- Now, just a minute here.
- You wait here In case it doubles back.

640
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,433
Tony, are you sure
that butterfly's gonna come here?

641
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,596
Positive. When you're followed,

642
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,031
you instinctive find a place
where nobody can find you.

643
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,755
- This Is it
- You do know a lot about butterflies.

644
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,796
It's what we study In medical school:
Insects, animals, people.

645
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,912
You'd be surprised
how similar we are In many ways.

646
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,109
Oh?

647
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,278
Well, did you know that
beetles actually kiss?

648
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,435
- No.
- Sure.

649
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,868
How?

650
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,356
The boy beetle rubs his antenna
against the girl beetle.

651
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,279
And what does the girl beetle do?

652
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,075
If he doesn't rub her the wrong way,
they make plans for the future.

653
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,236
Like tonight.

654
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,796
Medicine's a fascinating field.

655
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,034
That's why a woman
like Lisa so interesting.

656
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,276
Lisa?

657
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:53,191
There are 206 bones In the human body.
I've never seen them that way arranged before.

658
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,152
Oh.

659
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:00,434
- She sure Is a beautiful specimen.
- Yes, she Is. For her age.

660
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,715
- I am sorry. I didn't mean to be catty.
- Don't be sorry.

661
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,831
She Is, she's very beautiful.

662
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,110
- She really Is.

663
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,270
How would you say I'm arranged?

664
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,471
- You?
- Yeah.

665
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,389
I never gave it much thought.

666
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,552
You've got good basic bone structure.

667
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,716
Let me see.

668
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,909
Nice rib cage.

669
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,156
Fibula.

670
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,437
Tibia’s good.

671
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,119
Ah, well-developed patellas.

672
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,753
Uh-huh.

673
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,439
Mm-hm.

674
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,831
Uh-huh.

675
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,592
Good.

676
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,072
Very good.

677
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,952
Excellent

678
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,112
Good strong heartbeat.

679
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,073
- Isn't that strange?
- What?

680
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,999
Your pulse,
it suddenly started to race.

681
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,954
- Did it?
- It's swung down now.

682
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,148
There it goes again.

683
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,315
it doubled back.

684
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,351
Oh, err... Tony was just examining
my bone structure.

685
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,313
He's studying to be a doctor.

686
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,671
Where does he plan to Intern?
At the Follies Bergères?

687
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,637
I don't want to Interfere
with medical progress,

688
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,796
but we’re ready to leave.

689
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,596
After you, Doctor.

690
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,193
- Hey, Beagle. Is this it?
- Yes, sir

691
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,277
Here we go

692
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,752
I thought you said
he'd never make it up this hill.

693
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,520
All right, so we get him
on the next hill.

694
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,280
He's killing the whole day for us.

695
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,153
What about tonight?
The girls are leaving In the morning.

696
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,828
Beagle, will you relax?
We'll get rid of him.

697
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,759
I don't know.
This Is no kid we're fooling with.

698
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,871
That's the answer, he's no kid.

699
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,038
Look he's got a be over 35.

700
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,913
How many hills can he take?

701
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,395
I don't know.
He looks pretty rugged to me.

702
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,591
Yeah, In his day, Beagle.

703
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:26,318
The B-29 was a rough plane, but it can’t
keep up with a guided missile.

704
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,633
When they wheel him
Into the hanger tonight,

705
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,559
his tail Is really gonna be dragging.

706
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,114
- They’re out to get me.
- Get you what?

707
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,392
- Get rid of me.
- Do you blame them?

708
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,832
- Don't start that
- It's natural, they want to be alone.

709
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,113
- Have you forgotten what that's like?
- What's that supposed to mean?

710
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,713
They’re normal, healthy boys
and normal, healthy girls. No?

711
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,799
That can lead to a normal, unhealthy
situation. Yes, believe me. I know what I'm doing.

712
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,391
- Robert, you're breaking the spirit.
- Yeah

714
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,038
The guy's not human.

715
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,755
When I couldn't push my scooter
up that last hill...

716
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,394
...he carried it up for me.

717
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,275
- It's spooky.
- Look, Let's be rational.

718
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,232
How old are we, anyway?

719
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,749
I feel like I'm 92.

720
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,633
We're 20 and he's pushing 40.
That's ancient

721
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,876
We're young, we can bounce back.

722
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,992
He's probably laying In his room right now,
like a lead ball.

723
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,553
Anybody here?

724
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,995
The girls tell me
we're all going dancing tonight.

725
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,829
We'll be ready to leave
In about an hour.

726
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,838
 Multiplication,
that's the name of the game

727
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,669
 And each generation plays the same

728
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,359
Isn't he terrific?

729
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,236
 When you see a gentleman bee
Round a lady bee buzz in;,

730
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,635
 Why, count to ten
Then count again

731
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,400
 There's sure to be an even dozen

732
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,752
 Multiplication,
it's the name of the game

733
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,670
 And each generation plays the same

734
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,874
 Now two butterflies cast their eyes
Both In the same direction

735
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,640
 Why you'd never guess
that one little yes

736
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,195
 Could start a butterfly collection

737
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,552
 Multiplication,
that's the name of the game

738
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,914
 And each generation plays the same

739
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,999
 I say one and one are five
Call me a silly goat

740
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,509
 But you take two minks
You add two winks

741
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,711
 What've you got? One mink coat

742
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,994
 A girl gets coy In front of a boy
after three or four dances

743
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,316
 Well, you can bet
she’ll play hard to get

744
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,273
 To multiply her chances

745
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,519
 Multiplication,
that's the name of the game

746
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,998
 And each generation plays the same

747
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,794
 Let me tell you now
Mother Nature's a clever gal

748
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,389
 She relies on habits

749
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,673
 Take two hares with no cares
Soon you got a room full of rabbits

750
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,510
 Parakeets, In between tweets,
sometimes get too quiet

751
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,475
 But have no fear, soon you hear
A parakeet’s riot, try it

752
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,473
 Multiplication
is the name of the game

753
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,036
 And each generation plays the same

754
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,433
 Multiplication
is the name of the game

755
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,316
 And each generation plays the same

756
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,951
It's respect.
That's what girl wants from a boy.

757
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,836
if the girl gives In too easy,
the boy will not take her seriously

758
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,952
He’ ll never think
In terms of engagement,

759
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,914
marriage, a home, or children.

760
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,956
if you want all these things,
keep your standards high.

761
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,110
The bedroom's like a wedding gown,

762
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,996
It's bad luck to let the fellow
see you In it before you marry him.

763
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,836
Isn't he fabulous?

764
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,349
How does he do it?

765
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,949
He's going on raw courage now.

766
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,355
Remember.
The night Is young, he's not

768
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:38,275
Well, if you’re old enough to fly,
you're old enough to look.


770
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,516
Mr. Talbot?

771
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,637
Mr. Talbot sir?

772
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,997
What do you what?

773
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,475
We'd like to speak to you
for a minute, sir.

774
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,796
It's terribly important

775
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,353
- I’ll be right down.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

776
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,518
You told the girls
to be ready In an hour, right?

777
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,153
He's a weirdie

778
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,239
He’s just as fresh
as when we started out

779
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,477
Beagle... Beagle,

780
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,319
No man his age
can defy the laws of medical science.

781
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,911
He's traveled on a motor scooter for
over 100 miles, half of it straight up.

782
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,476
He's been on a dance floral night,
knocking himself out

783
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,636
He's had it. Come here.

784
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,989
It's medically proven that to put
said subject to sleep at this point,

785
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,876
It's only necessary to Introduce into the system
some drops of monatomic di carbon hydroxyl.

786
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,513
What's that?

787
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,315
Booze. Just few drinks, we're home.

788
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,034
- You're the king.
- Thank you. Observe.

789
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,751
Hold it, now.

790
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,949
Yes?

791
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,276
Excuse me Sir, since we're leaving early
in the morning,

792
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,677
we thought we’d like to come by
and apologise to you.

793
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,955
Oh.

794
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,869
I know we've created a terrible impression,
we've been rude and unpleasant,

795
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,469
in fact, sometimes downright boorish.

796
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,592
May we come In for a moment, sir?

797
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,956
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

798
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,517
Mr. Talbot We just couldn't leave without
trying to square things with you.

799
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,551
- I see.
- No hard feelings?

800
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,593
- Not at all. 
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

801
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,030
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

802
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,113
What did you say, Beagle?

803
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,278
Do you know what an occasion
like this calls for? A drink.

804
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,994
- Yeah.
- You're right. He's right, sir.

805
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,913
May we have a farewell drink together?

806
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,714
- Sure. Let's do.
- Thank you, sir.

807
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,552
Beautiful villa you have, Mr. Talbot

808
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,113
Now, then.
What would you boys like to drink?

809
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,789
- A brandy.
- Brandy?

811
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,789
Fine.

812
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,157
A toast, sir.

813
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,033
May this night be an example
of the friendship.

814
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,118
between your generation and ours.

815
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,636
And another toast, sir.

816
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:05,276
May these drinks wash away the past
and ensure the future.

817
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,556
To a little insurance.

818
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,671
Now, then...

819
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,434
Well, sir.
I'd like to propose a toast.

820
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,959
To what?

821
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,355
You name it

822
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,949
- Well...
- How do you feel?

823
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,149
Fine.

824
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:16,710
Sir, do you realize that you are defying
the laws of medical science?

825
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,798
Dr. Lister and Louis Pasteur.

826
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,036
And, err...

827
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,196
Madame Curie.

828
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,193
All our work, sir, Is for nothing.

830
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,153
I'm sorry. Some unfinished business
I had to attend to.

832
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,235
Robert

833
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,516
What's wrong?

834
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,872
- What's happened?
- I got'em

835
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,640
Every last one of 'em.

836
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,030
Tony?

837
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,673
Tony

838
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,437
What happened?

839
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,918
Tony

840
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,277
Tony

841
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,709
Hmm?

844
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,599
Tony?

845
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,238
Are you all right?

846
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,077
Course I'm all right.

847
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,838
A little wet, that's all.

848
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,600
Come on, try and stand up.

849
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,995
Now see if you can walk.

850
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,991
Course I can walk.

852
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,277
How do you feel?

853
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,597
What happened?

854
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,230
Mr. Talbot...

855
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,877
He called us In,
and then he forced us to drink with him.

856
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,071
Tony...

857
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,556
If I could only lie down for minute,
I'd feel fine. I know it

858
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,716
Do you want to go In the house?

859
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,354
No, I... I'd better not

860
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,835
I'd better go back to the tent

861
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,397
- Tony
- Mm?

862
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,757
I need a little help.

863
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,596
Robert

864
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,109
How could you do this?

865
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,629
I was only following their golden rule.

866
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,149
Do unto others before they do it to you.

867
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,476
You can't let them lie there all night.

868
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,353
Maurice can sweep 'em out
In the morning.

869
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,916
Look...don’t feel sorry for them.

870
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,918
They got exactly what they 
are deserved.

871
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,591
- Somebody has to look after the girls.
- Is it not their parentsresponsibility?

872
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,839
The trouble with the American parents is,
they have a new gimmick.

873
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,192
"Keep your kids off the streets.
Send them to Europe."

874
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,110
They’re turning this continent
Into one big corner drugstore.

875
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,355
- It's gone.
- What?

876
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,792
There’s a body missing. The one body
I don't want to have missing.

877
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,198
Sandy wait, I was drunk, I swear.
I didn’t even know what I was doing.

878
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,358
The next time I see a man lying in the bar, 
I will leave him there.

879
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,358
- Mr.Talbot, Did you force him to drink with you?
- Of course not.

880
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,039
And that's a lie.

881
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,277
- Sandy, honey...
- Sandy...

882
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,075
Thank you.

883
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,558
You've reaffirmed my lack of confidence
In my fellow man.

884
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,195
- Sandy?
- Mm?

885
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,595
Are you all right?

886
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,189
Oh, sure. He's cute, Isn't he?

887
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,674
- Who?
- Tony.

888
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,634
Hope I didn't loosen any teeth when
I hit him. He has a beautiful smile.

889
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,628
- You're not mad at him?
- Mad? Why would I be mad at him?

890
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,512
Wait, wait...

891
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,951
- He got fresh. You hit him.

892
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,434
- You're not mad?
- No.

893
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,198
- You like him?
- Adore him.

894
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,118
Eh giàl Sicuro!

895
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,915
The business psychiatrists
must do In America

896
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,953
You people are all mixed up.

897
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,709
You see, when he got fresh,
it showed he was Interested.

898
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,276
- I had to ensure he stayed Interested.
- So you hit him.

899
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,590
It's like Mr.Talbot said.
A girl has to make a boy respect her.

900
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,839
If she gives in easily, he  
will never take her seriously.

901
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,598
Oh.

902
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,710
- He said that?

903
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,878
He's right. He said,
"When you go shopping In a market,

904
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,072
you don't buy anything
that's been there too much."

905
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,913
- When did Mr.Talbot tell you all this?
- While we were dancing.

906
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,874
He said: "if you want man to think in terms
of getting engaged and married,

907
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,197
you got to keep your standards high."

908
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,428
What else did he say?

909
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,031
He said that love Is one product you
don't sell by giving away free samples.

910
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,311
That's a good advice for all of us.

911
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:03,275
You listen to him. I can tell you,
he knows what he's talking about

912
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,913
I know.

913
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,472
Well?

914
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,518
I guess you learned
something tonight, huh?

915
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,952
Yes. I never realized
how wrong I was.

916
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,870
- It's all In the past now.
- You're so right.

917
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,473
You know, It's been a long day.

918
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,956
Some champagne
would do us both the world of good.

919
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,357
- The bottle's on the terrace.

920
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,199
- I'll go get it

921
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,197
- Robert

922
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,278
When you get to the terrace,
would you do me a favor?

923
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,438
- Sure.
- Jump off.

925
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,153
- What are you doing?
- Taking your advice.

926
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:08,798
If a woman is too easy to get, 
no man will ever take her seriously.

927
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,719
When I think how easy I was.

928
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,229
Stupida Cretina Idiota

929
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,989
- Something I told some young girls.
- To protect their morals.

930
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,111
What about my morals?

931
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,675
What's that got to do with it?
We're adults.

932
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,714
- Lisa, look. You just calm down.
- Don't touch me.

933
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,914
How could I be that stupid?

934
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,993
You are rich, good looking
Intelligent, charming.

935
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,239
I should have known better than
to get mixed up with someone like that

936
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,839
You're not making any sense.

937
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,474
I don't have to make sense.
I'm Italiani

938
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,069
Ci sono uomini
più Interessanti di te In Italia.

939
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,999
Sono stufa degil american. Stufa

940
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,078
Talk English I can't understand you.

941
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,319
That's another thing. if you loved me,
you'd have learned my language.

942
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,715
But no. I had to do it

943
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,559
The weeks I spent studying.

944
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,275
Learning to speak this fluid English.

945
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,833
Not fluid, fluent

946
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,634
Big shot Knows all the words.

947
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,036
For the first time, I started to think
What am I doing here? 

948
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,835
Lisa, believe me, no love affair can survive
if either party starts to think.

949
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,508
That's the beauty of our relation ship.
No thinking.

950
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,191
- No pressure, no questions asked.
- It's time someone asked questions.

951
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,153
I knew those girls
would get me In trouble.

952
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,952
You're a hypocrite.

953
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,357
You made all the rules
and I play by them.

954
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,233
- Now I know what you think of me.
- Lisa.

955
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:43,195
Well, the game Is over, Robert
I don’t want to play any more.

956
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,473
- If you just calm down.
- I'm tired of being a free sample.

957
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,593
- There’s no future In it
- We never even talked about the future.

958
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,678
Women don't want talk.
They go by Intuition.

959
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,677
And I've learned one thing.

960
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,678
A woman’s Intuition
Is a man's best friend.

961
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,111
- Lisa, wait.
- The market's closed, Mr. Talbot.

962
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,551
You have to start shopping
somewhere else.

963
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,394
Lisa.

964
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,714
Lisa

966
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,270
Who's In that tent?

967
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,072
Boys.

968
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,838
Boys?

969
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,040
Watch your head, my dear.

970
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,230
- Did my girls meet them?
- Meet whom?

971
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,149
- Those boys down In the tent
- Oh, those boys. Yes.

972
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,318
They weren't Interested
In feminine companions.

973
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,956
They’re too absorbed by
the educational aspects of the tour.

974
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:22,109
It's too bad you won't have time to meet
them. Fine, clean-cut young Americans.

975
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,437
True goodwill ambassadors
of a great nation.

976
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,833
- Which way's the tent?
- What happened to the girls?

977
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,032
I don't know. Man, what a night.

978
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,033
- Maurice
- Dear, I'm as shocked as you are.

979
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,629
If anything's happened to those girls...

980
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,679
Margaret, believe me, please

981
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,917
Nothing happened.
Absolutely nothing, I'm sure.

982
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,114
I hope not. Remember...
I left to the girls In your care.

983
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,710
Oh Cedric

985
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,113
- He hiccupped.
- He did.

987
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,238
Cedric

988
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,116
He's drunk

989
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:26,795
Maurice What kind of party
did you have here last night?

990
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,231
- Lisa, come back here
- I said, don’t touch me

991
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,477
Wait until everybody's gone.
We can talk like adults.

992
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,673
I don't want to talk like an adult
That's how I got Into all this trouble.

993
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,633
- How will you get back? There's no train.
- I'll walk.

994
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,149
- You are very welcome to come with us.
- Thank you.

995
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,510
You keep out of this.

996
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:49,156
Lisa, don’t you walk out that door.

997
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,114
What would I lose? Thef privilege
of seeing you every September?

998
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,471
Well, I'm tired
of being girl of the month.

999
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,192
- You know you're more than that
- Don't worry, Robert

1000
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,790
You won't have any trouble.
Just put an ad In the paper.

1001
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,357
Girl wanted. Short hours,
pleasant working conditions.

1002
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,997
There’s only one drawback.
There’s no chance of advancement

1003
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,797
Wild parties, immoral rendezvous...

1004
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,116
And to think I trusted you

1005
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,595
Next, I'll find out
this Isn’t even a hotel.

1006
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,236
That's precise the next thing
you're about to find out

1007
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,112
- Sir.
- You're fired.

1008
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,835
And you, madam,
take those girls of yours,

1009
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,112
pack that drunken bird,
and get out

1010
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,232
Are you going to allow him
to speak to me like that?

1011
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,513
Margaret, there’s a small detail I probably
should have mentioned before now.

1012
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,837
I know you are going to take it
with your customary good sense of humor.

1013
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:51,397
Margaret, Listen to me
Where's that good sense of humour?

1015
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,032
Margaret

1016
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,195
Sandy Honey, listen...

1017
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,071
Hey, Sandy

1018
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,515
- I'm packed, sir.
- Goodbye, Mr. Clavel.

1019
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,794
- Before I leave, can I get you breakfast?
- No.

1020
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,390
- Yes. Get me an olive.
- A martini for breakfast?

1021
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,196
Great for the morning after. Especially
if there hasn't been a night before.

1022
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,355
Yes, sir.

1023
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,917
Oh, before I forget,
would you kindly sign this, sir?

1024
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,759
- What Is it?
- A letter of recommendation.

1025
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,191
A letter of recommendation?

1026
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,996
I didn't want to trouble you, so I took the
liberty of writing it out myself. Just sign here.

1027
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,069
It's much too trivial
for you to bother reading, sir.

1028
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,596
"Loyal...

1029
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,275
...faithful, dedicated, noble."

1030
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,233
"Reputable. Incorruptible."

1031
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,159
it does get rather monotonous.

1032
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,833
Nearly saint-like in his devotion 
to his master.

1033
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,439
Yes, sir.

1034
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,275
Nobody who believes this deserves you.

1035
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,795
Thank you very much, sir.
I'll get the olive.

1036
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,755
May I speak to you a moment, sir?

1037
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,555
Well, If it Isn't
the prowling physician.

1038
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,115
I don't blame you, sir.

1039
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,869
The way I acted with Sandy,
I'm no credit to the medical profession.

1040
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,718
Hardly.

1041
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,833
I came to apologise, sir.
No gimmicks this time.

1042
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,600
You had us pegged
right from the beginning.

1043
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,712
That's probably
why we got so sore at you.

1044
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,037
- Sir, do you know what a lemming is?
- No.

1045
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,312
Well, It's an animal
that destroys itself.

1046
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:19,349
I gotta look up my family tree, there
must be some real lemmings in it

1047
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,678
I meet a great girl like Sandy and what
do I do? I goofed the whole thing up.

1048
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,996
I acted just like a stupid adolescent

1049
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,714
I'm not a kid any more,
I know better than that

1050
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,232
- I'm getting on In years.
- You are not exactly ancient.

1051
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,318
When a guy gets as old as I am,
you'd think he'd be smart enough

1052
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,149
to stop fooling around
and look for lasting relationship.

1053
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,239
Once In a while, if you're lucky, you
come across something of real value.

1054
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,078
And what do you do?

1055
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,795
Treat it like a bargain basement
speola. You start grabbing it

1056
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,992
And you lose it
You spend your life shopping around

1057
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,555
for something
that's not even half as good.

1058
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,434
Anyhow, I came by to say, I'm sorry.

1059
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,629
So long, Mr. Talbot

1060
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,273
Tony.

1061
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,514
Yes, sir?

1062
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,073
Err...

1063
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,431
Have a nice trip.

1064
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,638
Thank you, sir.

1065
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,398
Thank you.

1066
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,998
- Here you are, sir.
- Mr. Clavell.

1067
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:45,796
just learned something. I'm a lemming.

1068
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,670
You really should have something
more substantial for breakfast.

1069
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,589
You know man Is the only animal clever enough
to build the Empire State Building

1070
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,995
and stupid enough to jump off it

1071
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,398
- Get the car, Maurice.
- Yes, sir

1072
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,913
- I don’t see them.
- Sparrow, stop worrying

1073
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,715
- He'll follow us.
- Who?

1074
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,914
Tony. You don't think I'd have left
If I didn’t think he'd come after me?

1075
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:25,636
And don't you worry.
Mr. Talbot will come after you too.

1076
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,798
Believe me, Sandy, I couldn't care less.

1077
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,991
A $20,000 car
Isn't supposed to get a flat

1078
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,431
Evident, the manufacturers
felt the same way.

1079
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,871
There’s no jack to change the tyre.

1080
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,594
There must be a garage
around here someplace.

1081
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,396
Va; vial
Dov'è il garage plù vicino?

1082
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,478
They don't know. I'll ask Inside.

1084
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,069
You there, I want to borrow your truck.

1085
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,157
MI spiace, ma non capisco.

1086
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,796
I want to borrow your truck.
I'll pay you for it

1087
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,991
Non posso.

1088
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,272
It's an emergenoy.
I'll buy it, here.

1089
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,109
Ma questo camion non é mica mio.

1090
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,675
Perché mi ha dato questo denaro?
Non è mio.

1091
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,118
- Get In.
- There’s a garage.

1092
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,550
- Never mind, get In.
- In this?

1094
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,436
Va bene. Va bene.

1095
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,795
Eh, il mio camion

1096
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,959
Eccolo là Fermati

1097
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:26,429
Calmati, figlio mio.
Chiamiamo la polizia adesso.

1098
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,311
There they are, sir.

1100
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,748
- Here, take this bird.
- Take the wheel.

1101
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,754
Lisa

1102
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,916
- What?
- Stop the bus

1103
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,679
- I want to talk to you.
- Go away.

1104
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,676
I've been thinking.

1105
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,759
You want me to take you seriously?
OK. I take you serious.

1106
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,076
It's too late.

1107
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,078
What do you want me to do, marry you?

1108
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,671
- OK, I'll marry you.
- You sound like you do me a favor.

1109
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,678
I'm not doing you any favor
by marrying you.

1110
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,476
if you'd asked me when we first met,
or last year, or even yesterday.

1111
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,877
We never spoke of marriage.
We were happy.

1112
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:32,074
I always feel I forced you Into it

1113
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:37,274
- Do I sound like I'm being forced?
- You don’t seem happy about it

1114
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,357
I've never been happier.

1115
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,596
Look damn it, I'm smiling.

1116
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,352
it would never work

1117
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,512
Lisa, I'm asking you In a nice way.

1118
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,154
Now stop being an Idiot

1119
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,672
Get off that blasted bus and marry me

1120
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,438
No

1121
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,917
OK, don't ever say I never asked you.

1122
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,113
You're a witness.
You heard me ask her.

1123
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,759
- Don’t stop now, sir. Follow them.
- No, Maurice.

1124
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:28,753
I'm like this goose.
I know when I've laid an egg.

1125
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,878
I want that villa put up forsale.

1126
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,629
And if you can't sell it, burn it
I've had it with this country.

1127
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,274
Thais Is no time to burn your villas
behind you.

1128
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,995
- She loves you. She wants to marry you.
- She has a funny way of showing it

1129
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,395
Italian women are emotional.

1130
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,512
She's been hurt
She wants time to think.

1131
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:54,555
I want to go back to America, where
people get married without thinking.

1132
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,833
Eccolo ìl camion

1133
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,031
Arresta

1134
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,313
ue?

1135
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,671
- What are they saying?
- They say we stole his truck.

1136
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:26,238
His truck? That's ridiculous.
Tell them I bought it, paid $600 for it

1137
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,718
Yes, we admit it
We stole this truck. It was his Idea.

1138
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,514
I never stole any thing In my life.

1139
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,319
Thais Isn’t the first car he's stolen.

1140
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,632
Tell them that's my car over there.

1141
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,432
He stole that one, too.

1142
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,077
I resent being treated
like a memberof the Mafia.

1143
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,918
He's a member of the Mafia.

1144
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,074
What are they doing?

1145
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,191
Maurice, tell them who I am.

1146
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,359
This Is Robert Talbot
The most wanted criminal In Europe.

1147
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,719
That's right.

1148
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,113
They probably want some money.
Offer them a bribe.

1149
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:22,153
He says you'll never collect
the big reward.

1150
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,077
He's wanted In Rome...
five million lire.

1151
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,916
You know the police
In the big cities.

1152
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:38,079
if they come after him,
they end up with the reward.

1153
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,714
The way to make sure you get it,

1154
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,512
Is to take him to Rome personal.

1156
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,629
- Did you tell them about the money?
- They’re definitely Interested.

1157
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,470
The time I wasted on him.
For the hypocrite, a liar, a fraud.

1158
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,468
You are fortunate. Most women
find it out after they are married.

1159
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:15,518
I'm lucky to get man like Spencer.
He's honest, sincere, sympathetic...

1160
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,950
...err... reliable

1161
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:23,154
Everything Robert Isn't.
But at least Robert did me one favor.

1162
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,113
- He did?
- He asked me to marry him.

1163
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:31,440
He begged me.
And that freed me of him forever.

1164
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,029
Now I know I can be happy with Spencer.

1165
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,352
Where are they taking us?
We've been riding for hours.

1166
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,913
I wish I knew, sir.

1167
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,032
I don't understand it
They act like I'm a criminal.

1168
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,832
I've noticed that, sir.

1169
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,314
Hey

1170
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,758
Metti giù le mani

1171
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,553
Tell him I'd like to
explain everything very carefully.

1172
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,432
Yes, sir.

1173
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,078
He says he Is ready
to make a full confession.

1174
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,715
Now, there's this girl, Lisa Fellini.

1175
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,710
There Is this girl,
Lisa Fellini.

1176
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,559
Tell them she was my house guest.

1177
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,716
She Is his chief accomplice.

1178
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,155
She lives here In Rome,
via Bellaglo, 46.

1179
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,712
She Is hiding out In Rome...
at via Bellaglo, 46.

1180
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,509
We had an argument, a lover's quarrel.
I was trying to keep her from leaving.

1181
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,915
There’s a big reward for her.

1183
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,838
Hey

1184
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,590
If I only had my lawyer here.

1185
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,156
Believe me, what I'm doing for you,
no lawyer could ever do.

1186
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,876
You didn’t see Lisa at her best the other day.
Once you get to know her, you'll love her.

1187
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:11,198
She's a shy, gentle girl.
Very quiet, well-bred and home-loving.

1188
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,311
Lasciatem andare!

1189
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,071
Lasciatem andare!
Sono Innocente! Mascalzoni

1190
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,358
I don't like making snap decisions,
Spencer,

1191
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,199
but do you think
this Is the right girl for you?

1192
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,999
Robert

1193
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,112
Signorina

1194
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,673
There’s this man I met
about eight months ago. Spencer.

1195
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,519
He's been very nice to me and...

1196
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,472
Non lo so.

1197
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,989
I don't want to sue anybody
for false arrest.

1198
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,952
just want to get out of here.

1199
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,870
if there's a plane, a train, a bus, or
jackass leaving this city, get me on it

1200
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,073
- There’s a train leaving for Milan in just about
an hour. - Fine. Get me a taxi.

1201
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:31,829
Let me tell you about Italian women.
They’re not to be trusted.

1202
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,350
- Deceitful, emotionally unstable.
- Doesn't that apply to all the women?

1203
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:38,552
Of course, it does. That's where they've got us.

1204
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,228
Nothing else to replace them with.

1205
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:48,073
- At least you go down to the station and apologise.
- I'll write to them.

1206
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,429
Cafoni

1207
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:52,712
First, You say you don't love me,
spend two nights at a man's villa,

1208
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,876
finally, when you return you're arrested.

1209
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,594
I can't allow this to go on
after we’re married.

1210
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,392
Come along.

1212
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,194
Hello?

1213
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,951
Yes, Maurice.

1214
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,879
I don’t care
what train Mr. Talbot Is taking.

1215
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,514
As long as he takes it

1216
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,029
We don’t want him here In Italy.

1217
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,595
I speak for the government
Goodbye.

1218
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,677
Hello?

1219
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:33,031
Take care of yourself, Maurice. Ciao.

1221
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,200
What are you so happy about?

1222
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,199
- Lisa, I have to talk to you.
- Come In.

1223
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,559
What's wrong?

1224
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,115
He didn't follow me

1225
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:55,552
I'm going home tomorrow and
he doesn’t even have my phone number.

1226
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,194
- I know I'll never see him again.
- Don’t worry.

1227
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:03,076
Lisa, I don't want to lose him. I'm 18,
I may never have another chance.

1228
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,511
- Of course you will.
- No, I'm going to end up like you.

1229
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,395
Marrying the wrong man
and miserable with someone I don't love.

1230
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:14,673
Non sense,
I'm very happy with Spencer.

1231
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,756
Now, listen. Do you know
where the boys were going?

1232
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,191
Yes, but what good Is it?
It's like Mr. Talbot said.

1233
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,676
It's wrong for woman to chase a man.
He won't respect her.

1234
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,998
Forget Mr. Talbot
Listen to him and you'll ruin your life.

1235
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:34,830
But you told me he was right.
You said you were taking his advice.

1236
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,112
Did I? I don't remember.

1237
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,470
Now, where were the boys going?

1238
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,230
Paris. The Deauville Hotel.

1239
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,035
Hotel Deauville In Paris.

1240
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,032
Internazionale prego.

1241
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,356
- You're calling Tony.
- Lisa...

1242
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:58,190
I want the Hotel Deauville In Paris.

1243
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,551
- When they answer, ask for him.
- Do you think I should?

1244
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,398
Of course

1245
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:08,151
It's like fighting a war. If you retreat
and the enemy doesn't follow you,

1246
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,749
you've got to turn around and attack.

1247
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,679
What good Is winning the battle
if you lose the war?

1248
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,950
Aspetta un momen to.

1249
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:19,311
Why be miserable
with someone you don't love?

1250
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:23,354
Betterto be miserable
with someone you do love.

1251
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,318
Hello? Hello.

1252
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,238
Paris.

1253
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,955
Yes, Hotel Deauville.

1254
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,116
Yes, I'll hold on.

1255
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,399
- Miss Fellini. Where...?
- Apartment 2a...

1256
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,478
- Thank you.
- What's she made up for?

1260
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,392
Yes, operator, I'm still holding on.

1261
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,353
Hello? Hello?

1262
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,993
Sandy.

1263
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:33,994
Hi.

1264
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,879
Oh, It's you.

1265
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,277
Remember I told you
we were going to Paris?

1266
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,152
Did you?

1267
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,557
Well, I couldn’t go.
I didn't have your phone number.

1268
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,113
Oh.

1269
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:52,039
I suddenly realized
I might never see you again.

1270
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,395
You don’t care
if you never see me again.

1271
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,831
- I don’t want to hurt your feelings.
- Don't say another word.

1272
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,191
Let's have dinner tonight.
The two of us will sit and talk.

1273
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,153
And maybe get to know each other.

1274
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,351
OK?

1276
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,556
- OK?
- What'll I tell Mario?

1277
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,633
- Who's Mario?
- My date for tonight.

1279
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,158
Oh.

1280
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,635
I see.

1281
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,276
Oh, but I can cancel it

1282
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,198
Will you?

1283
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,710
- I won’t even answer the phone.
- Good.

1284
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,473
Promise. I won’t even touch you.

1285
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,872
Robert

1286
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,309
Robert

1287
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,750
There she Is.
I told you she'd be here.

1288
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,393
Robert

1289
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,749
Lisa

1290
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:40,749
Mi lasci passare.
Un momen to, e che dlavolo!

1291
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,839
Devo parlare con quel signore
che sta prendendo II treno. La prego!

1292
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,554
- Non si può.
- Ho capito, cafone!

1293
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:51,639
Darling, I knew you wouldn't
let me down. My sisters are over there.

1294
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,512
Robert...

1295
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,631
Robert

1296
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,149
I'm here Robert

1297
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:03,591
I'll send you both a wedding present

1298
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,075
Andiamo!

1299
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,599
There you are.

1300
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:10,553
I'll give the fellow credit:
he's a jolly good loser.

1301
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,638
You stop here and don't move.
I'll bring my sisters.

1302
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,669
- Ho detto non si può!
- Ho capito!

1304
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,994
- Ancora lei
- È un padre dl famiglia, mi può capire.

1305
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:47,797
Mi guardi, sola e abandonata con questo
bambino. Il giorno delle nozze.

1306
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,514
E il padre di questo bambino sta
partendo.

1307
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,517
Mascalzone americano!

1308
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,676
- America no?
- America no d'America.

1309
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,155
Se lei non mi fa
passare, quello lì se ne val

1310
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,396
I can't let you leave
without even talking to her.

1311
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,194
She's got that little something extra.

1312
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,393
That little something extra.
This could never happen In England.

1313
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,477
It's this beastly climate.

1314
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,197
- Eccolo!
- È lui?

1315
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:33,029
- Il papà.
- L'americano? Ci penso io.

1316
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,396
Guarda papà.

1318
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:10,558
...nobody's gonna... That's not mine.
I'm gonna leave this country.

1319
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,638
I'm gonna go back to America

1320
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,956
Lisa, tell him I'm not...

1324
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,114
He has done it, again.

1325
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,994
Sir, I thought you were both
on your way to America.

1326
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,714
You've two minutes to get everyone
out of the house.

1327
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,878
I received a letter from Margaret.
She's forgiven me.

1328
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,913
We might even get married.
I needed the money.

1329
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,951
I said Everybody out.

1330
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,833
They’re different, so quiet,
you won't even notice they're around.

1331
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:34,510
All right. If you won't
throw them out I will.

1332
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,837
Are you sure
those two people are married?

1333
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,395
Sister, this time I'm sure.
