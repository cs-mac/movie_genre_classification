1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,722
The Vampire and Lycan
clans had been at war...

2
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,758
... for centuries before
I was born.

3
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,979
Their endless conflict hidden
from the human world.

4
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,941
I was turned by a Vampire.

5
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,798
And given the strength to avenge
my family against the Lycans.

6
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,981
And I was good at it.

7
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:24,325
Then I found Michael Corvin.

8
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:30,540
A human that was turned to
neither Vampire nor Lycan.

9
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:34,340
But a hybrid of the two...

10
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:35,762
... and everything changed.

11
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,717
Allies turned enemies.

12
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:44,654
And the Vampire elders I had
protected for over six centuries...

13
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,381
... now wanted me dead.

14
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,910
We retaliated.

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,346
Killed the elders...

16
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:57,659
... and for a brief moment
of time, we were safe.

17
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:06,118
But then, a new darkness arose.

18
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,840
In the nine days since the first
discovery of the non-human species...

19
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,451
... scores of so-called "covens"
have been uncovered.

20
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,638
Estimates of the number
of infected have skyrocketed.

21
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,616
Military sources confirm
that the primary measures...

22
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:25,178
... of defence against the non-humans
are based on ultraviolet light and silver...

23
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,685
... to which the infected
appear to have fatal sensitivity.

24
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,418
Tents have been posted at every
barricade throughout the city.

25
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,681
A test will be administered
to verify if you're clear of infection.

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,909
Spray her!
Spray her with silver!

27
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,565
- Get it out here!
- Help! Run!

28
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,924
- No, no!
- Run!

29
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,683
We've begun our
second attack wave...

30
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,495
... using ultraviolet and
silver-nitrate munitions...

31
00:02:58,002 --> 00:02:59,671
... which are deadly
to the infected.

32
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,723
Due to the volatile situation...

33
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,152
... martial law was declared
two hours ago.

34
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,832
Many of us have lost
loved ones to this.

35
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,049
Please know that you cannot
help them or yourself.

36
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:23,144
It's shocking discovery that not
one, but two distinct species...

37
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:26,472
... may have been coexisting
within human populations.

38
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,584
The existence of Vampires
and Werewolves...

39
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,253
... now appear to have
actual basis in fact.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,782
The city remains reluctant
to share any new information.

41
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:38,503
But we are getting reports on what
appears to be a mass cleansing.

42
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,495
Fire!

43
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,856
Get back!
No cameras!

44
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,267
There's no cure.

45
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,690
There it is!
Contact.

46
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,292
Engage contact!

47
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:54,784
Man down!

48
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,019
- Man down!
- Cover me! Cover me!

49
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,748
The Purge.

50
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:36,209
Human beings no longer
kill each other.

51
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,213
We are the enemy
they've been waiting for.

52
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,026
Escape has become
our only chance of survival.

53
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:49,698
Therefore, Michael and I
are leaving tonight.

54
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:54,903
Halt!

55
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,083
Delta 6 in pursuit!

56
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,398
Stop!
Get down on the ground!

57
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:05,899
She'll be here any minute.

58
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,834
- You be ready to go.
- Better hurry.

59
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,141
Tango Unit moving into position.

60
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,145
We have the hybrid in sight.

61
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,555
Hold your fire.
Leave this one alive.

62
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,696
Delta in position.

63
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:28,822
- Watch your flank.
- Secure.

64
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,217
- Move, move, move!
- Alpha Unit in position.

65
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,639
Arming silver grenade!

66
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,542
Michael!

67
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,960
Fire!

68
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,592
- Move in!
- Alpha 4, move in.

69
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,751
Grenades, fire!

70
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,227
Retrieve the bodies.

71
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,541
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

72
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:06,586
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

73
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:10,674
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

74
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:14,720
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

75
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:18,794
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

76
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:22,536
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

77
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,747
Defrost sequence initiated.

78
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:28,942
Lowering compression
in Subject 1 cryo-chamber.

79
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,843
Defrost sequence complete.

80
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,593
- Subject 2! Get it!
- Over there by the chamber!

81
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,172
Don't let it get away!

82
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,810
Security violation, Level 6.

83
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:47,512
All containment personnel
to Level 6.

84
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:08,662
Jacob.

85
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,011
Subject 2 escaped.
It's somewhere in the building.

86
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,882
We've got Subject 1
in full lockdown.

87
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:19,219
- Give me the status.
- Subject 1 has broken free.

88
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,748
- We need to flash-burn immediately.
- No, wait. Let me see.

89
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:24,850
Open it.

90
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,320
Put it back to sleep.

91
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,990
Hurry.

92
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,579
Releasing maximum dose
of fentanyl.

93
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,077
What is this place?

94
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,847
Where is Michael?

95
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:17,402
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

96
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:36,472
All non-security personnel
clear the building!

97
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,815
Security command, outside now!

98
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,639
- There she is!
- Stop!

99
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,060
Don't move!

100
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,184
Multiple casualties on Level 6!
Medical to alert status!

101
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,999
Prepare for full containment
on Level 6!

102
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,436
I repeat, full containment
on Level 6!

103
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,858
I see her.
East corridor. Send security.

104
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,886
No. Let her go.
She can lead us to Subject 2.

105
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:33,895
No, don't shoot!

106
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:35,972
Let her go.

107
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,095
Attention, all units.

108
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:10,198
Subject 1 and Subject 2
have escaped the perimeter...

109
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:12,935
... and are no longer
under Antigen control.

110
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:16,955
Secure the outer gates and use
extreme caution upon encounter.

111
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:20,420
Report immediately
upon coming into contact.

112
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:58,415
Hey, how did you get in there?

113
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,834
You're not allowed in here.

114
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,128
The pier is closed.

115
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:05,047
Since when?

116
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,283
A long time ago.
Come on.

117
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:10,794
How long?

118
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:14,932
About 12 years ago.

119
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,418
Since the cleansing.
Why?

120
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,395
You okay, ma'am?

121
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,497
Attention, all units,
code three call.

122
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:25,759
Receiving a report of an assault,
Exit 39 underpass.

123
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,238
Possible non-human aggressor.
Proceed with caution.

124
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:32,591
CDC already en route.
All area units respond.

125
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,079
Ma'am?
Hey!

126
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,413
Ma'am?

127
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,478
- What are you doing over there?
- Stay right there! Don't move!

128
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:11,613
- Identify yourself!
- Get back here right now!

129
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,385
Whoever it is, they couldn't
have made it very far.

130
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:36,430
I'll alert CDC to keep an eye out.
They're en route.

131
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,600
- There's no way this attack was human.
- You don't know that.

132
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:42,352
Don't know what?

133
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,783
The guy is shredded. His throat
was found over in the gutter.

134
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,481
Just let me handle it.

135
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:49,151
What's to handle?
This has Lycan written all over it.

136
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:53,655
Detective, when was the last time you
heard about a reported Lycan killing?

137
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,824
A couple of years ago.

138
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,527
How many years have you
been with this department?

139
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,159
What do you mean?
I've been here for three months.

140
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:02,372
Exactly.

141
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,001
You question me less
until you know a bit more.

142
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:08,420
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

143
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,275
Detective Sebastian.

144
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,144
Detective, we've just
received a report.

145
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,512
There's been a disturbance
at Antigen Labs.

146
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,466
A witness says there
may have been an escape.

147
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,816
They said someone jumped
out of a window.

148
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:26,188
This is a priority investigation.
We need you over there asap.

149
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:27,756
We're on our way.

150
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:30,375
Hey, let's go.
Johnson, you're the lead.

151
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:32,194
You got it, detective.
Will do.

152
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,003
Who's in charge?

153
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:55,884
There's a Detective Sebastian
here to see you, sir.

154
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:59,313
Where is he?

155
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,723
In the lobby, sir.

156
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:08,814
You'll be relieved to know that
the situation is well under control.

157
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,456
- What happened?
- I repeat, well under control.

158
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,251
I repeat, what happened?

159
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:16,989
Ah yes, there are reports
to be filed.

160
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,886
One of our test subjects
attempted to escape.

161
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,286
We were forced to put it down.

162
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:25,188
- So nothing got out?
- Only a stray bullet.

163
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,874
- And the test subject?
- Flash-burned.

164
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,284
Will that be all?

165
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:32,145
A few things to attend to.
You could imagine.

166
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:34,523
Doctor, we received
an anonymous call...

167
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,925
... that something else
escaped through a window.

168
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:41,987
Detective, our mission at Antigen is to
develop ways of preventing infection...

169
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,950
... not releasing it
into the general population.

170
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:48,003
I lost my son to this disease.

171
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,348
There's no room
for error with me...

172
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,448
... when it comes to
the safety of the public.

173
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,101
If something had escaped...

174
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,445
... the authorities
would have been notified.

175
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:58,438
You are an authority,
are you not?

176
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,050
Now, if you'll excuse me.

177
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,977
The guy in charge says it's nothing.
Let's go.

178
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,080
Yeah, and he's full of shit.
Look at this.

179
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:36,835
- Want me to report it, sir?
- No, I'll do it.

180
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:39,001
I don't mind.
I can do it for you.

181
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,991
All right, sir.

182
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,286
The prisoner that helped me escape,
the one you called Subject 2...

183
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:13,021
... was it a hybrid?

184
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:17,192
- Yes.
- What were you doing with us?

185
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,578
We...

186
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,864
... we help the government
identify the infected.

187
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,801
We were using your DNA
to try to find a cure...

188
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:28,161
... to prevent another outbreak.

189
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:32,073
You were told that I would lead
you to the hybrid. Why?

190
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,419
Subject 2 is restricted information.

191
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:37,212
I don't have the clearance.

192
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:39,339
You're lying.

193
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:41,758
No!

194
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,511
No, please!

195
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,722
All I know is there's some kind
of connection between you two.

196
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:51,893
Your brain waves fall into sync
whenever you're close to each other.

197
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,912
You can see through
each other's eyes!

198
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:58,292
Please don't!
I'm the one who let you go!

199
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,305
Now we're even.

200
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,728
What the hell was that?

201
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,105
Creepy is what.

202
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,924
- I'm calling it in.
- Let's go.

203
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:29,124
Shit.

204
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:40,127
Don't.

205
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:41,378
Why not?

206
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:43,227
We're the same.

207
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,302
Why are you following me?

208
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,478
We monitor
the police frequencies.

209
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:51,788
"We"?

210
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,850
Do you know what attacked that
human back there, under the bridge?

211
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:56,877
No.

212
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,815
Lycans.

213
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,391
What remains of them, yes.

214
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:08,947
They've been hiding down here
like rats ever since the Purge.

215
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:12,567
Diseased and starving, they rarely
show themselves above ground.

216
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:15,587
Which means that something
has got them riled up.

217
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:18,640
Something you're not telling me.

218
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,282
Michael!

219
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:19,751
Do you know her?

220
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:21,270
No.

221
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:29,444
They will come back in numbers.

222
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:32,638
We can't leave her here.

223
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:38,650
Come on.

224
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,259
Let's try the van.

225
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,391
Get in.
Move! Move!

226
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,719
There are three
of them behind us.

227
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:31,416
Go!

228
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,214
Hurry, Selene!
They're getting in the back!

229
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,115
Fucking piece of shit!

230
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,982
The girl!
They're taking her!

231
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:32,711
You drive.

232
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:20,901
She's not healing.

233
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:23,937
We have a doctor that can
help her, at our coven.

234
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:27,224
How did you find me?

235
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,894
What's your name?

236
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:33,355
Subject 2...

237
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:36,316
... and you are Subject 1.

238
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:39,319
I freed you.

239
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,657
Do you not know who I am?

240
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:50,247
They told me that I had no mother,
that she died when I was born.

241
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:53,875
I never believed it.
I...

242
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,586
... I felt you.

243
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:59,006
Saw images through your eyes.

244
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,317
But then someone
outside my door...

245
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:07,556
... they said since I was no longer
a child, the wait was over...

246
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,051
... that I'd be dead soon.

247
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:14,596
And that my own mother,
right next door...

248
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:17,608
... would never
even know I'd existed.

249
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:21,737
What did they tell you
of your father?

250
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:24,573
They must have
told you something.

251
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,493
- Do you see images through him?
- No.

252
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,245
Only you.

253
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,184
No, please!

254
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,265
She's never stepped foot
outside the lab.

255
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,934
How can she possibly survive?

256
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,103
I understand the risk of reporting
her escape to the authorities.

257
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,396
There's no record of her birth.

258
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,899
So questions will be asked.
I'm well aware of that.

259
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,301
But if she dies, all our years
of research will be...

260
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:02,945
Rather than tell me
how to do my job...

261
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:06,114
... why not take a look at your
own professional conduct?

262
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:09,051
And how your continual need
to endow this creature...

263
00:30:09,117 --> 00:30:13,121
... with human traits has led to
the laxness of its security protocols.

264
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:15,758
It's not a human being, Lida!
It's not your child.

265
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:19,561
It's not to be coddled and pitied.
It's a blight of nature.

266
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:25,525
Stop worrying.
It'll come back to us.

267
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,670
Get Olivia at once.

268
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:07,235
Again you break my rules.
Why?

269
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:09,529
She was attacked.

270
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,114
She is not healing.

271
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:13,700
And for this you
compromise our safety?

272
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:16,912
You have no reason to fear us.

273
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:22,017
Do you think I'm foolish enough
to take you at your word?

274
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:27,356
No reason to fear a Death Dealer
who fell in love with a Lycan?

275
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:29,666
Who murdered
two of our elders?

276
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:33,488
And who, at every turn,
has betrayed her own kind?

277
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:37,507
Do you know who this is?

278
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,343
Yes.

279
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:43,981
But it was we
who betrayed her, Father.

280
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,025
Let her through.

281
00:32:49,444 --> 00:32:50,904
She's not healing.

282
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,875
She was attacked
by a lower Lycan.

283
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,752
Two hours ago.

284
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:14,002
Her cell repair is active,
but weakened.

285
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:21,401
She has no origin bite marks...

286
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,228
... or scars.

287
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:27,090
I've never seen
a child like this before.

288
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,985
When did you last feed?

289
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,653
Feed?

290
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,615
Give her blood.

291
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:45,697
Child, you must.

292
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:05,020
Slowly.

293
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:07,189
Slowly.

294
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:11,026
There.

295
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:13,862
There, now.

296
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:19,518
She's healing.

297
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:23,788
- And quickly.
- Good.

298
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,700
Take her to my room.
She needs to rest.

299
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:26,708
No.

300
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:29,778
Look at the eyes.

301
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,767
I never believed it.
They do exist.

302
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:50,107
- This is not one of us.
- No, it's something more, Father.

303
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,695
What do you know of her?

304
00:34:57,281 --> 00:35:00,158
I was held captive
at a place called Antigen.

305
00:35:01,303 --> 00:35:03,796
One of the other
prisoners freed me.

306
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:06,415
I believed it was Michael Corvin...

307
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:09,084
... the only hybrid I knew
existed at that time.

308
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:11,395
Yes, yes, your Lycan lover,
long dead.

309
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:13,290
What is this, then?

310
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:16,466
None of your concern.

311
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:20,130
As soon as she regains her
strength, I will leave with her.

312
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,011
I used to hear stories
of the Death Dealers.

313
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:07,893
That they were a thing of the past,
never to return.

314
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:11,146
I'm glad they were wrong.

315
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:14,850
You knew who I am...

316
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,880
... and yet you still
brought me here.

317
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,683
Thank you.

318
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,743
You're a fighter.

319
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:27,621
We could use more
like you to teach us.

320
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,123
I'm not sure your father
would agree.

321
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,882
There was a time
when he would have.

322
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,002
That's why he dislikes you
so much, I think it...

323
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:38,423
... it reminds him of the days when
he defended us with fire and steel...

324
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,135
... rather than hollow words.
He knows how much we need you.

325
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,182
- I'm not a leader.
- But you fight for what you believe in.

326
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:49,000
You always have.

327
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:51,436
I don't know what
I believe in anymore.

328
00:36:51,603 --> 00:36:54,147
I don't recognise this world.

329
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,191
But you haven't changed.

330
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,461
I saw it in your eyes
when you looked at the child.

331
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,781
You will protect her.

332
00:37:02,948 --> 00:37:05,993
It's in your blood.
It's who you are.

333
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:10,038
When you leave,
take me with you.

334
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:16,396
You distrust me.

335
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:26,114
Of course you do.
I made you feel unwelcome.

336
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,367
And for that, I'm sorry.

337
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:37,459
Those eyes... they're special.

338
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,839
I know exactly what you are.

339
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:58,186
My father says that should
we survive as a species...

340
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:00,573
... these relics will help
our descendants know...

341
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,484
... who we were
and how we lived.

342
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:04,278
And what do you say?

343
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:06,822
That if we continue to live
as we do now...

344
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:09,825
... then we disgrace the past
and don't deserve a future.

345
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:12,527
We must resist the humans...

346
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:15,055
... wherever and
whenever possible.

347
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,591
Between the first
and second Purges...

348
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,771
... Lycan youth rallied in the same way
against the prudence of their elders.

349
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:26,383
Their calls for violent action
carried the day.

350
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,051
The result?

351
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,096
The Werewolves are nearly extinct.

352
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:34,975
Is that what you wish for us,
extinction?

353
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:38,327
Yet you bring her offspring
into our home.

354
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:42,316
Do you honestly believe the humans
will allow her to remain free?

355
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:44,668
They will hunt her down
at any expense.

356
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:47,654
- Then we can help protect them.
- Protect them?

357
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:51,867
- They leave tonight.
- This isn't prudence.

358
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,910
This is cowardice,
plain and simple.

359
00:39:55,912 --> 00:39:57,989
How dare you?

360
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,508
How dare you...

361
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:02,744
... do so little?

362
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:36,303
I dreamt of the day
we would meet.

363
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:41,375
Like a silly little girl.

364
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:50,509
You're as cold
as one already dead.

365
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:59,393
Yesterday, I was with your father.

366
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:05,857
He was only a little further away
from me than you are now.

367
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,903
I went to sleep.

368
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:13,907
And when I awoke
the next day...

369
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:17,402
... I learned that overnight...

370
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:20,622
... 12 years had passed.

371
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:25,560
And instead of the only man
I've ever loved...

372
00:41:26,878 --> 00:41:29,398
... there stood a girl
with his eyes.

373
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:36,179
My heart is not cold.

374
00:41:36,346 --> 00:41:38,015
It's broken.

375
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,854
I'm so sorry.

376
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,532
What is it?

377
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:58,827
They're here.

378
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:02,372
Stay here.
Wait for me.

379
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:03,999
No, take me with you.

380
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:05,334
Please.

381
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,837
I won't let anyone hurt you.
I promise.

382
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,047
Lock the door.

383
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:14,134
Everybody to the shelter.
Now!

384
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:17,054
No!

385
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,181
Prepare the armoury.

386
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,433
Do as I say!
Go, go!

387
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:24,853
Pay heed to me!

388
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,250
No!
We stand and we fight.

389
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,541
No!
Have you no sense?

390
00:42:50,496 --> 00:42:51,913
Stop this now!

391
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:56,418
We lived safely for years and now
you brought humans into this coven.

392
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:59,588
They want the girl and they will
stop at nothing to get her back.

393
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:02,492
This day was bound to come,
with or without us.

394
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,285
Let's move!
Munitions, let's go! Everyone!

395
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:06,603
Are you mad?

396
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,665
We have no more than a handful
of fighters. We will be annihilated!

397
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:12,484
And what's your plan, Father?

398
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:14,236
Let's go!
Now!

399
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:18,407
- Where are you going?
- To get her away from here.

400
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,285
Your father's right.
I shouldn't have come.

401
00:43:20,323 --> 00:43:22,585
- He doesn't understand how we...
- The humans will follow us out.

402
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:24,296
We just need to
hold them off till then.

403
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:26,515
They're only here for her.

404
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:29,518
She's more powerful
than any of us...

405
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,353
... and they fear the day
she discovers it.

406
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:34,131
I have to get her out of here.

407
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:13,754
Lycan!

408
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:19,276
Silver ammunition!

409
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:20,277
Now!

410
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:23,847
Defend the second rotunda!
Move! Move!

411
00:45:08,141 --> 00:45:09,518
Open the door!

412
00:45:11,603 --> 00:45:12,484
Let's go.

413
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:37,671
Move!
Move!

414
00:46:18,086 --> 00:46:19,338
We need to go.

415
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:46,214
What the hell was that?

416
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,787
- Take her somewhere safe.
- No.

417
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:53,413
Take her.
Go.

418
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:36,827
Where is she?

419
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:38,787
They took her.

420
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:41,923
They accepted her.

421
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,519
As a gift from me.

422
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,001
Do you even know
what you've done?

423
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:29,087
Do you have any idea?

424
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:31,506
What would you
have had me do?

425
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:35,969
Fight to the last to protect the
very one who brought this upon us?

426
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:37,712
We're defeated.

427
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:41,858
Our coven is destroyed.
My son is dead.

428
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:43,644
Because of you.

429
00:50:44,728 --> 00:50:45,896
Why?

430
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:50,609
Because he helped
that child of yours.

431
00:50:50,776 --> 00:50:52,861
If they kill her, so be it.

432
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:56,765
Your son died because
he was fighting for all of you.

433
00:50:57,533 --> 00:51:00,302
Because he knew that running
is not survival.

434
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:03,564
Those were Lycans.

435
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,917
Not extinct.
More powerful than ever.

436
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:10,812
That thing was more than twice
the size of any Lycan I've ever seen.

437
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:13,391
They risked showing themselves...

438
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:17,177
... after more than a decade
in hiding because of her.

439
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,738
And you handed her
over to them.

440
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:26,728
She is the last direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus.

441
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:30,607
The only hybrid child
that has ever existed.

442
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:35,587
Whatever it is the Lycans
want from her...

443
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,865
... your son knew
it was worth dying for.

444
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:46,824
What are you doing?

445
00:52:16,612 --> 00:52:17,946
David...

446
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:33,830
A force of two dozen Lycans...

447
00:53:33,897 --> 00:53:37,067
... attacked and destroyed
one of our covens last night.

448
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:40,320
You're not surprised.

449
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:44,666
You knew the Lycans
were not extinct.

450
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,244
- How?
- Just a feeling.

451
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:49,655
I'm not good with feelings.

452
00:53:49,671 --> 00:53:51,707
I want to know how.

453
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:54,126
This is not the place for this.

454
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,378
And you're not gonna kill me.

455
00:53:56,545 --> 00:53:58,839
- Really?
- No.

456
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:01,300
Because you wouldn't need
a fucking gun to do it.

457
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,287
A few years ago...

458
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:08,223
... the government declared
"mission accomplished" on all Lycans.

459
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:12,437
The feds announced that we were
to only focus on your kind now.

460
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,939
Three months ago,
a friend of mine sent me this.

461
00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:21,061
It arrived two days after he was found
hanging from his own ceiling fan.

462
00:54:23,405 --> 00:54:25,632
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.

463
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,142
Every case was investigated.

464
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,128
Every blood test
came back negative.

465
00:54:29,169 --> 00:54:31,138
So my friend began to wonder...

466
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:34,626
... "Were they all false leads or was
someone trying to protect the Lycans?"

467
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,580
Helping them replenish
their packs, letting them regroup.

468
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:40,589
What about your own department?

469
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:47,189
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.

470
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:50,860
If you're protecting someone,
I don't care.

471
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:53,160
I'm not after them, I just want her.

472
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:54,645
No.

473
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:57,324
Even if there are others
in my department...

474
00:54:57,445 --> 00:54:59,524
... they won't have the authority.

475
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:01,501
This goes much higher.

476
00:55:02,152 --> 00:55:04,404
I believe all the way to the top.

477
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:08,984
- Or to the bottom.
- What do you mean?

478
00:55:09,868 --> 00:55:11,895
Who administers the tests?

479
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:16,250
We're a bit short on time,
so if you please, take a look at these.

480
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,728
This schedule will take you from
the moment we adjourn today...

481
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:22,214
... straight through to the final
manufacture of the vaccine.

482
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:27,636
If we stick to this plan, inoculations
should begin within three months.

483
00:55:27,803 --> 00:55:29,738
Any questions, now's the time.

484
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:31,058
Because after today's surgery...

485
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,158
... there will be no
communication between us...

486
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:35,477
... until we meet up again
in the inoculation centre.

487
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:38,605
Doctor, in terms
of your test subject...

488
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:41,583
... he continues to demonstrate
immunity to silver?

489
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,985
Absolutely.

490
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:47,572
And additional inoculations,
administered only as a precaution...

491
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:49,925
... have triggered side effects
we never imagined.

492
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,845
Vast increases in strength,
muscle mass...

493
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:56,985
... self-healing, stamina.

494
00:55:59,084 --> 00:56:00,819
You said she was essential
to our research.

495
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:04,072
- Yes, and will continue to be.
- How?

496
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:06,049
By vivisecting her?

497
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:08,318
You weren't meant to have that.

498
00:56:08,385 --> 00:56:14,049
I cared for this little girl all these
years, and you expect me to sit by...

499
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:17,352
- ... while you...
- Harvest its genetic material?

500
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:20,214
I expect nothing from you.

501
00:56:21,273 --> 00:56:23,025
I hired you to look after it...

502
00:56:23,191 --> 00:56:26,528
... and for the most part,
you did an excellent job.

503
00:56:26,737 --> 00:56:29,064
Saving the lives of thousands.

504
00:56:29,906 --> 00:56:31,908
What are you talking about?

505
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:34,886
An entire species
saved from extinction.

506
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,768
Jacob...

507
00:57:26,588 --> 00:57:30,592
After today, you won't have to
wait so long between injections.

508
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:33,262
Are you sure she's ready?

509
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:35,180
Oestrogen levels high...

510
00:57:35,347 --> 00:57:38,433
... intervals between menses
holding steady.

511
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:40,502
It's come of age.

512
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:44,631
Everything's worked out
just as we'd hoped.

513
00:57:48,652 --> 00:57:50,624
You're the first proof of it.

514
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:54,201
I'm proud of you, son.

515
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:00,789
Now that it's with us again...

516
00:58:00,956 --> 00:58:04,126
... we'll have all the genetic material
we need, ready for cloning.

517
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:07,796
Enough to produce
an endless supply of vaccine.

518
00:58:08,964 --> 00:58:10,240
Imagine...

519
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:13,260
... our species immune to silver.

520
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:14,995
No more hiding.

521
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:18,824
Every Lycan under our command
as powerful as you are.

522
00:58:19,558 --> 00:58:22,144
I've even begun injecting myself.

523
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:25,397
I only wish Mother
were here to see it.

524
00:58:26,148 --> 00:58:28,609
Your mother chose to
remain human.

525
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,246
She abandoned us.

526
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:36,250
Remember that.

527
00:58:50,505 --> 00:58:52,120
Of course, Father.

528
00:58:59,348 --> 00:59:00,785
Look, if you're right
about Antigen...

529
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:04,169
... who knows how many Lycans
will there be hiding in there?

530
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:07,456
The second you step foot inside,
you're gonna be surrounded.

531
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:08,707
I'm hoping so.

532
00:59:10,593 --> 00:59:12,803
I know you want her back.
I can help you.

533
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,098
- Why?
- Just tell me what your plan is.

534
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,991
It's worse if you try to fight it.

535
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,310
Trust me.

536
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:51,984
So how is it you're actually able
to survive in the sunlight?

537
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:55,529
It was a gift.

538
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,773
From a man named
Alexander Corvinus.

539
00:59:59,574 --> 01:00:01,051
The founding father.

540
01:00:04,713 --> 01:00:07,416
I used to be married, to a nurse.

541
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:11,428
One day at work, she was bitten.

542
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:17,292
Nobody knew but us.
We lived like that for a few years.

543
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:20,829
Then came the Purge.

544
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:24,043
The feds were conducting
door-to-doors...

545
01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:26,243
... and when they
knocked on ours...

546
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:35,068
Well, she... she told me
she loved me and uh...

547
01:00:36,445 --> 01:00:38,697
... and she let the sunlight in.

548
01:00:40,032 --> 01:00:42,034
I had to watch her burn.

549
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:05,182
Okay.

550
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:09,102
You got me?

551
01:01:09,728 --> 01:01:10,921
Yes.

552
01:01:12,105 --> 01:01:13,482
Good luck.

553
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,783
- Shit. It's her.
- In daylight?

554
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,541
- It's her! Go!
- Okay.

555
01:02:02,906 --> 01:02:05,125
- Wait for my cue.
- I'm ready.

556
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:14,376
Ops Code A. Repeat, Ops Code A.
Breach on Level 1.

557
01:02:14,543 --> 01:02:16,378
Intruder ascending in Elevator 4.

558
01:02:16,545 --> 01:02:19,257
I want all levels secured
ready on that elevator now!

559
01:02:23,218 --> 01:02:24,986
- Anaesthesia ready?
- Yes, sir.

560
01:02:25,053 --> 01:02:25,929
Good.

561
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,038
Security units on alert.

562
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:54,016
Ops Code A.
Intruder on premises.

563
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:55,410
Secure the east wing.

564
01:02:55,577 --> 01:02:57,883
All units, intruder's ascending
in the elevator.

565
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,096
Come on.

566
01:02:59,896 --> 01:03:01,006
Let's go.

567
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:21,126
Move!

568
01:03:38,293 --> 01:03:39,736
There's your cue.

569
01:03:40,003 --> 01:03:41,129
Copy.

570
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:14,096
They're using silver-nitrate gas.
Bombs on all the floors.

571
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:18,292
It's Subject 1.
We need to evacuate.

572
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:19,835
Fine.

573
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:21,753
Start a propofol infusion.

574
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,766
We're not cancelling
this procedure, understood?

575
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,966
We're moving it.

576
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:28,719
You find her...

577
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:30,971
... and you destroy her.

578
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,639
With pleasure.

579
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:47,229
I'm here.

580
01:04:47,395 --> 01:04:49,898
I got movement on a van
in Parking Level 3.

581
01:04:50,065 --> 01:04:51,466
No sign of the girl.

582
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:54,870
They'll be on the move.
Just don't lose them.

583
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:01,168
She's in the service elevator.

584
01:05:03,045 --> 01:05:04,021
Get her.

585
01:05:04,129 --> 01:05:05,047
I'm coming down.

586
01:05:27,986 --> 01:05:30,656
Selene.
Selene!

587
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:34,117
They're heading
for Parking Level 2.

588
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,955
Selene.

589
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:39,998
Selene, I need to know
where you are!

590
01:05:51,093 --> 01:05:51,980
Oh, shit!

591
01:06:06,817 --> 01:06:09,669
Do you copy?
Selene, where are you?

592
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:41,343
I see her.
I see her.

593
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:42,828
Parking Level 2.

594
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:45,200
They're loading your daughter
into the van.

595
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:47,374
Selene, where are you?

596
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,111
Fuck it.

597
01:06:54,573 --> 01:06:57,418
Hold it right there!
Stop! Stop now!

598
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:11,673
- Michael?
- Get her!

599
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:25,370
Selene, Lane has her in the van.

600
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:27,522
They're on the move.
Where are you?

601
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:29,628
They are leaving with her!
Do you hear me?

602
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:33,153
I'm on my way.

603
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:03,051
Come on, faster.

604
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:23,827
Don't stop.
Hit him!

605
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,110
Selene, they're heading
for Parking Level 1.

606
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:58,632
Selene, they're getting away
on Parking Level 1. Do you copy?

607
01:09:59,024 --> 01:10:00,309
I'm coming.

608
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:24,533
Everything okay?

609
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,703
Levels are holding stable, sir.
Baseline vitals...

610
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:10,931
Fuck you.

611
01:12:54,224 --> 01:12:55,325
Get away from her!

612
01:14:54,845 --> 01:14:57,097
It's worse if you try to fight it.

613
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:01,715
Trust me.

614
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:02,037
I heal instantly.

615
01:16:02,287 --> 01:16:03,372
I'm counting on it.

616
01:17:02,306 --> 01:17:04,308
You came back for me.

617
01:17:08,812 --> 01:17:10,439
I said I would.

618
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:12,829
Selene.

619
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:17,926
You should go.

620
01:17:20,574 --> 01:17:22,676
There's a safe house
not far from here.

621
01:17:22,723 --> 01:17:26,880
Go. I'll send them on a different
path, buy you some time.

622
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:29,666
Thank you.
Come on.

623
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,093
David.

624
01:17:33,712 --> 01:17:35,164
Are we going back in?

625
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:36,765
We are.

626
01:17:54,733 --> 01:17:55,876
What is it?

627
01:17:57,319 --> 01:17:58,253
Michael?

628
01:18:00,364 --> 01:18:01,655
The roof.

629
01:18:07,829 --> 01:18:12,209
Though the world has changed,
our enemy remains the same.

630
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:15,170
The Lycans will rebuild...

631
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:18,682
... and will hunt for her father
as they did for her.

632
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:22,678
But as they grow stronger...

633
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:24,680
... so will we.

634
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:29,184
The Vampire coven will
not only survive this world...

635
01:18:29,851 --> 01:18:31,770
... we will reclaim it.
