1
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,621
Hi, Leonard!
How are you doing?

2
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,550
Heh heh heh heh!
Ha ha!

3
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,761
Ricardo, I see you're feeling
better. Good for you.

4
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,233
(Children laughing)

5
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,600
Hey, father cliff.

6
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,136
Hello, Victor, boys.

7
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,366
What's the story on Roger?

8
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,774
Is he getting
booted out of here?

9
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,984
I hope not.

10
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,179
But he's a bad kid.

11
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,251
You weren't exactly
a Saint when you first
got here, were you?

12
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,648
Lest we forget.

13
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,253
(Laughs)

14
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,845
Got me there.

15
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,186
Ha ha ha!

16
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,661
Ha ha ha ha!

17
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,734
Good-bye, boys.

18
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,928
<i>¶ ...was a little,</i>
<i>little man</i>

19
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,403
<i>¶ and a little, little man</i>
<i>was he</i>

20
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,902
<i>¶ he climbed up</i>
<i>to a sycamore... ¶</i>

21
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,737
uh!

22
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,436
Who's...

23
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,283
I say, who's throwing...

24
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,451
Ow!

25
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,579
Ow!

26
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,551
Father Clifford.

27
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,623
What are you doing, Roger?

28
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,562
Are you running away?

29
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,857
Who, me?

30
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,728
No, no.
What would make
you think that?

31
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,058
I just,
uh... I lost
my balance

32
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,863
while cleaning
my outside
windows.

33
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,196
Cleaning your windows
with a suitcase, were you?

34
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,598
Oh, Roger!

35
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,906
Oh!

36
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,137
Roger!

37
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,207
My heart...

38
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,512
It hurts.

39
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,577
Whoa...

40
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,812
(Thud)

41
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,786
Oh, no!

42
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,247
Oh, look who's recovered!

43
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,655
Let go of me!

44
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,657
Now, now, now, what
seems to be the problem?

45
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,158
(Crying) Oh...

46
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,801
Now, now, now, now, now...

47
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,767
(Roger) Whenever there's
something I
really, really want,

48
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:09,443
there's always some adult
who comes along
and says, "no,"

49
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,113
like Mr. byrne.

50
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,981
First he said I could be
on the basketball team,

51
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,911
then he said I couldn't.

52
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,616
You thought
blowing up
the gymnasium

53
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,848
was an appropriate response?

54
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,623
Yes.

55
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,992
But your parents
told Mr. byrne

56
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,431
they didn't want
you playing any
contact sports.

57
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,898
My parents say no
to everything I want.

58
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:35,166
The other boys
are very angry
at you, Roger.

59
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,296
I don't care what they think.

60
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,365
Then why are you running away?

61
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,183
What's your IQ, son?

62
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,778
185.

63
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,749
Ah! My, you're
a real genius.

64
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,619
Mine's 190.

65
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,377
Oh, wait. I forgot.

66
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,723
Mine is 195.

67
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,323
Oh, wait.
I forgot.

68
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,785
Mine is almost 200,

69
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,734
but that's
not really
the point.

70
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,030
The point
is that people
like you and I,

71
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,233
when we get very frustrated,

72
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,566
can cause a lot of damage.

73
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,206
You're not like me.

74
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,039
Why? Because I'm
all grown-up?

75
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,475
That's true.
I've changed,

76
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,551
but when I was your age...

77
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,317
Ooh! I...

78
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,858
Let me tell you
a story about when
I was your age.

79
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,428
I was traveling
with my parents
to the island of Hawaii.

80
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,209
Weather conditions seem
vastly improved, steffen.

81
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,038
I think now
we can safely proceed

82
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,243
with the scheduled lift-off.

83
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,633
Splashdown!

84
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,196
Would you please
stop hitting
my chair?

85
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,799
I am trying to sleep.

86
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,771
I'm sorry,
miss nice-older-person,

87
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,739
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

88
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,238
Perhaps you were
just having a nightmare

89
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,969
about your early days
in the circus.

90
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,044
One more word,
I'll call the flight
attendant.

91
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,948
It wasn't very nice
of the mean old lady

92
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,419
to smash your collar-bone,
was it, steffen?

93
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,578
Ladies and gentlemen,

94
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,586
we'll be passing
over Los Angeles

95
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,988
in about 10 minutes.

96
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,460
The skies are crystal clear.

97
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,359
It should be smooth sailing
all the way to Honolulu.

98
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,304
(Yells)

99
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,666
Damn it! Clifford,
why did you wake me?

100
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,776
I didn't.
Steffen did.

101
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,948
Why wouldn't you let him sleep?

102
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,107
Now that
you are awake,
my papa,

103
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,816
when we land in Los Angeles,

104
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,988
can we then
immediately go
to dinosaur world?

105
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,257
I've told you,
the plane doesn't
go to Los Angeles.

106
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,317
It goes directly to Honolulu.

107
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,330
How can that be?

108
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,488
What?

109
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,626
That on my birthday,

110
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:21,031
I can be so close
to dinosaur world
and yet so far away?

111
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,374
Your birthday
was six months ago.

112
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,471
Clifford,

113
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,612
daddy is on a business...

114
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,468
A business trip,

115
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,876
and this is not a vacation.

116
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,679
Drop this
dinosaur world thing
for five seconds.

117
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,651
Would you do that for me?

118
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,550
You're driving me crazy!

119
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,993
Looks like daddy
is going to have
a big stroke,

120
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,489
and then he'll be
talking like this.

121
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,361
I swear to God...
Clifford!

122
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,631
Would you just stop?

123
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,260
Whatever you say,
sweet one
who birthed me.

124
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,872
May I visit the captain?

125
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,910
I imagine
he would be very
brave and wise,

126
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,967
possibly with
a cleft in his chin.

127
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,511
All right.
Just be back
for dinner.

128
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,253
Whatever you say, my papa.

129
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,520
Ow! Ow! Ow!

130
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,978
Oh, God! Ow!

131
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,667
Captain, we have
a young man here
who has a request.

132
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,095
Hi. What's
your name, son?

133
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,703
Clifford.

134
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,235
I think you're
the bestest captain in
the whole wide world,

135
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,512
thank... you, Clifford.

136
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,382
I was wondering
if we could land
in Los Angeles

137
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,551
so I could go
to dinosaur world.

138
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,720
The only way
we could land
in Los Angeles

139
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,119
would be for an emergency.

140
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,821
Whatever you say, my captain.

141
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,627
Jeez, it's awful quiet in here.

142
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,527
Where's Clifford?

143
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,737
He shut the engines down.

144
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,739
I don't know why
steffen did that.

145
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,482
Are you out of your tree, sir?

146
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,638
(All) Aah!

147
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,980
Steffen, hang in!

148
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,786
I've regained control
of number four, Los Angeles.

149
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,432
Request permission for
emergency landing procedures.

150
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,758
Roger, flight 43.
This is l.A.X.

151
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,674
You're cleared for immediate
landing on runway 23.

152
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,769
(Roger)
Hee hee!
What an amazing story.

153
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,072
You liked that, did you?

154
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,273
You got them to land the plane.

155
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,506
You got what you wanted.

156
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,982
But I risked the lives

157
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,410
of a couple of hundred people.

158
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,605
But no one got hurt.

159
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,056
But they could have.
But they didn't.

160
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,185
That was a truly
wonderful story,
father,

161
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,288
but I have to get going now.

162
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,820
Fine.
Bye-bye.

163
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,285
(Swish)

164
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,596
Oh!

165
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,458
Son, that's not
the whole story.

166
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,796
It's just the beginning.

167
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,631
Oh, sorry, father.

168
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,866
That's all right.

169
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,541
Sit down and get comfortable.

170
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,040
Would you like a mint?

171
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,612
No, thank you.
Mmm...

172
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,379
I guess we have to
begin the story
earlier that day.

173
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,916
You see...
(Choking)

174
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,364
Yes. I'll save this
for later.

175
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,825
You see,
I had an Uncle
named Martin

176
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,059
who was a famous architect,

177
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,665
and he had two dreams.

178
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,667
One was to build a great
mass transit system

179
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,070
for what was known at that time

180
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,743
as the city of Los Angeles,

181
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,442
and his other dream
was to marry Sarah,

182
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,745
the love of his life.

183
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,878
Sarah was a teacher
who operated a daycare center

184
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,424
where he worked.

185
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,989
She loved him very much.

186
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,318
In fact, they were engaged
to be married.

187
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,091
Hi.

188
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,657
You look so handsome.

189
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,162
You look so handsome.

190
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,703
I'm in a very good mood.

191
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,858
How come?

192
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,366
I'll tell you later.

193
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,267
Tell me now, right now.

194
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,010
(Martin) You will love this.
It will literally be

195
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,079
the biggest surprise
of your life.

196
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,653
We're here?
We're here!

197
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,176
I'm excited!
Don't peek!

198
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,024
I'm not!
Don't peek!

199
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,122
Are you excited?
Yeah.

200
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,518
I'm so excited.

201
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,726
Wait.

202
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,287
O.K.
O.K.

203
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,555
Please don't peek.

204
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,963
I'm not.
O.K.

205
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,826
All right.

206
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,800
O.K., look!

207
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,814
Are you stunned?

208
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,707
What am I looking at?

209
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,312
The house!
I bought it!

210
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,914
It's on a cliff?

211
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,876
That's what
you want...
A cliff.

212
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,954
It's incredible, isn't it?

213
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,056
Uh-huh.

214
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,957
It's very minimalist,

215
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,429
but it's got
a quiet intensity,
doesn't it, honey?

216
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,857
Doesn't it?

217
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,263
It's very warm.

218
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,725
(Clifford) There was, however,
one slight problem.

219
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,004
Sarah wanted children
very much,

220
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,903
but Martin, it seemed,
was in no hurry.

221
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,206
Martin...

222
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,505
How many bedrooms
in this house?

223
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,781
One, honey.

224
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,579
One bedroom, honey.

225
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,352
But look
at this view.
Look at this!

226
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,950
The ocean!

227
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,752
You can see catalina out there.

228
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,962
Whoa! It is quite a drop!

229
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,188
(Door closes)

230
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,633
Honey?

231
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,158
I can't believe
I let this happen again.

232
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,964
Honey, what's wrong?

233
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,496
I can't marry you.

234
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,871
You're just like
my first husband.

235
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,199
He didn't want kids either.

236
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,144
When did I say
I didn't
want kids?

237
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,109
It's so obvious.

238
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,508
What are you talking about?

239
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,381
I'm talking about
this bachelor pad
with one bedroom.

240
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,451
Where's a kid
supposed to sleep?

241
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,191
Have you ever
heard the word
sofa-bed?

242
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,047
Have you ever heard
the word stupid?

243
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,659
Stupid?

244
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,217
Stupid!

245
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,986
Are you saying
this house couldn't
work for kids?

246
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,864
Oh, no, it's just perfect.

247
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,363
"Where are the kids, honey?"

248
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,034
"Oh, the kids
are just out back
playing on the cliff."

249
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,332
I love kids.

250
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,996
No, you don't. I saw you
at the daycare today.

251
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:38,705
You should see me
with a kid I know...
My nephew.

252
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,482
You never mentioned
you had a nephew.

253
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,350
I love my nephew.

254
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,449
What's his name?

255
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,678
I want to say Mason.

256
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,646
Uh... Clifford.
Little Clifford.

257
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,056
How old is he?

258
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,557
I haven't
seen him since
the christening.

259
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,429
He'd be older now...
Like, 10.

260
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,030
My brother julien
and I don't speak

261
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,272
as much as we'd like to.

262
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,898
I have heard
that Clifford is
a very special boy.

263
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,573
Where is that little monster?

264
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,174
Julien, please!

265
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,383
Ooh!

266
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,208
You did it, didn't you?

267
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,053
You did it again, didn't you?

268
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,578
You're banned from
the flight.
No.

269
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,223
They won't allow you
back on the plane.

270
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,048
I'll miss
the convention
tomorrow

271
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,553
and lose
thousands of dollars
in speaker's fees.

272
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,755
Do you understand me?

273
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,063
Where did you get that walkman?

274
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,361
Did you steal it?
No.

275
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:33,462
Is there no end
to your madness?

276
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,996
A kindly
old priest
gave it to me.

277
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,603
You're lying.
No.

278
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,865
You're lying
to your own
father's face.

279
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,744
I should leave you here,
you little animal.

280
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,083
What a terrible thing to say
to such a sweet child.

281
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,450
I'm sorry,
Mrs. extra-wide-load.

282
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,051
What are you packing in,
two dozen doughnuts a day?

283
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,215
Huh?

284
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,092
Julien, calm down!

285
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,591
Your heart...

286
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,132
Daddy, it's coming...

287
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,898
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

288
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,469
Oh, theodora,
what am I
going to do?

289
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,738
I... I got to
be on that plane.

290
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,067
Pappy, pappy, pappy.

291
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,302
What?

292
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,266
Doesn't Uncle Martin
live in Los Angeles?

293
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,276
Maybe I can go to his house,

294
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,738
and then you could
go to Hawaii,

295
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,306
and I could go
to dinosaur world.

296
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,916
(Telephone rings)

297
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,951
Wait. Sarah?

298
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,186
(Julien) Martin?
Yes?

299
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,359
Martin, it's julien,
your brother.

300
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,002
Your brother
julien.
Yes?

301
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:42,668
I haven't made
much of an attempt
to keep in touch.

302
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,439
I wouldn't blame you
if you hung up on me,

303
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,568
but don't hang up, o.K.?

304
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,835
I'm in a terrible dilemma.

305
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,184
I have a tremendous
favor to ask you.

306
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,549
Ha ha ha!

307
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,223
I can't believe it.
He went for it.

308
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,123
I'm going to dinosaur world!

309
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,555
I told him I had
this speaking engagement

310
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,290
and that Clifford gets airsick.

311
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,325
Dinosaur world I'm going to!

312
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,031
He almost seemed
excited about it.

313
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,403
Ha ha ha!

314
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,166
I'm Martin Daniels.

315
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,344
I'm here to pick up
my nephew Clifford.

316
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,743
Do you have any identification?

317
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,914
Yeah.

318
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,878
All right.

319
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,683
He's in the back room
resting. Come with me.

320
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,085
Thank you.

321
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,490
Clifford.

322
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,033
This is so cute.

323
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,998
Come here.
Look.

324
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,057

Clifford.

333
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,608
Don't reject me!

334
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,617
<i>¶ LA LA LA LA LA... ¶</i>

335
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,651

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,190
Yes.

337
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,862
<i>¶ LA... ¶</i>

338
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,660
I'm going to go big.

00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,559

344
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,272
dearest Uncle Martin,

345
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,773
can we go
to dinosaur world now?

346
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,876
Dinosaur world?
It's closed.

347
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,138
It's 10:30,
Clifford.

348
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,046
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

349
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,978
I've got
a lifetime pass
to dinosaur world

350
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,083
because I designed
Larry the scary...

351
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,145
Scary Rex? You designed
Larry the scary Rex?

352
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,324
<i>¶ I'm Larry the scary Rex ¶</i>

353
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,926

354

356
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,326
oh, boy, you're
some sort of hero.

357
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,269
Let's go get your bags.

358
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,440
Yes.

359
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,668
Somebody stole my dog sneakers.

360
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,472
Calm down!

361
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,344
Have you unloaded
everything off
flight 791 yet?

362
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,644
Oh, yeah.

363
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,945
So far I'm missing
a Mountain bike,

364
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,077
a stereo, a surfboard,

365
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,583
and a big brown dog.

366
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,422
You brought a lot of stuff.

367
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,293
Dad's scared of burglars.

368
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,993
He makes us
take everything
when we travel.

369
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,826
And your dog.

370
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,961
I couldn't leave
my sneakers at home.

371
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,866
Of course you couldn't.

372
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,976
Sarah will be so excited.

373
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,781
I told her
how special
you are to me.

374
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,783
We've never met before.

375
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,145
I was with you
at the christening.

376
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,615
I spent the better
part of a day
in your company.

377
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,825
I have the utmost
admiration for you.

378
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,057
Oh, Uncle Martin!

379
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,402
Oh!

380
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,399
O.K.,
you can let go now.

381
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,501
Okey-dokey.

382
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,872
Okey-dokey. O.K.

383
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,840
(Arf)

384
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,368
Oh, Sarah loves dogs.

385
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,643
Come on, sneakers.

386
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,971
Come on, sneakers.

387
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,306
Come on, sneakers.

388
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,581
Come on.

389
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,409
Come on.

390
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,382
(Meow)

391
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,586
(Meow)

392
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,334
(Martin) Come on, boy.

393
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,699
Come on, sneakers.

394
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,097
Please, boy.
Get out of
the car. Oh!

395
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,031
(Meow)

396
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,265
Whoa!

397
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,010
(Sarah) Just face it, Sarah.

398
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,612
You'll be alone
the rest of your life,

399
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,445
just like that maid
on the Brady bunch,

400
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:55,021
faking enthusiasm
for other people's happiness.

401
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,051
And there's, of course,

402
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,286
the pity of others
to look forward to.

403
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,556
"Isn't that Sarah Davis?

404
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,291
"My! She's aged.

405
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,556
"She drove off
every man she ever had,

406
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,565
"and then she just withered up

407
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,468
like an old prune
who couldn't..."

408
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:12,938
Aah!

409
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,806
Sarah?

410
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,967
Aah!

411
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,883
Don't judge me.
It was steffen's
fault.

412
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,378
Shame on you.
Shame on your eyes.

413
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,811
What? Sarah!

414
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,076
Martin?

415
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,484
Are you o.K.?

416
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,786
That was
a lousy trick
to play.

417
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,159
What trick?

418
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:34,557
Your stupid dinosaur
in the shower.

419
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,760
Oh, no, no.
That was Clifford.

420
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,564
Who is Clifford?

421
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,365
My nephew. Remember?
I was telling you about him.

422
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,440
Your nephew's here?

423
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,769
My brother julien called.
He was flying to Hawaii.

424
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,276
Julien said would I
look after him
for a week.

425
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:55,978
I said, "of course."
He's a wonderful kid.

426
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,322
Come on, meet him.

427
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,352
O.K.

428
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,491
Hi.

429
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,362
Uncle, Martin, I hope
your friend doesn't mind

430
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,461
that I helped myself
to a snack.

431
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,663
That's o.K.

432
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,834
Martin.

433
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,032
Oh, Clifford,
this is Sarah Davis.

434
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,872
<i>¶ LA LA</i>

435
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,035
<i>¶ LA ¶</i>

436
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,274
hello.

437
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,476
Hello, miss Sarah Davis.

438
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,278
Whew! That's
a lovely bathrobe
you're wearing.

439
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,019
I'm sure on anyone else
it wouldn't look
half as lovely.

440
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:33,982
(Sighs)

441
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,886
Thank you.
What a sweet thing to say.

442
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,819
Isn't he
everything
I said he was?

443
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,315
I love you, Uncle Martin.

444
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,726
And I you, Clinton.

445
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,388
Clifford.

446
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,526
Isn't there
an incredible
family resemblance?

447
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,574
Well, I guess so.
Yes.

448
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,540
I'd like to see more
of you, Clifford.

449
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,143
Perhaps you can
convince your Uncle

450
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,575
to make sure of that.

451
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Absolutely!
But right now,
sleepyhead,

452
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,323
we got to
get you to
Uncle Martin's.

453
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,589
Normally I would despise

454
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,417
when someone ruffles
my hair like that,

455
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,592
but not when you do it.

456
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,262
Isn't he something?

457
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,361
Yes.
He certainly is.

458
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,003
O.K., honey,
let's go.

459
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,166
Good night, darling.

460
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,614
Good night.

461
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,041
O.K., Clifford,
come on.

462
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,746
Good night.

463
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,208
Good night to you.

464
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,616
Good night, sweet Sarah.

465
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,018
May all
your dreams be
pleasant ones.

466
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,290
May the rainbow arches...

467
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,258
Come on, sweetie.
Time for bed.

468
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,158
(Door closes)

469
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,964
Like other native peoples,

470
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,296
the lake girls
copy the movement of animals.

471
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,701
Since the beginning of...

472
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,935
(Slurp)

473
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,540
Allow them to enter
the prayer land.

474
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,742
There has been mutual respect.

475
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,144
This dance, called the...

476
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,746
Time to turn off the videos.

477
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,048
Is an expression
of their culture.

478
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,650
O.K. Time to go
to sleep.

479
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:18,588
Steffen felt that was a very
cruel action, Uncle Martin.

480
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,561
Oh, well, you tell steffen...

481
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,791
That it's 2:00
in the morning

482
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,096
and we have to
get up very early

483
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:30,598
because tomorrow
we're going
to dinosaur world.

484
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:34,043
Oh, you're the bestest Uncle
in the whole wide world!

485
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,746
Thanks.

486
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,594
Good night, Clifford.

487
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,590
Good night, Uncle Martin.

488
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,191
Good night, Clifford.

489
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,534
Good night, Uncle Martin.

490
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,444
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Uncle Martin?

491
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,209
If you lied to me,
I'd be so angry,

492
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,307
I don't know what I'd do.

493
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,879
No, I wouldn't lie to you.

494
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,935
Get in the bed.

495
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,924
Cozy, cozy.

496
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:24,487
Uncle Martin,
whose ring is this?

497
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,820
Where did you get that?

498
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:26,885
On the dresser.

499
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,493
Give me that.
No.

500
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:31,804
That's
my grandmother's
wedding ring.

501
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,057
Then wouldn't she be
my great-grandmother?

502
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,496
Yes.

503
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:38,901
Then wouldn't it be
just as much mine as yours?

504
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,065
What's your point?

505
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,743
I want to marry Sarah
and give her this ring.

506
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,841
That's very sweet,

507
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,706
but it's, it's, it's
very unrealistic.

508
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,015
I still want the ring.

509
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,877
You can't have it.

510
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,175
I, I... give it...

511
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,486
But it sparkles.

512
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,558
I like sparkle as well.

513
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,887
I will give Sarah
this ring someday.

514
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,929
How exciting!

515
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,395
Ring bearer?

516
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,498
We'll see.

517
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,838
(Sarah) This is smiling,
isn't it?

518
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:16,744
(Knock on door)

519
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,726
Hi, Martin.
Hi, Clifford.

520
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:39,429
Hello, miss Sarah Davis.

521
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,432
I didn't know
you were a teacher.

522
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:45,574
Had I known,
I would have brought
you an apple.

523
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,641
What a charming
thing to say.
How very thoughtful.

524
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,041
I'm taking Clifford
to dinosaur world.

525
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,813
Then I've got
a meeting with Ellis.

526
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,952
This deadline is really
closing in on me.

527
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,517
It'll be o.K.
Your ideas are great.

528
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:02,452
It's a little odd

529
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,585
that this daycare center has
been here for over six months,

530
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,430
and Mr. Ellis hasn't
even dropped in once.

531
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:11,327
I'm sure he hates kids.

532
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,260
What makes me nervous
is that if I
don't talk fast enough

533
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,966
he snaps his fingers at me.

534
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:22,438
I hear he's a womanizer
and he's obsessed
with himself

535
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,641
and that's supposed to be
a wig that he's wearing.

536
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,084
Ellis wears a rug?

537
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,979
Oh!

538
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,747
Mr. Ellis,
how are you?

539
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:33,952
Thanks for coming in.

540
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,993
I don't believe we've met.

541
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,448
This is miss Sarah...

542
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,316
Sarah Davis, of course.

543
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,856
I want to thank you
for the wonderful
job you've done.

544
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,756
Oh, thank you.

545
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,925
Oh, isn't that impressive?

546
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,134
You know, I don't think

547
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,796
there's anything
more meaningful
to me

548
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:55,144
than the welfare
of our employees'...

549
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,971
(All laugh)

550
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,836
This is my nephew Clifford.

551
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,384
Say hello
to my boss Mr. Ellis.

552
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,050
Isn't he a cute little fella?

553
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,819
Hi, Sonny.

554
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,247
My! That's the bestest-looking
wig I've ever seen!

555
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,650
Oh, no, no, no.

556
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,215
That's, that's not a wig.

557
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,158
You said it was a wig.

558
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,030
You called it a rug, too.

559
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,488
You misunderstood me.

560
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,026
I never said that, sir.

561
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,231
Good.

562
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,371
What are you looking at?

563
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,299
It's not a wig.

564
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,644
It's not a rug either.

565
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,870
(All laugh)

566
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,174
Just don't worry about that.

567
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,006
Right. Don't worry
about that.

568
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,581
I guess we have work to do.

569
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,918
I was wondering one thing.

570
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,047
Later on,
could I give
you a call?

571
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,222
Me?
No. Her.

572
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,491
There's something I would love

573
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,820
to talk to you about.

574
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,526
Oh, well...

575
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,357
That'd be f... fine.

576
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,702
Su... o.K.

577
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,498
Well, good-bye, sir.

578
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,125
Charming.

579
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,874
(Martin) You want me
to redesign
the entire model

580
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,713
in two days?

581
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,038
The bottom line is,

582
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:05,683
you've got to move
the train line.

583
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:06,878
What?

584
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,449
Yeah. 2 Miles.

585
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,849
That's impossible!

586
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,750
That'll put the train line

587
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,952
right through
the sepulveda dam.

588
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,415
Hmm.

589
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,123
That's not good.

590
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,885
Well.

591
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:23,463
You'll come up with something.

592
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,802
You'll hole up for a few days

593
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,797
and drink a lot of coffee.

594
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,870
You being
the professional
I know you are,

595
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:33,799
I know you'll hit
another home run for us.

596
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,741
You all right?
No.

597
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,042
Good man.

598
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,047
If you're a visitor,
would you do me a favor?

599
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,318
Enter your visitor card number.

600
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,663
(Martin) Clifford!

601
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,897
Hello, Uncle Martin.

602
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,342
Are we ready to go
to dinosaur world?

603
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,904
Uh, Clifford, uh...

604
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,173
I've got some bad news.

605
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,176
I can't take you right now!

606
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,908
The freeway
to dinosaur world
is back there.

607
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,175
You're going to make us crash!

608
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,884
(Tires squealing)

609
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,421
Steffen,
make it all better
somehow.

610
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,494
Get ahold of yourself!
You're out of control!

611
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,994
(Hyperventilating)

612
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,455
What? What?

613
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,303
A whole gang of chocolate,
I need it badly.

614
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,631
(Hyperventilating)

615
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,035
Jesus!

616
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,597
(Horn honking)

617
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,472
(Hyperventilating)

618
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,276
O.K. All right. O.K.

619
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,178
Wait one minute.
I'll be right back.

620
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,010
Don't... don't
breathe so much.

621
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,848
O.K. Excuse me.

622
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,357
O.K., kids,
next stop... dinosaur world!

623
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,830
Who's excited?

624
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,058
(Kids cheering)

625
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,263
I have to go to the bathroom.

626
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,639
You're out of chocolate?
How can that be?

627
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,375
Everybody wants chocolate.

628
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,850
I need chocolate!

629
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,918
I might have
an easter bunny
left over.

630
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,119
Get me the bunny!

631
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,230
Thanks for making
us wait, you dork.

632
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,057
Clifford?

633
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,273
Clifford?

634
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,835
Well, where
did you get
those clothes?

635
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,405
This kid bought
my dinosaur costume.

636
00:31:58,384 --> 00:31:59,684
What's the matter with you?

637
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,345
Are you crazy?

638
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,054
I'm terribly sorry.

639
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,716
Where's my son?

640
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,294
He was counting the money

641
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,964
he was given in the men's room.

642
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,302
You pervert!

643
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,925
Ahh!

644
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,404
Ah!

645
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:19,402
Ow! My ear!
You hit my ear!

646
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,095
Tell me where he is!

647
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,806
Mom, I'm over here!

648
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,612
Oh, Kevin!

649
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,311
You're all right!

650
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,150
What in the world is...

651
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,577
So...

652
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,445
Any luck with that chocolate?

653
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,894
"Any luck with that chocolate?

654
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,619
Any luck with
that chocolate?"

655
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,163
Bad boy, Clifford!
Bad boy!

656
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,426
I don't know
what to say to you.

657
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,436
You could have
given those parents
a heart attack.

658
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,769
If they press charges,

659
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,373
you could end up in prison.

660
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,811
And the wasted time!

661
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,413
I happen to be
very busy, young man.

662
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,915
The city of Los Angeles

663
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:08,317
is relying on me
for public transit.

664
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,120
My boss is breathing
down my neck.

665
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:14,123
That was so embarrassing
with Mr. Ellis.

666
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:18,826
Don't tell someone
they have a nice wig.

667
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,801
I said,
"the bestest-looking wig."

668
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,829
It was a compliment.

669
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,625
(Sighs) He says he
doesn't wear a wig.

670
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,696
People don't take it
as a compliment

671
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,035
if you say,
"nice wig."

672
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,211
I didn't say,
"nice wig."

673
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,009
I said,
"bestest-looking wig."

674
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,982
There is a difference.

675
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,950
Why are you such
an authority on wigs?

676
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,950
My teacher
Mr. Cavanaugh wears one.

677
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,250
He lets us play with it.

678
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,815
He lets you play with it?

679
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,164
Frisbee.

680
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,559
(Whistles)

681
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,733
Miss gathecold,
the art teacher,

682
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,501
borrows it as well.

683
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
That would be
for different reasons.

684
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,373
Let's just forget
about the wig.

685
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,142
I've got to punish you,

686
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,741
and that means
dinosaur world is out.

687
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,911
I don't understand.

688
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,383
I've got a bombshell for you.

689
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,851
I'm the boss in this house.

690
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:13,249
You cannot fight city hall.

691
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,522
Surely someone as wise as you

692
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,091
would realize that breaking
a little boy's promise

693
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,130
and punishing him for it
would be a terrible thing.

694
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,262
That little boy
wouldn't be responsible

695
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,404
for what he was
going to do next.

696
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,699
I don't like threats.

697
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,602
You're going to spend
the day in your room.

698
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,174
Now you march, young man!

699
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,312
March!

700
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,779
It's not fair, steffen.

701
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,746
He was the one
who broke his promise,

702
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,091
and now I'm the one
who's being punished.

703
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,291
It isn't fair.

704
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,264
They're never fair.

705
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,234
I am going to go
to dinosaur world.

706
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,299
I don't care what he says.

707
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,830
(Ring)

708
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,800
(Ring)

709
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,705
Hello.

710
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,267
Hi, it's me.
How was dinosaur world?

711
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,240
I postponed it.

712
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,045
Ellis hit me
with a hundred changes

713
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,747
to make on the model.

714
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:17,908
(Gasps)

715
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,746
Oh, you poor thing.

716
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,991
How's Clifford?
He must be heartbroken.

717
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,417
No, he's fine.

718
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:25,962
We're in the kitchen
making popcorn.

719
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,388
Use a potholder, cliffie!

720
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,593
I was calling about tonight.

721
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:31,926
Tonight?

722
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,100
My parents' anniversary.

723
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,398
Why?
Did you forget?

724
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,769
No! Are you kidding?

725
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,667
I can't miss your
parents' anniversary party!

726
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,441
It's 7:00.

727
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,110
I can't wait
for my folks
to meet Clifford.

728
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,309
See you then.
Bye.

729
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,041
(Line disconnects)

730
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,554
Isn't that something, steffen?

731
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,464
Too busy for a boy's dream,

732
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:01,017
but not too busy
to go out to dinner.

733
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,039
(Martin) Punish you,

734
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,684
and that means
dinosaur world is out.

735
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,675
I've got a bombshell for you.

736
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,353
I'm the boss in this house.

737
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,021
You cannot fight city hall.

738
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,720
(Tape rewinding)

739
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,525
Steffen, do you
like Uncle Martin?

740
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,295
So do I.

741
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,698
This is Martin Daniels.

742
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
I've got a bomb.

743
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,905
(Clifford) Wow! Is this house
ever huge!

744
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,578
Uncle Martin,
do they live in a hotel?

745
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,252
You're not still mad at me

746
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,907
for grounding you,
are you, Clifford?

747
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,575
Of course not.

748
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,084
Whatever would make
you think that?

749
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,418
There they are.

750
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:07,023
Now, daddy, be nice
to Martin for me.

751
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,585
If I have to, honey.

752
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:12,495
I don't understand
a man at his age

753
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,527
and still not married.

754
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,603
Hi, honey.

755
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,401
Hi. Daddy, look.
It's Martin.

756
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,542
Hi.

757
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:19,597
Congratulations, sir.

758
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:20,695
Happy anniversary.

759
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,206
I hope you have
many, many more.

760
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,438
Daddy, this is
Martin's nephew
Clifford.

761
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:30,254
Well, now, look
at this big fella.

762
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,219
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

763
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,717
A dinosaur.

764
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,019
Ha ha ha!

765
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,722
Do you like
dinosaurs,
miss Sarah?

766
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,424
I adore dinosaurs.

767
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,385
Would you like some punch?

768
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,264
I would like that very much.

769
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,733
Martin, bloody Mary?

770
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:46,801
Thank you.

771
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,368
You have a most
exceptional
daughter.

772
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,235
Thank you for letting me know.

773
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:56,007
You must be having
the time of your life.

774
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,882
Why do you say that,
miss Sarah?

775
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,577
Getting to spend time

776
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,379
with your Uncle finally
and everything.

777
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,148
Oh.

778
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,679
Uncle Martin.

779
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,581
Yeah.

780
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:08,916
Scary Uncle Martin.

781
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,820
Sarah!
Hello, darling!

782
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,723
Oh, how fabulous you look!

783
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,325
I always loved you
in that dress.

784
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,458
It's new, Julia.

785
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,732
Oh, yes.
Of course it is.

786
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,571
Oh, come and meet raweejni.

787
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,567
I'll be back soon.

788
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,999
Okey-dokey.

789
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:47,123
Hi, Clifford.
Have you seen Sarah?

790
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,925
She was taken
by a lady who
looks like this...

791
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,995
What makes her face
look like that?

792
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,301
They call that
a face-lift.

793
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,573
What's a face-lift?

794
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,638
Let's not shout so much.

795
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:05,813
Oh, sorry.

796
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,611
I believe your drink
is right there.

797
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,052
Oh, thanks.

798
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,447
Martin!

799
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,049
Oh, Mrs. Davis.

800
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:16,045
Oh, I knew you'd come.

801
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,724
Parker said you'd try
to weasel out of it.

802
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,493
I knew better.

803
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,061
Oh, not to come
to your 35th anniversary,

804
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,829
that would be unthinkable.

805
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,028
(Both laugh)

806
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,399
Ha ha ha!

807
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,672
Is this Clifford?

808
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,168
Yes, I believe it is me.

809
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,969
I'm Sarah's mother.

810
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,841
I'm Annabelle.

811
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,340
If you're miss Sarah's mother,

812
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,011
you must
be the most
wonderful person

813
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,739
in the whole wide world!

814
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,982
What a gorgeous,

815
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,881
gorgeous child!

816
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,983
Oh!

817
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:48,916
Wait.

818
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,020
Wait.

819
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,521
Wait. No.

820
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,723
(Yells) Wait!

821
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,526
I believe Uncle Martin

822
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,157
would like
to offer
you a toast.

823
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,333
Oh, how sweet.

824
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:02,072
Parker. Sarah.

825
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,367
Everybody, come on.
Gather around.

826
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,369
Sarah's Martin is toasting.

827
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,501
Come on. Quickly.

828
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,469
Here we go.

829
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,368
A toast.

830
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,236
We raise our glasses

831
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,852
first to Parker Davis,

832
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,018
the patriarch
of the Davis family,

833
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:23,388
for 35 years, a devoted husband

834
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:26,888
and a loving, loving father.

835
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,192
We love you very much, sir.

836
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,391
Hear. Hear.

837
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,826
Hear. Hear.

838
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,869
Next...

839
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,384
Aren't you going to

840
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:49,109
say something about
Sarah's mother?

841
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,746
(Parker)
Goddamn it, Daniels!
Get on with it!

842
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,293
Are you feeling o.K.?

843
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,386
(Glass shatters)

844
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,491
Ahh!

845
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,929
Ah!

846
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,401
Ah!

847
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,499
Ahh!

848
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,395
Excuse us.

849
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:13,603
I would like a word
with my nephew.

850
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,835
The paprika sauce
was the talk
of the party.

851
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,577
You're trying to punish me

852
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,109
because I haven't taken
you to dinosaur world.

853
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,484
You put something in my drink.

854
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,784
In your drink?
In my drink!

855
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,746
My mouth was going to burn off!

856
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,185
You think it's funny?

857
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,090
No.

858
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,092
It was funny, Uncle Martin,

859
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,794
because you made a toast,

860
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:39,796
"here's to Parker Davis.

861
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,358
We love you, sir."

862
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,366
And then you
held up the drink...

863
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,868
(Gagging)

864
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,307
Everyone was
staring and saying,

865
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,479
"what a goof!"

866
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,037
You ran to the punch bowl.

867
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:55,576
Argh!

868
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,024
(Yells)

869
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:10,958
Oh! Oh! Oh!

870
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,657
See, when
you are looking
at the baseball,

871
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,126
look at it.

872
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:17,234
Oh, I see now.

873
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:18,965
Keep your eye on the ball.

874
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,372
Tricky to remember,
Uncle. Thanks.

875
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:28,382
Well, so...

876
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:31,578
O.K.?
Yes.

877
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,217
Yes.

878
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,819
They're starting
to serve dinner now.

879
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,319
Dinner is served.

880
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,564
Oh! Hungry boy
am I.

881
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,361
(Sarah)
Clifford, maybe you'd
like to wash your hands.

882
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,463
Oh.

883
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:48,966
Yes.

884
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,400
Bye, captain.

885
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:01,037
You'd tell me
if you were having

886
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:02,446
a nervous breakdown,
wouldn't you?

887
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,447
(Both laugh)

888
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,179
Nervous breakdown.

889
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:12,021
He wants me to fly
to San Francisco
with him tomorrow

890
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,523
to open a daycare center.

891
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:15,015
What did you say?

892
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,386
I said yes.

893
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,094
It's only for one night.

894
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,096
You're spending the night
in San Francisco with Ellis?

895
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,429
He is my boss.
Was I supposed
to say no?

896
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,096
What's wrong with you tonight?

897
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,774
Clifford, what are you doing?

898
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,742
I just wanted to borrow

899
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,411
your lip-thingy
stuff.

900
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,739
My lips are somewhat parched.

901
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,714
You can't put your hand
into somebody's pocket.

902
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,083
No. You cannot borrow it.
It's not sanitary.

903
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:38,822
Whatever you say, Uncle Martin.

904
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,817
Here are your pickles, sir.

905
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,319
Oh, thank you
ever so kindly, sir.

906
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:48,559
What a nice, polite
young man you are.

907
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,300
He said even though
you're a worrywart,

908
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,597
he has confidence
you'll come
through in the end.

909
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,070
Then maybe he'll take
me to San Francisco.

910
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,440
Because
I'm in a good mood
and you're not,

911
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,969
you just can't stand it.

912
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,474
I can stand it.

913
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,976
Just forget it.

914
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,392
Hi.

915
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,159
Hi.

916
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,831
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

917
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,636
Oh, Martin,

918
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,368
you are hysterical!

919
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,709
(Guests laughing)

920
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,394
Wha...

921
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:54,758
Go like this...

922
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,260
Martin, go to the bathroom
and wipe it off.

923
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:05,268
(Guests laughing)

924
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,781
There's a bathroom
on the second floor,
madam.

925
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,579
Are you Martin Daniels?

926
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,011
Yes.

927
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,516
May I sleep at your house?

928
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:21,848
Oh...

929
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:24,053
Madam, come quickly, please.

930
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,724
You're making
a terrible mistake.

931
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,856
Stop this.
I'm the fiance of...

932
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:31,962
ugh!

933
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,904
I'm miss Davis' fiance!

934
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,029
Martin!

935
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,374
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

936
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,438
We are police officers.
Don't be alarmed.

937
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:44,038
This gentleman
is suspected of planting
an explosive device.

938
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,412
What? No!

939
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,080
I'm with the city!

940
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,408
I'm designing
a public transit system

941
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:52,284
for the entire city
of Los Angeles.

942
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,223
Honestly, this is insane!

943
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,249
You've made some
sort of mistake.

944
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,954
We don't think so.

945
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,356
It's not as if
I didn't warn her.

946
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:01,888
Oh, wait.

947
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:03,693
Uncle Martin!

948
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:04,785
No!

949
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:08,562
In the name of all that's holy,

950
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,626
somebody help my Uncle!

951
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,235
He's an innocent man,
I tell you!

952
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:15,068
An innocent...

953
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,173
Man.

954
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,639
Mission accomplished, friend.

955
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:27,918
Why don't you tell us
where the bomb is hidden?

956
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,119
What are you talking about?

957
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,290
Do I look like someone

958
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,918
that would
put a bomb
under city hall?

959
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:37,285
You're trying to get
a confession from me

960
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,655
by grilling me
under hot lights.

961
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:41,728
Sorry.

962
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,072
Well, you know,
now I can't see
anything.

963
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,141
That's... No.

964
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,611
Is that better?

965
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,353
I don't want
to make this
about lighting.

966
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:58,948
Let's move on.

967
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,480
You wanted
to get caught.
You called us.

968
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,046
What?
Yeah.

969
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,790
Hi. This is
Martin Daniels.

970
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,832
I've got a bomb
under city hall.

971
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:12,028
Talk to you later.

972
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,800
This is part
of my answering
machine message!

973
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:16,629
This is a prank!

974
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:17,774
You don't have to believe me!

975
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:19,469
Call my home!

976
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,400
Here.
Speaker's on.

977
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:25,839
(Ring)

978
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,881
Hi. This is Clifford.

979
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:29,979
I can't tell you where
my Uncle Martin is,

980
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:32,451
but I'll give you
a hint... kaboom!

981
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:49,532
Clifford?
Ah!

982
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,834
I didn't mean to scare you.

983
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:54,366
Morning, miss Sarah.

984
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,042
You're all dressed up
to go dreaming.

985
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,870
Don't say I'm wrong.

986
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,213
Oh, thank you.

987
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,012
I didn't hear you get up.

988
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,354
I've been up since 5:00.

989
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,350
I don't sleep as much
as one might assume.

990
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:11,493
Well, I see you
found something to eat.

991
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:12,859
(Knock on door)

992
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,357
Hi.

993
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,089
It's the jailbird.

994
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,864
Oh, Martin,
I've been
so worried!

995
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,333
You've been worried.

996
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:25,167
There he is.
Hi, Clifford. You o.K.?

997
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,599
Hi, Uncle Martin.

998
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,874
How was your stay
in penitentiary?

999
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,443
Did you meet any
interesting hoodlums?

1000
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:31,771
Ha ha ha!

1001
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:33,643
Ah!

1002
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,576
Are you really in trouble?

1003
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,252
I've told you about
Larry gould, right?

1004
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,392
No.

1005
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,587
You know,
Mr. practical jokes?

1006
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,889
The whole thing was a setup.

1007
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:51,361
Oh, no!
I don't believe
what I'm hearing!

1008
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:52,962
I don't either.

1009
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:58,233
Honey, be careful
how you eat your cereal.

1010
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,036
This boy and his cereal.

1011
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,168
Ha ha ha!

1012
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:05,737
Explain to me what happened.

1013
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:08,313
Larry tapes my
answering-machine message

1014
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,583
and my phone conversation.

1015
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,981
He edits them together.

1016
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,323
The police play it for me,

1017
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,278
and I think I'm going insane.

1018
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:16,987
That's sick!

1019
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:18,648
It gets better.

1020
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:21,156
The two cops who arrested me?

1021
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,929
Larry's cousins.

1022
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:26,727
No! I don't think
that's funny at all!

1023
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:30,601
I didn't either,
and then I started
thinking about it,

1024
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,541
and I got to laughing.

1025
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:37,667
Ah.

1026
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,078
It is funny.

1027
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,850
Those guys are certifiable.

1028
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:45,478
Tell me about it.

1029
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,083
I'm so relieved.

1030
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,186
Oh, now, Clifford, see?

1031
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:52,618
Didn't I tell you
that everything
would be just fine?

1032
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:53,993
Yes, you did,

1033
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,292
but I don't like those men.

1034
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:57,934
They're liars.

1035
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,299
Everybody knows that liars

1036
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:01,197
eventually get caught.

1037
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,296
That's right...

1038
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,271
You little pecker-head.

1039
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,504
O.K., I'll see
you tomorrow.

1040
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,866
Try to get some sleep.

1041
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:14,375
I got a lot of work
to catch up on.

1042
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:18,609
I'm sorry I was a jerk
about your trip with Ellis.

1043
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,716
I know, sweetheart.
I know.

1044
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,651
I'm staying at
the wemberton hotel.

1045
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,616
You can phone my suite.

1046
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,855
You have a suite?
Yes.

1047
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,287
Bye, Clifford.

1048
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,825
Make sure
by the time
I get back

1049
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,130
your Uncle's
not working on
a chain gang.

1050
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:37,667
That's very good.

1051
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:38,728
O.K. Bye.

1052
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:39,896
Bye.

1053
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:48,178
Bye-bye.

1054
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,309
Bye.

1055
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,383
Bye!

1056
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,981
Get in the car.

1057
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,459
I am now out on bail.

1058
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,687
Are you listening to me?

1059
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,195
Are you?

1060
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:07,597
Yes, I am.

1061
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,767
I have a criminal record,

1062
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,870
but you know what
you're going to have?

1063
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:18,012
A one-way ticket
back to your parents.

1064
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:20,039
No! They hate me!

1065
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,114
Not as much as I do!

1066
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,413
(Crying)

1067
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,854
Stop with the fake tears!

1068
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:27,849
I'm not faking!
I'll admit anything!

1069
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:30,352
Just don't send me
back to my parents.

1070
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:33,064
I'll tell miss Sarah
I put the lipstick
in your pocket,

1071
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,687
which I didn't.

1072
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,192
Her father did it!

1073
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,725
He wanted to embarrass you.

1074
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,400
He said you were
a simple-minded moron.

1075
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
He called me a moron?

1076
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,742
A simple-minded moron.

1077
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:50,737
And Sarah's father
put the lipstick
in my pocket?

1078
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:51,871
Yes.

1079
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:54,414
Why would he do that?

1080
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,212
Because he hates you!

1081
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:59,254
I don't know why.

1082
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,780
I certainly think
you're a nice enough sort.

1083
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,086
I suppose that Sarah's father

1084
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:06,758
also put the hot sauce
in my drink.

1085
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:08,117
That I don't know.

1086
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,826
You don't?
No.

1087
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,327
You have no idea who did that?

1088
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,000
I would suspect
the bartender.
Theory.

1089
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:19,337
Well, you know, I would
suspect someone else.

1090
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,297
Now, who could that be?

1091
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:26,014
If you're about
to say what I think,

1092
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,514
then I don't want to hear it,

1093
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:30,913
because Sarah Davis loves you.

1094
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:33,015
She wouldn't do that.

1095
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,777
She has problems with you,

1096
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,015
but every relationship
goes through that.

1097
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:40,587
Oh.

1098
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:41,891
Oh, you...

1099
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:44,927
you don't think it was me?

1100
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,659
Uncle Martin!
Stop!

1101
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,304
I had to be made
naked in the jail!

1102
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:55,603
I was strip searched!
I was humiliated!

1103
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:56,936
I know.
I'm sorry.

1104
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:59,281
I'm sorry that I made the tape.

1105
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:01,137
Oh, God, it was wrong!

1106
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,045
Why did I do it?

1107
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:07,715
I think I know why.

1108
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:10,788
Because
I was angry at you
for having promised

1109
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,348
that you would take me
to dinosaur world

1110
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,156
and then breaking that promise!

1111
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:17,058
What is it with you
and dinosaur world?
It's sick!

1112
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,961
You're obsessed with
this dinosaur world!

1113
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,695
I believe dinosaur world
is the only place

1114
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,101
where a boy like me
can be happy.

1115
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,413
(Sobbing)

1116
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:38,013
Oh.

1117
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:42,245
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Shut up a minute!

1118
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:46,756
Will you listen to me?

1119
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:48,387
I'm listening.

1120
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,758
Don't put the dinosaur
on me like that.

1121
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,866
Just leave the dinosaur
over there like that.

1122
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,269
I'm trying to
tell you something.

1123
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,873
When I...
when I was a little boy...

1124
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,936
you touch the dinosaur,
I'll kill you.

1125
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:10,175
Steffen wanted to stand here.

1126
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:12,781
Give it to me!
I'll rip its head off!

1127
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:15,281
God almighty, boy!

1128
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,855
Listen.
I'm trying to tell you
something to help you.

1129
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:27,395
Clifford, I'm trying
to tell you something

1130
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:30,528
about when I was
a little boy in Chicago.

1131
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:32,474
All right?
Yes.

1132
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,570
There was a great
amusement park
called riverview.

1133
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:36,943
Did your father mention it?

1134
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,771
Yes.

1135
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:42,406
I thought that was
the only place
I could be happy,

1136
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,153
but my father never took me.

1137
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:46,979
And then one day...

1138
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,150
They tore it down,

1139
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:53,585
before I ever got to go there.

1140
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,591
I understand how you feel.

1141
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,063
You do?
Yes.

1142
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:00,362
Does it ever get easier,
my Uncle Martin?

1143
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,503
Not really.

1144
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,201
Now listen to me.

1145
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:09,337
Here's the deal...
you go to your room,

1146
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,770
write a confession that
I'll take to the police,

1147
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:15,006
and I won't send you
back to your parents.

1148
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:18,252
You tell Sarah
that you and I
are best friends.

1149
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:20,979
We are,
aren't we?
Shut up.

1150
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:24,145
But if you even
look at me funny,

1151
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:26,955
if you do one thing
I find weird,

1152
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,357
which is, like,
your middle name...

1153
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:31,664
You're doing it now.

1154
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:35,202
Can you act like
a human boy
for one minute?

1155
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,329
Look at me like a person.

1156
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:38,965
You can't do it.

1157
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,269
Look at me like a human boy!

1158
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:43,142
Don't mess around with me,

1159
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,670
or you'll be back
on that plane.

1160
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,306
You understand me?

1161
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:50,351
I understand that I love you.

1162
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:53,218
All right. All right.
Let it go. Let it go.

1163
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,524
Steffen walked back.

1164
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,717
Give me that!
Give me that, Clifford!

1165
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:04,787
Please don't hurt him.

1166
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:06,525
He's the only one
left in his family.

1167
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,730
Take the dinosaur
and go to your room.

1168
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:12,304
You take the dinosaur.
Write your confession.

1169
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,273
Yes.

1170
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,394
Pretty soon, there won't be
anyone left in his family!

1171
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,645
O.K., I've got 20 hours.

1172
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,083
I can do it if I don't panic.

1173
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:34,058
Clifford, come on down
and get some lunch.

1174
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:35,958
Clifford?

1175
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,842
(Clifford)
My dearest Uncle Martin,

1176
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,367
I've failed you many ways.

1177
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:51,342
I have taken
the 1:45 train
to San Francisco

1178
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:53,682
to find Sarah Davis.

1179
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,407
With all the love
in my little heart,

1180
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,347
Clifford.

1181
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:02,985
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

1182
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:13,599
Clifford!

1183
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,911
Clifford!

1184
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:24,207
Clifford!

1185
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:34,954
Have you seen this boy?

1186
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,292
No, sir.

1187
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,490
(Train starts)

1188
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,962
Have you seen this boy?

1189
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,664
No.
No, I haven't.

1190
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,310
<i>¶ San Francisco,</i>

1191
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,510
<i>¶ open your golden gate</i>

1192
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,484
<i>¶ you'll let nobody wait</i>

1193
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:09,124
<i>¶ outside your door</i>

1194
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,119
<i>¶ San Francisco,</i>

1195
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,921
<i>¶ here is your wandering one</i>

1196
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:15,923

1199
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:22,728
<i>¶ aaaahhh! ¶</i>

1200
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,467
would you like a hunk?

1201
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:33,935
(Loud music playing
on headphones)

1202
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,718
(Porter) San Francisco.

1203
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,030
(Telephone rings)

1204
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,340
Hello?

1205
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:02,908
Who's this?

1206
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,737
This is Brian.
Who's this?

1207
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,039
Whose house is this?

1208
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,714
Um, it's the kid
who's throwing
the party.

1209
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,853
I think his name is Clifford.

1210
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:16,722
Is Clifford there?

1211
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,760
I saw him in the back

1212
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,757
bashing the shit
out of a pinata.

1213
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:25,589
He said we could party
if we took him
to dinosaur world.

1214
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:26,996
Should I get him?

1215
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,457
I'll get him later.

1216
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:43,084
Where you going?
Uh, the airport.

1217
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,910
Swing by the wemberton hotel.

1218
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,676
(Thunder cracking)

1219
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:56,057
Driver, let's just
forget about the hotel.

1220
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,860
Let's go to the airport.
What am I doing?

1221
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,701
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Stop the car!

1222
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,071
Hey, buddy.

1223
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,869
I'll get out here.

1224
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,470
You'll get hit.
(Horn honks)

1225
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:30,925
This is not just from me.

1226
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,828
This is from us at the company.

1227
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,330
Here,
let me help you
with it here.

1228
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,503
I saw you eyeing it.

1229
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:42,074
There you go.

1230
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,572
Little tight.

1231
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:47,079
You like it?

1232
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:50,007
I don't know what to say.
It's very beautiful,
but I... ahh!

1233
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,951
What?
What's the matter?

1234
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:57,851
Nothing, uh...
It's I'm so excited.

1235
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,485
Ahh!
Excited.

1236
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:03,961
I thought you would be.

1237
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:06,661
I'd like to go
see how it looks on me.

1238
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,134
O.K.
O.K.

1239
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:10,502
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

1240
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,440
What are you doing
spying on me?

1241
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:20,112
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

1242
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,980
What's with the necklace?

1243
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:25,509
The company gave this to me.

1244
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:28,546
I have no intention
of keeping it.

1245
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:32,492
You are such a baby.
Clifford should be
baby-sitting you.

1246
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,989
I prefer baby-sitters
who aren't affiliated

1247
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,992
with the manson family.

1248
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:39,464
What are you talking about?
Where is Clifford?

1249
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:41,163
Don't worry about Clifford.

1250
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:44,965
He's happy with
a ton of sugar
and a book about Hitler.

1251
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,668
What's that supposed to mean?

1252
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:51,470
I mean Clifford
tricked me into coming
to San Francisco.

1253
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:54,005
Why would he do that?

1254
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:57,681
Why? Because he wanted
to throw a party.

1255
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:00,351
You don't know anything
about Hitler... Clifford.

1256
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,320
He's a lying, conniving,
evil little monster.

1257
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,685
You see, Martin,

1258
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,490
that is the reason
you and I can
never get married.

1259
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:14,704
If Clifford were your own,
you'd be talking the same way.

1260
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:17,698
It was all
a big act,
wasn't it?

1261
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,201
The special
relationship
with Clifford.

1262
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,604
The loving Uncle.

1263
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,065
Well, let me
tell you something.

1264
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,573
You're a phony.

1265
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:28,105
Believe me, I can spot a phony.

1266
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:29,242
Excuse me.

1267
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,706
Have you seen a collie?

1268
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,115
No, ma'am, I haven't.

1269
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:40,955
That's why I feel sorry
for you, Martin,

1270
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:45,358
because you're going to
end up one lonely old man.

1271
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,002
Well, I feel sorry for you.

1272
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:51,627
Don't think you won't age.

1273
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,309
Don't call me
a lonely old man
and a phony.

1274
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:16,657
<i>¶ I like the way you move, yeah</i>

1275
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:26,837
<i>¶ I like the way you move, yeah</i>

1276
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,353
<i>¶ I like the way you move ¶</i>

1277
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:48,457
ohh, no!

1278
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,088
You creep!

1279
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,134
Oh!

1280
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:54,029
I think you broke a rib.

1281
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:57,301
I'll break more than that
if you try that again.

1282
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:59,231
(Chuckling)

1283
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,609
As for this stupid thing,

1284
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:06,037
which I had no
intention of keeping...

1285
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:07,183
no?

1286
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,277
No.

1287
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:11,977
Don't think
I don't know
what you're doing

1288
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,852
with your
romantic little dinners

1289
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:16,891
and showering me with gifts.

1290
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,947
What is this thing,
soldered on?

1291
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,556
Ha ha.

1292
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,721
Shut up!

1293
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,656
I'll help.
No!

1294
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,531
Ooh, ooh.

1295
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,360
Oh! Thanks
but no thanks!

1296
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,370
Hmm.

1297
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,435
Aw, honey.

1298
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:36,298
If you think this

1299
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:40,136
frightened little
high school virgin act
is turning me off...

1300
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,652
You're wrong.
Ooh, God!

1301
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,522
Oh, my God!
It's true!

1302
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,750
Ha ha.

1303
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:53,916
Put that back.

1304
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,994
No.

1305
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:57,433
Put that back on my head.

1306
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,760
No, no...
No, you don't!

1307
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:10,743
(Muttering)

1308
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:33,432
Clifford!

1309
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,634
Uncle Martin!

1310
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,307
Uncle Martin,
I'm so glad
you're here!

1311
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:48,981
I got on a train,

1312
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:52,709
but a person
tried to touch
my no-no place!

1313
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,446
There were bikers here,

1314
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,891
and they tied me up,
Uncle Martin!

1315
01:05:56,887 --> 01:06:01,417
And then they told me stories.

1316
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:03,825
Some were fun,
but some were scary!

1317
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,342
(Phone ringing)

1318
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:22,184
Hi.
This is Clifford.

1319
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:25,209
I can't tell you
where Uncle Martin
is right now...

1320
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,146
Hello?

1321
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,994
Clifford?

1322
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,360
Miss Sarah Davis?

1323
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,155
How are you?

1324
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,330
Not very good.

1325
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,588
Why?

1326
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:42,296
Uncle Martin is becoming nuts.

1327
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:45,769
He went away
for the longest time.
He came back crazy.

1328
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:50,770
I know, Clifford,
but I think
he's just overworked.

1329
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:53,414
I'll get the first plane
home in the morning.

1330
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,048
I love you, miss Sarah Davis.

1331
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:58,507
I love you, too, Clifford.

1332
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,083
(Panting)

1333
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,555
Sometimes I scare myself.

1334
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:28,543
(Boards rattling)

1335
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,853
Ohh.

1336
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:36,751
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

1337
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:38,891
Ohh.

1338
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,419
Miss Sarah Davis,
my little mouth is parched

1339
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:44,385
from my long night of bondage.

1340
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,034
You poor, dear darling.

1341
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:48,599
Are you o.K.?
What has he done
to you?

1342
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:52,373
Ask him how he got tied up.

1343
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:55,699
Tell about the bikers
and your damn no-no place.

1344
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:57,605
You stay away from him.

1345
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:01,837
Larry gould didn't make
the bomb threat, he did.

1346
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,075
I don't know what he's saying.

1347
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:06,211
Why is his face twisted so?

1348
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,176
You need help.

1349
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:09,775
He needs help.

1350
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,091
Good. Take him away.

1351
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,720
But don't blame
me when his head
starts spinning around.

1352
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,956
Watch out for the green vomit!

1353
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,142
(Beep)

1354
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,467
Oh, God!

1355
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,813
The cassette.

1356
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,710
My model cassette.
Where is it?

1357
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,110
How did it get out?
Ahh.

1358
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,544
Gee, I don't like him.

1359
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:08,782
We live in an age of gridlock.

1360
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,248
Our projections
for the year 2000

1361
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:13,718
indicate that
the average speed...

1362
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:16,845
Where have you been?

1363
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,623
You should
have been here
an hour ago.

1364
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:21,262
I've been listening
to this idiot...

1365
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:23,118
What are you looking at?

1366
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,726
Nothing.
Good.

1367
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:27,759
Did you make the changes?

1368
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,134
Yes.

1369
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:31,032
Yeah, but you didn't shave.

1370
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:33,804
The press is here.
You look like shit.

1371
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:35,103
I look like shit?

1372
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:37,505
You look like Willie Nelson.

1373
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:39,841
Thank you.

1374
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,005
Ladies and gentlemen,

1375
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,513
I'd like to introduce

1376
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,854
the man who was
the chief designer

1377
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,821
of this entire
mag-trans project.

1378
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,860
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Martin Daniels.

1379
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:56,117
Marty, come on up,
you son of a gun.

1380
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,456
Come on.
They love you.

1381
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:02,226
Hey, go get them.

1382
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,328
Thank you, gentlemen.

1383
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:07,936
Thank you very much.

1384
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:11,309
I just want
to say that...

1385
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:12,738
(screaming)

1386
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,080
Fire extinguisher!

1387
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,092
Look out!

1388
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,390
Congratulations, Clifford.
Brilliant.

1389
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,399
Who the hell
is responsible for this?

1390
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,769
I am.

1391
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:39,631
Then you're fired.

1392
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,704
Of course I am.

1393
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:45,766
And by the way,
I love Willie Nelson.

1394
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:50,352
This is his...

1395
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:52,607
I underestimated the evil one.

1396
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:58,785
Oh, Clifford, what shall we do?

1397
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,460
Whatever shall we do now?

1398
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,291
(Recorder playing)

1399
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,083
<i>¶ I'm Larry the scary Rex</i>

1400
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,881
<i>¶ I'm a scary dinosaur, but...</i>

1401
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:28,583

1404
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:33,722
shut up!

1405
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,736
Well, there it is, Clifford.

1406
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,338
Dinosaur world.

1407
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:53,174
Are you happy?

1408
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:57,246
I'd say I'm the happiest boy
in the whole world,
Uncle mental case.

1409
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,277
I'm the mental case?

1410
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:01,352
You're in the strait jacket.

1411
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:03,321
I imagine when they
put you in yours,

1412
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,890
they'll need
a much larger one, sir.

1413
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,094
That's cute.

1414
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,099
(Beep beep) Hi, Mitchell.

1415
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:19,971
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

1416
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,139
He's crazy about dinosaurs.

1417
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:24,208
I'd like to take him on a tour.

1418
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:25,967
I'll take full responsibility.

1419
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,705
Yes, sir.

1420
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:30,311
And throw some light
on the Rex, would you?

1421
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:31,713
Okey-dokey.

1422
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:06,378
Climb aboard, Clifford.

1423
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,677
Are you excited, Clifford?

1424
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:12,346
Yes, 'cause this has
always been my dream,
Uncle Martin.

1425
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:16,185
The same way as building
a transit system
was always my dream.

1426
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:19,032
Was? Has something
happened to it?

1427
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:22,098
"Has something
happened to it?"

1428
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:23,868
We'll see how you feel
about your dream

1429
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:26,367
after being
on the ride
for 10 hours.

1430
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:29,739
I'd like it even more!

1431
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,069
Then we'll see
how you feel
after 100 hours.

1432
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,119
Wow! Ah!

1433
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:53,030
Oh! Ah!

1434
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,430
Ha ha ha ha!

1435
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,500
Ah! Ha!

1436
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,110
(Squawk)

1437
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:16,576
Hello. I'm Terry
the pterodactyl.

1438
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:19,086
I'd turn back if I were you.

1439
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,658
Larry is in a horrid mood.

1440
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:23,928
Things haven't
been going well
around here.

1441
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,257
(Rumble)

1442
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,261
Oh, dear!
An earthquake!

1443
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:28,833
Ah! Ah!

1444
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:30,495
Aah!

1445
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:02,196
Whoa! Ah!

1446
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:04,529
Ha ha!

1447
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,512
Heh heh heh!

1448
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:18,614
Oh!

1449
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,052
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1450
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:31,086
(Squawk)

1451
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:34,495
(Squawk)

1452
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:37,267
You'd better
get out before
it's too late.

1453
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,401
Save yourself.

1454
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,842
No one has ever
wandered into
Larry's lair

1455
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:43,908
and lived to tell the tale.

1456
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,420
Aah!

1457
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:57,249
(Grrr)

1458
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,086
(Grrr)

1459
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,458
(Grrr)

1460
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,795
Oh, boy.
You're big.

1461
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,430
(Grrr)

1462
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:17,873
(Terry) Use your laser.

1463
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:20,344
It's the only chance
of surviving.

1464
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:26,511
Lady luck, you owe me.

1465
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:29,918
(Grr)

1466
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:41,098
Steffen, we did it!

1467
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,397
We killed that big lug.

1468
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,229
(Terry) Bravo!

1469
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:48,574
And don't forget
our new frozen-yogurt bar.

1470
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:50,541
<i>¶ Larry the scary Rex</i>

1471
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,410
<i>¶ he's a scary dinosaur</i>

1472
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:54,308
<i>¶ but don't be scared</i>
<i>of his sharp, sharp teeth</i>

1473
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,240
<i>¶ or his mighty, mighty roar</i>

1474
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,205
<i>¶ he loves kids,</i>
<i>and kids love him</i>

1475
01:16:58,214 --> 01:16:59,384
<i>¶ even though his... ¶</i>

1476
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:03,081
was that scary?

1477
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,786
That was fun!

1478
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,217
How many years
will you get
for kidnapping me,

1479
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:08,463
Uncle 10-most-wanted?

1480
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:12,755
Life. Let's go
a little faster,
shall we?

1481
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:13,892
Yes!

1482
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:21,703
Ah!

1483
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:24,843
Aah!

1484
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:27,806
Aah!

1485
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:35,483
Was that scary?

1486
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,289
Not at all.

1487
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,447
Ah, a thought occurred to me.

1488
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:43,816
Do you think
that miss Sarah
and Mr. Ellis

1489
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,726
perhaps would name
their first child
Martin?

1490
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:49,163
That is so cute.

1491
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:54,103
You know, Clifford,
I really shouldn't
put this in hyperdrive,

1492
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:56,703
but I just can't seem
to help myself.

1493
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:58,706
Oh, well...

1494
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:03,712
Ah!

1495
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,245
Ha ha!

1496
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:09,781
Aah!

1497
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:12,247
Oh, boy!

1498
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:17,058
Aah!

1499
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,360
Hee hee!

1500
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:19,761
Hee hee hee!

1501
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:23,230
Hello. I'm Terry
the pterodactyl.

1502
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:26,628
I'd turn back if I were you.

1503
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:27,796
I'd turn back if I were you.

1504
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:31,736
(Grrr)

1505
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:33,965
Ah!

1506
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:09,611
Ah!

1507
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:23,961
Someone help!

1508
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,379
Uncle Martin, save me!

1509
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:53,615
Uncle Martin?

1510
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:55,393
I'm thinking it over.

1511
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:57,892
Please. I'm scared.

1512
01:19:57,894 --> 01:20:00,734
I'm scared of
what might happen
if I save you.

1513
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:03,600
Maybe I should do mankind
a tremendous favor...

1514
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:04,999
let that dinosaur eat you.

1515
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:09,639
What horrors you might unleash!

1516
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:12,069
What if you
got your hands
on some plutonium?

1517
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,614
"I just made
the bestest
nuclear bomb

1518
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,409
in the whole wide world."

1519
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,180
Aah!

1520
01:20:19,782 --> 01:20:20,882
Ah!

1521
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,325
Uncle Martin!

1522
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:37,429
Aah!

1523
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,380
Take my hand.

1524
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:49,937
Come on!
(Grrr)

1525
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:51,613
(Grrr)

1526
01:20:54,317 --> 01:20:55,947
Help me, please.

1527
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:09,225
Uh! Ah! Come on!

1528
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:10,462
(Grrr)

1529
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:29,224
(Grrr)

1530
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:34,386
I'm sorry.

1531
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,260
No, Clifford, don't!

1532
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:38,229
I don't want to hug you.

1533
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,557
I can't imagine
anyone ever
wanting to hug you.

1534
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:43,057
But I really am sorry.

1535
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,365
You really are sorry?

1536
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:47,067
You know, sorrow
is a human emotion.

1537
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,439
As we know, you're
not a human boy.

1538
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:53,008
You're just
this, this
destructive thing.

1539
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:55,839
Eventually,
everyone just
gets to hate you.

1540
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:01,776
Let's go.

1541
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:06,686
If that's how you feel,
why should I go
with you, then?

1542
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,717
Then don't go with me.

1543
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:12,456
It's your choice.

1544
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:19,595
(Clifford)
For the first
time in my life,

1545
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:21,472
I felt very confused.

1546
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,110
I had thought
that I didn't care

1547
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,438
how Uncle Martin felt about me,

1548
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:31,375
but I was wrong,

1549
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:34,948
and his words
had devastated me.

1550
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:38,689
And I thought
I was so clever...

1551
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:43,819
And yet I hadn't figured out
until that moment...

1552
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:48,759
That if you destroy everyone

1553
01:22:48,764 --> 01:22:51,504
who stands in the way
of your dreams...

1554
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,569
Then you end up alone...

1555
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:58,535
With no dreams at all.

1556
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,912
Is that what will happen to me?

1557
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:08,216
You?

1558
01:23:09,919 --> 01:23:13,249
No. You're much
too intelligent
for that.

1559
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:22,102
Did your Uncle
ever forgive you?

1560
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:24,298
I begged him to.

1561
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,440
I sent him
over 287 letters
of apology,

1562
01:23:28,437 --> 01:23:30,697
all of them returned unopened.

1563
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:34,481
You're improving, lofty.

1564
01:23:34,477 --> 01:23:35,837
Ha ha ha!

1565
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:39,353
Whatever became
of his girl friend?

1566
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,048
Miss Sarah Davis.

1567
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:45,485
Well, one day, out of the blue,

1568
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:48,488
which is an expression
we used to use back then,

1569
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:51,561
I received
a phone call
from her...

1570
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,260
With the bestest
request in the whole
wide world.

1571
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:41,040
Uncle Martin had forgiven me,

1572
01:24:41,043 --> 01:24:44,413
and that single
act of kindness
changed my life.

1573
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:48,883
Thank you, father.

1574
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:50,784
You're welcome, Roger.

1575
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:57,455
Hey, father.

1576
01:24:58,227 --> 01:24:59,827
You were some kid.

1577
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:05,067
I'd really have
to go a long way
to match you,

1578
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:06,297
but I won't.

1579
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:07,772
Why is that?

1580
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:09,470
I want people to like me.

1581
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,770
How will you do that, Roger?

1582
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:15,705
I'm going to write
287 letters of apology.

1583
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:18,412
Ah...

1584
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:19,654
See you next week, father.

1585
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,853
Bye-bye.

1586
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:35,061
Mission accomplished,
old friend.

1587
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:06,212
