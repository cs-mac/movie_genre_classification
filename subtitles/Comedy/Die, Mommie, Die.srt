1
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,266
Well?

2
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,709
<i>I am sending you the code.</i>

3
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:48,072
Yes I see that, thank you.

4
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,467
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

5
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:20,104
<i>I have just sent it,
you should have it.</i>

6
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:21,735
Yes, thank you.

7
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:23,529
<i>Are you sure that this is legal?</i>

8
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,018
<i>We are just running a test on our
security systems, Sir,</i>

9
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:27,259
<i>it is fine.</i>

10
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,724
<i>You have a sexy voice. Uhh, is
there anything else we can do for you?</i>

11
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:33,382
- To you?
- We have all we need.

12
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:45,762
Ready.

13
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,953
Yo, guess who just made 50,000 today.

14
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,829
- What did you do to my drive, man?
- Man, shut up I didn't touch it.

15
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:10,565
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

16
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:21,544
The diagnostics show no damage but we are
certain that it was an intentional breech.

17
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:23,196
Are you saying we were hacked?

18
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,982
It wasn't a denial of service level.

19
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,850
They definitely cracked our door.

20
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,892
OK. Open the "Black Eye" files.

21
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,498
I want every hacker in the country,

22
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,967
who could have done this,
interviewed, now.

23
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:35,703
Sir, that is close to a thousand names.

24
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,601
With the holiday weekend,
we are short staffed as it is.

25
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,173
Listen...

26
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,810
We are the ones who are supposed
to keep this from happening...

27
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:41,865
And it just happen to us.

28
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:42,850
Get it done.

29
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,931
Sir, it is the middle of the night and they
are scattered all over the whole country.

30
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,925
Fine, get local law enforcement help.

31
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:51,734
Somebody thinks they can screw with us.
I want to find out who.

32
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,983
Jim, I said no.

33
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,569
Lucy, you're killing me, alright?

34
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:23,816
- Get out of the car.
- What?

35
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,733
- Get out of the car, now!
- Don't touch me.

36
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,762
- No means no jerk-off.
- What are you doing?

37
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,935
- John, stop it!
- Oh, don't call me that.

38
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,742
I hate it when you call me that.

39
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:34,345
- Do you know this guy?
- Shut up, just shut your mouth. Right now!

40
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:35,449
Dad!

41
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,094
Stop it! I mean it!

42
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,070
Dad? You said your dad was dead.

43
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:40,075
What?

44
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:42,755
You told this jerk-off I was dead?

45
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:46,677
- You actually said that?
- I may have exaggerated a little bit.

46
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,371
And is this guy what, your boyfriend?

47
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,026
- No!
- Yes!

48
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,086
I don't know, okay?
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:56,205
We will see.

50
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,224
What are you doing here?

51
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,328
You don't answer your phone,
you don't return my calls.

52
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,093
That is because I am not
talking to you.

53
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,498
Why aren't you talking
to me this time, Lucy?

54
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:06,846
Why not?

55
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,178
What? You want a list?

56
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,546
How about stuff like this:
You spy on me!

57
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:11,884
Do I spy on you?

58
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,730
You come over here and
drag my boyfriend of the car...

59
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:15,640
- You said that he is not your boyfriend.
- He is not!

60
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:18,781
- But you said that I was...
- God! Just...

61
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,157
You are such an asshole.

62
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:24,907
OK.

63
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,282
I am sorry for pulling your
not boyfriend out of the car.

64
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:29,516
OK?

65
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,803
Let's just get in the car.

66
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,287
No!

67
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,058
- Won't both of you just go away?
- Talk to me, Lucy.

68
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,229
I am tired and I am going for bed.
Alone.

69
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,344
You are damn right alone.

70
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,100
Lucy, wait one minute.

71
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,041
I want to talk to you.
Just wait.

72
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,512
Dad.

73
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,959
When I want to talk to you,

74
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,981
IF I want to talk to you...

75
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,332
I'll call you.

76
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:58,879
Lucy!

77
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,640
Wait, Lucy! Lucy!

78
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:05,380
- Lucy McClane!
- It is not McClane, it is Gennero.

79
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:09,038
Chicks, right?

80
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:14,394
I'm gonna go.

81
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,682
I'll go.

82
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:45,130
<i>John!</i>

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,758
<i>John!</i>

84
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,220
<i>It is Sclavino.</i>

85
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:51,970
This is McClane.

86
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:55,250
- What are you doing at Rutgers?
- How do you know where I am?

87
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,849
We had all the cars tracked
4 years ago, you remember.

88
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,144
I am looking exactly
at where you are.

89
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,276
So that's not something
that I would turn on.

90
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,123
Yes, we did that, John.

91
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,666
We turned them on.

92
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,660
Listen...

93
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,427
The feds have called in a favour.

94
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:09,846
<i>They are doing a sweep.</i>

95
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:12,674
They want us to pick up a
a computer hacker in Camden.

96
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:14,612
The last name is Farrell.

97
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,546
<i>The first name is Matthew.</i>

98
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:17,729
Camden?

99
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:18,886
<i>What are you telling me for?</i>

100
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,130
<i>It's 3 in the morning.
I'm on my way home.</i>

101
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,380
Send a jug-head from the Academy.
They will be happy to go pick this kid up.

102
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:27,387
I can't just send in uniform.

103
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,903
<i>The feds demanded
a senior detective.</i>

104
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,034
<i>The kid is a high value subject.</i>

105
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:33,925
<i>I don't know.
Just pick him up.</i>

106
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,329
Escort him to the
Hoover building in Washington.

107
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:40,222
They had some kind of
computer breech there this morning.

108
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,359
Right.

109
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,253
Give me the information.

110
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:47,223
Give me that name again
What is it?

111
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,122
You owe me one, Jack.

112
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,499
God damn it.

113
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:31,519
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

114
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,413
Open the door, please.

115
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,698
- Hi.
- NYPD?

116
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,165
Yeah.
I get it.

117
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:48,260
Don't worry, everyone gets lost
round here, glad to help

118
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,819
Kid, I'm not lost.

119
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,873
Are you Matt Farrell?
Matthew Farrell?

120
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:52,785
No...

121
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,898
Actually, he doesn't live here anymore.

122
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,896
Of course not.
Who are you?

123
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,722
My name is Daisy Duke.

124
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,780
I got a lot of shit for
when I was a kid.

125
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:02,923
Please, don't add to it.

126
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:06,489
Can I see some identification, please?

127
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:07,817
Yeah, sure.

128
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,942
Detective!
Yeah that looks real.

129
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:16,073
Where did you get that?
Toys R Us?

130
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,123
It looks great.

131
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,448
That...

132
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,477
That actually looks pretty good.

133
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,158
Farrell!

134
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,961
Soldier just pdld a new copy of the killzone.
Do you want to come to take a look?

135
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,597
No, thanks though man!

136
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,366
And good luck at the bad timing awards.

137
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,178
Open the door.

138
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:35,670
Shit!

139
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:42,734
Can I get you something?
Coffee, warrant?

140
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,985
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

141
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:47,684
Some kind of computer thing.

142
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,693
The DC Feds wanna talk to you.

143
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:50,904
So, let's go.

144
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,151
- Feds, huh?
- Yeah, the Feds.

145
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,666
I've been watched for four years.

146
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:07,610
Once you are on that goddamn
list, such a pain in the ass.

147
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,393
Do you play with dolls?

148
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,440
Uhh, could you please
not touch that.

149
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,336
- Is it like a G.I. Joe?
- No, it is not!

150
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,314
It is a limited edition of...

151
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:19,174
- Is that meant to come off?
- No, it is not.

152
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,898
But it is much more valuable broken.
So thanks for that.

153
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:24,860
Crazy glue, I'm sure it's
very important.

154
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,468
I have other cool shit in
here if you want to break that.

155
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,076
Let's go, OK? Come on!

156
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,589
I've got to power down my gear, ok?

157
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,688
More dolls.

158
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,532
You don't spend a whole load of
time with the girls, huh?

159
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,833
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

160
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:44,682
Please! Don't shoot.

161
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,070
- Don't shoot.
- Get down!

162
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:56,051
Keep your head down.

163
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:16,944
Let's go, come on.
Stay down.

164
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,434
Come on.

165
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:28,976
- Is everything alright?
- Stay down.

166
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:30,266
Stay down.

167
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:32,680
- You stay with me.
- OK.

168
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,523
- Follow me.
- OK.

169
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:39,025
Right.

170
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,121
That's gonna wake the neighbours.

171
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:00,695
Get down, get inside.
Get down!

172
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,085
They are back in the room!

173
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,763
<i>They are back in the room!</i>

174
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,512
Are you nuts?

175
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,938
- Get out of there right now!
- I am trying...

176
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,011
Now!

177
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,060
Go to the right.

178
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,598
Let's go!

179
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:57,413
Get back in there!

180
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,132
Get ready to run.

181
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,554
Ready?

182
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,281
What the hell was that?

183
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:25,881
What?

184
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,445
Did you do that?

185
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,151
No.

186
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:30,203
Shit.

187
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,451
I didn't do that.

188
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,203
- Let's go.
- Shit.

189
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:35,233
Stay close to me.

190
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,586
OK.

191
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,495
Let's go.

192
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,526
Come on, let's go damn it!

193
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,304
Let's go.

194
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:44,487
Let's go!

195
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:47,477
Watch it.
Just tone it down.

196
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:48,891
OK.

197
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,129
Let's go!

198
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,668
Stay close.

199
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:10,494
Stay with me.

200
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,671
- Stay with me.
- Right!

201
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,452
Let's go.
Stay close.

202
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,707
Get in the car.

203
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,061
- Go, go.
- Yes.

204
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,812
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

205
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:33,704
- Can you reload a gun?
- Oh, yeah...

206
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:38,651
Look in the glove box and get a
magazine out right now!

207
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,396
Get your head down.

208
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:22,634
Is the circus in town?

209
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:35,151
- Did you see that?
- I saw it. I did it.

210
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:39,468
Camden Base 10077, come back.

211
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,739
Camden Base 10077.

212
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,360
<i>Camden Base go ahead.</i>

213
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:46,338
I need to speak with your chief,
this is a police emergency.

214
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,042
ASAP.

215
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,679
<i>Standby.</i>

216
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,087
<i>This is chief detective Wiesman.</i>

217
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,430
Chief Detective, this is Detective
John McClane of the NYPD.

218
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:54,958
Police Emergency.

219
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:58,109
I want to report a police
shooting in your jurisdiction.

220
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,216
Yes.

221
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,586
What's the status?

222
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:27,736
Hold the line.

223
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:49,442
Thomas.

224
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,525
We have a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell is still alive.

225
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:57,525
- So he got away?
- Yes.

226
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,958
I did send 5 of you, is that right?

227
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,894
I am sending the chopper, get airborne.
We will track him down.

228
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,221
<i>Think you can handle that?</i>

229
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:13,052
Oh my God!

230
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,734
- Just breathe.
- I am breathing, but...

231
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,807
- I can't stop shaking.
- It is the adrenaline.

232
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,484
You are just scared.
It will pass.

233
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,371
Of course I'm scared.

234
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:25,536
Weren't you scared, back there?

235
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:26,682
Yes.

236
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:28,872
I was scared.

237
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,122
Really?
This is you being scared?

238
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,430
I dunno, you seem really calm.

239
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,268
Have you done stuff like that before?

240
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,974
Stuff like what?

241
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:40,116
Like killing people.

242
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:42,557
Yes.

243
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,345
Not for a long time.

244
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:48,020
Who were those guys?

245
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:52,624
Why did they try to kill you?
Why did they blow up my apartment?

246
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,888
They were there to kill you.

247
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,893
Why would they want to kill me?

248
00:19:57,903 --> 00:19:59,386
You tell me, kid.

249
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,169
You're the criminal.

250
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,556
We got 7 dead hackers so far,
none high on our list

251
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,390
Collect the hard drives
and start sweeping them..

252
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:23,406
Yes, Sir.

253
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:29,620
Trey...

254
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,038
Matthew Farrell,
Find him for me.

255
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:33,194
On it.

256
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,791
What's with all the guns?

257
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,681
Operational prudence.

258
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:44,808
Think of them as hardware
to your software.

259
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:57,943
<i>Good morning D.C.</i>

260
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:01,336
<i>Well it' shaping up to be
another beautiful 4th of July weekend.</i>

261
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,859
<i>If you've got any big plans,
you better get started early.</i>

262
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,372
<i>Because it looks like the
traffic is hotting up.</i>

263
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:10,696
<i>So another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.</i>

264
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:13,035
What?

265
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:14,708
What?

266
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,826
What are you doing?
What is that?

267
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,189
It is Credence.

268
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:19,901
- Credence?
- Credence.

269
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,033
Credence Clearwater Revival.

270
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,202
- Classic rock.
- I know who it is.

271
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,740
It is old rock,
that does not make it classic.

272
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,851
What sucked back then
still sucks now.

273
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,286
You don't like Credence?

274
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:33,364
It is like having a pine cone
shoved up my ass.

275
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:34,770
OK, really...

276
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:36,411
Wow, that's mature!

277
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,600
Come on man.

278
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:44,804
<i>We are at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.</i>

279
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,497
Listen up everyone.

280
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,249
Are we ready?

281
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:54,591
The transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

282
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,125
Begin stage 1.

283
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:33,135
When was the last time you tuned
in your radio to pop music?

284
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,733
Give me any decade.

285
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:36,867
Was it the seventies?

286
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:39,198
Did Michael Jackson still play?

287
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:41,955
Pearl Jam.
I'm going back about 10 years.

288
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,287
Ten years.

289
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,844
Twenty years. The Cure? Nothing?

290
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:46,879
It's called News Radio.

291
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:50,394
I'm trying to see if any of your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

292
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:51,361
Hold on.

293
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,743
- You listen to the news?
- Yeah, you have a problem with the news now?

294
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:58,868
Yes, I have a big God damned
problem with the news.

295
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,154
Are you ready for this?

296
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,717
The news is completely manipulated.

297
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:05,843
Everything that you hear
every single day...

298
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:09,475
Is designed by corporate media
to do one thing only.

299
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:10,589
Jesus!

300
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,183
To keep you living in fear.

301
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,445
- Oh fear?
- Total fear.

302
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:15,497
Fear so you will go out and
spend money on things.

303
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,911
Things you probably don't even need.
Things you should already be sick of.

304
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:20,308
So that their advertisers keep
buying adds on their stations.

305
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:21,937
And I tell one more thing.
Are you ready for this?

306
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:25,057
I can do this all day man.
I've got days of data at home.

307
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,834
I'll drop a bomb on you bigger...

308
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:28,676
- HEY!
- SHUT UP!

309
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:29,917
That's good, that's good,
be dismissive

310
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:30,968
You...

311
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,441
- Are you alright?
- No, I am not alright.

312
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:28,425
Stay in the car.
You will be alright.

313
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:32,501
Hey man! Hey.

314
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,287
How are you doing, you alright?

315
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:38,079
Just call 911, alright?

316
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,583
Jesus Christ.

317
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,497
All of the lights are green.

318
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:07,985
All of the lights are green.

319
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:09,195
Let's go, right now.

320
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,520
- We gotta go?
- Let's go.

321
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:12,617
Get your bag hack boy.
Let's go.

322
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:15,663
- Jesus.
- Let's go.

323
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:17,383
I've never been in a crash.
Are you alright?

324
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,430
Well it is very exciting.
This way, here we go.

325
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:21,709
- Have you ever been in a car accident?
- Yes, I have been in a car accident.

326
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,861
What are we doing?

327
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:27,166
A little thing they invented back
in the 60s, it's called jogging.

328
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:41,301
Sir, Chicago is reporting a
system crash in their train network

329
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,991
Amtrak is flashing a level 1
crash of their system

330
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:52,071
F.A.A. Just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC Net just went down.

331
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:53,751
We are under attack.

332
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:56,734
OK.

333
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:01,005
Let's get them outside
for a little bit of fresh air.

334
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,687
That is the Anthrax Alarm.

335
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,621
Alright, everyone out, Now!

336
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:16,717
Now!

337
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:21,040
Taylor, move, go.

338
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,305
Move!

339
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:42,630
<i>All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately.</i>

340
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,805
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

341
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,846
<i>All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately.</i>

342
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,386
Take the team and go for
the fourth floor. Got it?

343
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:21,807
Masks on.

344
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,200
Make it happen, OK?

345
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:28,049
Research the data
from these crashes,

346
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:31,375
see if you can ID the
point of origin.

347
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:34,449
Begin Stage 2.

348
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:42,835
<i>Hey what is going on?</i>

349
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:44,515
<i>What is happening?</i>

350
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,593
They are already starting to panic.

351
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:57,769
Of course they are.

352
00:27:58,337 --> 00:28:00,767
They think that someone
is taking their money.

353
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:03,690
All of those nickel
and dimes they saved.

354
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,039
Useful idiots,
as Lyman would say.

355
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,492
Prep the video package.

356
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:25,583
DC transportation system is crashing

357
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,240
And they just hit the
financial sector. Everything.

358
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:33,153
Call the Secretary of Trans, the
Treasury and the Director of F.C.C.

359
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,378
Let's go people!

360
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:36,993
Somebody, somewhere,
has left a digital fingerprint.

361
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,166
Find it!

362
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:40,270
Is Deputy Director Bowman in here?

363
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:42,913
- Not now it will have to wait.
- Not today waxworks.

364
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:44,504
This is Matthew Farrell.

365
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,446
I brought him here on direct
orders from Bowman.

366
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:49,078
So if you don't know what's going on,
go find me somebody who does.

367
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,381
I am Bowman.

368
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:59,781
The video package is
ready for upload.

369
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:03,027
Thanks.

370
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:03,845
Listen, John.

371
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:06,293
I thank for bringing Farrell,
but everything's changed this morning

372
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:08,242
We are neck deep in
damage control right now.

373
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:09,629
Excuse me, I'm sorry, Sir.

374
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,359
Do you have something to eat?
Any snacks around here?

375
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,722
I would love... I am
really low on blood sugar.

376
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:15,831
Sir?

377
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:17,476
No?

378
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:25,774
<i>As if the crash of the traffic
system wasn't bad enough.</i>

379
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,839
<i>The Stock Market found itself
in a selling frenzy this afternoon.</i>

380
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:34,310
<i>The Federal Trade Commission believes this panic
might have triggered by computer malfunction.</i>

381
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:35,830
<i>What we thought to be related...</i>

382
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,708
Oh man, that is all bad.

383
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,177
It's not as bad as it looks.

384
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:43,326
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

385
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:45,840
- Are these your suspects?
- They were.

386
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:49,041
All seven were killed
in the last 24 hours.

387
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:52,245
Do you recognize any of them?

388
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:55,270
No.

389
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:56,815
Not one?

390
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,481
Sir.

391
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:00,770
You need to see something here.

392
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:13,614
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

393
00:30:13,624 --> 00:30:15,214

00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,805
It's not an authorised broadcast.

398
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:23,498
<i>What your country can do...</i>

399

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,872

401
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,791

<i>We will not tire.</i>

425
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,975
<i>We will not falter.</i>

426
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:06,047
<i>And we will not fail.</i>

427
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,419
I don't know how they
are getting in.

428
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:09,890
<i>Thank you.</i>

429
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:11,096
<i>And a...
Happy...</i>

430
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:13,525
Independence Day...
to everyone!

431
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:17,945
That was creepy.

432
00:31:18,848 --> 00:31:21,453
I tried to find more Nixon.

433
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:22,937
Do you think they bought it?

434
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:24,785
Absolutely.

435
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,012
OK.

436
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,318
I want telecommunications, transports and...

437
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:33,664
Jesus Christ! It's a Fire Sale.

438
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:34,621
What?

439
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:37,458
It's a Fire Sale.

440
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:39,692
Hey, we don't know that yet.

441
00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:41,270
It is a myth anyway.
It cannot be done.

442
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:42,642
Oh it's a myth?
Really?

443
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:45,618
Please tell me she's only here for show
and she's not actually in charge of anything.

444
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:48,397
- What is a Fire Sale?
- It is a three step...

445
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:52,104
It is a three step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

446
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:54,471
Ok Step 1: Take out all
the transportation

447
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:56,647
Step 2: The financial base and telecoms

448
00:31:56,761 --> 00:32:00,442
Step 3: Get rid of all the utilities.
Gas, Water, Electricity, Nuclear...

449
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,248
Basically everything that is
controlled by a computer.

450
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:04,603
Which today, is almost everything.

451
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:07,955
So that's why they call it a Fire Sale
because everything must go.

452
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,074
Hey, listen, what's your name?

453
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:12,571
Farrell?
Keep your voice down OK?

454
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,997
Nobody here is talking about a Fire Sale.

455
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,903
Not unless you are telling me
you helped plan one.

456
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:20,884
No man, I'm just saying...

457
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,799
We appreciate the concern, we
know what we are doing, thank you.

458
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:26,111
What?

459
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:29,311
- What?
- Nothing, I said I understand.

460
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:32,960
Hey, they didn't send the
girl scouts to get this kid.

461
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,861
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear,

462
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,401
they blew the whole joint up.

463
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:39,510
Now look, I don't know this kid...

464
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,769
And, frankly, I don't give a shit.
No of fence.

465
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:44,131
But somebody wants this kid dead.

466
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:48,724
And obviously, it's got something
to do with what's going on here.

467
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:51,270
Humler is taking over
the interrogations,

468
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:52,738
of the hackers that we are bringing in.

469
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:55,170
I will get you an escort over there.

470
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:58,476
Right? Molina, get this kid
to the front of the line.

471
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,298
- I want to know what he knows.
- Right.

472
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,080
If he knew about half of what I know,
his fuzzy little head would explode.

473
00:33:05,296 --> 00:33:07,302
Special agent Johnson.
I will take you there.

474
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:10,247
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right.

475
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,059
Right this way.

476
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:17,266
- So is any of what you were saying possible?
- Possible?

477
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:20,670
OK look, I will tell you again.
If you take away any one thing, no problem,

478
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:23,846
but if you take it down all at once,
the system crashes, and...

479
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,993
Look around, man!

480
00:33:26,364 --> 00:33:30,800
Come on, the government has got to have
dozens of departments dedicated to that shit.

481
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:35,073
It took FEMA 5 days to get
water to the superdome.

482
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:00,890
How long until we get to
the Dept. Of Homeland Security?

483
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:04,970
Lauflin, get on the police band and get
them to clear a route to the D.H.S.

484
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:09,071
DC Metro, this is the
F.B.I., requesting you to...

485
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,234
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

486
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:16,675
The feds are taking him to Homeland.

487
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,634
Good, close that loop now.

488
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:19,808
Isolate the frequency.

489
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:23,935
Locate the vehicles and get
me John McClane's file.

490
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:28,991
<i>Brad, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for location.</i>

491
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:33,021
I don't mean to harp guys but

492
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:36,593
but have just passed another
snack bar and I am starving.

493
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,628
- Shut up.
- I need to eat.

494
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,309
Shut up.

495
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:43,693
Shut up. You have 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me back there.

496
00:34:43,806 --> 00:34:46,287
Did I lie to you?
What are you talking about?

497
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,257
The pictures on the wall.
You knew those guys, right?

498
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,918
- I, wha..., I...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

499
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:55,645
I am a cop, I can tell you
are lying. Who are they?

500
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:00,259
OK, OK, OK...

501
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,571
They were my competition.

502
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,063
Make the next right onto Concord.

503
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,344
They said they were a software firm
that had developed some kind of

504
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:13,843
a new algorithm

505
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:16,921
and they just wanted to see
if it could be cracked.

506
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:19,905
That's what I do,
I do math based security.

507
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,312
Here's the thing,

508
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:29,763
the thing that I've been thinking is
that if you can do something this massive

509
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:31,547
you need tons of start-up guys
to write the software

510
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:33,280
but only a few black hats

511
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:35,384
to actually implement that stuff

512
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,537
so then the start-up guys
who haven't really done anything

513
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:40,779
- like me...
- End up as pictures on a wall

514
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,394
I swear to God McClane
I had no idea I was gonna be

515
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,528
an accessory to Armageddon

516
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:52,145
<i>Take the next left at Lexington.</i>

517
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,792
And that's a sexy voice.

518
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:56,862
What is she taking us this way for?

519
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:58,472
Oh, my God!

520
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:00,942
<i>Unit this is dispatch
clear a route for two F.B.I. Vehicles...</i>

521
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:02,791
<i>F.B.I. We have cleared a path.</i>

522
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,006
- That's her!
- Her who?

523
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,580
What are you talking about?

524
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:09,383
It is them.

525
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,364
- Are you saying it's "them" them?
- I swear to you, I know her.

526
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:15,442
I would know her voice anywhere.

527
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,828
- Don't say anything.
- Keep you mouth shut for a minute.

528
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:23,071
Hey Metro,
how's your day going over there?

529
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:26,897
Gotta be crazy over there
with all these 5-87s, huh?

530
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:29,826
Yes, Sir, we had to
dispatch all units.

531
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:32,942
Yeah you had to dispatch all units,

532
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:35,784
for all the naked people walking around?

533
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:39,946
Cut the bullshit honey
and just put your boss on.

534
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:45,399
<i>Lauflin, we are getting off this route
make a left here on 14th street..</i>

535
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,694
- Officer McClane.
- That is Detective McClane, asshole.

536
00:36:58,022 --> 00:37:00,689
Don't worry though, we will have
plenty of time to get to know each other...

537
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,774
When I come visit you in prison.

538
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:06,747
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

539
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,743
Your address in Brooklyn...

540
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:13,492
The payments on your mortgage,
how long you have been in the NYPD

541
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:17,505
and how is Holly?
That's sad, you are divorced.

542
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,399
Was that tough on little
Jack and Lucy?

543
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:27,098
After thirty years, I would have thought
you had a better pension plan.

544
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,348
Oh and it gets worse...

545
00:37:32,192 --> 00:37:34,655
Your 401k no longer exists

546
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,741
Tell you what, let me
make it up to you.

547
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,907
Box them in at that intersection.

548
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,123
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,
and drive away

549
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,881
by the time you get to
the end of the next block,

550
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:48,090
all your debts will
be wiped clean...

551
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:51,517
And your children
will be set for life.

552
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,173
That really is tempting,
especially that last part.

553
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,362
But I think I'll pass, jerk off.

554
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:03,407
John, you are a Timex
watch in a digital age.

555
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:04,849
You are gonna lose.

556
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:09,245
Yes, well the other thing that can happen,
it is that I can come and find you...

557
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,593
Kick your ass and throw you
out of your own party.

558
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:15,453
- What do you think about that dickhead?
- Hold your position.

559
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,963
He is not responding.

560
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:24,757
Down, get down!

561
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,497
Officers down at the corner
of Main with Constitution.

562
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:39,664
I repeat, officers down.

563
00:38:57,574 --> 00:38:59,572
Come on, come on,
get out let's go!

564
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,444
God Damn it!

565
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,118
Stay down!

566
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:13,147
Get down, just hold on!

567
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,533
We have a squad car under fire
we need backup.

568
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,959
<i>I Repeat, we need backup!</i>

569
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:29,926
This is base, we are
sending backup.

570
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,304
Hang on, hang on.

571
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:53,110
Hang on.

572
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:10,402
Hold on.

573
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,654
- We lost...
- Stay with them.

574
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,267
OK take the tunnel, left left left!

575
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:05,690
Give me the schematics
of that tunnel.

576
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,286
The tunnel!

577
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:18,831
Open the gates on the
North side entrance.

578
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,878
Redirect traffic,
occupy all lanes.

579
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,622
- Open the other side.
- What?

580
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:49,167
Move!

581
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,961
Hang on to something!

582
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:34,456
Hey, don't get out of the car!
Hey!

583
00:42:41,942 --> 00:42:43,399
Stop!

584
00:42:56,246 --> 00:42:57,911
Run!

585
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:05,784
Oh God!

586
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:14,448
Don't ever hesitate
like that again.

587
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:16,424
Are you alright?

588
00:43:21,774 --> 00:43:25,040
- Stay here, don't move.
- What?

589
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:26,942
You've been here before John.

590
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:29,769
Get over to the wall, Sir.

591
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,909
The feds called in a favour.

592
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:37,916
All you gotta do is pick
up a kid in Jersey...

593
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,832
Drive him down to DC.

594
00:43:39,963 --> 00:43:43,513
How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard now, can it?

595
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:47,215
No, gotta be a senior detective

596
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:53,584
think that a traffic jam

597
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:56,978
or throwing a car at me
will stop me, huh?

598
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:58,591
Red, get in there and get it done.

599
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:14,766
This is not a good idea!

600
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:56,429
- Don't touch me!
- Ok, ok, sorry, sorry...

601
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,620
Are you OK? Oh my God!

602
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:03,729
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh yeah lucky!

603
00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:07,470
Jesus, you just killed a
helicopter with a car.

604
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:09,249
I was out of bullets.

605
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:13,672
How you doin'?

606
00:45:13,684 --> 00:45:17,111
I skinned my knee and my
asthma is acting up...

607
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:19,997
Whatever, yeah I'm fine.

608
00:45:32,665 --> 00:45:34,046
<i>Red, check in.</i>

609
00:45:38,184 --> 00:45:40,221
What about Farrell and McClane?

610
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:43,597
- They are both dead.
- Come back in.

611
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:46,157
OK we are moving on,
begin Stage 3.

612
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,173
I have just spoken to Emmerson.

613
00:45:48,184 --> 00:45:49,785
The teams are arriving
at Woodlawn now.

614
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:51,584
Very good.

615
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:54,052
Mai, get ready for the downloads.

616
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,479
I.D, Sir.

617
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:05,688
Park behind the transpo
and we'll lead you in.

618
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,076
Man the gate, you come with me.

619
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:17,604
The anthrax alarms only went off
across five floors.

620
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:20,672
Below that you will
need clearance.

621
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:23,201
I don't know why you would
need to go down there

622
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:26,207
there is nothing down there but servers.

623
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,673
<i>All clear. Rodriguez!</i>

624
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,045
<i>Incoming.</i>

625
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:52,222
- The gate is secured.
- Copy.

626
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:03,254
OK, we are in.

627
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:44,104
Hey, this is absurd, man.
There is tough and there is stupid.

628
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:47,349
You've got to go to the
hospital, look at you.

629
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:50,073
I am not a doctor, but
you look like you are hurt.

630
00:47:50,188 --> 00:47:51,760
- Yes, sexy, right?
- No.

631
00:47:51,771 --> 00:47:52,987
Come on.

632
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:56,774
We don't need a doctor,
we need the cops.

633
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,287
He's in.

634
00:48:26,513 --> 00:48:30,496
Get out of the way,
look out, please.

635
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,780
NYPD, alright, I got this kid.
Come on let's go.

636
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:46,206
NYPD

637
00:48:48,862 --> 00:48:50,554
Sergeant?

638
00:48:50,573 --> 00:48:51,642
Sergeant!

639
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,875
I need to speak with you.

640
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:54,616
The doctor is in the back.

641
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:58,601
I am NYPD,
I need to talk to you.

642
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:00,315
Just give me a minute.

643
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,372
Oh my God!

644
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:16,167
Let's get of here.

645
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:23,011
<i>Perfect! Now the second sequence.</i>

646
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:30,603
<i>The server is ready.</i>

647
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,680
We are go.

648
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:35,385
Launch the downloads.

649
00:49:44,926 --> 00:49:46,888
Nothing is happening.

650
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,349
Be patient.

651
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:53,775
- I don't know, it's not responding.
- Wait for it.

652
00:49:57,889 --> 00:49:59,373
See.

653
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:01,493
There you go.

654
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:04,012
Let me know when the
download reaches 20%.

655
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,240
OK.

656
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:17,135
- Excuse me!
- Thank you!

657
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,546
Holy Shit!

658
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:22,124
Kid? Kid? Hey!

659
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:24,819
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yes.

660
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:26,383
Come on let's go.

661
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:33,413
And here you go, agent...
Tavarek. I guess that's you.

662
00:50:56,483 --> 00:50:57,976
The download is at 20%.

663
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:02,680
Time to move. Let's keep them
chasing their tails.

664
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:18,986
<i>Due to the recent activity...</i>

665
00:51:18,997 --> 00:51:21,971
<i>law enforcement agencies are
being extremely cautious.</i>

666
00:51:22,086 --> 00:51:26,800
<i>They are telling drivers to abandon
vehicles, until they are searched.</i>

667
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,083
<i>And as you can see...</i>

668
00:51:28,094 --> 00:51:30,883
<i>K-9 units are checking each vehicle.</i>

669
00:51:30,998 --> 00:51:33,931
<i>Now whether this is connected
to the anthrax reports earlier...</i>

670
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:37,097
<i>or if it is a new terrorist threat
we don't know that this stage.</i>

671
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:38,801
FAA just grounded all flights.

672
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:40,302
- Good.
- Sir...

673
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,389
We have complete access
over system networks.

674
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:45,906
Phones, power grids,
water, nuclear...

675
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,027
- Hey, excuse me...
- Dan Parry, The NSA

676
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:50,930
Chuck Summer DHS Liaison.
The White House made the call.

677
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,009
Anything you need,
We are here to help.

678
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:55,021
Help? Wow. That's, that's great.

679
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:57,928
We are gonna need some
work space for our people.

680
00:51:58,042 --> 00:52:00,004
What can you do for us?

681
00:52:00,015 --> 00:52:02,117
Well as you can see, we
are using the space...

682
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:04,409
You guys can stand in the corner,

683
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:05,464
and liaise.

684
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,516
And if I need something...

685
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:09,081
I'll just wake you.

686
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:33,470
- Wait, no no. Don't call.
- What?

687
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,547
- What are you talking about?
- They probably cracked that hours ago

688
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,247
if you use it they might
be able to trace us here.

689
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:38,435
- Just put in your pocket.
- Sure?

690
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:40,288
Yes.

691
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,546
Or smash it, you didn't
have to smash it...

692
00:52:43,434 --> 00:52:45,919
Excuse me, excuse me.
This is a police emergency.

693
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:48,049
He'll call you right back.

694
00:52:49,122 --> 00:52:50,367
Here, wait in here.

695
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,536
- Do you have a signal?
- Yes.

696
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:56,058
Yes.

697
00:52:56,078 --> 00:52:58,496
This is John McClane
for agent Bowman.

698
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,019
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

699
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,318
McClane, go.

700
00:53:03,328 --> 00:53:04,616
We never made it to DHS

701
00:53:04,627 --> 00:53:08,930
They came for the kid again.
All your men are down.

702
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:13,006
- And what about Farrell?
- Yeah he's here with me.

703
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,083
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

704
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:16,956
Yeah I'll hold on.

705
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:24,098
Another day in paradise.

706
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,557
They just swamped everything,

707
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:29,583
the whole telecom system.
Phones, cellular, satellite...

708
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,528
They are blanketing every station.

709
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:13,018
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news.

710
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:16,185
It on every channel,
it's been like this for a few minutes now.

711
00:54:33,752 --> 00:54:35,658
Oh my God!

712
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,101
Shit!

713
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:44,305
McClane!

714
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:48,664
Look out!

715
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:50,999
Look out!

716
00:54:53,182 --> 00:54:55,191
Bowman? Do you see that?

717
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,162
- McClane?
- Bowman?

718
00:54:57,174 --> 00:54:58,624
It's a fake.

719
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:04,677
I see it.

720
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:06,180
Thank God!

721
00:55:09,602 --> 00:55:12,023
- McClane?
- Bowman.

722
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:21,121
The satellite's down.
Get me a landline.

723
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,635
Wrote one little piece of code
and the world falls apart.

724
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:41,836
- This is virtual terrorism.
- What?

725
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:45,609
It's crazy, the first time that I
heard of a Fire Sale

726
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:49,038
I actually thought it would be cool,
if somebody did it.

727
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:52,650
Hit the "reset" button...

728
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,687
Melt the system, just for fun.

729
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:58,246
Hey, it is not a system.

730
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,738
It is a country. We are
talking about people.

731
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,858
A whole country, full of people.

732
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:04,317
Sitting at home, alone...

733
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:06,231
Scared to death in
their houses, alright.

734
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:08,249
So if you are done with
your little nostalgic moment...

735
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:12,365
Maybe you can think a little
and help me catch these guys.

736
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,046
Just help me.

737
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,339
Just put yourself in their shoes.

738
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,758
Come on.

739
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:22,266
If this were your Fire Sale,
what would be your next move?

740
00:56:24,271 --> 00:56:28,839
OK, the point of a Fire Sale is that it
is mostly done by remote, right...

741
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:31,630
But not everything is run
completely on-line.

742
00:56:31,744 --> 00:56:34,676
Major utilities aren't,
they are run in closed circuits...

743
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,796
You can breech the security
up to a certain point, but...

744
00:56:36,808 --> 00:56:41,572
To shut it down you would have
to physically go there...

745
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:44,539
You know what, give me that guys PDA.

746
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,179
The phones don't work,
they are all dead.

747
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:48,299
No the phones are fine
it is the network that is dead.

748
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:50,275
I only need to reprogram it...

749
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:53,537
And link it into the old sat-come,
hackers surf them the whole time.

750
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:56,181
It is probably what these guys are
using to talk to each other.

751
00:56:56,294 --> 00:56:58,775
How do you know all this stuff?

752
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:00,578
Dude, I don't know.

753
00:57:00,865 --> 00:57:02,972
I couldn't explain it to you.

754
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,097
OK.

755
00:57:04,322 --> 00:57:05,987
The national power grid,
gas and the electricity...

756
00:57:05,998 --> 00:57:07,274
They are divided in to
three zones, right?

757
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:10,950
Eastern, Central and Western.
Each one with a primary hub.

758
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:12,769
Here it is.

759
00:57:15,355 --> 00:57:18,246
- What is that, what am I looking at?
- That is the eastern hub.

760
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:20,323
Now, they take this out...

761
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:22,710
It wipes out all the power
for the entire eastern corridor.

762
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,346
But again they will have to
do it manually.

763
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,835
OK.

764
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,208
- Come on, let's go.
- What, to West Virgínia?

765
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,803
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me.

766
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,231
- McClane, McClane?
- Oh you get used to it.

767
00:57:36,346 --> 00:57:37,795
McClane. Oh, shit!

768
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:42,242
Sir, wireless networks are down
they are hitting the landlines too.

769
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:45,423
I don't care how,
you find me a line.

770
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:47,233
Come on, what you got?

771
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:49,342
We swept the whole building,
it seems clean. We can...

772
00:57:49,353 --> 00:57:51,316
- sweep it again, but...
- Don't bother.

773
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:52,933
Don't bother.

774
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:56,707
It is fake. These guys planned this...

775
00:57:57,336 --> 00:58:00,271
Alright get everybody back
inside the crisis centre, now.

776
00:58:00,385 --> 00:58:02,761
Let's open it up!

777
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,291
Come on, get in.

778
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,683
The door is locked. Unless
you have an extra gun to unlock it.

779
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:15,270
Hey, don't do that.

780
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,288
You're gonna disable it... Shit.

781
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:22,028
Wow, crazy, did you see that?

782
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:27,169
Sorry about that man.
I didn't know it would come out so fast.

783
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,373
How did you do yours?

784
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:38,034
Are you alright? What,
did it hit you a little bit.

785
00:58:38,229 --> 00:58:39,249
Sorry.

786
00:58:43,972 --> 00:58:45,801
Please, don't touch those, OK?
I know what am doing.

787
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:47,535
I have done this before.

788
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:50,064
I mean, I have read about it.

789
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:53,861
<i>Road Assist, we have detected
an airbag deployment.</i>

790
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:55,939
Yes erm! Please, we hit a tree...

791
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,957
And my Dad is having
a heart attack...

792
00:58:57,968 --> 00:59:00,857
I think he is gonna die.
You need to help us!

793
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,821
<i>Hold while we contact
the Emergency Services.</i>

794
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:05,528
No, no, no! He is dying!

795
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,752
Please, listen to me. I can get him
to the hospital, I can drive.

796
00:59:07,764 --> 00:59:11,312
I am fine! But the key doesn't turn.

797
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:14,234
So you have to start the
car for us OK? Please, Dad...

798
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,458
<i>Your name, please?</i>

799
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,834
My name is...

800
00:59:19,905 --> 00:59:23,353
Frank and my Dad's name is...

801
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:30,711
Dvorak Tsargentzki!

802
00:59:32,584 --> 00:59:35,413
Please, just help us!
We need your help, please!

803
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:37,689
<i>The Emergency Services are on their way.</i>

804
00:59:38,017 --> 00:59:40,023
No, no, no! Listen, ma'am.

805
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,620
- What is your name?
- Dolores.

806
00:59:41,624 --> 00:59:43,501
Dolores? OK, Dolores...

807
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:45,003
I don't know if you have a Dad...

808
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,250
But I do...

809
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:48,585
And I want to be able
to say that a year from now, OK?

810
00:59:48,596 --> 00:59:50,455
Because my Dad is my
hero and right now he is...

811
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,987
In my arms, dying and...

812
00:59:52,998 --> 00:59:54,527
And his only hope is...

813
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:56,581
To get to a hospital right now!
We can't wait!

814
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,453
So, please!
Start the God damn car!

815
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,764
Thank you, Dolores.

816
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:07,388
Pass the P.D.A.
I gotta call the Warlock.

817
01:00:07,502 --> 01:00:10,950
- The what?
- Warlock, he is a digital jedi.

818
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,055
Ma'am, you are not
authorised to be here.

819
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:32,778
F.B.I. We suspect there has
been a security breech.

820
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:35,721
You have landed without authorisation.

821
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:59,839
- That was pretty good back there, kid.
- Thanks.

822
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:04,560
- What's the matter, nothing to complain about?
- No, just...

823
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:09,383
- Then what? What's the matter?
- It's not funny, I'm not like you,

824
01:01:09,389 --> 01:01:11,282
I can't do this shit.

825
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:16,025
- What does that mean? Like what?
- Like... heroic and everything.

826
01:01:17,643 --> 01:01:18,884
I am not that guy.

827
01:01:18,899 --> 01:01:22,550
- Nobody here is a hero, kid.
- You saved my life like 10 times,

828
01:01:22,664 --> 01:01:23,674
in the last six hours.

829
01:01:23,676 --> 01:01:25,767
I was doing my job, that's all.

830
01:01:28,668 --> 01:01:32,848
Do you know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing! You get shot at.

831
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:37,040
A little pat on the back,
bla bla bla. That a boy!

832
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,213
You get divorced...

833
01:01:42,557 --> 01:01:48,497
Your wife can't remember your last name,
kids don't want to talk to you...

834
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:52,509
You get to eat a lot
of meals by yourself.

835
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:55,868
Trust me kid, nobody
wants to be that guy.

836
01:01:56,686 --> 01:02:01,148
- Then why you doing this?
- Because there is nobody else to do it right now.

837
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:02,887
Believe me if there was
somebody else to do it

838
01:02:02,892 --> 01:02:07,124
I would let them do it.
But there's not, so we're doing it.

839
01:02:08,577 --> 01:02:11,363
That's what makes you that guy.

840
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:21,251
The things flying now.

841
01:02:21,261 --> 01:02:25,167
Contact Emerson, tell him that
we will be there soon.

842
01:02:31,136 --> 01:02:35,283
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor is restricted access.

843
01:03:00,225 --> 01:03:01,466
You stay here.

844
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:54,840
- We are in.
- Good, shut it down.

845
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:07,043
I guess you were right, kid.

846
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:09,106
OK... that's awful.

847
01:04:11,785 --> 01:04:12,945
We got company.

848
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,014
So how would they
shut down the power?

849
01:04:24,015 --> 01:04:26,041
- What?
- Come on!

850
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:29,102
Central control room.

851
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:34,444
- Fourth floor, fourth floor!
- Come on!

852
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:46,572
Shit!

853
01:04:49,439 --> 01:04:51,080
- Try to keep up!
- I am keeping up!

854
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:52,957
I am just trying to stop for
just two seconds to catch a breath.

855
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:57,637
- They have these things called Gymnasiums...
- Well yeah, it's not like...

856
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:20,120
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

857
01:05:32,247 --> 01:05:35,557
Intel is fairly certain that
the terrorists are mobile.

858
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:38,919
It is the only way to consistently
avoid signal triangulation.

859
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,878
Judging by the amount of
hardware they are running,

860
01:05:40,879 --> 01:05:43,410
we are probably looking
for a large vehicle,

861
01:05:43,412 --> 01:05:45,716
probably a semi-trailer rig.

862
01:05:45,717 --> 01:05:46,595
Right.

863
01:05:46,604 --> 01:05:48,254
Tell the guys at
Homeland Security...

864
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:51,438
That we need every agent, satellite and
functioning network they have got.

865
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:52,467
Now!

866
01:06:11,789 --> 01:06:13,475
Playtime is over sweetheart

867
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:16,705
Don't! Take your hand off the gun.

868
01:06:16,762 --> 01:06:19,565
Hands up. Stand up.

869
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:28,143
Go on, now!

870
01:06:28,953 --> 01:06:31,763
Let's go, kid! You're up!

871
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:36,695
As fast as you can.

872
01:06:57,385 --> 01:07:02,120
That's enough of this Kung-Fu shit
I've met some bitches in my day...

873
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:04,179
But you...

874
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:10,521
Still awake, huh?

875
01:07:11,144 --> 01:07:13,272
- Just keep doing what you are doing.
- OK!

876
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:16,505
- How much time do you need?
- Not much.

877
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:30,781
Are you done?

878
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:32,736
Are you done?

879
01:07:32,804 --> 01:07:34,641
No... no, not quite...

880
01:07:34,848 --> 01:07:38,389
I am not exactly checking
my email here, you know.

881
01:07:38,462 --> 01:07:41,626
I ran this hacking PN mode on their
PI, I am just booting their host...

882
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:44,970
- What?
- It means about 30 seconds, ok?

883
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:49,337
It is not the easiest
thing to do, when...

884
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:01,631
OK.

885
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,754
- Undo everything you just did, now!
- OK, OK...

886
01:08:08,407 --> 01:08:12,318
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand. I really do.

887
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:15,638
I'm a righty...

888
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:50,657
One last door to open.

889
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:56,105
Do you know what you are doing?
Do you realise what this'll do to the country?

890
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:59,228
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

891
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:03,831
Ok, good. Glad we are
on the same page.

892
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:30,103
How you doin'?

893
01:09:39,781 --> 01:09:41,016
Hang on!

894
01:10:56,193 --> 01:10:58,478
Let's just talk about
this for once...

895
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:06,510
How you doing? That's
not too tight is it?

896
01:11:08,363 --> 01:11:09,599
Damn it!

897
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:14,160
Well, great!

898
01:11:47,768 --> 01:11:49,406
McClane!

899
01:11:50,898 --> 01:11:52,305
Shit!

900
01:11:53,452 --> 01:11:55,250
McClane, get out of there!

901
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:59,025
Come on man, come on!

902
01:12:03,032 --> 01:12:04,475
Come on, man!

903
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:28,394
Did you see that?

904
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,517
- So you stopped her, right?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

905
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:36,890
Actually having a gun pointed at
your head makes it harder to do.

906
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:40,133
- What?
- I think she left a surprise.

907
01:12:43,486 --> 01:12:45,895
Can't you just turn it off?
Lock 'em out?

908
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:47,427
I'm not sure.

909
01:12:49,176 --> 01:12:52,542
I might be able to slow
them down though.

910
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:58,216
Western and central hubs are
ours, we are just waiting on Mai.

911
01:12:58,217 --> 01:13:00,263
Hang on, something's up.

912
01:13:00,264 --> 01:13:03,196
All of the security is
reactivating.

913
01:13:03,197 --> 01:13:07,258
I think somebody is in the
market for some cheap Viagra...

914
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:10,432
And your girlfriend is dead...

915
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:13,920
Why not check out our sexy
singles you can chat with.

916
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:15,740
It's an e-bomb.

917
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,309
Alright, wait wait wait, OK

918
01:13:32,702 --> 01:13:36,013
- Mai, talk to me what's going on?
- Mai...

919
01:13:37,065 --> 01:13:40,839
Oh, yeah, little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

920
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,873
I don't think she will be talking
with anybody for a long time.

921
01:13:44,515 --> 01:13:47,075
The last time that I saw her,
she was in the...

922
01:13:47,076 --> 01:13:50,541
Bottom of an elevator shaft
with an SUV rammed up her ass.

923
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:53,598
<i>What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?</i>

924
01:13:53,965 --> 01:13:58,282
Listen, Jackass! Your
Fire Sale is over.

925
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:03,603
Pack up your little circus or
I will come and kick your ass.

926
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:09,797
You have idea who I am
and of what I am capable of.

927
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,830
<i>When I'm finished here and
I promise it will be soon...</i>

928
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:16,431
I will focus all my attention on you.

929
01:14:17,863 --> 01:14:20,841
You wanna make things personal, fine!

930
01:14:40,611 --> 01:14:45,839
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

931
01:14:46,644 --> 01:14:49,793
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure...

932
01:14:49,831 --> 01:14:52,650
- Can get anyone.
- Do it.

933
01:14:52,651 --> 01:14:54,581
- Now?
- Yes, now.

934
01:14:57,832 --> 01:14:59,480
Please, no!

935
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:03,260
- That is Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit!

936
01:15:04,196 --> 01:15:07,705
- You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

937
01:15:08,213 --> 01:15:11,594
He was D.O.D.s chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

938
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:14,626
After 9/11, he's the guy
that told joint chiefs...

939
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:18,253
That the system was vulnerable. He was pushing
for total overhaul, but they wouldn't listen.

940
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:21,507
- Gabriel is not exactly people friendly.
- You think so?

941
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:26,286
<i>When he tried to go public, they
crucified him, destroyed his reputation,</i>

942
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:29,106
<i>after that he disappeared.</i>

943
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:32,118
We got a pretty serious problem.

944
01:15:32,286 --> 01:15:33,830
Hold on a minute, what?

945
01:15:33,831 --> 01:15:37,021
I think we need to get out
of here, right now.

946
01:15:38,386 --> 01:15:41,450
- They are sending the gas lines here.
- Gas? What gas?

947
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:42,831
Christ!

948
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:45,819
Oh, all of them!

949
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:49,380
See that? Those flashing arrows?
That is not good.

950
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:52,393
- All that's coming here?
- Yes, I think we gotta go.

951
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:55,816
<i>Listen, I gotta go.
Just find Thomas Gabriel!</i>

952
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,916
McClane? McClane?

953
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,826
Let's go, finish this up!

954
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:09,270
Right now, let's go!
Come on!

955
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:30,267
Get in there!

956
01:17:23,095 --> 01:17:25,531
Let's go, come on,
we gotta get out of here.

957
01:17:25,532 --> 01:17:27,619
Oh what is the point, oh man,
what is the point?

958
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:32,801
Hey, knock that off. This has something
to do with that code you wrote, now think.

959
01:17:32,802 --> 01:17:36,071
- Come on, help us win.
- Win?!

960
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,341
When did we start winning, huh?

961
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:43,848
Look around, are you out of your mind?
We are not even close to winning.

962
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:46,666
We just got the shit kicked out of us!

963
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,084
You think I'm holding out on you,
something I'm not telling you

964
01:17:48,151 --> 01:17:50,757
If I knew what they wanted,
I would tell you!

965
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:53,904
- I would happily tell you!
- Jesus!

966
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:37,481
Warlock, Warlock!
Ah great, there goes the cell phone.

967
01:18:37,482 --> 01:18:40,702
- They knocked the satellites out now?
- No, the battery ran out.

968
01:18:40,704 --> 01:18:42,780
- Listen we should go see him.
- Who?

969
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:45,892
The Warlock, it's not that far
away, it's in Baltimore.

970
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:50,125
- You want to go to the Warlocks house, now.
- Hey, this is me helping you.

971
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:54,501
Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock
it is our only hope.

972
01:18:59,141 --> 01:19:03,776
- How do you feel about flying?
- You mean like, with a pilot?

973
01:19:11,191 --> 01:19:13,716
- Stick it in the round thing.
- What round thing?

974
01:19:13,717 --> 01:19:15,685
Here, put these on.

975
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:19,442
Stick it in there, that'll work.

976
01:19:19,497 --> 01:19:23,731
- You OK?
- Yeah, uhh, I am afraid of flying.

977
01:19:23,732 --> 01:19:26,674
- Yeah I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

978
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:29,717
I took some lessons, you know,
face my fears, that kind of thing...

979
01:19:29,718 --> 01:19:32,002
- Yeah, did it help?
- Not really.

980
01:19:33,151 --> 01:19:34,456
That's it...

981
01:19:37,297 --> 01:19:40,088
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yes.

982
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:44,403
Maybe we should just drive,
it'll be fun like a road trip...

983
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:46,810
Take it easy, they say taking
off is the hardest part.

984
01:19:46,811 --> 01:19:48,046
Really, I'd heard...

985
01:19:48,341 --> 01:19:52,332
- I'll be honest, I missed some classes.
- Ha Ha, you did? Really?

986
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:55,813
You got your license, right?
To fly one of these things...

987
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:01,333
Hey hey.
There we go, we're up!

988
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,930
That's good, that's
pretty good.

989
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:15,225
Jesus! Look at that! This
whole area's blacked out.

990
01:20:16,588 --> 01:20:19,160
How will we find Warlocks house?

991
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:24,298
It will probably be the only one
with the lights still on.

992
01:20:29,968 --> 01:20:34,836
Power outage keeps spreading,
half the east coast has gone down.

993
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:38,475
Alright, put everything
on emergency generators.

994
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:41,347
How the hell are they
getting past us?

995
01:20:46,085 --> 01:20:47,928
- OK, down there, I see it.
- Down there?

996
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:49,370
Left, left, down.

997
01:20:54,092 --> 01:20:55,898
We gonna land there?

998
01:20:57,643 --> 01:20:59,989
- Alright, hang on.
- Oh, Jesus!

999
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:04,796
The fence! The fence!

1000
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:09,222
- The fence! The fence!
- I see it...

1001
01:21:09,223 --> 01:21:10,634
Watch...

1002
01:21:22,874 --> 01:21:25,346
- Oh, Jesus!
- Come on.

1003
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:29,396
- Oh yeah, taking off is the hardest part.
- Let's go!

1004
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:36,355
There's something you need to know
about Warlock, he hates cops...

1005
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:40,020
He hates them, so let
me do all the talking.

1006
01:21:51,822 --> 01:21:55,914
Hey Mrs. Kludis.
Is Freddy home?

1007
01:21:57,847 --> 01:22:02,414
I am Matt Farrell and that is Billy.

1008
01:22:04,165 --> 01:22:05,981
We are friends from Space Camp.

1009
01:22:05,982 --> 01:22:09,382
We went to Space Camp with Freddy.

1010
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,754
Freddy!

1011
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:14,227
- Freddy?
- You got company.

1012
01:22:20,444 --> 01:22:23,263
Frederick, didn't you hear me?

1013
01:22:23,431 --> 01:22:26,807
- All Baltimore heard you, ma.
- Your friends are here.

1014
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,954
Friends? But what the...

1015
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:33,729
Ma, how many times, you don't
bring people down here?

1016
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:38,712
I can't see too well, you have
lost so much weight!

1017
01:22:38,713 --> 01:22:40,816
No, dude I gained 30 lbs,
who is that?

1018
01:22:40,817 --> 01:22:43,704
You know what it doesn't matter?
What are you even doing here?

1019
01:22:43,705 --> 01:22:47,189
I am rocking 5 generators just
so I can stay online.

1020
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:51,013
And since you are being hunted by
assassins, maybe this visit

1021
01:22:51,014 --> 01:22:53,560
isn't a productive or a healthy way
of spending my time.

1022
01:22:53,561 --> 01:22:57,635
- Hey, don't touch that alright?
- CB radio?

1023
01:22:58,356 --> 01:23:01,681
- A little low tech for you isn't it?
- Old? That my friend...

1024
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:04,103
Is an end of the world
insurance system, OK.

1025
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:06,003
When the last microchip is down
I will be able to...

1026
01:23:06,004 --> 01:23:09,203
Be in contact with the world,
be they zombies or not.

1027
01:23:09,204 --> 01:23:10,232
I'll tell you that right now.

1028
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:13,898
- What did you bring your Dad here for?
- He is cool, he's into games.

1029
01:23:13,899 --> 01:23:19,049
- Nice poster.
- Oh, what are you, a fan of Fett?

1030
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:25,330
- No, I was more of a Star Wars guy.
- Star Wars! Who is this man?

1031
01:23:25,331 --> 01:23:26,361
He is...

1032
01:23:26,363 --> 01:23:30,400
Dump-truck, I'm not his Dad,
I am a cop. How about that?

1033
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:33,253
Ah, a cop, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

1034
01:23:33,254 --> 01:23:35,725
Why'd you bring a cop into
my Command Centre?

1035
01:23:35,726 --> 01:23:39,715
- Command Centre?! It is a basement.
- It is a Command Centre!

1036
01:23:39,716 --> 01:23:41,440
Don't help, McClane!
I can explain...

1037
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:45,015
Tell us what you know about Thomas
Gabriel. That's why we came here.

1038
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:47,710
Thomas Gabriel, that's cool,
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1039
01:23:47,711 --> 01:23:50,697
Get out, I want you out of here,
man, right now!

1040
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:51,802
Hey, calm down.

1041
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:55,069
- Just calm down big boy.
- You calm down, it's my house!

1042
01:23:55,833 --> 01:24:02,245
You are going to tell me what I wanna know.
Or I'm gonna kill you in your own house.

1043
01:24:14,885 --> 01:24:17,398
4 years ago the D.O.D.
Recruits Thomas Gabriel...

1044
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:19,007
To be a cyber spook for them, OK.

1045
01:24:19,008 --> 01:24:21,368
First day on the job he
goes and tells his bosses...

1046
01:24:21,369 --> 01:24:25,273
That the nations security infrastructure
is wide open to compromise.

1047
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:27,946
And what did they say?
"We will take it under advisement."

1048
01:24:27,947 --> 01:24:30,856
But he doesn't ease up 'cos he is
committed, like you read about.

1049
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,697
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint chiefs of Staff, OK?

1050
01:24:33,698 --> 01:24:36,993
Using just a laptop he
hacks into NORAD

1051
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:38,482
and shuts down the
entire defence network

1052
01:24:38,483 --> 01:24:42,072
So they put a gun to his head
and forced him to stop the hack,

1053
01:24:42,073 --> 01:24:45,139
Thomas Gabriel is the guy who
shut down NORAD with a laptop,

1054
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:48,122
just to prove a point,
you think I'm scared of you?

1055
01:24:48,123 --> 01:24:51,104
- Just tell us how to find the guy.
- I don't know how, he is a ghost.

1056
01:24:51,105 --> 01:24:52,648
He just fell off the grid.

1057
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,080
- Another dead end, come on.
- Hold on wait, McClane,

1058
01:24:55,081 --> 01:24:58,288
Listen, Warlock, a couple of
weeks ago I wrote this...

1059
01:24:58,289 --> 01:25:01,111
I know dude, you wrote a
mutating algorithm security code

1060
01:25:01,112 --> 01:25:03,628
that's probably being used
by Thomas Gabriel right now.

1061
01:25:03,629 --> 01:25:05,605
No, we know that, yes.

1062
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:08,282
- Can you tell us what he's using it for?
- I've been trying to figure that out..

1063
01:25:08,408 --> 01:25:09,033
Here, look...

1064
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:13,984
The only security system in
the country, that I can find,

1065
01:25:14,055 --> 01:25:16,141
currently employing
that particular template,

1066
01:25:16,232 --> 01:25:18,440
is the Social Security
Administration, ok?

1067
01:25:18,441 --> 01:25:21,195
They don't even use it
in the main facility, look.

1068
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:24,458
They use it in this building,
over here, in Woodlawn.

1069
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,749
What the hell...

1070
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:28,521
- I know, right?
- Right, what?

1071
01:25:28,522 --> 01:25:29,797
What the hell you guys talking about?

1072
01:25:29,798 --> 01:25:31,583
The power consumption is off the charts.

1073
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:32,475
It's hot, on fire.

1074
01:25:32,476 --> 01:25:35,070
- The chilling towers?
- That's what I thought.

1075
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:41,332
- Hello, what's a chilling tower?
- Jees, see what I've been dealing with?

1076
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:46,008
Large server farms generate a
lot of heat, they need to be cooled.

1077
01:25:46,009 --> 01:25:46,869
Why there?

1078
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:51,914
I don't know what is in that building but I
assure you it's not Social Security numbers.

1079
01:25:57,055 --> 01:26:01,942
I have a red flag over here,
someone's hacking into Woodlawn.

1080
01:26:03,066 --> 01:26:08,673
Tracking IP on the server now...
Frederick Kaludis.

1081
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:11,592
- Let's take a look at him.
- Fat bastard!

1082
01:26:17,143 --> 01:26:19,961
McClane. Where is his daughter?

1083
01:26:20,154 --> 01:26:22,160
We just got a trace on her cell.

1084
01:26:22,161 --> 01:26:23,746
You're gonna love this.

1085
01:26:28,151 --> 01:26:30,787
Alright let's get
a better look at you.

1086
01:26:42,211 --> 01:26:46,953
<i>Freddy, what the hell are you
doing, meddling in my network?</i>

1087
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:55,589
<i>McClane? I thought
I'd killed you already.</i>

1088
01:26:56,272 --> 01:26:58,105
I get that sometimes.

1089
01:27:01,293 --> 01:27:04,505
Do you think you can
track where he is?

1090
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:10,125
<i>Detective, covering the camera with
your hand, doesn't turn off the microphone.</i>

1091
01:27:11,054 --> 01:27:16,736
I know that am not as smart as
you guys and this computer shit.

1092
01:27:17,363 --> 01:27:21,145
But hey, I'm still
alive aint I?

1093
01:27:21,706 --> 01:27:25,796
I mean you got to be running
outta bad guys by now, right?

1094
01:27:30,212 --> 01:27:31,698
Gabriel?

1095
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,877
Honestly, you can tell me.
How's that work?

1096
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:42,210
Is it some kind of service or something?
Some kind of 1-800 number, 1-800 henchmen?

1097
01:27:42,472 --> 01:27:44,204
I bet you are still
on hold waiting:

1098
01:27:44,205 --> 01:27:47,958
"Get another dead Asian hooker
bitch over here right away?"

1099
01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:54,210
But seriously, all that kicking
aside, that skinny ninja chick...

1100
01:27:54,211 --> 01:27:55,687
<i>she was smoking hot.</i>

1101
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,477
Another one of those is gonna be
real hard to come by, right?

1102
01:27:59,514 --> 01:28:03,677
- You're very impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

1103
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:04,696
Yeah?

1104
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:09,033
Is this one of them?

1105
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:16,900
- Hello?
- Yes, Emergency Services calling.

1106
01:28:17,029 --> 01:28:19,017
- Oh, thank God.
- Can she hear me?

1107
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:21,420
My name is Lucy Gennero, I have been
stuck for hours, been trying to call...

1108
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,334
- My cell phone's not working...
- Can she hear this?

1109
01:28:23,336 --> 01:28:25,656
Lucy, hang up that phone.

1110
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:29,314
<i>Calm down miss.
We know exactly where you are.</i>

1111
01:28:29,675 --> 01:28:32,494
- Everything will be alright.
- Lucy, hang up the phone!

1112
01:28:33,075 --> 01:28:36,612
Please, John, I am
trying to have a conversation.

1113
01:28:38,687 --> 01:28:42,678
<i>We are a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,</i>

1114
01:28:42,679 --> 01:28:44,614
but I assure you, we are
gonna get you out of there...

1115
01:28:44,615 --> 01:28:47,898
Even if I have to come down there
and get you myself.

1116
01:28:48,139 --> 01:28:49,069
Thank you.

1117
01:28:49,173 --> 01:28:53,185
In the meantime, Miss Gennero, is there
anybody we can contact for you?

1118
01:28:53,186 --> 01:28:56,791
Yes, my Dad.

1119
01:28:57,823 --> 01:29:01,948
His name is John McClane,
He's a New York City cop.

1120
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:07,234
<i>We'll find him, just hang in
there Miss and we will get to you.</i>

1121
01:29:07,235 --> 01:29:08,677
<i>Very soon.</i>

1122
01:29:10,633 --> 01:29:11,868
<i>Thank you.</i>

1123
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:18,663
<i>Wow, that's a great girl you
got there, can't wait to meet her.</i>

1124
01:29:18,887 --> 01:29:21,897
<i>What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?</i>

1125
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:26,183
Come on John? Make a joke.

1126
01:29:27,126 --> 01:29:29,431
Say something funny.

1127
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:39,475
Wait, where are you going?

1128
01:29:39,976 --> 01:29:43,452
Hey, hold up. Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

1129
01:29:43,474 --> 01:29:45,376
What do you think I'm gonna do?

1130
01:29:46,003 --> 01:29:48,565
I'm gonna kill this guy
and get my daughter.

1131
01:29:48,566 --> 01:29:50,137
- But she can be...
- No, listen to me.

1132
01:29:50,138 --> 01:29:52,825
It's gonna get messy,
You should just stay here.

1133
01:29:52,827 --> 01:29:55,858
- I think I...
- Hey, I'm doing you a favour.

1134
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:58,056
I wouldn't bet on me, alright?

1135
01:29:58,057 --> 01:30:02,061
I'll take it from here.
Thanks for the help.

1136
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:14,565
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I guess I'll give you a hand.

1137
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,675
OK.

1138
01:30:43,248 --> 01:30:45,761
F.B.I. Ma'am,
Jersey Field Office.

1139
01:30:45,762 --> 01:30:48,270
Mind if I see your ID?

1140
01:30:48,271 --> 01:30:49,589
None at all.

1141
01:30:58,797 --> 01:31:01,615
My dad is a cop, force some habit.

1142
01:31:01,811 --> 01:31:05,116
Your father sounds like
a very smart man.

1143
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:13,614
- Kid, can you get Bowman?
- Uhh, yeah.

1144
01:31:23,828 --> 01:31:25,720
It's completely dead.

1145
01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:30,537
Gabriel must have shut down
all of the satellite links. Shit!

1146
01:31:34,952 --> 01:31:37,464
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1147
01:31:40,243 --> 01:31:41,555
All of it...

1148
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:45,635
It is my fault you got into this,
this wasn't your fight.

1149
01:31:45,636 --> 01:31:48,087
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1150
01:31:52,616 --> 01:31:53,852
Bastard!

1151
01:31:53,855 --> 01:31:55,540
This bitch is a handful.

1152
01:32:01,091 --> 01:32:02,777
Are you gonna be alright?

1153
01:32:06,086 --> 01:32:08,300
Behave or I will hurt you.

1154
01:32:08,301 --> 01:32:11,417
Oh yeah? Let's step outside,
just you and me.

1155
01:32:12,112 --> 01:32:14,151
We will see who hurts who!

1156
01:32:15,305 --> 01:32:18,949
You really are his daughter.
Tie her wrists.

1157
01:32:26,172 --> 01:32:28,683
Trey! Gabriel wants to see you.

1158
01:32:28,684 --> 01:32:31,222
- Is it that time already?
- Yes.

1159
01:32:35,213 --> 01:32:37,620
I'll be back in a second.

1160
01:32:42,226 --> 01:32:44,080
Don't kill me! Please!

1161
01:33:29,446 --> 01:33:33,059
We are showing a breach
in an external vent.

1162
01:33:36,681 --> 01:33:38,368
Go take a look.

1163
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:42,307
Don't be long, we are
packing up soon.

1164
01:33:54,168 --> 01:33:55,460
Hey, McClane!

1165
01:33:55,559 --> 01:33:57,959
Do we have anything resembling
a plan or anything?

1166
01:33:58,048 --> 01:33:59,669
To find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1167
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:03,785
I mean like a plan,
like a way to do that.

1168
01:34:05,601 --> 01:34:07,184
Come on.

1169
01:34:08,414 --> 01:34:13,756
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

1170
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,193
It should be locked.

1171
01:34:25,175 --> 01:34:27,636
OK, now it looks like we are
getting somewhere.

1172
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:43,530
OK this looks like it controls the
cooling system for the mainframe, which...

1173
01:34:43,532 --> 01:34:46,042
Should be...

1174
01:34:46,544 --> 01:34:48,706
If I can just hack in...

1175
01:34:49,581 --> 01:34:53,122
And trip the alarm,
it might alert Bowman.

1176
01:35:01,503 --> 01:35:03,428
Someone set off the alarms.

1177
01:35:03,509 --> 01:35:05,515
Yes, thank you detective.
I can hear that.

1178
01:35:05,516 --> 01:35:08,023
Find a way to turn it off.

1179
01:35:11,742 --> 01:35:13,276
What you got?

1180
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:15,837
We got a problem.

1181
01:35:16,039 --> 01:35:18,447
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1182
01:35:19,563 --> 01:35:21,369
It's got to be him.

1183
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:24,077
And what's, Woodlawn?

1184
01:35:27,589 --> 01:35:29,597
It's N.S.A.

1185
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:32,193
A secure facility outside of Baltimore.

1186
01:35:32,194 --> 01:35:34,823
It's a failsafe we built after 9/11...

1187
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:37,132
To backup all financial information.

1188
01:35:37,133 --> 01:35:39,656
The moment the networks were hit
all the financial data...

1189
01:35:39,657 --> 01:35:42,638
It automatically began
downloading to those servers.

1190
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,236
Banks, Wall Street,
Corporate Records...

1191
01:35:45,237 --> 01:35:47,559
Government funds, all of it.

1192
01:35:47,657 --> 01:35:51,694
Basically a backup for the
accumulated wealth of America.

1193
01:35:51,696 --> 01:35:53,380
All in one location?

1194
01:35:55,193 --> 01:35:57,868
- What could Gabriel do with it?
- If he could get in he might try...

1195
01:35:57,869 --> 01:36:01,213
A transfer of the data
to a portable hard drive,

1196
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,187
then he can have access to
those accounts from anywhere.

1197
01:36:03,188 --> 01:36:06,071
Syphon of billions for himself.

1198
01:36:06,199 --> 01:36:08,178
We would have no way to trace it.

1199
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,659
But knowing him,
he could erase it all

1200
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:13,736
and send us all back to the stone age.

1201
01:36:13,737 --> 01:36:16,230
Why the hell wasn't I told about this?

1202
01:36:16,231 --> 01:36:17,857
Frankly...

1203
01:36:17,877 --> 01:36:21,861
- It's above your pay grade.
- My pay grade?

1204
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:28,217
How did Gabriel find out about
this when I didn't even know?

1205
01:36:31,283 --> 01:36:32,864
He designed it.

1206
01:36:34,857 --> 01:36:36,714
It was his program.

1207
01:36:36,925 --> 01:36:42,419
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

1208
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:43,918
That's brilliant!

1209
01:36:44,428 --> 01:36:47,855
You two, geniuses,
stay out of my way.

1210
01:36:52,943 --> 01:36:56,421
Let me see if I can
get a floor plan of this place.

1211
01:36:57,472 --> 01:36:58,745
Don't move!

1212
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:02,487
You!
Get away from the bag! Now!

1213
01:37:02,488 --> 01:37:03,558
OK.

1214
01:37:03,767 --> 01:37:05,825
We've been waiting for you.

1215
01:37:06,978 --> 01:37:08,007
Yeah?

1216
01:37:09,098 --> 01:37:11,446
I've been waiting for you too.

1217
01:37:37,578 --> 01:37:38,870
McClane!

1218
01:37:41,026 --> 01:37:42,094
McClane!

1219
01:37:45,144 --> 01:37:46,173
Kid?

1220
01:37:46,743 --> 01:37:47,773
Matt? Kid?

1221
01:38:02,687 --> 01:38:04,494
<i>Emerson...</i>

1222
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:08,192
We seem to have a problem
in one of the cooling towers.

1223
01:38:08,194 --> 01:38:09,633
- Tower 7.
- Tower 7.

1224
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:12,966
- Find out what's going on.
- I will see to it. OK.

1225
01:38:21,441 --> 01:38:22,473
Sir?

1226
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:25,138
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get Woodlawn, now.

1227
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:28,285
The roads out, completely blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1228
01:38:28,286 --> 01:38:30,296
Then get us some helicopters.

1229
01:38:30,297 --> 01:38:32,786
They have all been pulled by the
Pentagon, for search and rescue.

1230
01:38:32,787 --> 01:38:36,668
Molina, find me some God damned
helicopters immediately.

1231
01:38:37,799 --> 01:38:40,809
Look, the Pentagon has jets
flying cap over DC.

1232
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:43,838
Have them send one over to Woodlawn
and keep on eye on things until we get there.

1233
01:38:43,839 --> 01:38:45,303
Let's go!

1234
01:38:56,868 --> 01:38:58,672
Where is my daughter?

1235
01:38:58,874 --> 01:39:00,353
<i>Russo, check in.</i>

1236
01:39:04,894 --> 01:39:09,227
<i>I think Russo is on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.</i>

1237
01:39:09,854 --> 01:39:12,861
<i>He's on the third floor, the kid...</i>

1238
01:39:19,426 --> 01:39:21,537
<i>Did you get all that?</i>

1239
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,309
<i>That's right.</i>

1240
01:39:23,345 --> 01:39:27,071
I am on the third floor,
but I'm coming to get ya.

1241
01:39:35,407 --> 01:39:38,231
Don't move, pal,
I will send a doctor.

1242
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:44,645
Kill this guy and
I will give you Mai's cut.

1243
01:39:44,992 --> 01:39:46,288
<i>OK.</i>

1244
01:40:30,202 --> 01:40:32,569
My algorithm.

1245
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:39,095
Please... God.

1246
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:42,965
Please... God.

1247
01:41:18,853 --> 01:41:22,026
Oh Jesus, they are
going after the money.

1248
01:41:45,657 --> 01:41:48,228
<i>You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?</i>

1249
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:50,527
Yep, that's my plan.

1250
01:41:50,528 --> 01:41:53,889
What makes you think I wont put a
bullet in your daughter's head, right now?

1251
01:41:53,891 --> 01:41:55,330
Because you are scared of me.

1252
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:58,007
Is that right, you think
I am afraid of you?

1253
01:41:58,008 --> 01:42:00,065
Cos otherwise she would
be dead already.

1254
01:42:00,066 --> 01:42:02,290
<i>You need a bargaining chip.</i>

1255
01:42:08,105 --> 01:42:10,734
Stop there! Hands up!

1256
01:42:10,771 --> 01:42:13,530
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1257
01:42:16,101 --> 01:42:18,020
Move away. Move!

1258
01:42:25,149 --> 01:42:29,240
You know John, I feel like
we have gotten off on the wrong foot.

1259
01:42:29,915 --> 01:42:33,392
<i>And 'cos of that you think
I'm the bad guy,</i>

1260
01:42:33,415 --> 01:42:36,553
Nothing could be further from the
truth, I'm the good guy here.

1261
01:42:36,554 --> 01:42:40,207
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1262
01:42:40,208 --> 01:42:42,523
Did I get a thank you?
No, I got crucified.

1263
01:42:42,524 --> 01:42:45,354
- But they wouldn't listen.
- You got their attention now, don't you?

1264
01:42:45,355 --> 01:42:47,253
That's right.

1265
01:42:47,929 --> 01:42:50,907
I am doing the country a favour.

1266
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:52,645
<i>Ha ha, by tearing it apart?</i>

1267
01:42:52,646 --> 01:42:55,168
Better me than some outsider,

1268
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:57,995
some religious nut job
bent on Armageddon.

1269
01:42:57,996 --> 01:42:59,762
<i>Nobody wants to see that happen.</i>

1270
01:42:59,763 --> 01:43:02,991
Everything I've broken, can be fixed.

1271
01:43:03,707 --> 01:43:07,044
If the country is willing to pay for it.

1272
01:43:07,045 --> 01:43:10,059
Ah bullshit!
It's always been about the money.

1273
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,549
What, I shouldn't get
paid for my work?

1274
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:14,671
I'm workin' my ass
off here, John.

1275
01:43:14,672 --> 01:43:18,160
Just sit tight asshole,
I got a cheque for ya.

1276
01:43:21,004 --> 01:43:22,398
I can't talk to this guy.

1277
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:26,424
You talk to him, see if
you can get him to focus.

1278
01:43:26,425 --> 01:43:27,705
Dad?

1279
01:43:29,752 --> 01:43:31,034
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

1280
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:34,258
Now there only 5 of them.

1281
01:43:37,004 --> 01:43:39,519
Hang on, Lucy, I'm coming.

1282
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:53,309
Would somebody, please,
kill this son of a bitch.

1283
01:43:55,117 --> 01:43:56,435
We have a problem.

1284
01:43:57,933 --> 01:44:01,954
There actually no problem here
I just got off at the wrong floor.

1285
01:44:04,168 --> 01:44:05,862
This is a mess.

1286
01:44:08,136 --> 01:44:10,044
Wow, I'm truly impressed, man.

1287
01:44:11,609 --> 01:44:13,920
Hacking all the financial data
of the whole country would take weeks,

1288
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:16,767
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1289
01:44:16,768 --> 01:44:20,279
That's what this Fire Sale
is about, isn't it?

1290
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,576
- It's brilliant.
- Yes, it is.

1291
01:44:22,577 --> 01:44:25,182
- Please, be quiet.
- Asshole.

1292
01:44:25,183 --> 01:44:28,318
- Who are you?
- Matt Farrell.

1293
01:44:29,203 --> 01:44:30,633
Lucy McClane.

1294
01:44:31,347 --> 01:44:33,748
I thought your name was Gennero.

1295
01:44:33,855 --> 01:44:35,380
Lucy Gennero?

1296
01:44:35,434 --> 01:44:38,627
- Not today.
- Can you crack the code?

1297
01:44:38,886 --> 01:44:41,297
Maybe, if I had enough time.

1298
01:44:41,557 --> 01:44:42,936
That is encouraging.

1299
01:44:44,925 --> 01:44:46,181
We take them with us.

1300
01:44:47,117 --> 01:44:49,731
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1301
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:54,467
Gabriel, the Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1302
01:44:54,468 --> 01:44:55,959
Keep an eye on it.

1303
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:01,600
Pulling the go codes now.

1304
01:45:16,425 --> 01:45:21,171
Might wanna start thinking what
you want on your headstone, asshole.

1305
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,171
Damned, hamster.

1306
01:45:30,528 --> 01:45:31,613
There you go!

1307
01:45:31,944 --> 01:45:34,895
Be still, spider boy.

1308
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,800
That's right!

1309
01:46:24,036 --> 01:46:28,679
Seriously, you probably shouldn't
antagonise them since they have all the guns.

1310
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,475
Listen, will you just take a minute and
dig deep for a bigger set of balls...

1311
01:46:31,476 --> 01:46:33,317
Because you are going to need them
before we are through.

1312
01:46:33,318 --> 01:46:34,779
Wow, I know that tone.

1313
01:46:34,784 --> 01:46:38,115
It's just weird hearing it
from someone with hair.

1314
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:18,201
Sir, E.T.A. 15 minutes.

1315
01:48:12,381 --> 01:48:13,871
Fix it.

1316
01:48:13,919 --> 01:48:17,684
Why? You are just going to kill me
if I fix it, I know that.

1317
01:48:24,988 --> 01:48:26,477
Shit!

1318
01:48:29,585 --> 01:48:31,174
I'm not gonna do it.

1319
01:48:36,059 --> 01:48:39,855
- No no no! Shit.
- Robertson is coming really fast.

1320
01:48:40,082 --> 01:48:41,895
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something is wrong.

1321
01:48:41,896 --> 01:48:44,366
Robertson is coming too fast.

1322
01:48:48,135 --> 01:48:49,504
It's not Robertson.

1323
01:48:50,127 --> 01:48:52,126
That would be my Dad.

1324
01:49:03,551 --> 01:49:04,635
<i>Freddy!</i>

1325
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:07,817
<i>Freddy!</i>

1326
01:49:09,763 --> 01:49:12,293
<i>This is John McClane.
Look, I know you can hear me.</i>

1327
01:49:12,294 --> 01:49:13,992
This is your frequency, right?

1328
01:49:13,993 --> 01:49:16,820
666. Come on pick
up the mic, Freddy.

1329
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:22,750
Nobody here by that name, sorry.

1330
01:49:22,751 --> 01:49:24,847
Hacker jerk off!

1331
01:49:29,357 --> 01:49:30,862
Warlock!

1332
01:49:31,371 --> 01:49:34,390
I need you to do whatever
it is that you do...

1333
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:36,481
To patch me through
to the F.B.I.

1334
01:49:36,482 --> 01:49:39,743
To Deputy Director Bowman,
you hear me?

1335
01:49:40,018 --> 01:49:43,529
Are you serious, you want me
to intentionally open up a com-line...

1336
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:48,066
<i>to the head of the C.I.A.
Cyber division? I don't think so.</i>

1337
01:49:48,067 --> 01:49:51,496
Freddy, God damn it!
They have my daughter!

1338
01:49:55,519 --> 01:49:57,415
<i>I can do that, hold on.</i>

1339
01:49:59,133 --> 01:50:00,206
Thank you.

1340
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:11,208
<i>This is central, we have a
patch for Director Bowman.</i>

1341
01:50:11,209 --> 01:50:14,550
Sir, central is trying to reach you.

1342
01:50:15,646 --> 01:50:16,943
Go.

1343
01:50:17,043 --> 01:50:19,259
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1344
01:50:19,261 --> 01:50:21,843
Listen to me,
Gabriel is on the 695,

1345
01:50:21,844 --> 01:50:23,512
headed north, in a
haz-mat truck.

1346
01:50:23,513 --> 01:50:26,615
<i>Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?
We were heading there right now.</i>

1347
01:50:26,616 --> 01:50:29,766
Bowman, he's got my daughter.

1348
01:50:30,988 --> 01:50:35,876
Listen, this haz-mat truck, it's a
government vehicle so it should be Lo-Jacked, right?

1349
01:50:35,877 --> 01:50:38,380
Track that down,
should take you right to him.

1350
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:40,393
- Gimmie the tag number?
- Alright,

1351
01:50:40,394 --> 01:50:42,042
Here it comes.

1352
01:50:42,077 --> 01:50:44,926
Golf, Tango...

1353
01:50:45,427 --> 01:50:48,973
Five-Niner-Two, November.

1354
01:50:49,453 --> 01:50:52,471
I've got it.
McClane, where is Farrell?

1355
01:50:52,472 --> 01:50:53,960
He is with them.

1356
01:50:55,492 --> 01:50:58,829
Listen to me, I'm gonna
go in there and get Lucy out.

1357
01:50:59,515 --> 01:51:01,530
But if something happens to me...

1358
01:51:01,531 --> 01:51:03,644
<i>you gotta send in the cavalry,
do you hear me?</i>

1359
01:51:03,645 --> 01:51:07,983
I mean everybody, don't let that
maniac get my daughter, you hear me?

1360
01:51:07,984 --> 01:51:09,580
John, don't worry.

1361
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:11,891
I want your word, Bowman.

1362
01:51:13,609 --> 01:51:15,092
Yeah, you have it.

1363
01:51:16,312 --> 01:51:17,939
Why not?

1364
01:51:24,881 --> 01:51:26,678
There's the F-35.

1365
01:51:29,194 --> 01:51:31,194
Did you get the go codes?

1366
01:51:31,195 --> 01:51:34,255
- Trey! Did you get the go codes?
- Yes, I got the go codes.

1367
01:51:34,256 --> 01:51:36,536
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1368
01:51:53,165 --> 01:51:55,372
Isolating his radio.

1369
01:52:00,394 --> 01:52:03,218
Sending him the go codes.

1370
01:52:09,965 --> 01:52:11,202
AV-81.

1371
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,913
AV-81, this is Marine Airway. ATC.

1372
01:52:14,974 --> 01:52:16,431
<i>Gofer, AV-81.</i>

1373
01:52:16,432 --> 01:52:20,820
Confirmed terrorist vehicle has been
located in your sector. Big-Rig Truck.

1374
01:52:21,531 --> 01:52:24,549
- We are in pursuit of a Haz-mat vehicle.
- I'm hearing you, ATC.

1375
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:27,374
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

1376
01:52:27,567 --> 01:52:29,774
<i>Copy that,
AV-81 engaging.</i>

1377
01:52:38,637 --> 01:52:39,920
What...

1378
01:52:49,412 --> 01:52:50,897
God damn it!

1379
01:52:53,734 --> 01:52:55,833
You're shooting the wrong guy!

1380
01:53:03,305 --> 01:53:05,879
I don't think Daddy's
coming, honey.

1381
01:53:17,593 --> 01:53:21,204
Hey! Jackass!

1382
01:54:08,164 --> 01:54:09,751
Is that it?

1383
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:15,244
Is that your best shot?

1384
01:57:01,309 --> 01:57:04,135
Come on, get out. That way.

1385
01:57:14,141 --> 01:57:17,173
We are leaving in 3 minutes.

1386
01:57:19,894 --> 01:57:22,362
You have 1.

1387
01:57:22,398 --> 01:57:27,196
The rules didn't change man, you're
gonna kill me the minute I unlock it.

1388
01:57:30,449 --> 01:57:32,462
- Ah, shit!
- Matthew?

1389
01:57:32,463 --> 01:57:36,200
Matthew! I really need
you to pay attention.

1390
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:39,507
The rules can always change.

1391
01:57:39,508 --> 01:57:42,331
- OK OK.
- I will shoot in her in 10 seconds.

1392
01:57:42,332 --> 01:57:45,352
- Wait, wait.
- Nine.

1393
01:57:45,524 --> 01:57:47,848
- I can't...
- Eight.

1394
01:57:48,563 --> 01:57:50,258
I can't...

1395
01:57:51,332 --> 01:57:52,703
Oh, God!

1396
01:57:55,608 --> 01:57:58,126
OK!

1397
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,441
Ok, ok, ok!

1398
01:58:00,641 --> 01:58:02,128
Six.

1399
01:58:02,293 --> 01:58:05,164
OK, stop stop, I'm doing it.

1400
01:58:05,165 --> 01:58:07,036
I'm doing it. Oh, God!

1401
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:24,719
The Feds are heading this way.

1402
01:58:24,817 --> 01:58:27,127
Get everything on the plane.

1403
01:58:35,375 --> 01:58:37,186
- Dad?
- Careful.

1404
01:58:37,901 --> 01:58:42,407
Don't worry baby,
Everything is going to be alright.

1405
01:58:43,981 --> 01:58:45,521
Daddy!

1406
01:58:53,022 --> 01:58:54,507
Hold this.

1407
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,268
Jesus Christ!

1408
01:59:22,727 --> 01:59:24,651
You got her?

1409
01:59:25,201 --> 01:59:26,688
You sure?

1410
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:31,240
Nice effort though.

1411
01:59:31,241 --> 01:59:32,743
Matthew?

1412
01:59:33,254 --> 01:59:35,264
Shit. OK.

1413
01:59:35,265 --> 01:59:37,063
I'm doing it, I know.

1414
01:59:44,325 --> 01:59:45,828
McClane...

1415
01:59:46,749 --> 01:59:48,663
Would you do me a favour?

1416
01:59:50,876 --> 01:59:53,382
I know the lights are
beginning to dim...

1417
01:59:53,383 --> 01:59:55,886
But if you can just hang
on for a second...

1418
01:59:55,887 --> 01:59:59,418
As soon as Matts finishes,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter

1419
01:59:59,419 --> 02:00:02,554
And I would love for you
to see that.

1420
02:00:03,778 --> 02:00:05,677
God damn it. Mathew?

1421
02:00:05,871 --> 02:00:08,992
10 second, ok, 10 seconds
and you will have all your money.

1422
02:00:08,993 --> 02:00:10,909
You can just leave,
nobody has to get hurt, OK?

1423
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:14,014
A few seconds.
Stay with me, McClane...

1424
02:00:15,523 --> 02:00:18,758
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

1425
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:21,538
On your tombstone
it shall read:

1426
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:24,776
"Always in the wrong place,
at the wrong time"

1427
02:00:25,583 --> 02:00:29,674
How about:
"Yippi-kai-ay, mother fu..."

1428
02:00:42,878 --> 02:00:44,159
Daddy?

1429
02:00:45,967 --> 02:00:48,586
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine...

1430
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,265
I knew you would come for me.

1431
02:00:53,266 --> 02:00:57,140
Of course I would come for you.
It's OK.

1432
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:13,177
Freeze!

1433
02:01:13,895 --> 02:01:16,720
Hold up, Hold up!
He's OK.

1434
02:01:21,984 --> 02:01:24,295
Help Daddy up.

1435
02:01:25,575 --> 02:01:27,612
I think I'll just stay
here for a minute.

1436
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,985
Daddy, you are out of your mind.

1437
02:01:31,489 --> 02:01:33,798
- What are you talking about?
- You shot yourself.

1438
02:01:33,799 --> 02:01:36,325
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1439
02:01:37,138 --> 02:01:40,793
Don't tell these guys
that I did that, OK?

1440
02:01:56,465 --> 02:01:58,096
Is he OK?

1441
02:01:59,567 --> 02:02:03,770
Lift your arms up,
Now put them down, further.

1442
02:02:04,698 --> 02:02:07,704
He might die from shock
on the way to the hospital.

1443
02:02:11,744 --> 02:02:13,232
Alright.

1444
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:17,256
I'll be right back.

1445
02:02:19,792 --> 02:02:22,812
- Hey.
- How does it feel to be shot?

1446
02:02:22,813 --> 02:02:25,280
Actually it feels great. He gave me...

1447
02:02:25,281 --> 02:02:27,689
What's it called? Morfon...? Morphine.

1448
02:02:28,304 --> 02:02:33,393
- Well, you got your merit badge now?
- Yeah... I don't know what that means.

1449
02:02:33,394 --> 02:02:36,732
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really?

1450
02:02:38,917 --> 02:02:41,936
- Not that one.
- What?

1451
02:02:41,937 --> 02:02:44,978
- Don't even think about it.
- How did you know what I was thinking?

1452
02:02:44,979 --> 02:02:48,979
What, did she say something to you?
I felt, we had a vibe...

1453
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:51,805
Take it easy, it's just
the morphine kicking in.

1454
02:02:52,904 --> 02:02:56,242
Besides, after all we've been through,

1455
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:59,585
I'd hate to have to
beat you to death.

1456
02:02:59,776 --> 02:03:01,503
That would suck.

1457
02:03:03,562 --> 02:03:05,655
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1458
02:03:05,656 --> 02:03:08,892
Take care of yourself
I'll see you in the hospital.

1459
02:03:15,764 --> 02:03:18,884
Hey. Thanks for saving
my daughter's life.

1460
02:03:20,179 --> 02:03:23,004
What was I gonna do?

1461
02:03:24,181 --> 02:03:26,699
That's what makes you "that" guy.

1462
02:03:29,237 --> 02:03:30,725
Yeah.

1463
02:03:38,293 --> 02:03:40,502
Did he say anything about me?

1464
02:03:42,114 --> 02:03:43,927
Jesus, Lucy!

1465
02:03:43,962 --> 02:03:47,158
What? I'm sorry,
I'm just asking.

1466
02:03:48,188 --> 02:03:51,564
I'm in enough pain already.
Hospital...
