1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,954
Previously on Teen Wolf...

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,531
You mind taking a look at those pictures

3
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:06,557
I was telling you about?

4
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:08,338
A wolf could chase down its prey,

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,467
hobbling it by tearing at the ankles.

6
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:14,117
Don't think for a second
I've given up on finding out

7
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:15,190
what your little secret is.

8
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,448
No, we're not done here.

9
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:21,684
This was...

10
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:24,113
Kind of a perfect birthday.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,403
Move! Move!

12
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:27,576
Allison!

13
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,394
Lydia, what did you see?

14
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:32,251
Something.

15
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,324
Damn it.

16
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,241
Oh, crap.

17
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:37,641
<font color="#ec14bd">S@chith Collection</font>

18
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,795
No. No, stop.

19
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,246
You're dead.

20
00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,921
What-what the hell was that?

21
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:00,877
Said I was gonna teach you.

22
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:01,861
I didn't say when.

23
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,428
You scared the crap out of me.

24
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,611
Not yet.

25
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,291
Okay, but I was fast, right?

26
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,888
Not fast enough.

27
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,851
But-but the car alarm thing,

28
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,082
that was smart, right?

29
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,383
Till your phone rang.

30
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,850
Yeah, but that was-I mean...

31
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,122
Would you just stop?

32
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:19,901
Please?

33
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,325
What happened the other night,

34
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,224
Stiles' dad getting hurt,
that was my fault.

35
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:26,588
I should have been there to do something.

36
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:29,262
I need you to teach me how to control this.

37
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:31,962
Look, I am what I am because of birth.

38
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:32,873
You were bitten.

39
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:35,906
Teaching someone who was bitten takes time.

40
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:38,082
I don't even know if I can teach you.

41
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,278
What do I have to do?

44
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,295
This is why I caught you.

45
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,108
You want me to teach you?

46
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:48,471
Get rid of her.

47
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:51,415
What, just because of her family?

48
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,815
Wait-wait-whoa-whoa!

49
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,726
You getting angry?

50
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,066
That's your first lesson.

51
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,370
You want to learn how to control this,

52
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,041
how to shift, you do it through anger,

53
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,095
by tapping into a primal animal rage,

54
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:07,143
and you can't do that with her around.

55
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:08,357
I can get angry.

56
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,847
Not angry enough.

57
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,398
This is the only way that I can teach you.

58
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,314
Now, can you stay away from her?

59
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:18,274
At least until after the full moon?

60
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,174
If that's what it takes.

61
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,698
Do you want to live?

62
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:22,769
Do you want to protect your friends?

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,214
Yes or no?

64
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:25,649
Yes.

65
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,126
If you can teach me, I
can stay away from her.

66
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,736
Take it off.

67
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:39,750
You're okay with that?

68
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:41,973
Are you okay with it?

69
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,560
You're asking me if I'm okay
with taking off your clothes?

70
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,309
Stupid question.

71
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,678
Like, world record stupid.

72
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,102
You first.

73
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,500
Just a second.

74
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,172
Allison.

75
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,335
Uh, coming. Coming.

76
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,582
What's up?

77
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,190
Uh, nothing.

78
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,713
Just doing homework, sending some emails.

79
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,161
Emailing the boyfriend?

80
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,352
No.

81
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,561
I'm emailing peta about
how my wing nut father

82
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:00,153
gunned down an innocent mountain
lion in the school parking lot.

83
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:02,017
And that wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact

84
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:04,349
that you're grounded and
you can't see Scott?

85
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,865
I'm not gonna be one of
those whining teenagers

86
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,999
who looks at her father and says,

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,967
"I hate you. I wish you were dead. "

88
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,485
But...

89
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,002
I hate him and I wish he was dead.

90
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:17,937
See, now you're starting to sound
like a normal, angry teenager.

91
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,263
What are you working on?

92
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,360
Can I help?

93
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:24,678
Uh, a history project, and I just
want to be left alone, actually.

94
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,620
Come on.

95
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,032
What kind of history project?

96
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,162
I have to come up with a report

97
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:30,417
that has some relevance
to my own family history.

98
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:32,488
Specific to your family?

99
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,640
Why? Do you have any ideas?

100
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,141
Type this in.

101
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:41,834
"La Bete du Gevaudan. "

102
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,162
The beast of Gevaudan.

103
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,638
What is this?

104
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,994
It's an old French legend
that, believe it or not,

105
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,006
has something to do with your family.

106
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,155
"In 1766 in a province of Lozere,

107
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,846
la Bete killed over a hundred people. "

108
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:00,396
Mysterious animal attacks,

109
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:04,111
just like a certain town
called beacon hills.

110
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:09,934
So what was it?

111
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,365
The animal?

112
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,067
Nobody knows for sure, but
I can tell you one thing.

113
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:15,195
It definitely wasn't a mountain lion.

114
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:18,049
What's it look like to you?

115
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:24,277
It looks like...

116
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,725
A wolf.

117
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:58,864
Derek?

118
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:04,098
I- I know I said I would stay
away, but you broke my phone.

119
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:06,926
I had to at least tell her
why I wasn't answering.

120
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,539
Derek?

121
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:21,612
You seriously need to stop doing that.

122
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:22,469
So what happened?

123
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,433
Did he talk to you?

124
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:24,369
Yeah.

125
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,857
We had a nice conversation
about the weather.

126
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,313
No, he didn't talk.

127
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:29,577
Well, did you get anything off of him?

128
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:31,080
An impression.

129
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:33,192
What do you mean?

130
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:36,562
Remember your other senses are heightened.

131
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:38,278
Communication doesn't have to be spoken.

132
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,119
What kind of feeling did you get from him?

133
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,167
Anger.

134
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,318
Focused on you?

135
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,082
No, not-not me.

136
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,003
But it was definitely anger.

137
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:52,230
I could feel it.

138
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,278
Especially when he drew the spiral.

139
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,670
Wait, the what?

140
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,370
What'd you just say?

141
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,371
He drew this spiral on
the window of my car,

142
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:04,044
in the condensation, you know?

143
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,391
What?

144
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:07,204
You have this look like
you know what it means.

145
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,957
No, it's-it's nothing.

146
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,482
Wait-wait-wait-wait a second.

147
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,736
You can't do that.

148
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,197
You can't ask me to trust you

149
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,831
and then just keep things to yourself.

150
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,777
Doesn't mean anything.

151
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,233
You buried your sister under a spiral.

152
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,811
What does it mean?

153
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,779
You don't want to know.

154
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:49,473
Stay away from Allison.

155
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:54,050
Stay away from Allison.

156
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,113
Stay away from Allison.

157
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,858
Stay away from Allison.

158
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:06,089
Must stay away from Allison.

159
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,975
Just stay away from Allison.

160
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,589
Stay away from Jackson.

161
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,430
Just stay away from Jackson.

162
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:13,166
Hey, Scott.

163
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,635
Oh, come on!

164
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:34,104
Still not talking to me?

165
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:39,510
Can you at least tell
me if your dad's okay?

166
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,301
I mean, it's just a bruise, right?

167
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,789
Some soft tissue damage?

168
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:51,835
You know I feel really bad about it, right?

169
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,421
Okay.

170
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,705
What if I told you that I'm trying

171
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:01,539
to figure this whole thing out, and...

172
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,965
That I went to Derek for help?

173
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:06,846
If I was talking to you,

174
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,814
I'd say that you're an
idiot for trusting him.

175
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:14,363
But obviously I'm not talking to you.

176
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,054
What did he say?

177
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:35,525
Wh-he wants you to tap into
your animal side and get angry?

178
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,244
Yeah.

179
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:37,370
All right, well, correct me if I'm wrong,

180
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,257
but every time you do that,
you try to kill someone,

181
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,444
and that someone's usually me.

182
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:41,863
I know.

183
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,132
That's what he means when
he says he doesn't know

184
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,021
if he can teach me.

185
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,491
I have to be able to control it.

186
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,150
Well, how's he gonna teach you to do that?

187
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:48,951
I don't know.

188
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,229
I don't think he does either.

189
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,928
Okay.

190
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:51,827
When are you seeing him again?

191
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:52,826
Just told me not to talk about it.

192
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:54,478
Just act normal and get through the day.

193
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,053
When?

194
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:59,167
He's picking me up at the
animal clinic after work.

195
00:12:59,168 --> 00:12:59,771
After work.

196
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:03,212
All right, well, that gives me to
the end of the school day then.

197
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:04,739
To do what?

198
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,385
To teach you myself.

199
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:11,882
The what of who?

200
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:13,317
The beast of Gevaudan.

201
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:15,177
Listen.

202
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,542
"A quadruped wolf-like monster,

203
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,461
prowling the Auvergne and south
Dordogne areas of France

204
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:24,866
during the year 1764 to 1767.

205
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:27,594
La Bete killed over a hundred people,

206
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:30,931
becoming so infamous that
the King Louie the 15th

207
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:33,686
sent one of his best hunters
to try and kill it. "

208
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,737
Boring.

209
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:36,267
"Even the church eventually declared

210
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:38,413
the monster a messenger of Satan. "

211
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,442
Still boring.

212
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:41,808
"Cryptozoologists believe it may have been

213
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,948
a subspecies of hoofed predator,
possibly a mesonychid. "

214
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,753
"Slipping into a coma" bored.

215
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,815
"While others believe it
was a powerful sorcerer

216
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:52,147
who could shape-shift into
a man-eating monster. "

217
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,135
Any of this have anything
to do with your family?

218
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,331
This.

219
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,003
"It is believed that la Bete was finally

220
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,033
trapped and killed by a renown hunter

221
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:01,453
who claimed his wife and
four children were the first

222
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:05,323
to fall prey to the creature. "

223
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,244
His name was Argent.

224
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,162
Your ancestors killed a big wolf.

225
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:10,642
So what?

226
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,437
Not just a big wolf.

227
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,995
Take a look at this picture.

228
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,688
What does it look like to you?

229
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:28,650
Lydia?

230
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:32,861
Lydia.

231
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,762
It looks... like a big... wolf.

232
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:40,412
See you in History.

233
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,094
I think the book's making it more obvious.

234
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,648
Besides, she's reading, anyway.

235
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,720
So did you come up with a plan yet?

236
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,630
I think so.

237
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,435
Does that mean you don't hate me now?

238
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:01,560
No.

239
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,429
But your crap has infiltrated my life,

240
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,053
so now I have to do something about it.

241
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,037
Plus I'm definitely a
better Yoda than Derek.

242
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,072
Okay, yeah, you teach me.

243
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,297
Yeah, I'll be your Yoda.

244
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,091
Yeah, you be my Yoda.

245
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:14,216
Your Yoda I will be.

246
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:16,419
I said it backwards.

247
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,790
Yeah, I-I know.

248
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,503
All right, you know what?

249
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:19,735
I definitely still hate you.

250
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,696
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

251
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,777
Scott.

252
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,380
Scott, wait.

253
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:32,755
Hey, Scott.

254
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:33,951
Sc-

255
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,828
This is not gonna be easy.

256
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,956
Okay.

257
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:55,603
Now... put this on.

258
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:59,517
Isn't this one of the heart rate
monitors for the track team?

259
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:00,858
Yeah, I borrowed it.

260
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,860
Stole it.

261
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,006
Temporarily misappropriated.

262
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,725
Coach uses it to monitor his heart
rate with his phone while he jogs,

263
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,488
and you're gonna wear it
for the rest of the day.

264
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,577
Isn't that coach's phone?

265
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:11,323
That, I stole.

266
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,164
Why?

267
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:14,750
All right, well, your heart rate
goes up when you go wolf, right?

268
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,728
When you're playing lacrosse,

269
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:16,424
when you're with Allison,

270
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,554
whenever you get angry.

271
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,311
Maybe learning to control
it is tied to learning

272
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,673
to control your heart rate.

273
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:23,385
Like the Incredible Hulk.

274
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,291
Kind of like the Incredible Hulk, yeah.

275
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,505
No, I'm like the Incredible Hulk.

276
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,266
Would you shut up and put the strap on?

277
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,742
This isn't exactly how I wanted
to spend my free period.

278
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:37,392
All right.

279
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:38,032
You ready?

280
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:38,822
No.

281
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:42,233
Remember, don't get angry.

282
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:47,199
I'm starting to think this
was a really bad idea.

283
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,420
Oh, man.

284
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,234
Okay, that one... kind of hurt.

285
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:00,748
Quiet.

286
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:01,472
Remember, you're supposed to be

287
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,530
thinking about your heart rate, all right?

288
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,537
About staying calm.

289
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,322
Stay calm.

290
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,073
Staying calm.

291
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,634
Staying totally calm.

292
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,366
There's no balls flying at my face-

293
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,194
Aah! Son of a bitch!

294
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:23,945
You know what?

295
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:26,351
I think my aim is actually improving.

296
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:28,218
Wonder why.

297
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,696
Don't get angry.

298
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,064
I'm not getting angry.

299
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,466
Scott?

300
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:14,278
Scott, you started to change.

301
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,787
From anger.

302
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:19,264
But it was more than that.

303
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,704
Was like, the angrier I
got, the stronger I felt.

304
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:25,721
So it is anger, then. Derek's right.

305
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:27,915
I can't be around Allison.

306
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,794
Just because she makes you happy?

307
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:32,713
No, because she makes me weak.

308
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,839
Alright, so you stay away from her for a few days.
You could do that.

309
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:42,723
But is it a few days, or is it forever?

310
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:44,323
You know, this whole "women
make you weak" thing

311
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,732
is a little too spartan warrior for me.

312
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,389
It's probably just part
of the learning process.

313
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,301
Yeah, but you've seen Derek.

314
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,845
I mean, the guy's totally alone.

315
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,809
What if I can, like, never
be around her again?

316
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,670
Well, if you're not dead,

317
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,343
that could be a good thing.

318
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:03,454
Rather be dead.

319
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,450
You're not gonna end up
like Derek, all right?

320
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:06,836
We'll figure it out.

321
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:07,857
'Kay.

322
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,673
Come on. Let's get out of here.

323
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,066
Something smells terrible in here, anyway.

324
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,505
Really? In a boys' locker room?

325
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,325
That doesn't make any sense at all.

326
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:18,573
No, it's like something's rotting or dying.

327
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,843
What are you reading?

328
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:34,765
Oh, hey.

329
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:39,018
Just stuff for a history project.

330
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,672
You have a free period, or...

331
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:57,948
No, I-I just don't like
sitting through Chem.

332
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:59,713
Understandable.

333
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,285
Did... did you want something?

334
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,009
Actually, um, yeah.

335
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,360
I wanted to talk.

336
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,722
I realize that I've been a jerk to you.

337
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:20,063
And especially to Scott.

338
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:24,066
And I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

339
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,895
I'm serious.

340
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:27,528
Okay.

341
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,095
I... I believe you're being serious,

342
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:34,504
but I'm not so sure I believe
you're being sincere.

343
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:39,797
Do you know what it's like to be

344
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,980
the best player on the team?

345
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,897
To be the star?

346
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,272
To have every single person at

347
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,603
the game chanting your name?

348
00:21:57,078 --> 00:22:00,113
And then... some kid...

349
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:01,695
Some kid just comes along,

350
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,231
and then everyone starts
looking at him instead of you.

351
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,266
Do you know what that feels like?

352
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,159
No, I don't.

353
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:15,095
Well, it feels like something's been...

354
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,564
It feels like something's
been stolen from you.

355
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:24,101
And then you start to feel like you'd do...
anything.

356
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,600
Anything in the world to get it back.

357
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,039
Haven't you ever learned
there's no "I" in "team"?

358
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:37,013
Yeah, but there is a "me. "

359
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,405
Ha. That was a joke.

360
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:43,705
Gosh.

361
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,129
You must really, really hate me.

362
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,890
Not at all.

363
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,665
You sure?

364
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:57,849
Because... I'm not a bad guy.

365
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,692
I mean, yeah, I make stupid mistakes.

366
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,566
A lot, but...

367
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,863
I'm not bad.

368
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:07,982
I really like you.

369
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,358
And-and Scott.

370
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,093
I really-I really like you both,

371
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:14,541
and I want you guys to like me.

372
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,725
I want to get to know you guys better.

373
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:26,241
So... what are you reading?

374
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:28,526
Let's go.

375
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:29,988
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

376
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:31,548
We got a lot to cover today.

377
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:33,023
Let's go.

378
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,426
Quicker.

379
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:37,778
Hey, Stiles, sit behind me, dude.

380
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:47,307
I haven't seen you all day.

381
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:48,312
Uh, yeah.

382
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:50,585
I've been, uh, super busy.

383
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:51,687
When are you gonna get your phone fixed?

384
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:53,733
I feel like I'm totally
disconnected from you.

385
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,184
Uh, soon.

386
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,690
Real soon.

387
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:59,131
I changed lab partners, by the way.

388
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,125
Oh. To who?

389
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:01,467
To you, dummy.

390
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,266
Me?

391
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:05,287
I mean, are you sure?

392
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,716
Yeah.

393
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:10,089
This way I have an excuse to
bring you home and study.

394
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:16,479
You don't mind, do you?

395
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:20,868
I just-I don't want to
bring your grade down.

396
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:24,558
Well, I mean, maybe I can
bring your grade up.

397
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:27,855
Come to my place tonight. 8:30?

398
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,102
Tonight?

399
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,645
8:30.

400
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,032
Let's settle down.

401
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,306
Let's start with a quick summary

402
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,143
of last night's reading.

403
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,426
Greenberg, put your hand down.

404
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:42,016
Everybody knows you did the reading.

405
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,383
How about, uh...

406
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:46,904
McCall.

407
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:48,354
What?

408
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,522
The reading.

409
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:53,214
Last night's reading?

410
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:54,924
How about, uh, the reading of

411
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:56,911
the Gettysburg Address?

412
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,650
What?

413
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:59,110
That's sarcasm.

414
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,202
You familiar with the term

415
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:02,422
"sarcasm," McCall?

416
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:03,718
Very.

417
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,653
Did you do the reading or not?

418
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,087
I- I think I forgot.

419
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:10,422
Nice work, McCall.

420
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,773
It's not like you're not
averaging a "D" in this class.

421
00:25:12,774 --> 00:25:13,887
Come on, buddy.

422
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:14,644
You know I can't keep you on

423
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,875
the team if you have a "D."

424
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,530
How about you summarize, uh, the

425
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:21,128
previous night's reading?

426
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,177
No?

427
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:26,290
How about the, uh, the night before that?

428
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:30,644
How about you summarize
anything you've ever read...

429
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,589
In your entire life?

430
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:34,203
I- I, uh...

431
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:35,208
No? A blog?

432
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:36,689
How about, uh, how about, uh,

433
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,434
the back of a cereal box? No?

434
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:42,196
How about the adults only warning
from your favorite website

435
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:44,174
you visit every night?

436
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,425
Anything?

437
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:48,368
Thank you, McCall, thank you.

438
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:49,497
Thank you, McCall!

439
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:53,324
Thank you for extinguishing
any last flicker of hope

440
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,279
I have for your generation.

441
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,152
You just blew it for everybody.

442
00:25:57,153 --> 00:26:01,133
Thanks. Next practice you can
start with suicide runs.

443
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:04,193
Unless that's too much reading.

444
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:06,636
All right.

445
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:10,060
Everybody else, settle down.

446
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,481
It's her.

447
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:36,066
What do you mean?

448
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:37,376
It's Allison.

449
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:39,280
Remember what you told me about
the night of the full moon?

450
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,347
You were thinking about her, right?

451
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,835
About protecting her.

452
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:43,383
Okay.

453
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,547
Remember the night of the
first lacrosse game?

454
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,188
You said you could hear her
voice out on the field.

455
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:47,929
Yeah, I did.

456
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,117
Well, so that's what brought
you back so you could score.

457
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,256
And then after the game in the
locker room, you didn't kill her.

458
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:53,962
At least not like how you
were trying to kill me.

459
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:57,053
She brings you back, is what I'm saying.

460
00:26:57,054 --> 00:26:59,808
No, no, no, but it's not
always true, because literally

461
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,384
every time I'm kissing her

462
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:02,247
or-or touching her...

463
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:03,915
No, that's not the same.

464
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,134
When you're doing that, you're
just another hormonal teenager

465
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:09,383
thinking about sex, you know?

466
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,115
You're thinking about sex
right now, aren't you?

467
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:13,078
Yeah. Sorry.

468
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,906
That's fine.
Look, back in the classroom when

469
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:17,379
she was holding your hand,
that was different, okay?

470
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,293
I don't think she makes you weak.

471
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:20,331
I- I think she actually gives you control.

472
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:21,505
She's kind of like an anchor.

473
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,320
You mean because I love her.

474
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,971
Exactly.

475
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,721
Did I just say that?

476
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:28,183
Yes, you just said that.

477
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:31,625
I love her.

478
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:32,351
That's great.

479
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,013
Now, moving on...

480
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:35,213
No, no, no, really.

481
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:37,117
I think I'm totally in love with her.

482
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,373
And that's beautiful.

483
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:40,258
Now, before you go off and write a sonnet,

484
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,250
can we figure this out, please?

485
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,099
Because you obviously can't
be around her all the time.

486
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,754
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

487
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:47,927
So what do I do?

488
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:50,405
I don't know. Yet.

489
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,503
Oh, no. You're getting an idea, aren't you?

490
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:57,586
Yeah.

491
00:27:57,587 --> 00:27:59,240
Is this idea gonna get me in trouble?

492
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:00,140
Maybe.

493
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:01,675
Is this idea gonna cause me physical pain?

494
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:03,672
Yeah, definitely. Come on.

495
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:05,928
What are we doing?

496
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:07,633
You'll see. Hold on.

497
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:09,696
Okay. Stand right there.

498
00:28:09,697 --> 00:28:11,160
Do you have your keys?

499
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,846
Perfect.

500
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:16,469
Hold 'em up like so.

501
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,706
Now, whatever happens,
just think about Allison.

502
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:21,437
Try to find her voice
like you did at the game.

503
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,301
Got it?

504
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,534
Okay.

505
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:27,892
Just... keep holding it right there.

506
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:41,951
Hey, hey, hey, dude!

507
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:42,930
What do you think you're doing

508
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,442
to that truck, bro?

509
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:49,365
What the hell?

510
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,690
Ow! My God. Wow.

511
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,776
Ah, come on, stay calm. Stay calm.

512
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,490
Oh, that's not okay.

513
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:21,368
Scott. Come on, buddy.

514
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,338
Studying with a friend.

515
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:45,368
Yes, that friend.

516
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,612
We're lab partners.

517
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:50,751
Stop!

518
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:53,116
Hey, stop it right now.

519
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:00,794
What do you idiots think you're doing?

520
00:30:16,078 --> 00:30:18,559
I need your help.

521
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,752
If you can hear me, I need
you to give me a sign.

522
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:24,602
Blink. Raise a finger.

523
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:27,340
Anything. Just...

524
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,061
Just something to point me in
the right direction, okay?

525
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:36,003
Someone killed Laura.

526
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:40,514
Your niece.

527
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,712
Laura?

528
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,663
Whoever he is, he's an Alpha now.

529
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,156
But he's one without a pack.

530
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,185
Which means he's not as strong.

531
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,000
I can take him.

532
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:07,778
But I have to find him first.

533
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:08,838
Look, if you know something,

534
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:11,122
just give me a sign.

535
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,262
Is it one of us?

536
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,291
Someone else make it out of the fire?

537
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:22,046
Just give me anything. Blink.

538
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:22,869
Raise a finger.

539
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,650
Anything.

540
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,880
Say something!

541
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,407
Let him go.

542
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,980
You think after six years of this,

543
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:32,556
yelling at him is going to get a response?

544
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,605
Got a better method?

545
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:34,435
Patience.

546
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,805
He'll respond if you give him the time.

547
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,275
I don't have any more time.

548
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:34,688
Excuse me, sir?

549
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:35,701
Uh, I know it's detention and all,

550
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:37,495
but, uh, I'm supposed to be at work,

551
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:40,181
and I don't want to get fired.

552
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,649
You knew I would heal.

553
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,047
Yep.

554
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,720
So you did that to help me learn?

555
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,029
Yep.

556
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:57,568
But partially to punish me.

557
00:32:57,569 --> 00:32:58,465
Yeah.

558
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:02,005
Well, that one's obvious.

559
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:04,431
Dude, you're my best friend,

560
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:08,680
and I can't have you being angry with me.

561
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,827
I'm not angry anymore.

562
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:19,311
Look, you have something, Scott.

563
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,746
Okay?

564
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:23,967
Whether you want it or not,

565
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,178
you can do things that nobody else can do.

566
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,266
So that means you don't
have a choice anymore.

567
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:34,247
It means you have to do something.

568
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:40,252
I know. And I will.

569
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:44,549
All right, both of you, out of here.

570
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,941
Thank you.

571
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,898
Scott, you're late again.

572
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,399
I hope this isn't getting to be a habit.

573
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,914
Can I help you?

574
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:15,885
Hope so.

575
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:16,978
Want to know about the animal you found

576
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:19,587
with the spiral on its side?

577
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:20,867
Excuse me?

578
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:21,651
What animal?

579
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:22,985
Three months ago.

580
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:24,736
The deer.

581
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,237
You remember this?

582
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:31,460
Oh, yes.

583
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:32,959
It's just a deer.

584
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,828
And I didn't find it.

585
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,248
They called me because they wanted to know

586
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:37,142
if I'd ever seen anything like it.

587
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,548
What'd you tell 'em?

588
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:41,065
I told them no.

589
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:48,337
Did you hear that?

590
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:51,704
Hear what?

591
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:55,060
The sound of your heartbeat rising.

592
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:56,342
Excuse me?

593
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:58,330
It's the sound of you lying.

594
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,914
Oh, God.

595
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,526
Are you protecting someone?

596
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:19,609
All right.

597
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,432
The key to the drug locker is in my pocket.

598
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,222
I don't want drugs.

599
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:25,040
I want to know why you're lying.

600
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,149
I don't know what you're talking about.

601
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:29,906
What are you doing to me?

602
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:30,575
What do you want?

603
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:31,651
I want to know who you are or

604
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:33,202
who you're protecting.

605
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:34,715
What are you doing?

606
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,590
Scott, get out of here!

607
00:35:38,198 --> 00:35:39,614
Stop! Stop!

608
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:40,475
Look, when he's conscious,

609
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:41,511
he can keep himself from healing,

610
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:42,733
but unconscious, he can't.

611
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:44,161
Are you out of your mind?

612
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:45,410
What are you talking about?

613
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,257
You want to know what the
spiral means, Scott?

614
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,375
It's our sign for a vendetta, for revenge.

615
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,471
It means he won't stop killing
until he's satisfied.

616
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:52,865
You think he's the Alpha?

617
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,582
We're about to find out.

618
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,620
Hit him again, and then
you'll see me get angry.

619
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,026
Do you have a plan?

620
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:31,703
Just give me an hour.

621
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:33,489
Then what?

622
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:36,859
Meet me at the school.

623
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,785
In the parking lot.

624
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:02,756
This is a terrible idea.

625
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,177
Yeah, I know.

626
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,130
But we're still gonna do it?

627
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,538
Can you think of something better?

628
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,263
Well, personally I'm a fan
of ignoring a problem

629
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:10,284
until eventually it just goes away.

630
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:12,162
Just make sure we can get inside.

631
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,455
He's here.

632
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:23,953
Where's my boss?

633
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:25,670
He's in the back.

634
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:33,505
Oh, well, he looks comfortable.

635
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,370
Wait. Hey.

636
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,656
What are you doing?

637
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,290
You said I was linked with the Alpha.

638
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,427
I'm gonna see if you're right.

639
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:55,779
Okay, one question.

640
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,977
What are you gonna do if
the Alpha doesn't show up?

641
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,935
I don't know.

642
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,815
And what are you gonna
do if he does show up?

643
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,182
I don't know.

644
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,554
Good plan.

645
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:07,754
All right.

646
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:09,899
You said that a wolf howls
to signal his position

647
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,847
to the rest of the pack, right?

648
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:12,930
Right, but if you bring him here,

649
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:15,611
does that make you part of his pack?

650
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:16,616
I hope not.

651
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:17,921
Yeah, me too.

652
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:20,999
All right.

653
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,942
All you.

654
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:34,790
You've got to be kidding me.

655
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:44,030
Was that okay?
I mean, that was a howl, right?

656
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,857
I- yeah, technically.

657
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,200
Well, what did it sound like to you?

658
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,481
Like a cat being choked to death, Scott.

659
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:53,052
What do I do?

660
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:54,138
How am I supposed to do this?

661
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,890
Hey, hey.

662
00:38:56,754 --> 00:38:58,036
Listen to me.

663
00:38:58,037 --> 00:38:59,678
You're calling the Alpha.

664
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,689
All right?

665
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,228
Be a man.

666
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:05,489
Be a werewolf, not a teen wolf.

667
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,266
Be a werewolf.

668
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:08,684
Werewolf.

669
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:10,211
Do it.

670
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:43,479
I'm gonna kill both of you.

671
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,478
What the hell was that?

672
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:47,483
What are you trying to do, attract
the entire state to the school?

673
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,115
Sorry. I didn't know it would be that loud.

674
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:51,167
Yeah, it was loud.

675
00:39:51,168 --> 00:39:53,178
And it was * awesome *.

676
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:54,162
Shut up.

677
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:56,993
Don't be such a sour wolf.

678
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,200
What'd you do with him?

679
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,253
What?

680
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,417
I didn't do anything.

681
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:37,408
Lock it!

682
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:40,494
Next time on Teen Wolf...

683
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:41,895
Somebody please explain
to me what's going on,

684
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,789
because I'm freaking out here.

685
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,693
Derek's not dead.

686
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:45,741
He-he can't be dead.

687
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:46,977
He's dead and we're next.

688
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,185
Wait, Allison.

689
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:51,714
You're about to say "be careful. "

690
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,395
Please don't go.

691
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:54,853
Please don't leave us.

692
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:56,098
Please.

693
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:58,226
We're at the school.

694
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,606
Dad, we're at the school.

695
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:06,552
I'm not dying here.

696
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:08,359
I'm not dying at school.

697
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:18,759
