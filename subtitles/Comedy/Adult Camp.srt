1
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,828
Are you going to take the TV, too?
-Yeah.

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,077
Saara can have the kids' old one.
It's good enough for her.

3
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:21,543
Could you be a dear,
and get my kettlebell from upstairs?

4
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,888
This pink one must be yours.

5
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,143
We can take that one, too.
Saara never uses it.

6
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,773
What happened?

7
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,900
Sorry.

8
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,909
Your... thingy is here.

9
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,537
Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

10
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,705
What are you doing home?
-I thought you were coming at three.

11
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,960
At one. Why are you lurking here?
We've been here an hour.

12
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,170
I was just working out here.

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,640
I was wearing headphones,
so I didn't hear you at first.

14
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:14,103
I thought it's embarrassing
to suddenly announce myself-

15
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:18,138
so I started to clean a bit
under this rug.

16
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:24,485
Right. Well, seeing as you're here,
can you lend a hand?

17
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,824
After all, you're a real powerhouse.

18
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,707
Thanks.

19
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,846
Remember, mum is bringing you Pussy
to look after in a couple of weeks.

20
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,092
Me? why?

21
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,305
She is used to being here.

22
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,523
It's your mum's cat,
she should be with you.

23
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,187
I didn't want to burden her
with the divorce or moving out news.

24
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,814
But I won't be at home!

25
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,193
I'm starting my new life.
I'm going to a camp-

26
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:15,451
with handsome, smart guys,
who understand women.

27
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,076
We will have discussions
and make love on hot rocks.

28
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,502
<i>Do you want to be young once again?</i>

29
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:29,629
<i>Do you want to think about who</i>
<i>you are and what you want to become?</i>

30
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,425
<i>Do you dream of a spiritual growth</i>
<i>course or a coming-of-age camp?</i>

31
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,973
<i>Do you yearn for conversation,</i>
<i>or even debates?</i>

32
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,185
<i>Are you curious to see</i>
<i>how others view life?</i>

33
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:47,270
<i>Do you want to heal the world</i>
<i>and stand for equality and justice?</i>

34
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,275
<i>I'm a certified</i>
<i>personal growth coach</i> -

35
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,533
<i>with a Kerala Diploma</i>
<i>of Human Growth -</i>

36
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:01,666
<i>and I invite you to Turku</i>
<i>to a meaning of life camp for adults.</i>

37
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:06,962
<i>The price includes the camp</i>
<i>programme, a delightful room -</i>

38
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,049
<i>gourmet-level full hoard,</i>
<i>and a growth guarantee.</i>

39
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,635
<i>Invest in yourself and experience</i>
<i>the greatest week of your life.</i>

40
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,099
I will not be looking after Pussy!

41
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,815
Hi! Excuse me, can I get
your autograph'! -Sure you can.

42
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,137
Can I help in any way? -There's
no need. just clear the gangway.

43
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:06,275
Fantastic! We have a great group!
Take a good look at each other.

44
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,310
These people
are going to change your life!

45
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,063
This is going to be a great week!

46
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:18,865
I'm Kalle, I'll be your escort,
but you will make this a journey.

47
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:23,579
I think we are all here.
-Not everybody is here yet.

48
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,209
Kokko, Saara.

49
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,207
Kannisto, Alli.
-I am. That's me.

50
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,430
Then registered together are
Vilen, Viivi and Häkkinen, Jouko.

51
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,590
Viivi has not yet arrived.

52
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,977
I'm sure you understand that
there can be no refund at this point.

53
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,313
But she does want
to come to this camp.

54
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,436
Are you Kalle?
-Yes.

55
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,861
Why is there less money
for provisions than agreed?

56
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,740
I gave the amount we discussed.
But can we get back to that?

57
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:02,332
Let's not bother the campers
with money talk.

58
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:08,083
Darling, here's your bag.
Tepsi and I are heading home.

59
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:13,589
I'll see you...
See you when you come.

60
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,183
So I don't catch the gay.

61
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,731
Now you could also come.
There was a cancellation.

62
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:42,403
He's lying. I know when people are
lying. You can see it in their aura.

63
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,573
I'm missing you a little.

64
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,533
Yours is quite weak.

65
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:52,504
Kind of messy. Have you let someone
do something to you? Trample on you?

66
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,509
Nobody's trampled on me. Excuse me.

67
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,426
Hi.

68
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,686
Has she been yowling the whole time?
-Only when the rocking started.

69
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,983
She's probably scared.

70
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,562
Are you scared?

71
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:21,161
I don't like the sea. My mum drowned
in the Estonian cruise ship disaster.

72
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,786
I'm sorry.
-Well, it was twenty years ago.

73
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,291
It's annoying
that we're going to an island then.

74
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,879
I want to take part
in the revolution camp.

75
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,928
Revolution? Isn't it coming-of-age?

76
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:45,180
No, we'll talk about societal issues
and justice.

77
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,270
I don't think this has anything
to do with politics.

78
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:57,398
The video was about coming-of-age
camps. Camps for growing up.

79
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:03,493
Oh. Well, damn.
What am I doing here then?

80
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,123
Welcome.

81
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,709
Welcome.
-Thank you.

82
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,632
I can help you.

83
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,439
What's this pussy's name?
-Pussy.

84
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,188
Careful now. Nicely done.

85
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:49,448
Is it clear for all
that this is a dry camp? -What?

86
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,158
This is my seventh camp.

87
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:58,291
It's really important to meet on
an alcohol-free plain at these camps.

88
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,253
This is champagne.
It's drunk for the taste.

89
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,264
I have cheeses and strawberries, too.

90
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:10,761
Not everyone can afford that. Did you
consider those who are less well-off?

91
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,018
There are people
who do real work here.

92
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,688
Did you really think proletarians
can afford champagne?

93
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,320
Wonderful!

94
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:26,572
Do you see how genuine
your communication is already?

95
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:31,740
As camp leader,
I should make myself unnecessary.

96
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,954
But because of that, and
despite that, we will remain sober.

97
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:42,335
I can't make these disappear.
-We'll hold onto them for you.

98
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,716
At least let me have the cheeses.

99
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,052
It smells good,
and I'm sure it is tasty, too.

100
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,120
The lavatories are over there,
around the corner.

101
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:15,703
The sauna is heated every day.
It's a good place to get clean.

102
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,211
Now for an important announcement!

103
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:23,340
The well water from the taps
is not drinkable.

104
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,547
It contains a bacterial strain.

105
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,717
We brought enough drinking water
from the mainland. just ask me.

106
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,264
The indoor toilets are not in use.

107
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:40,101
For the common good,
I recommend you keep this in mind.

108
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,905
Go ahead.
-Where are the horses?

109
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,650
There are no horses here.

110
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,158
There were in the video.

111
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:57,914
Right! The horses!
Yes. My dear friends -

112
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,582
those horses symbolise a free mind.

113
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,136
This is where the lodgings are.

114
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,052
How about you take this room?

115
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:18,106
You brought your beloved pet?
-No. This is not beloved at all.

116
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:23,691
But you brought it anyway. Room mate,
you don't have allergies, right?

117
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,230
You could go here.

118
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,693
Let's go this way, men.

119
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,701
I was supposed to share
a two-person room with Viivi.

120
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,870
Who is this Viivi?

121
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,712
The lady who was late. It's supposed
to be a two-person room.

122
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:49,794
These are,
but you can easily fit three persons.

123
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:55,388
If I get my good friend to come,
can we have a two-person room?

124
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,011
Anything can always be arranged.

125
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:05,897
Petri will surely switch if you want
to take the upper cabin with me. -No.

126
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:14,990
Eyes closed! Here comes Boss Pig!

127
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,241


128
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,672
Boss Pig is going!

129
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,468
Little piggies, open your eyes
and guess who's under the blanket.

130
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,390
Whoever answers correctly gets
to be the next Boss Pig.

131
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,186
Is it Mervi under there?
-Mervi works in the kitchens.

132
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,479
It's... What was her name?
-Alli.

133
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,648
No, I am Alli.

134
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,570
It's that Pussy's mum.
What was her name?

135
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:03,077
When you have reached your own goal,
you can pop the balloon.

136
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:31,694
How can we help to achieve this goal
of 'break from pussy“?

137
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:43,789
All of us women could stay far away
from this person. Would that help?

138
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,758
These camps are free of intoxicants
and sex. That's a useless goal.

139
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,173
You don't have to stay away.

140
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,681
I'm sick of nobody being interested
in what I'm thinking.

141
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,930
Women only see me
as a sex symbol and a rock star.

142
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,180
It's really tough.

143
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:09,267
I don't want women to beg for sex
or make a fuss about who I am.

144
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,980
Excuse me, but who are you?
-Don't you know?

145
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,987
It looks like
I reached my goal already.

146
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,670
Darling, call or text me.
I'm concerned.

147
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,878
You can't come here
in the middle of everything.

148
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:39,177
And I still don't understand why you
wanted to come here in particular.

149
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,800
But I'm now here
and you are God knows where.

150
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,681
I can see that you have
unresolved issues.

151
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,561
Yeah, absolutely.

152
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,982
You are filled with fear,
and that causes you to lie.

153
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,942
I see lies as different colours
when they come out of you.

154
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:03,615
It's interesting that you're fearful.
That usually reduces with age.

155
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:09,212
What do you fear? -That I'll have
to listen to your shit for a week!

156
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,547
Stop! Shoo, evil energy be gone!

157
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:17,260
Here is a crystal surface,
and its rainbow light repels evil.

158
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,222
Are you saying grace?

159
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,149
Yes.

160
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:34,153
Unbelievable. That's really great.

161
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,233
Help yourselves.

162
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,487
Get off!

163
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,158
Excuse me, cook.
Could you please present the menu?

164
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:59,091
For starters,
there is bread and butter.

165
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:07,137
The main course is minced meat sauce,
potatoes, carrots, and cauliflower.

166
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:12,476
For dessert, there is coffee and
a slice of coffee bread. Thank you.

167
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,523
What about the vegetarian menu?

168
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,207
For starters,
there is bread and butter.

169
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:32,876
The main course is potatoes, carrots,
and cauliflower. You can add butler.

170
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,464
For dessert, coffee
and coffee bread. Thank you.

171
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,385
Thank you.

172
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,595
Are you trying to kill me?

173
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:54,267
You had slipped in garlic,
even though I informed I am allergic.

174
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,851
There was no garlic.

175
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,611


176
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,529
Was this in it?

177
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,500
Isn't that chili sauce?

178
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,996
Don't you read the label?
It says 'garlic'.

179
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:21,963
I've never heard of a garlic allergy.
You have my apologies.

180
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,014
That's not much help
when my throat closes up.

181
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm a nurse. What symptoms
do you have? -My ears are itchy.

182
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,186
Nothing else. My ears are itchy.

183
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,890
Then it's nothing fatal.

184
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:41,565
I didn't pay to come here
and have itchy ears.

185
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,993
The food was wonderful
Thank you, cook.

186
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,719
No. Come now.

187
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,456
Are you playing horse?
-No.

188
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,496
This is useless.

189
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:45,130
Do you want my help?
Do you want me to take the photo?

190
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:50,927
I don't know. This is ridiculous.
I want to go home.

191
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,803
We've only just started.

192
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:58,689
The sea is wonderful, there
are lovely rocks and people, and...

193
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,065
Even if there are no horses here.

194
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:05,898
I've been lying.
I miss my kids terribly.

195
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,155
Do you have children?
-Yes. Four.

196
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:14,789
And before you ask,
yes, I am Laestadian.

197
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:19,620
Okay. How come you are
at this kind of camp?

198
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,334
I'm supposedly at a riding camp.

199
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:27,425
I'm trying to send
deceptive photos home.

200
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:34,180
I just want to know what people
think and what they believe in.

201
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,390
I don't meet anyone
from outside the community-

202
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,224
and I've been really tired.

203
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:44,896
Then when I saw the horses
in the advert -

204
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:50,150
I told myself that this isn't
such a big lie, but it really is.

205
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,280
Does this lie mean
that you'll end up in...

206
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,621
Where will you end up? In damnation?

207
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,036
Hopefully not.

208
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,217
Are you in this room?
-Looks like it.

209
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,219
Then lam not.

210
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,990
Bloody hell, come on now!

211
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,715
...60.

212
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:53,171
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm just having a work-out.

213
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:58,472
I've been thinking.
I have those really nice cheeses -

214
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,141
and the strawberries
are not half-bad, either.

215
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:06,397
Do you fancy going for
a row to watch the sunset?

216
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,938
A little picnic.

217
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:15,320
With me? -Yes, you. It would
be nice to get to know you.

218
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,205
I'm not keen on strong cheeses.
You two should go.

219
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,495
That cat can't come in the boat.

220
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,710
Sure she can.
-No, she can't.

221
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,770
I switched rooms with Alli.

222
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:56,033
I can't share a room
with that intolerant idiot.

223
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:17,255
If I go out, my curls will get wet.
I'm not going out. I'm not.

224
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,470
Let me hold you.

225
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,436
So soft...

226
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:34,570
It's mine. I want it.
What SPF is that?

227
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:48,023
"Tepsi went into labour."

228
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,897
"Tepsi went into labour."

229
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:58,194
The number can't be reached.
"Tepsi went into labour.'

230
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,077
Is Tepsi the dog?
-I guess so.

231
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,571
What will we do now?

232
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:09,502
We'll order a taxi, go home,
and demand refunds.

233
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:14,794
I can't just leave. We've paid,
so it must be okay to stay.

234
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,672
I'd also like to stay.

235
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:24,011
You know what?
I think this is our guru's method.

236
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:28,184
By disappearing,
he is making us rely on each other.

237
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,392
This is actually quite ingenious.

238
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,767
Now we can do whatever we want.

239
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,655
Let's play truth or dare,
and get to know each other properly.

240
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,657
I have a lot of experience in running
these kinds of camps.

241
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:48,496
If you want, I can take over here.

242
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:53,207
Let's make this
a politically aware camp!

243
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,965
<i>I'm a child of the summer</i>

244
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,926
<i>I'm wild by nature</i>

245
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:09,520
<i>I'm a child of the summer</i>

246
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:13,812
<i>My worries are all gone</i>

247
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:18,444
<i>Nothing beats these summer nights</i>

248
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,651
<i>There are no tight belts</i>
<i>when I run towards the sea</i>

249
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:28,282
<i>The summer state of mind is wild</i>

250
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,994
<i>I would want to fall in love</i>
<i>with everyone</i>

251
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:41,751
<i>I would really want to kiss you</i>

252
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:47,176
<i>My heart is beating</i>
<i>I see you coming</i>

253
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:51,218
<i>This tastes like life</i>

254
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:55,938
You are cute.

255
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:18,832
I bring you a message.
Our theme is time -

256
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,000
and we're living in the wrong order-

257
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:25,341
so could you turn the food
arrangements on its head? -How?

258
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:31,054
Dinner at lunch time
and breakfast at supper time.

259
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:34,559
There's no difference.

260
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,769
Right. There isn't.

261
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,738
When Emma took charge
of the programme -

262
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:49,990
she put an end
to us having our phones.

263
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:54,747
I have one phone call
that I really have to make.

264
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:58,921
Can I leave this here with you?

265
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,414
Kalle left. Did you know?

266
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:06,382
He left in the night.
His dog went into labour.

267
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,511
I'm not sad to see that homo gone.
-Come on, now.

268
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:16,978
How much did you pay for this camp?
-800 euros.

269
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:21,562
My Lord!
He's made out like a bandit.

270
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:27,941
He can't be left with much after
the rent, food, and your wage.

271
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:33,955
This place doesn't cost anything.
The main building has damp.

272
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,330
He's pulling in at least six grand.

273
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:39,954
You've been paid, right?
-Yes. I'll do what I agreed.

274
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,997
Put the phone on the shelf.
I'll keep an eye on it.

275
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,097
You are a nice person.

276
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:39,940
What's going on? Swimming costumes
off. This is a mixed sauna.

277
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,099
It's still a mixed sauna like this.

278
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:52,035
Unashamed nudity is the best way
to clear all the erotic tension.

279
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,323
Okay. Get to it.

280
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:05,499
I can't come in
because I've had a small operation.

281
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:11,214
So let's get to know each other
better on the veranda.

282
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,387
Pants off!

283
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:19,474
It's far too hot in here.

284
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,516
What do you do, in civilian life?

285
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,729
Jouko, come and swim
if it was too hot!

286
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:51,590
Hey, we've swapped pants.
-These did feel a little different.

287
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:56,051
Do you want them?
-Let's swap in the sauna.

288
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,513
What the hell, this is icy cold.

289
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,099
Just get in there!

290
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,452
Do you think
you're younger then me?

291
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:42,389
Jouko, why are you there when
everyone else is in order of age?

292
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:48,141
Saara, you can't decide
how old somebody else feels.

293
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:53,443
It's not like I'm as old as you,
but I am in a spiritual sense.

294
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:59,447
I can't help it that men are more
fertile than women later in life.

295
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:04,532
If you feel you're on the Eastern
side of the hill, it can't be helped.

296
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,702


297
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,871
Whose phone is on?

298
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:12,630
Just because you can procreate,
it doesn't mean you're 20!

299
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,423
Look next to you!
They could be your kids.

300
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,763
My children are still small.

301
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:22,598
I'm in better physical condition
than I was at twenty.

302
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,637
Young women still find me
to have great performance.

303
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,652
I have more time ahead of me
than behind me. So I'm standing here.

304
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,275
What are you talking about?
Men have a lower life expectancy.

305
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:42,034
A realistic place for you
would be over there!

306
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,788
You have a gut, even though
you exercise in the bushes.

307
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:50,040
And you eat butter and sausages
just like old men do.

308
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:57,047
You'll fall into your grave, even if
you're with a five-year-old woman!

309
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,766
Look what the menopause can cause.

310
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,430
You have the menopause in your pants.
I'm sorry.

311
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,524
Saara, this cat is suffering.

312
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,067
I smell the urine
of a stressed out animal.

313
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,448
She always smells like that.

314
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:25,115
Against my will, I can read animals.
That cat is depressed.

315
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,458
What breed is it'!
-Norwegian Forest cat.

316
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:33,747
Of course. She hates being inside,
imprisoned.

317
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:37,754
She's an indoors cat.
She lives in a flat.

318
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,629
But here, she can smell
the forest and the sea.

319
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:45,553
There are forests
and the sea in Norway.

320
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:49,974
Do you normally clean that
in the morning? -In the evening.

321
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:56,696
This day is turned on its head.
You don't seem to grasp that.

322
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,856
Neither does this cat!

323
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:04,157
Am I supposed to push these turds
back into her?

324
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:10,617
Think. Who was your outburst for?
Who are you angry at?

325
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:14,045
That's an important key for you.

326
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:25,927
Hey. Are you going to bed already?
Would you come to the rocks with me?

327
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:31,097
The rocks that are
in the sun all day?

328
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:34,939
I guess.
-I'll come, I'll come!

329
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:38,562
I just need to throw Pussy's...
I'm coming.

330
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,344
I thought you might want
to watch the news, too.

331
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,554
The internet works fine here.

332
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:25,867
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

333
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:30,450
No. I've just had a tiring day.

334
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:34,410
It's my own fault.
I've not drunk enough.

335
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:39,841
It's easy to forget when you can't
get it straight from the tap.

336
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,925
I always have water in this.
Have some.

337
00:34:57,014 --> 00:35:01,403
Do you feel better?
-It helped straight away. Thank you.

338
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:09,073
What do you have...

339
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,450
Something was taken for a test.

340
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:33,219
Globally, the world
is shockingly unequal.

341
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,513
Today, we get a glimpse
into how the other half lives.

342
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,482
This makes sense.

343
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:42,142
One of you is a rich Westerner.

344
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:46,188
Two of you are quite poor,
the other five are really poor...

345
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,359
Would you swap?

346
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:55,541
I read a magazine article
about poverty.

347
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:59,375
It was a good depiction of what
happens in a person's head -

348
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:05,715
when they must turn down everything
and live a crushing routine.

349
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,294
They become exhausted and lose hope.

350
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:13,134
A person without hope is dangerous
because they have nothing to lose.

351
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:16,063
What is your wage, for example?

352
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:20,476
In general or for this week?
-For just this week.

353
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:25,231
It's none of your business, but 700.

354
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:32,203
700! -It's not too much. I work long
days and the hours are not recorded.

355
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:36,997
Shockingly little. After taxes,
you're left with barely anything.

356
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,707
Don't worry about that. This backdoor
boy pays under the table.

357
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:46,376
You have to pay tax. Taxation
is the best thing that Finland has.

358
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:50,633
We have to report this.
How could we do that without her...

359
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:56,346
I don't know. I'm going fishing
to get ingredients for the fish soup.

360
00:36:56,758 --> 00:37:02,607
Here are the kitchen keys.
Help yourself to the water.

361
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,901
Has Alli been put
on the hunger squad?

362
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,577
We drew lots, like in real life.

363
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:19,409
Don't you talk about things
you know nothing about, sour fish.

364
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:25,337
You weren't born a garlic princess.
You've been raised like that.

365
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:33,506
Oh, like that.
-Try it.

366
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,107
This party platform is not going
to work when we're so hungry.

367
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:52,031
My blood sugar is so low, all my
energy is going into basic functions.

368
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:57,279
That sounds like you don't believe
the poor are capable of democracy.

369
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,282
I didn't say that.

370
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:06,503
I want honest answers. Put your
hand up if you have missed Kalle.

371
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,050
Who is Kalle?
-Right.

372
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:16,387
We're doing what he said.
He made himself unnecessary.

373
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,009


374
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:26,982
What the hell!
Who has got their phone on?

375
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,187


376
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:47,330
Marika Lammi is calling.
Nobody knows who she is?

377
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:51,379
There's no need to call this number!

378
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:57,552
I'm switching this off if nobody
owns up that it belongs to them!

379
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:06,184
The revolution has begun! I
commandeered the means of production!

380
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:10,235
If you want to join me, follow me!

381
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:20,245
<i>When a person is a person</i>
<i>They need some bread</i>

382
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:26,993
<i>Idle talk doesn't repel hunger</i>
<i>or make empty full</i>

383
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:30,416
<i>So left, one, two</i>
<i>So left, one, two</i>

384
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:33,842
<i>Where is your place, do you know?</i>

385
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:40,179
<i>Proletarians are marching here</i>
<i>You are a proletarian, too</i>

386
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,561
What do you know about proletarians?

387
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:48,225
My dad did hard work for a low wage,
and provided for me by himself.

388
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,606
Sol probably know more than you!

389
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:57,856
What's with him?
-Revolution.

390
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,531
What's next'! I represent
high finance. Should I be concerned?

391
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:05,743
You should.
Your day in the sun is over.

392
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:14,753
You bloody fool.
Was that the key to the kitchen?

393
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:17,674
Did you have the key to the kitchen?
-Yes.

394
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:23,719
Do you morons realise
that was the only key'! Get it!

395
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:28,720
I'm not a strong swimmer.
-You only need to be able to dive.

396
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:32,565
I'm not good at that, either.
-Anyone can get to the bottom.

397
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,987
Where did it go?
-Over there, somewhere.

398
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,166
It's dark under the surface.
Far-sighted people can't see.

399
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,709
Don't come and whip up the water!

400
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:14,771
The landlord is sending another key.
We have to wait until the morning.

401
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,986
Let's break the window.
That's one way to get in.

402
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,823
You'll smash the place up
over my dead body.

403
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,825
We can all survive until the morning.

404
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,488
This was in our room.

405
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:31,289
Is this all the water we have?

406
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:35,875
I'm really disappointed.
You came to a communal camp -

407
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:40,545
and you are being anarchic.
-I came to a different camp.

408
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:45,217
Is Jouko's champagne in your room?
-We could go and get it.

409
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:49,058
It's mine.
And it wasn't exactly cheap.

410
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:52,937
In a crisis, you might consider
your Bible teachings.

411
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:56,276
Everyone was fed
with five loaves and two fish.

412
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,193
Of course I will give it
for communal use.

413
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,358
My body rejects alcohol.

414
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:07,370
That's good.
It leaves more for the others.

415
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:09,912
But the water is for Alli.

416
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:13,121
If someone saves some,
the others don't get any!

417
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:44,321
I wish it was at least organic.

418
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:54,244
Even though wine also contains
alcohol, and my body resists it...

419
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:02,677
...the production process of wine
is age-old and really natural.

420
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:06,925
Luckily, even a delicate person
can somehow manage to drink it.

421
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,802
Can I use this as kindling?
-Go ahead.

422
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:48,014
How did these people end up here?
The weirdest bunch ever.

423
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,925
There is a video advert online.

424
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:56,226
As to why somebody came here,
only that person knows that.

425
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:59,766
Why did you?

426
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:03,729
My mum died in the spring.

427
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:09,108
I cared for her for ten years,
in addition to my own work.

428
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:13,367
I'm not complaining,
but that was the life I had.

429
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:18,661
Then when she died,
I didn't really have anything.

430
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:24,299
Do you have children?
-No.

431
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:29,591
Do you have a man?
-That hasn't worked out for me.

432
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,758
Do you have?
-Nobody has wanted me.

433
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:41,105
Probably too ugly.
-You're not ugly. Not at all.

434
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:51,359
Do you have children?
-No. I don't really have anything.

435
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,415
There's no slowing you down.

436
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:09,251
Do you want some?

437
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,596
Play something that we can dance to.

438
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:41,414
That's good, keep going.
Listen to my body and go with it.

439
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,749
Play on!

440
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:54,136
I need to take a piss.

441
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:04,893
Teach me, too. I don't know how to
tango. -Sorry, the band's on a break.

442
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:07,809
Come and play some more.

443
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:12,899
It looks really bad when an old goat
is all over a young lassie like that.

444
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:16,781
Don't bother taking
your frustration out on me.

445
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,407
Charisma has nothing to do
with how tight your trousers are.

446
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:27,130
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
You followed me into the bushes.

447
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:30,338
For the exact same reason as you.

448
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,763
Can I please pee in peace?
-No.

449
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:43,809
I want to check out
the competition's equipment.

450
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,975
Get the hell out of here.

451
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,568
Come on, don't be shy now.

452
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,944
Get the fuck out of here!

453
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,654
The fuck! Stop that, bloody hell.

454
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:59,073
How ridiculous!
Seventh grade boys fight like that.

455
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:01,870
He has a need to show off.

456
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:07,790
Besides, she is married.
A Laestadian mother-of-four.

457
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,002
I knew that.
We've talked about everything.

458
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:15,222
She's not into either of you.
She has a good relationship.

459
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:16,966
How do you know'!

460
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:20,178
What makes you think
she'd be interested in you?

461
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:22,974
You have nothing in common.
-Is that so?

462
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:27,808
She is smart, friendly,
empathic, and damned attractive.

463
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,022
You definitely
don't have that in common!

464
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:36,321
You are boring, ugly, and old.
And not particularly wise!

465
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:38,284
Prick.

466
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:51,080
<i>It opens your mouth</i>
<i>to the highest thank you</i>

467
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,092
Stick up for yourself.

468
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,752
Taking wouldn't help at all.

469
00:47:56,835 --> 00:48:00,596
I have a history.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

470
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,980
Are you terribly thirsty?
-I'll survive.

471
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:12,602
Let's go to the rocks.
I can teach you something.

472
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:39,337
Hi, it's me.

473
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:43,382
There's no reason
to send suspicious text messages.

474
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:47,641
The raging leader of this camp
answered my phone.

475
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:53,773
Good night, darling.
Write something nicer next time. Bye.

476
00:48:55,561 --> 00:49:00,733
Hi, darling. I'm wondering why
I've not heard anything from you.

477
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:05,822
I should be offended that you stood
me up and didn't tell me why.

478
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:12,041
But I'll see you when I'm back.
Bye then.

479
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:25,096
Hi, it's me calling.

480
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:29,683
We're having a break, so I thought
I'd ask how you are doing.

481
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:33,107
I miss the sauna and my own bed.

482
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:38,397
And you. Say hello to the kids.

483
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:47,329
<i>This is the day when the sky is clear</i>
<i>Full moon, late at night</i>

484
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:51,580
<i>The moonlight shines on some kisses</i>

485
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,872
<i>Hey, sweetheart,</i>
<i>I got hot like a supernova</i>

486
00:49:56,955 --> 00:50:00,918
<i>I'll bring you stars</i>
<i>if you'll come to the dock with me</i>

487
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:07,643
<i>Teach younger ones</i>
<i>to talk about their feelings</i>

488
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:10,848
<i>So they'll make it when they notice</i>

489
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:13,893
<i>How many candlelit nights there are</i>

490
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:20,396
<i>You can keep the soul you took</i>
<i>Tonight it's magic and wishes</i>

491
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:27,782
<i>Tonight, tonight, tonight</i>
<i>It'll happen when the gate opens</i>

492
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,792
<i>Tonight it'll happen</i>

493
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:44,385
You can get the overtones
by making your mouth an echo chamber.

494
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,632


495
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,808
Did you hear?

496
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,519


497
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,823
This is so unreal.

498
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:10,241
I've never stayed up this late,
apart from when breastfeeding.

499
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:15,326
You are amazing.
Four kids and still your tit...

500
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,336
...thinking is so open.

501
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:26,256
I'm grateful for the chance
to get to know someone like you.

502
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:30,512
People have the opportunity
to get to know all kinds of people.

503
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,678
They don't.

504
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:38,276
A meat ring of pushy broads has
formed between me and the world.

505
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:43,275
I'm unable to reach
the place where real people are.

506
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:48,487
Is not every person a real person
and just as valuable?

507
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,113
At least in God's eyes.

508
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:55,750
Yes, naturally. You are so clever.

509
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:01,048
Will you be my soul sister?

510
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:09,550
I don't smoke.

511
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,806
You don't drink, either.
Today is different.

512
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:17,562
Isn't it God's will,
if he doesn't give us water?

513
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,058
Even Jesus drank wine.

514
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,360
Try it. Then at least you know
what you are turning down.

515
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:35,667
I want to turn that down.

516
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:44,840
Let's try that overtones thing again.
I want to hear your overtones.

517
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:49,004


518
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:05,980
Do you forgive me?

519
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:11,112
I guess that is less harmful
than drinking or smoking.

520
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:14,121
So can I try it again?

521
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:35,351
I've only ever kissed
my husband like that.

522
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:38,556
I've never kissed anyone like that!

523
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,984
It's never felt that good.

524
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:48,314
You poor thing. I was just thinking
it's good that I tried this.

525
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:51,951
Because it feels the best
to kiss my husband.

526
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:55,156
I want you.
-What a shame.

527
00:53:56,612 --> 00:54:00,373
Can't we put this experience
on the same tab?

528
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:05,040
That tab is not open.
I love my husband.

529
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,257
You mean you're turning me down?
-Yes.

530
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:14,849
Don't you realise how offended
it makes you feel to be rejected?

531
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:21,271
You knew there was that risk.
-I didn't. Nobody's ever rejected me.

532
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,894
I'm going to bed. Good night.

533
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:29,522
I'll pray that you will also find
joy and peace.

534
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,283
This could leave me
with a lifelong trauma.

535
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:39,741
If I can no longer get it up, it's
your fault! -I'll pray about that.

536
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:11,274
Would you like some good sex?

537
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:20,785
Can we go on the hot rocks?
-No. It's bloody cold there.

538
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,171
Have you got any rubbers?

539
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,755
Wait, I'll take this off.

540
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:44,804
Could you put it on?
-Yeah.

541
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,023


542
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:49,898
Ignore it. He talks in his sleep.

543
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,146


544
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:01,614
Quiet down!

545
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,960
Can't we have a single night
where he doesn't start that racket?

546
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:13,169


547
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,593
Mercy! Not the Saarenmaa waltz.

548
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,606
What are you fiddling about for?

549
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:32,272
I'm shagging.
-Go somewhere else to shag.

550
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:09,596
What's up?
-I forgot Pussy.

551
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:13,936
Now she's out there, alone.

552
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:25,575
Have you seen Pussy?
-No.

553
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,496
Pussy!

554
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:38,799
Another example
of the power of prayer. -What?

555
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:43,719
You aren't impotent,
even though I shot you down.

556
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:46,557
Apparently.

557
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:50,936
Why did you have to do that?

558
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:54,359
I was pissed off. I'm sorry.

559
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:59,111
I don't understand why someone
has to shag all the time.

560
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:02,735
You no longer even realise
the purpose of shagging.

561
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:06,363
Can I pray for you?
-You can.

562
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:14,171
<i>Where's Maya: Hwy gone'!?</i>

563
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:19,464
Sorry, did I interrupt you?
-No. It was a very short prayer.

564
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:24,550
Dear Lord,
make Ville slightly less stupid.

565
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,765
She hasn't slept in her bed.

566
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,400
It's wonderful to watch someone
do physical work. -Yes, to watch.

567
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:48,372
Could you mow carefully, so Pussy
doesn't end up being scythed?

568
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,199
Has anybody seen Emma?

569
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:59,415
You've been busy. You had Saara
under you a few hours ago.

570
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,252
Shut your face!

571
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:07,099
You released her, didn't you?
-Why would I release your pussy?

572
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,676
You wanted to get back at me.

573
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:14,764
Besides, she's my ex's mum's,
and I'll never be forgiven for this.

574
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:20,066
Don't worry. Cats always come back.
it's Emma who is missing.

575
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:23,073
Should we look for her?

576
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:28,366
Or do we just accept
that we disappear, one by one?

577
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,349
Okay then.

578
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,309
Thank you.

579
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:15,115
What fun do we have in store today -

580
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:19,042
at this camp that is free
of intoxicants and sex?

581
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:24,378
Have I shagged someone?
-No.

582
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:31,341
I've let myself down,
and also you and mother earth -

583
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,353
and I've soiled my body's temple.

584
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:40,063
As a repentance exercise, I declare
that this is now a silent retreat.

585
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,981
What does that mean in practise?

586
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:52,948
Should I warm up the sauna?
Not everyone smells of roses.

587
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:57,952
This is my cleanest shirt. [thought
there'd be a washing machine.

588
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,419
<i>You haven't even bothered to text me.</i>

589
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:13,050
<i>If you want us to continue,</i>
<i>meet me at the harbour.</i>

590
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:17,094
<i>The time and place is in the email</i>
<i>about the camp. Goodbye.</i>

591
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,111
Do you have regrets?
-About what?

592
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:35,455
This. It's comforting to see
that even angels can fall.

593
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:40,252
What those photos show does not
hurt anybody. -I'm sure it doesn't.

594
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:45,002
When they are published, you might
think about who you go with.

595
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:50,300
This is worth more than the gossip
magazine's standard 50 euro fee.

596
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:01,974
I can't even get dry logs
to light on fire.

597
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,605
I wouldn't say that.

598
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:11,569
The air pressure is too low.
Can I have a go?

599
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,198
He secretly took photos
when you kissed me.

600
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:19,784
When we were kissing.

601
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:23,211
He'll sell them to a magazine.
My lie will be revealed.

602
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:25,871
What? Who?
-Jouko.

603
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:28,793
Oh Christ.

604
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:34,389
Jouko, give me your phone.
It's an emergency.

605
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:37,346
For who?
-Kaisa-Leena.

606
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,063
What the...
-Don't come here!

607
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,112
Wait!

608
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,834
What the hell?

609
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,423
What are you doing?

610
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,384
You've ruined my life!

611
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:23,389
You won't destroy Kaisa-Leena's.
You let Pussy out! -I didn't!

612
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:28,690
<i>I released the cat. She's a forest</i>
<i>cat. She should be free!</i>

613
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:34,523
You fucking idiot!

614
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:38,990
What right did you have to do that?

615
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,662
Do you understand
anything about anything?

616
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:51,045
This affects my, my ex's,
and my ex's mum's life!

617
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,845
Do you ever think about anything
other than yourself?

618
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:00,683
You're an attention-seeking grump.

619
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:05,268
I know that everybody here
agrees with me.

620
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:10,857
You are the most detestable person
I've ever met! Bloody hell.

621
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:39,463
This makes no sense.
What are we doing here?

622
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:43,722
Why are we here?
Why are we not leaving?

623
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,348
Mervi, order me a boat.
I want to get out of here.

624
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:50,692
You can want all you want,
but you can't.

625
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:56,021
The weather forecast tells that
no boat will be able to dock here.

626
01:04:56,563 --> 01:05:00,526
It looks like your spiritual growth
course has not finished.

627
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:04,951
One of you cannot speak
and another is having a tantrum.

628
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,372
The only thing you can do
is try to grow!

629
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:17,255


630
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,387


631
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,156
What is it?

632
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,702
I'm scared. I'm scared of lightning.

633
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:52,835
Let's move the bed
away from the window.

634
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:04,095
Oh, it's attached.
Come here for the worst of it.

635
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:11,477
Everything's fine,
there's no need to be scared.

636
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,508
Hey, excuse me.

637
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:45,590
The power is out. I thought you
should know, if the food... -Yeah.

638
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:50,683
Try to calm down.
It's a perfectly normal storm.

639
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:57,106
We need to find Emma.
-Yes. I'll go to save the food.

640
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:07,284
A big branch has fallen and brought
the guttering down with it.

641
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:12,583
Doesn't seem to be a problem
with the power lines.

642
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,579
Come now!

643
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,963
Emma.

644
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:48,319
Lightning! Take me!
-She's in the sea, near the sauna!

645
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:54,290
You can't go in the water
during a storm!

646
01:07:54,366 --> 01:08:00,001
God of Thunder, come and get me!
I'm stupid and detestable!

647
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,299
I'm sorry!

648
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:09,932
Help! Saara fell into the water!

649
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:16,394
I'm coming to rescue you!

650
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:21,023
I'm going to drown.
I'll rescue you soon.

651
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:24,565
Petri! Get up!

652
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:28,567
I rescued you!

653
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,120
Is that Mervi?

654
01:08:31,195 --> 01:08:34,541
There is a boat. We are saved.

655
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:38,793
Where are you going?

656
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:41,834
There were calls for help.

657
01:08:42,206 --> 01:08:45,717
You could just as easily walk
to the shore from here.

658
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,473
Mervi.

659
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:08,023
How come you were there?
I thought you were in the kitchen.

660
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:12,448
I was fetching the generator,
but we'll make do without then.

661
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:15,660
Why do you have your bag with you?

662
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:20,496
Take her to the common cabin,
and let's get the fire started.

663
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,922
Go and change into dry clothes.

664
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:29,796
I don't have any. They are all wet.

665
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:33,054
Surely someone will lend
some clothes?

666
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:36,097
I don't think our trousers would fit.

667
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:42,275
You have dry underwear, at least?

668
01:09:57,823 --> 01:10:00,207
Why are you angry at me?

669
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:03,375
I can't help myself.

670
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,378
Anything goes in an emergency.

671
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:18,512
I'm so tired that I'm going to
collapse. I have to go to bed.

672
01:10:19,845 --> 01:10:22,562
Good night.
-Good night.

673
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:27,729
I see and know so many things,
and I just want to help -

674
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:30,112
but everybody hates me.

675
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:34,780
Can you really help people? Everyone
needs to make their own mistakes.

676
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,161
It's easy for you to say.

677
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:42,872
You are flawless and beautiful.
You don't pass out at the campfire.

678
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:48,041
I have nothing.
You are all doing better than me.

679
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:52,253
We are not.
-I'm the flawed one here.

680
01:10:52,336 --> 01:10:57,769
I'm filled with guilt.
I'm here and I have lied.

681
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:02,847
You have a husband, family, and
unrestrained relatives. You're happy.

682
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,516
What do you know about my happiness?

683
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:11,650
Ville, you got to kiss her.
Women find you interesting.

684
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:17,615
Answer honestly.
Do any of you find me interesting?

685
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:24,245
I knew it.

686
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:31,673
Are you not interested in me,
even this much?

687
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:37,134
I am, as a person.
-As a person.

688
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:42,020
Why doesn't anybody respond
to me as a man?

689
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:45,440
People don't respond to me
even as a person.

690
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:49,061
Nobody remembered my name
when we played Boss Pig.

691
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:53,319
I'm a grey back wall.
-No, you're not.

692
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:57,450
I rescued you.
You are a mother figure to me.

693
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:02,117
I really want to be the mother figure
for a man in his thirties.

694
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:05,626
I'm all alone. I don't have anything.

695
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:10,921
You don't have anything?
You're a millionaire.

696
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:16,130
You only need to snap your fingers,
and you get whatever you want.

697
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:23,264
You're kidding me.
You're Peter Manner!

698
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:50,172
I'm a leftist though.
Money means nothing to me.

699
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:56,011
That's why I wanted to hide it,
so I could speak politics for a week.

700
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:58,172
I'm on the side of the poor.

701
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:02,216
A leftist millionaire who can't swim.

702
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:06,095
Being rich is shit.

703
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:11,268
I don't have time to spend
any of my money.

704
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:16,107
Being rich is like being dead.
I can't dream of anything.

705
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:21,408
I can't even dream
about becoming rich one day.

706
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:26,077
I know what you mean.
I feel the same about eternal life.

707
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:32,883
If you go to heaven after you die,
then what next?

708
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:37,344
It just continues and continues,
forever.

709
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:40,636
You can't ever leave.

710
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:43,216
That's the terrible thing
about faith.

711
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:49,978
There is no end.
The happiness just continues.

712
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:55,438
My happiness doesn't continue.

713
01:13:56,728 --> 01:14:01,485
My husband left me
and my kids have left home.

714
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:05,781
I don't have a clue
what I am without them!

715
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:10,871
It's not like anybody here
looks particularly happy.

716
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:37,612
Guess what this reminds me of.
-What then?

717
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:43,365
The Devil took Jesus up a mountain,
and showed all he could have.

718
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:49,537
But you stay strong, like Jesus.
-I really don't.

719
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:55,750
Looking from this mountain,
what would you want?

720
01:14:55,829 --> 01:15:01,132
You, you, you.

721
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:06,050
Don't. It would be easier
to become your soul sister -

722
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,717
if you cut out that desire.

723
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:14,268
My self-esteem is completely trashed.

724
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:20,274
Would it help if I blew you?

725
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:24,324
Sorry. I couldn't help it.

726
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:26,529
You're so predictable.

727
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,873
That's cruel.
-I'm sorry.

728
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:36,965
Tell me, why do you
constantly think about sex?

729
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:42,637
I don't know. Maybe it's the most fun
thing I've ever done.

730
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,089
You poor thing.

731
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:50,388
You've not experienced much.

732
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:05,612
Some melted ice cream,
as a thank you to the yard clearers.

733
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:11,780
Do you want me to still lead
this camp day?

734
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:14,877
You're at least better
than that guru bloke.

735
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:28,847
It's not going to charge when
there's no electricity -I'm sorry.

736
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:34,512
Can I leave it here,
in case I get a call? -Yes, you can!

737
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:40,519
I thought I might take a look
at the power switchboard -

738
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:44,990
because it doesn't look like
any lines are down on the island.

739
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:49,985
I don't want there to be
any more accidents here.

740
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:53,201
I'm a certified electrician.

741
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:58,625
I have my paperwork in my wallet,
but it's a bit damp.

742
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:06,545
If you manage to fix the power -

743
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:11,846
you can choose any treat
for the evening party. I'll make it.

744
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:18,893


745
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:38,624
You're quite a guy.

746
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,284
The power came on! We have power.

747
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:22,253
Thank you. You are remarkable.

748
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:25,045
What did you want then?

749
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:27,341
Can I have this?

750
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,346
The dress?
-Yes.

751
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,506


752
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:40,940
Can I have it?
-Yes, yes.

753
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:44,975
Alli! It's your phone.

754
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:07,420
Yeah. In a week
or on the coming Monday?

755
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:13,181
To the same counter
as when I came for the biopsy?

756
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:22,808
It's not your fault.
Thank you. Goodbye.

757
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,612
What?

758
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:35,826
What was it?

759
01:19:37,361 --> 01:19:41,418
Cancer. The aggressive kind.

760
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:44,956
I'll go into hospital on Monday.

761
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:49,668
No...

762
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:56,715
What do you mean, "no"?

763
01:19:56,797 --> 01:20:01,388
If you don't want me when I'm
healthy, don't grope a dying woman.

764
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:05,348
Alli, I...
-Go to hell.

765
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:08,434


766
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:16,762
The table has been set.

767
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,639
Not yet.

768
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:40,551
Don't die.
Promise me that you won't die.

769
01:23:00,105 --> 01:23:04,945
Thank you for yelling at me.
Your aura is much brighter.

770
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:11,083
And sorry about the cat.
-I'd already forgotten about that.

771
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:13,828
What am I going to say
to my ex's mum?

772
01:23:13,911 --> 01:23:17,873
My dad used to say, when you're
in a tight spot, try the truth.

773
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:22,346
Do you plan on trying the truth?
-I will try.

774
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:24,507
It's not a problem for you.

775
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:29,345
I admire your courage to face things
and show your emotions.

776
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:34,979
Thank you. It was nice.

777
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:44,989
You're a really good listener. I wish
I'd have had a mother like you.

778
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:52,372
You're pretty attractive for your
age, and scary when you get mad.

779
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,794
This was a compliment, by the way.

780
01:23:56,703 --> 01:24:02,754
You are practically everything.
Versatile, fun, optimistic, and open.

781
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:09,015
You're a chill person.
Easy to be with.

782
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:14,181
<i>Iron rusts in time</i>

783
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:18,772
<i>And wreaths also wither</i>

784
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:22,946
<i>On the journey</i>

785
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:26,860
<i>The scenery changes</i>

786
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,321
<i>Ice and snow on the sea melted</i>

787
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:35,367
<i>It's getting lighter</i>

788
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:40,127
<i>On the shore of the sea</i>

789
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:44,465
<i>The field wind feels warm</i>

790
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:50,553
<i>Look, there is wind in the willows</i>

791
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:55,144
<i>It doesn't end here</i>

792
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:58,853
This should cover it.
-Yes, thanks.

793
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:04,736
Emma, wait over there.
I'll go and get my car.

794
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:23,294
When do you need to be back home?
-In the morning. I'll take the train.

795
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:28,048
We have a gig at Verkatehdas.
We can take you to Hämeenlinna.

796
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:32,304
You can take the same train
from there. -Should I?

797
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:37,139
It's God's will or we wouldn't have
a gig that's on the way to Oulu.

798
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:49,951
You can put your things
on the back seat.

799
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:54,782
Why are you wearing a dress?
-There was a huge storm.

800
01:26:01,078 --> 01:26:03,581
Did you lose your pussy?
-Yeah.

801
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:06,167
There's a picture
of a cat on that post.

802
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,382
Jouko, come out. You've been spotted.

803
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:23,445
There's been some new info. Give
me the key. This marriage is over.

804
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:26,234
Someone's got the wrong end
of the stick.

805
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:30,404
“There's talk of divorce.'
Bollocks. How many of us are there?

806
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:35,916
The key! -And here.
That was two years of my life!

807
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:40,792
I've been with him for 23 years.
Take that.

808
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:53,638
Was this the key for the garage
or yours? -Don't fucking ask me.

809
01:27:16,445 --> 01:27:21,795
Saara. My lift was cancelled.
Or lifts.

810
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:26,131
I saw. Look.

811
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:29,424
“Your new life starts here"?

812
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:33,383
Could it be Kalle's message?

813
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:39,309
Could you give me a lift somewhere?

814
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:43,019
Where were you thinking of going?

815
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:46,693
How about I come to yours?

816
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:49,484
No way!

817
01:27:51,647 --> 01:27:54,993
Where am I going to go then?
-How should I know?

818
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:57,914
Are your parents alive?

819
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:02,912
Mum is. In Mikkeli.

820
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:43,000
Don't open it.
- <i>What the hell?</i>

821
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:44,959
I don't want to see you.

822
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:50,668
Your mum's cat ran away,
but was found. Here are the details.

823
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:54,839
Don't touch the door.
I'll leave the carrier here.

824
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:57,220
<i>What are you up to?</i>

825
01:28:58,297 --> 01:29:04,976
Tell your mum about the divorce and
take responsibility for your life!

826
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:43,299
