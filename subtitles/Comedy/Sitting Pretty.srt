457
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,271
That, if I may say so, is a matter
of complete indifference to me.

I take it you are not retaining
my services to sit with him.

Now, may I see my room?

Never mind now.

Oh, uh, these are my sons,

well, anyway, they seem to
be quite fascinated by you.

00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:51,859
The fascination, I assure
you, is not mutual.

Oh.

up as nicely as we could.

I hope you like it.

479
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,918
After the obvious
eliminations have been made,

480
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,355
I believe it will be
entirely satisfactory.

481
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:33,500
For my work I require an
atmosphere of spartan simplicity.

And may I ask
what your profession is?

483

Certainly.
I am a genius.

484
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,714
Satisfactory?

485
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:50,150
Eminently,
as far as I can judge.

At the moment.

With this exception.

Before I retire for the night, may I
inquire what time you serve breakfast?

505
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:54,882
Um... uh...

506
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:57,885

Thank you.

Perhaps I should tell you
I'm a vegetarian.

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,590
I like fruit juice, coffee...

And thinly sliced
gluten bread, toasted.

Do you want to get
another toothache?

Harry, will you please put down
that paper and talk to me?

521
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:40,961
Well, what's the... what are we
going to do about Mr. Belvedere?

522
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:41,929
Very simple.

523
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:45,866
As soon as he deigns to join us for
breakfast, I'm going to kick him out...

524
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:46,934
Right on his ear.

525
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:51,104
I guess you're right. But you'll
have to tell him. He scares me.

526
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:53,841
I think he's kinda cute.
Me too.

Well, I don't!

out my end of our agreement.

I see no reason why you
should default on yours.

But it's obviously impossible.

You couldn't do
the things we require.

do you mind telling me
what form it takes?

Mrs. King, as I told you last night,

I dislike children intensely,

habits and manners.

However, I assure you I can
cope with them successfully,

Now eat your breakfast, and
chew each mouthful 28 times.

Should we give the guy
a whirl for a day or two?

an object lesson,

and, as you will observe,
he doesn't like it.

I couldn't agree
with you more, Mr. King.

It's Thursday,

Did you tell my kids
I was a moron?

I most assuredly did not.

But, uh, Mr. King, if you wish it kept
a secret, you should not act like one.

Take my advice. Bury your idiotic
pride and telephone your wife.

I'll ask for it.

I have half a mind to punch you right
in the nose, just on general principles.

It takes half a mind
to resort to such measures.

Couldn't get much closer
than that, could they?

his neighbors? [ Appleton gulps ]

1355
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:19,590
Who is it among us who knows our little
peccadilloes with girls in florist shops?

1356
01:21:19,592 --> 01:21:22,026
The girl was merely delivering
flowers to that motel.

1357
01:21:22,028 --> 01:21:24,862
But they were not orange
blossoms. And you, Mr. Mcpherson...

1358
01:21:24,864 --> 01:21:27,298
you caricatured me in this
book as a notorious lush.

1359
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,535
It was not I who counted the empties taken
away from your house by the garbageman.

1360
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:34,805
Just one little moment.
Are you insinuating that...

1361
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,473
I let the chips fall
where they may. But I...

1362
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:40,711
and, Mr. Hammond, who is it that makes
a habit of reading other people's mail,

1363
01:21:40,713 --> 01:21:42,746
other people's perfumed mail?

1364
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:48,185
Oh, this is outrageous. Are you suggesting
that I have been your... your collaborator?

1365
01:21:48,187 --> 01:21:49,620
don't be presumptuous.

1366
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:51,822
Let me put it in terms that
even you will understand.

1367
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:55,759
You have spread the pollen.
I have reaped the harvest.

1368
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:57,127
But I...
this is fantastic.

1369
01:21:57,129 --> 01:22:00,097
I have been more grossly maligned
in the book than... than anyone.

1370
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:03,634
It is only poetic justice that
a stool pigeon should be roasted.

1371
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:07,605
So, you're the one. Now, now,
Horatio, let's not be hasty.

1372
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:11,108
Why, you little weasel.
No, no, Horatio! No! No! No!

1373
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:13,844
[ All yelling ]
Mother!

1374
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:17,581
Mother! Mother! Mother!

1375
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:22,119
I'd give my right arm to get a look
at Appleton with that black eye.

1376
01:22:22,121 --> 01:22:26,523
I bet it nearly killed him when
they trampled down his Iris bed.

1377
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,592
Yeah.

1378
01:22:28,594 --> 01:22:31,428
How would you like to go
celebrating tomorrow night?

1379
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:33,964
Love to. Would you
care to take me dancing?

1380
01:22:33,966 --> 01:22:37,568
Yes. But remember, I don't
dance as well as Mr. Belvedere.

1381
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:40,504
No, dear,
but you're much prettier.

1382
01:22:40,905 --> 01:22:42,439
Wait a minute.
We can't.

1383
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:45,743
Who'll sit with the kids?
[ Mr. Belvedere ] I will.

1384
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:48,145
The mere fact that I have
been catapulted into fame...

1385
01:22:48,147 --> 01:22:52,383
Does not blind me to the
duties I undertook here.

1386
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:55,519
Mr. Belvedere,
you're an amazing man.

1387
01:22:55,521 --> 01:22:58,122
Just what are your plans
for the future?

1388
01:22:58,124 --> 01:22:59,456
My dear Mrs. King,

1389
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:01,892
hummingbird hill is only the
first volume of a trilogy.

1390
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:06,697
I estimate the other two volumes
will take me about two years.

1391
01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:10,534
Uh, and you're going to
write them here?

1392
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:11,435
Naturally.

1393
01:23:11,437 --> 01:23:17,007
Posterity will demand that the entire
masterpiece be written under the same roof.

1394
01:23:17,009 --> 01:23:18,942
This house will become a shrine.

1395
01:23:18,944 --> 01:23:21,745
I'm surprised
you even want to stay.

1396
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:26,819
It can't be very convenient. You
claim you don't even like children.

1397
01:23:28,821 --> 01:23:31,388
That is correct.

1398
01:23:31,956 --> 01:23:35,092
[ Tacey ] Mr. Belvedere? Yes?

1399
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:39,430
I think it only fair to
tell you that before long,

1400
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:42,700
we are expecting another child.

1401
01:23:42,702 --> 01:23:45,402
And you'll find me
of great service, Mrs. King.

1402
01:23:45,404 --> 01:23:47,771
I was also an obstetrician.
