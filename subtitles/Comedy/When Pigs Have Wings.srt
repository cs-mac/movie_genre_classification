1
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:18,465
What do you have for me?

2
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,836
Orders from battalion, sir.

3
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:26,740
You confirmed this?

4
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:28,608
Yes, sir, verified it twice.

5
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:31,110
Thank you.

6
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:36,950
Problem?

7
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:45,425
Hope that means good news.

8
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:46,893
Not really.

9
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,562
Orders to push.

10
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:49,763
Make a push?

11
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,230
They know where we are, right?

12
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:53,767
They should.

13
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,970
Jack, this is wrong.

14
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:59,939
Yeah, I know.

15
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:03,076
Damn orders, right?

16
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:06,245
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,748
Let's get it done, Sergeant.

18
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:11,545
Sir, it's a great spot to be ambushed.

19
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:15,482
How much further?

20
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:16,483
Right here.

21
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,652
25 kilometers ahead.

22
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:21,387
- Griff, take point.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,726
We gotta get out of here.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

25
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,201
Dying won't save them.

26
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:09,869
We gotta take out those MG's.

27
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:13,907
We've got to find the flank.

28
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:16,042
You got it.

29
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,344
Stay low, stay low.

30
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,729
Six Jerrys, what do you think?

31
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,396
One, two maybe.

32
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,232
They'd be on us before we got the rest.

33
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,901
Guess their only hope is
to wait for a battle change.

34
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:42,902
I gotta get close.

35
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:44,337
Jack...

36
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:49,308
Keep your head down, Sergeant.

37
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,109
It's about time.

38
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,111
You know what they say...

39
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,814
You don't get tired of
saving my ass, Sergeant?

40
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,950
Never.

41
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,352
Damn you!

42
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:37,823
What'd you do?

43
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,192
What'd you do, huh?

44
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:41,294
I'm sorry, Jack.

45
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,532
You're not going anywhere,
you're not going anywhere,

46
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:45,364
You hang in there,
you hang in there, OK?

47
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,804
Come on, soldier!

48
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,809
You better get rolling, Jack.

49
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,211
Come on, hang in there!

50
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:04,483
I'm sick of this fucking war.

51
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,989
You were a good man, Sergeant.

52
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:59,538
I'm sorry to hear about your men.

53
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,407
Brass gave you the wrong orders,

54
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:06,112
and now you're taking
the hit for their fuck up.

55
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:10,049
You know what your problem was?

56
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,385
Not a god damn thing.

57
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:15,955
You followed orders.

58
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:17,556
I'm Colonel A.J. Redding.

59
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,625
Lieutenant Jack Wosick, sir.

60
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:29,402
Listen soldier, sorry about this
but you're gonna have to...

61
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:32,739
You're gonna have to slap these on.

62
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,810
I've actually heard about
you before, Lieutenant.

64
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:39,779
How so, sir?

65
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:41,748
Everybody knows your name.

66
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:44,984
D-Day you attacked and
held a vital German position

67
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:50,924
at a crossroads for, what, six hours?

68
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,459
Earned yourself a bronze star.

69
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:56,429
That night, sir, we were
dropped all over the place,

70
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:57,801
gathered the troopers I could find,

71
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,767
just did what was necessary,
nothing more, sir.

72
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,937
A lot of men couldn't
have done that.

73
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,639
Soldier, you know how to lead men.

74
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:11,444
You know how to lead men
when the shit hits the fan.

75
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,613
I'm putting together
a group of handpicked men

76
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,019
for a very special mission.

77
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:25,792
And I need you to lead them.

78
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:29,128
Respectfully, I think you
have the wrong man, sir.

79
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:32,298
No soldier, I got the right man.

80
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:36,302
And I ain't got nobody else.

81
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,471
Lieutenant Wosick,
this is Captain Picault

82
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:41,640
of the French Foreign Legion.

83
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:45,644
The Colonel has
told me all about you.

84
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:49,315
I look forward to fighting together.

85
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:55,054
Can I ask why me, sir?

86
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:57,791
Why not you, soldier?

87
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,562
I need you, I need
you back in the fight.

88
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,900
And not everybody deserves
a second chance.

89
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:16,409
What's on your mind, soldier?

90
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:24,250
If I do this, will I be
cleared of all the charges?

91
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:30,523
You got my word,
you bet your ass you will.

92
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,692
Then I guess that's a yes, sir.

93
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,495
I thought that
might be your answer.

94
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,369
Here are the folders on our men.

95
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:51,377
The um... War Pigs.

96
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:58,751
War Pigs... What's that about?

97
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:02,788
Bless America.

98
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:10,063
Go, go, go!

99
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,998
This was a really terrible idea.

100
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:19,072
We gotta go, kid!

101
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,076
I'm too young to die.

102
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:32,852
Stupid American!

103
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,762
Oh, what the hell is this?

104
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:46,165
It's good is what it is, eat it!

105
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:52,438
It looks like bird shit on a shingle.

106
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,140
Who put you in charge
of breakfast anyways?

107
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:55,841
You're welcome.

108
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,012
You should have seen the kid earlier.

109
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,447
He had one hand full of eggs,
the other one full of balls.

110
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:04,350
I wasn't scared.

111
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,452
Come on, you shit your trousers, kid.

112
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,991
A few small prayers, son,
you're good to go.

113
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:09,788
Speaking of prayers,
preacher, you know,

114
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:11,824
I could use a little
heavenly help over here

115
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,562
with this hand, maybe
you could put in a word with

116
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,963
the big guy for me upstairs
regarding this hand?

117
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,866
You know what, I don't think
the Lord works that way.

118
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:28,807
Well, oh, he surely does
work in mysterious ways.

119
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:31,010
Stop distracting us from
your lousy hand, Sarg.

120
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:34,981
Alright, I got a...
whole lot of nothing.

121
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,215
I'm out.

122
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:38,051
Nobody's got any luck?
Come on!

123
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,519
Are you praying against us?

124
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:43,322
No, just against you... I'm out.

125
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:44,190
I'll raise.

126
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:46,993
Now we're talking!

127
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,195
I'll see you, kid,
and I'll raise you two.

128
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:53,499
Oh, now we've got a game.

129
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,001
A lot of you guys seen combat?

130
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:56,069
Oh, ho, ho!

131
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,071
Kid wants to see some action.

132
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:02,175
Moffatte over here,
he captured a whole kraut patrol...

133
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,342
Where was that?

134
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:04,210
Sicily.

135
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:05,344
Italy.

136
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,382
I'm still waiting for the medal.

137
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:07,383
It's coming in the mail, right?

138
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:08,814
Yes, the mail.

139
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:12,218
Preacher here, don't let
this clean cut routine fool you.

140
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:15,854
No, he is one stone-cold
natural born killer, this one...

141
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,923
and Frenchy,
he got shot twice already,

142
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:20,026
He got shot in the leg,
and he got shot in...

143
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:21,860
Ahhh!

144
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:24,363
OK, OK, thank you, thank you.

145
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,865
We've stormed two beaches together,
seen three countries.

146
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,367
Been together since basic.

147
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,369
Lucky bastard, you.

148
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:32,071
What about you?

149
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,373
Oh, me?

150
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,875
Me, I just want to see the end
of this war and get on home.

151
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:39,412
Don't be too eager to see combat, kid.

152
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:40,646
We've got it pretty good here.

153
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:44,117
We got booze, we got cards,
we got grub...

154
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,385
we even got some dirty magazines
somewhere around here.

155
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:48,287
Hey, I'm still using those.

156
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:52,891
You go ahead and hang
on to those, Preach.

157
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,958
All I'm saying is there's
kids younger than you dying

158
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:59,898
in foxholes, dreaming
of half of what we got.

159
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:01,437
You think they're gonna send us
up to the front soon?

160
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:02,901
You can bet on it.

161
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,571
Scuttle is that we have a new
officer arriving presently.

162
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:07,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
where'd you hear that?

163
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,076
Same sorry sap in supply.

164
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:13,412
I'll tell you, in a war, there's
really only two things that are

165
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,748
gonna ruin your day and you
know what those are boys...

166
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:17,816
officers and orders.

167
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,652
Correct.

168
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:27,426
This might ruin your day, too.

169
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:28,827
Look at that.

170
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:31,634
You know what I'm betting,
we get some slob,

171
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:34,167
Gets us all killed.

172
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,401
You think?

173
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:38,271
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
you're scaring him.

174
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:42,007
I'm not scared... I'm not scared!

175
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:42,975
It's OK, it's OK.

176
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,678
Hey, we've got officers coming.

177
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:53,619
You're not German, right, you're French?

178
00:13:53,686 --> 00:14:00,626
Yes, my home was occupied
by the Nazis in '39.

179
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,528
I was conscripted into the German Army.

180
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:06,632
So how'd you end up here?

181
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,468
I grew up in this region.

182
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:14,973
I'm very good at getting men
in and out of enemy territory.

183
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,875
Is that right?

184
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:21,147
So what, the German army,
they just let you go?

185
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:24,817
I never believed in Hitler's Germany.

186
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:27,520
Let's just leave it at that, OK?

187
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,488
You got it.

188
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:32,158
Private...

189
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:38,664
Looking for August,
Sergeant, third squad.

190
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,066
What, you lost your tongue, son?

191
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,535
No, sir.

192
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:43,606
You're talking about the War Pigs?

193
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,070
That's right, yeah.

194
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:48,541
Respectfully, I don't envy you
if you're the new commander.

195
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:49,742
Why is that, private?

196
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,845
It's just that um,
officers don't really

197
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:56,014
last that long with them, sir.

198
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,184
Is that right?

199
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:00,753
That's right, sir.

200
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,421
You can find them just down that way.

201
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:04,357
Just pass the mess hall, sir.

202
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:05,524
OK, good.

203
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:07,260
Thank you, private.

204
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:13,699
So everyone calls them the War Pigs.

205
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,701
Must be a good story.

206
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,036
I guess we're gonna find out, right?

207
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:18,804
Here we go.

208
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:23,876
Attention! Attention!

209
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,878
Able Company Third Squad, I assume?

210
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:27,112
Yep.

211
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,582
I'm Lieutenant Wosick,
this is Captain Picault

212
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,217
from the French Foreign Legion.

213
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,552
And I heard you go by
the name War Pigs?

214
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,020
Why is that?

215
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:39,225
Well, we have a reputation for
rolling around in the mud.

216
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,395
Well, good for you, Sergeant.

217
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:45,063
Now you're the lucky volunteers
for a new mission.

218
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,401
And why would we want to do that?

219
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:52,405
I assume you mean, why would
we want to do that, sir?

220
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:54,973
In the U.S. Army, we address
officers as "sir," Sergeant.

221
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,910
Or is that going to be
a problem for you?

222
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,079
No, sir.

223
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:04,583
We just want to know our
uh, orders, guidelines.

224
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,854
It's a long way to
the Rhine and it's my job

225
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,753
to make sure these boys
get home safe.

226
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,088
That's really sweet of you, Sergeant.

227
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:13,426
Your orders are simple,
you just follow mine.

228
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:16,329
We clear?

229
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:17,763
Crystal.

230
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,599
Tomorrow we prepare for
that mission, soldiers.

231
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,436
So you can get us all killed?

232
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:29,975
Lieutenant, Lieutenant...

233
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,110
I guess tomorrow you
formally join the U.S. Army

234
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:36,615
for the first time, Sergeant.

235
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:38,784
Soldiers, 0500 hours
tomorrow, be ready.

236
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:39,855
That includes you, Sergeant.

237
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:42,355
You're dismissed.

238
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,176
I say cheers to you, War Pigs.

239
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:56,986
Cheers!

240
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,291
- Can you believe this?
- Believe what?

241
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,723
- Our new officers.
- I think he likes you, Sergeant.

242
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:08,557
What? Augie?

243
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,159
God, nobody likes Augie.

244
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,335
Well, I tell you I really do hate...

245
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:18,333
- Officers and orders.
- Yeah, you get that right.

246
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,569
I don't know, lieutenant seems OK to me.

247
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:22,976
Well, the word is...

248
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:28,313
that Lieutenant Wosick,
formerly Captain Wosick of the 502's,

249
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:32,821
make a push straight into a MG-42,
get the whole bunch of Joes killed.

250
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,983
That's just hearsay say some.

251
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,225
Yeah, he's gonna get us all killed too.

252
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:40,388
He's taking his order
direct from Colonel Redding.

253
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,431
Great. Cowboy Redding.

254
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:43,892
Who's Redding?

255
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:48,403
He thinks he's Wyatt Earp,
more General Custer.

256
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:50,234
The guy's nuts.

257
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:53,578
Alright, to be fair, to be fair.

258
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:56,437
The man has survive
stepping on a landmine...

259
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,115
- right, has been shot twelve times.
- That's not me changing.

260
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:04,049
And he's been rewarded
three Silver Stars.

261
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,948
So he's doing something right.

262
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,024
I tell you what?

263
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,891
You stick with us, kid,
form my lead...

264
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,365
you will be alright.

265
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,969
Now, what was it, mud killer?

266
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,203
That's alright.

267
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:37,201
These men are rough.

268
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:39,070
They are rough.

269
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:43,040
Definitely an edge.

270
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:47,411
What do you think of them?

271
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,082
I think these are the men
we have to work with.

272
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,718
Do you think they'll be
able to follow orders?

273
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:58,222
Yes, sir, but I think you will
have to earn their respect

274
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,224
and gain their trust,
like everyone else

275
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:06,363
who wants to make it
through this war alive.

276
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:17,308
Yeah.

277
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:25,382
A lot of men died following me...
following my orders.

278
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:31,222
It's not an easy thing
to send a man into battle.

279
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:37,294
Armies are run from
orders, Lieutenant.

280
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:40,732
I'm just not sure
I'm ready for it this time.

281
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,938
Yes, you are, you just need
to leave the past behind

282
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:50,241
and focus on the task at hand.

283
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:52,810
Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

284
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:01,118
I read your after action report.

285
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,087
It was pretty interesting.

286
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:06,257
Said you got your orders mixed up.

287
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:12,096
You attacked the wrong
position at the wrong time.

288
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:18,770
No... Orders were fubar.

289
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,271
I knew it.

290
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:23,240
Followed them anyway.

291
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,114
So someone on top wanted you
to take the fall for their, uh,

292
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:34,018
their, uh, screw-up?

293
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,220
Something like that.

294
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:42,694
Well look, uh, men died
because of your orders,

295
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,766
But more men lived
because of your orders.

296
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:59,310
This, uh, Colonel Redding...

297
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,378
How well do you know him?

298
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:04,281
The mission, what do
you know about it?

299
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,691
Ever hear of Hitler's
wonder weapons?

300
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:17,561
I think the Colonel will
send us across enemy lines

301
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:19,731
for one of those.

302
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:33,745
We're counting on you to lead...
be there for them.

303
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,561
Ladies, what is this?

304
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:51,528
Get up!

305
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,138
You got two minutes!
Grab your gear!

306
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:07,645
Yeah... yeah.

307
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:26,063
Would have been nice to see you
first assembled, Sergeant.

308
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,966
I expect my NCO to lead by example.

309
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,736
Yeah, just like you do, Captain?

310
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:34,405
Sorry, "Lieutenant."

311
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,073
You did your homework.

312
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,574
Good, shows initiative.

313
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:39,744
The captain and I
will make sure you are

314
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:42,914
the best damn squad
in the whole army.

315
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,984
Gentlemen, to forge
proper squad camaraderie,

316
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,586
you will need many tools.

317
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:52,656
Your first tool... endurance.

318
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,591
You know, were not taking
orders from no frog.

319
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:56,297
You listen to me, you're going
to accept orders from me,

320
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:58,032
from him, and any god damn
orders we throw at you,

321
00:22:58,062 --> 00:22:59,596
is that clear, Sergeant?

322
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,635
Orders like you gave your unit
before you got them all killed?

323
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:04,001
OK, good, let's start as
need to continue, shall we?

324
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:08,339
Courtesy of Sergeant August...
three miles double time.

325
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:17,014
Captain?

326
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,791
I've got a surprise for you
at the end of the line.

327
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:29,126
Soldiers, left face.

328
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:30,661
March.

329
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,474
Beautiful morning, ladies.

330
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,676
Pick it up, pick it up!

331
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:55,486
Come on, Motty, come on.

332
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:00,424
It's like basic, only worse.

333
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,995
Kill me now.

334
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:05,162
Sergeant, move it.

335
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:08,332
Pick it up.

336
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,701
Excellent.

337
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,036
The end of the line.

338
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:16,841
And now for the surprise... voila!

339
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:18,575
What's that for?

340
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:26,717
Like an old lady, York.

341
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:30,021
Moffatte, you should be carrying
two of those things.

342
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,023
Nice one, Frenchy.

343
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:34,191
Move it, come on.

344
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:38,395
Sergeant, come on,
it's not play time.

345
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:41,698
Communication, gentlemen,

346
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:45,036
Is the soldier's
number one resource.

347
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:50,707
Modern technology allows for
mobile or direct contact.

348
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:56,213
In war, if you're
not communicating,

349
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,714
You're already dead.

350
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:04,221
You think dying is funny, kid?

351
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:09,126
Anyone here have radio training?

352
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:11,728
I do, sir.

353
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:17,801
You wind it up, talk to someone
on the other end, piece of cake.

354
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:19,736
Easy, huh?

355
00:25:19,803 --> 00:25:22,073
Talking is another
very valuable skill

356
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,440
we're gonna learn from you.

357
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,776
No, no, no, this is real good.

358
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:29,413
I'm sure you're very qualified
to teach our English lesson...

359
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,983
"Monsieur."

360
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:40,824
We may not have the luxury
of communicating so easily.

361
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:44,428
Understanding enemy movement
we may encounter in the field

362
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:49,967
is crucial to staying alive.

363
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,505
Today we are going to learn
how to communicate about that

364
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:54,505
using these... hand them out.

365
00:25:58,675 --> 00:25:59,746
I guess we can skip the basics,

366
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:02,613
I'm hoping you can all
read and write.

367
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:26,137
Everyone must have
basic drawing skills.

368
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:29,306
The ability to describe
and record what you observe

369
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:32,143
is vital behind enemy lines.

370
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:35,980
Everybody... draw what you see.

371
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,548
You've got two minutes.

372
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:44,655
OK, come on.

373
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,491
You're wasting your time.

374
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,563
Listen, I like fruit as much
as the next guy, Captain,

375
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:54,231
But what the hell
am I drawing it for?

376
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:55,666
Is that right, August?

377
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:59,170
You know, we thought
you might feel that way.

378
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,138
Plan B.

379
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,260
Gentlemen, please say hello
to Mademoiselle Collette.

380
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,698
Enchanté.

381
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:53,224
Hi, my name is August,
I'll be drawing you.

382
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,558
Doing great.

383
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:57,894
Two minutes?

384
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:00,397
Two minutes.

385
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:03,900
Take as long as you need, guys.

386
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:26,823
Land mines, gentlemen,
are not your friends.

387
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,761
The German land mines
come in many forms.

388
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:35,799
The worst ones are
the ones made from wood.

389
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:37,568
They really make them out of wood?

390
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:40,271
Oh, shit.

391
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:43,674
Captain, I think I got one.

392
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:48,679
It's a bottle, you idiot.

393
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,120
I don't get this.

394
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:57,803
What don't you understand
about land mines?

395
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,957
I just don't get what
we're doing this all for?

396
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:04,128
Sergeant, do you want to
keep your arms and legs?

397
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,363
Well, just my third leg.

398
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:09,900
Captain.

399
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:20,211
Right... the next exercise
everyone will enjoy.

400
00:29:27,218 --> 00:29:30,154
Good job, York.

401
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:34,057
Be strong, Sergeant.

402
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,026
Good, Shank, better.

403
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:37,864
I don't know, Lieutenant,
I was enjoying learning

404
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:39,796
about those land mines.

405
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:43,867
The German K-98.

406
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:47,171
Now we all know you know
how to shoot it...

407
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:51,242
now I want you to understand it
inside and out.

408
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:53,244
Go!

409
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:58,249
York, good job.

410
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:04,688
Again, faster!

411
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,990
Concentrate.

412
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:14,265
Go.

413
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,972
Again, faster.

414
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,782
You got anymore
brain busters for us?

415
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:37,688
Now let's see how well you do.

416
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:43,059
Yeah, it'll be a piece of cake.

417
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,461
OK.

418
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:52,068
So why don't we try it
blindfolded, courtesy of August?

419
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:53,970
Let's go.

420
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:10,621
So the training,
how do you think it's going?

421
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,490
They catch on quick.

422
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,592
Think they'll manage?

423
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,994
Yes, I believe so.

424
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:22,165
God, I hope you're right.

425
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:31,007
Why do you keep those?

426
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:34,177
They belonged to a
sergeant I served with.

427
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:43,354
Guess they remind me
what happens when I fail.

428
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,522
What happens?

429
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:55,299
He was killed... following me.

430
00:31:55,366 --> 00:32:02,839
He was a good leader...
and a great friend.

431
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:06,543
I don't think you keep those tags

432
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,044
to remind you of your failures.

433
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:13,284
I think you keep them because you
can't get away from your past.

434
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:18,054
The squad, the men...

435
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:20,824
they will do the job
when the time comes.

436
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:24,561
Trust them.

437
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:32,836
I do... I just don't want
to get them killed.

438
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:34,671
Then don't.

439
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:37,841
Lead, they will follow.

440
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,444
I know it.

441
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:47,162
Someone remind me,
why we're out here again?

442
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,402
We are out here because
Augie can't keep his big mouth shut.

443
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:58,275
Yes, that sound about right.

444
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:02,947
I'm been thinking about the lieutenant.

445
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:06,452
- Yeah, kid, what's that?
- I like him.

446
00:33:07,692 --> 00:33:08,989
He's a good man.

447
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,758
I hate to say, but kid's right.

448
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,621
He's not so bad.

449
00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:19,663
Do you guys think
so we make back home?

450
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,005
I wish I can answer that
for you, soldier.

451
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,148
Hot coffee. Better than
cold crap, right?

452
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,111
- For you.
- Thank you.

453
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:44,989
Are you alright, sir?

454
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,393
Yeah. Because you can't be
following order, right?

455
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:52,969
That's why you attacked
those Germans, sir?

456
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:55,632
What would you've done differently?

457
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:58,333
What I would have done differently?

458
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:01,736
Probably disobey orders, soldier.

459
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:10,554
Cold out.

460
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,887
Reminds me of my home.

461
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:17,851
I love that city.

462
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:19,681
Amen, sir.

463
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,698
You have a great night, guys.

464
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,272
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

465
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,519
Today's lesson... rope climbing.

466
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:43,687
Soldiers, this is gonna be fun.

467
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:45,723
Let's go!

468
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,458
You heard the Captain... move!

469
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,536
Alright, kid, you're up!

470
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:54,458
The art of the knife.

471
00:35:54,525 --> 00:36:01,432
It's a deadly art that
none of you know anything about,

472
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:02,966
but with some practice, can master.

473
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:05,403
We don't need lessons from a frog.

474
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,477
Are you ready?

475
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,513
Get the knife.

476
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,616
OK, sweetheart, go get it.

477
00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:22,786
Come on, Preacher!

478
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:28,792
Bet you wish you'd kept your
mouth shut, right, Preacher?

479
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:31,529
Come on!

480
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:34,197
There you go!

481
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,204
Let's go.

482
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:48,546
Proceed, proceed.

483
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:54,652
He's really good.

484
00:36:54,718 --> 00:36:57,254
Your whole body is a weapon.

485
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,225
Preach.

486
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:16,507
There's more to knife fighting,
than fighting with knives.

487
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:19,510
A legionnaire is shown how
to use all his tools

488
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:22,880
as a potential weapon...
Knife, club...

489
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:24,682
Chin up, Preach.

490
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:28,185
Hands, feet, anything
that can kill a man.

491
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:31,188
Foreign Legion have a unique
way of using the knife,

492
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:34,357
as you can see, Captain Picault
here is going to show you a few.

493
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:38,696
Sergeant, you're
with the Lieutenant.

494
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,430
With pleasure.

495
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:41,532
You ready?

496
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,868
Yep.

497
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,870
Been waiting for this.

498
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:49,607
I got, Preach,
he wasn't very good.

499
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:54,011
That leaves you and me, kid.

500
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,420
I don't like you.

501
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:04,688
I know.

502
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,565
You are gonna get us all killed.

503
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:15,298
Is that right?

504
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:16,800
Yeah, that's right.

505
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:39,990
I'm not gonna stop.

506
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:43,827
I don't want you to stop,
I want you to fight.

507
00:38:43,894 --> 00:38:44,928
You hear me?

508
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:46,463
I need you to be a soldier.

509
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,701
It's the only way you're
gonna stay alive,

510
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:48,999
you understand me, huh?

511
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:50,668
Yes, sir.

512
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:01,178
Aug.

513
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:07,851
Hey, good job.

514
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:13,123
These legit, sir?

515
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,524
Yes, they are.

516
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:15,626
I had them made.

517
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:17,961
Great, patches of death.

518
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:21,632
They're not patches of death,
Preach, it's our new insignia.

519
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,500
Listen up.

520
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,803
Division finally sent
through our orders...

521
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,470
Any idea what those are, sir?

522
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:30,173
All I can say is we're
going behind enemy lines.

523
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,145
You think we're ready, sir?

524
00:39:35,212 --> 00:39:37,547
I know you're ready.

525
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:41,184
Are you ready?

526
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,320
Sergeant, if something
should happen to me

527
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:46,489
or any of us while we are over
there, some of these men might

528
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:50,327
look to you for leadership...
don't let them down.

529
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:51,829
Get some rest, all.

530
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:53,563
Bright and early tomorrow morning.

531
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:02,005
No matter what fubar plan
he and Redding got cooked up,

532
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:05,242
Remember boys, I got
your six, copy me?

533
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:11,548
Remember, officers and
orders, right, huh?

534
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:14,752
Let's go.

535
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:31,534
So, we see the
Colonel tomorrow

536
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,603
Yeah.

537
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,245
Coffee?

538
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:47,217
Never liked coffee,
strong and black.

539
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:50,721
It can never beat a nice Armagnac.

540
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:53,356
Yeah, yeah, I heard
something about that.

541
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,108
Better?

542
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:16,413
Mmm...

543
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:22,753
I haven't been this close
to home for five years.

544
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,624
Ten miles, down the main road,
make a right at the sawmill,

545
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:31,428
keep the little stream
on your left...

546
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:34,664
beyond the hedges, there's home.

547
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:41,271
You miss it?

548
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:46,443
You gonna go back?

549
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,678
After all this?

550
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:08,799
The Germans conscripted
me against my will.

551
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:16,974
My mother, she begged me not to go,
but what choice did I have?

552
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,546
A few months passed by
and my family went missing,

553
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:26,984
Gestapo were the last
people seen at the house.

554
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,986
What happened?

555
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:33,656
They were found in a shallow
grave outside of town.

556
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:35,826
I'm sorry.

557
00:42:35,893 --> 00:42:42,332
So, I ran from the German army,
joined the legion,

558
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:47,037
Killed as many of those
Nazi bastards as I could.

559
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:54,077
So, you think they're ready?

560
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:58,348
The men, yes.

561
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:01,418
I think so.

562
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:05,522
Well, we could always take them
on another little run

563
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:07,858
through the forest.

564
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:09,726
That's a good idea.

565
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:12,863
We might end up with
a mutiny on our hands.

566
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,665
I think you're right.

567
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:25,275
Keep it, please, keep it.

568
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:27,444
Merci.

569
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,380
Merci, Captain.

570
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:31,481
Hello..

571
00:43:47,297 --> 00:43:51,301
Gentlemen, any of you heard
of a German millipede gun?

572
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:52,769
No, sir.

573
00:43:52,836 --> 00:43:56,473
I believe it's one of Hitler's
crazy new wonder weapons.

574
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:59,409
Basically, it's a 300 foot
barrel with 34 pairs

575
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:02,745
of booster tubes
sticking out the sides.

576
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:05,315
It makes it look like
it has stubby legs,

577
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:09,319
that's why we call it
the millipede.

578
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:11,621
What does it do, sir?

579
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:14,424
Well, it's a high
pressurized canon,

580
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:15,963
it can shoot a five foot
artillery round

581
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:17,494
hundreds of miles.

582
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,930
Division thinks they had one
fired on our boys

583
00:44:19,997 --> 00:44:21,764
in Monte Casino.

584
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:23,470
How can they be sure, there's
been a lot of artillery

585
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,835
dropped on Casino, sir?

586
00:44:25,903 --> 00:44:30,607
Yeah, well, they found a
round that didn't detonate.

587
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:33,476
Now, this gun was tucked away
on the outskirts of Rome,

588
00:44:33,543 --> 00:44:36,679
hundreds of miles away.

589
00:44:36,746 --> 00:44:41,351
A weapon this size
can take a steep hill.

590
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:43,453
Alsace is full of them.

591
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,622
Hill 314 suites that purpose.

592
00:44:45,688 --> 00:44:49,459
Now, these pictures were captured
by intelligence in Italy.

593
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:51,461
We believe it to be
components of the gun

594
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:53,663
before its construction.

595
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,299
A weapon that size
can cause a lot of problems,

596
00:44:56,366 --> 00:44:57,700
kill a lot of people, sir.

597
00:44:57,767 --> 00:44:59,970
Yeah, I want you boys
to find out if they're

598
00:45:00,037 --> 00:45:01,804
building this fucking gun.

599
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:04,874
Yes, sir.

600
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:09,112
Intelligence believes it's
being constructed right here.

601
00:45:12,615 --> 00:45:16,319
Well, that's deep into
enemy territory, sir.

602
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:22,825
I trust that won't be a problem.

603
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:24,995
We can manage.

604
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:30,833
Listen, I know it won't be
easy to get in, or get out.

605
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,170
Never is, sir.

606
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:38,341
Just get us the information and
get your asses out of there.

607
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:40,243
Yes, sir.

608
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:49,389
Looks like Hitler is
going to build himself

609
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:51,721
a new super weapon.

610
00:45:51,788 --> 00:45:54,091
Division wants us to
go in and find it.

611
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:56,726
What does it do, sir?

612
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:58,895
It's called a
millipede gun, soldier,

613
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:03,533
pressurized canon that can
fire artillery over 100 miles.

614
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,704
Division believes
they've located one.

615
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,439
Where is it exactly?

616
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:11,541
A place called Alsace-Lorraine.

617
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:15,078
Sir, that's quite a ways
behind enemy lines.

618
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:15,945
Yes, it is.

619
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:19,549
17.6 kilometers to be exact.

620
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:22,219
And we're going in on a hunch?

621
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:25,055
That is a possibility, yes,

622
00:46:25,122 --> 00:46:27,790
but we follow orders,
don't we, Sergeant?

623
00:46:27,857 --> 00:46:32,229
We're gonna get in, go find it,
we're gonna go home.

624
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,963
Go home, yes, sir.

625
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:36,433
Good.

626
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:38,568
Are we gonna disguise
ourselves as Germans?

627
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:40,903
That's too dangerous.

628
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,342
You get captured wearing
a German uniform,

629
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:44,774
they shoot you on sight.

630
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:49,746
Listen, I'm not gonna lie to you...

631
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:54,984
it's not gonna be easy...
but I know you can do it.

632
00:46:58,155 --> 00:47:01,824
You men are ready...

633
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:07,930
There's just one more thing
I need you to do.

634
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:11,768
Oh, shit.

635
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:13,936
Decide who gets to drive.

636
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:26,449
It's funny... my wife always
wanted to see Germany.

637
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:30,287
Hey, Moffatte,
you'll see her again.

638
00:47:30,353 --> 00:47:32,355
I promise you that.

639
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:45,635
You think this cannon is real?

640
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:47,870
Sounds like something
Hitler would dream up.

641
00:47:47,937 --> 00:47:49,839
We wouldn't be out here
if it wasn't important.

642
00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:51,308
The Sarg, you think he's right?

643
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:52,542
About what?

644
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:54,311
About the Lieutenant
getting us all killed.

645
00:47:54,377 --> 00:47:56,313
Wosick is tough, but he's fair.

646
00:47:56,379 --> 00:47:57,649
I think he knows what he's doing.

647
00:47:57,714 --> 00:47:58,981
Shank's right.

648
00:47:59,048 --> 00:48:02,652
Augie's got a big mouth,
I trust the Lieutenant.

649
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,721
I guess we'll find out.

650
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:16,333
It's about that time!

651
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:18,901
Keep your eyes peeled, soldiers.

652
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:30,713
We're in plain sight here.

653
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,515
Look for cover, soldier.

654
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:34,083
Copy.

655
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:45,209
Do you think they spotted us?

656
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:46,563
Probably.

657
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:49,699
The real question is,
are they gonna shoot at us?

658
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:51,033
Those are our planes.

659
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,402
Yeah.

660
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:55,071
Problem is, we are on
the wrong side of the line.

661
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:58,107
I don't want to become
target practice.

662
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:01,711
What a way to go... ambushed
by our own air corps.

663
00:49:01,778 --> 00:49:03,583
Change of plans, Captain,
we're going in on foot.

664
00:49:03,613 --> 00:49:05,282
Everybody get their weapons.

665
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,788
If these points are right,
we should...

666
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,454
Lieutenant, any idea where we are?

667
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:13,055
Yeah, sure, behind enemy lines

668
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:15,958
about to find a real
big gun, Sergeant.

669
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:17,960
Really?

670
00:49:21,964 --> 00:49:26,636
Gun should be just over the
ridge, west of here, Hill 314.

671
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:28,971
We need two volunteers
for scouting patrol.

672
00:49:29,038 --> 00:49:31,941
And who are the lucky/unlucky
bastards for that one?

673
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:34,411
Thank you, Sergeant,
you just volunteered.

674
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:38,415
These woods must be crawling
with German patrols.

675
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:41,083
I'd like to set up a defensive
perimeter around this road...

676
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:41,918
just in case.

677
00:49:41,984 --> 00:49:43,586
You got it, Captain.

678
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:44,691
Just don't engage
unless you need to.

679
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:47,089
Don't let all of Germany
know we're here.

680
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:48,258
Understood.

681
00:49:48,325 --> 00:49:50,260
I need one more volunteer
for this patrol.

682
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:52,262
I'll go.

683
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,331
You sure this is wise?

684
00:50:00,703 --> 00:50:02,171
You coming?

685
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:05,342
Yeah, kid.

686
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:07,109
I guess I am.

687
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,714
Any orders, sir?

688
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:46,586
We need to get somebody up
on the bend of that road.

689
00:50:46,616 --> 00:50:48,017
Yes, sir.

690
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:50,820
Preach...

691
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:52,425
Captain needs somebody
on the road, you good?

692
00:50:52,455 --> 00:50:53,990
Yeah.

693
00:50:54,056 --> 00:50:56,493
See the bend in the road?

694
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,829
Get up there, find a low
position, look for movement.

695
00:50:59,896 --> 00:51:01,401
If you see anything,
come back here right away.

696
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:02,899
Yeah, count on it.

697
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:06,336
Moffatte, bring any mines?

698
00:51:06,403 --> 00:51:08,771
Absolutely sir.

699
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:39,602
There she is.

700
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:43,272
How tall do you think it is?

701
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:50,279
Could be 600 feet, maybe more.

702
00:51:50,347 --> 00:51:52,114
Sure is ugly.

703
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:55,952
That thing could put a round
on Paris, maybe even London.

704
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:58,621
You know, it looks like
it could be operational.

705
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,224
Does division know?

706
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,226
That's why we're here, Sergeant.

707
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:06,863
What are we gonna do about it?

708
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:12,569
We're gonna get out of here.

709
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:13,970
Really, that's it?

710
00:52:14,036 --> 00:52:16,305
We're just gonna report it?

711
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:18,975
What if it starts firing on London?

712
00:52:22,044 --> 00:52:25,081
We've seen what we need
to see here, Sergeant.

713
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:27,016
So we're not gonna do anything?

714
00:52:30,487 --> 00:52:32,989
We're done here, let's go.

715
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:37,026
You get what you need?

716
00:52:51,173 --> 00:52:54,276
Hey, Moffatte, good work.

717
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:56,345
Wait until a Jerry gets
a load of these, huh?

718
00:52:56,913 --> 00:52:58,515
We're all dug in, sir.

719
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:59,782
Good.

720
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:02,284
Oh shit, this can't be good.

721
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:06,456
There's German armor
coming down the road.

722
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:08,024
Take cover.

723
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,462
Moffatte, the shovel!

724
00:53:43,225 --> 00:53:46,395
We've got to get
the fuck out of here...

725
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:53,670
Come on, kid, let's go.

726
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:54,704
Stay down.

727
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:56,072
You're gonna get us all killed.

728
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:57,544
I don't want to get you killed,
I want you to go home,

729
00:53:57,574 --> 00:53:59,842
You hear me, but shut up.

730
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,311
Grenade!

731
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:18,815
Sir, why are they stopping?

732
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:21,884
Maintenance check.

733
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:09,491
Captain, are you OK?

734
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:16,933
Get them!

735
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:46,355
Lieutenant?

736
00:59:46,422 --> 00:59:51,427
York, August... Germans have them.

737
00:59:51,493 --> 00:59:55,097
Let's get back to the squad.

738
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:08,010
Bit harder, harder.

739
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:11,948
Captain?

740
01:00:12,014 --> 01:00:14,550
Hey, hey, are you OK here?

741
01:00:14,616 --> 01:00:17,653
Yes, it's nothing, I will be fine.

742
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:21,557
Where's York and August?

743
01:00:21,623 --> 01:00:23,792
German Patrol got them both.

744
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,394
Still alive?

745
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:28,230
Think so, at least for now.

746
01:00:28,297 --> 01:00:30,066
Find the gun?

747
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:33,269
They run patrol not far
from here, set up a depot,

748
01:00:33,335 --> 01:00:35,471
millipede gun looks operational.

749
01:00:35,537 --> 01:00:37,874
Division's gonna want to
know about this, Captain.

750
01:00:41,477 --> 01:00:44,413
So, what do you want to do?

751
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,483
I can't leave my men behind, Captain.

752
01:00:49,485 --> 01:00:53,255
How are we gonna do that, sir?

753
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:57,026
We're going in and
getting them out.

754
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:05,267
OK... I'm in.

755
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,602
What about our orders?

756
01:01:06,668 --> 01:01:09,972
Looks like we just
changed them, soldier.

757
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:14,110
I'm in, sir.

758
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:16,512
Me too.

759
01:01:16,578 --> 01:01:18,814
We're all in, sir.

760
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:22,184
Thank you, soldiers.

761
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:24,586
How are we getting into that depot?

762
01:01:30,192 --> 01:01:34,363
Caught wearing a German uniform,
you're going to be executed.

763
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,833
That's right, Monsieur.

764
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,801
If you want to back out,
I understand.

765
01:01:39,868 --> 01:01:42,138
Now is the time to speak up.

766
01:01:42,204 --> 01:01:43,839
We're not backing out now, sir.

767
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:45,074
Good.

768
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:48,477
Do either of you know
how to drive a tank?

769
01:01:48,544 --> 01:01:50,146
I know how to drive a tractor, sir.

770
01:01:50,212 --> 01:01:52,214
That'll work, soldier.

771
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:05,827
OK... OK, it's just like a tractor.

772
01:02:05,894 --> 01:02:07,566
Sir, let me get this straight...
we're just gonna drive into

773
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:10,366
the German depot and
find August and York?

774
01:02:10,432 --> 01:02:14,336
I know it's not great,
but at least it's a plan.

775
01:02:14,403 --> 01:02:16,072
So what are our chances?

776
01:02:16,138 --> 01:02:18,040
50/50.

777
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:23,012
Either we succeed or we die.

778
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:26,515
Sir, what's the German
word for starter?

779
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:49,271
Can this get worse?

780
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:51,873
This is pretty bad, kid.

781
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,543
What do you think
they're gonna do?

782
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,612
I don't know...

783
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:08,924
You speak some German?

784
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:14,563
Yeah, you like that, Fritz?

785
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:19,068
My name is not Fritz.

786
01:03:19,135 --> 01:03:25,074
But what I want is to know
what you're doing here.

787
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:28,310
It was a routine patrol.

788
01:03:28,377 --> 01:03:31,780
I'd say you're a little bit lost.

789
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:35,917
Your patches... I like them.

790
01:03:35,984 --> 01:03:39,588
It would look good on my
bomber jacket, wouldn't you say?

791
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:43,925
Tell me, what does
the insignia mean?

792
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:49,265
It means we're the War Pigs.

793
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,435
Why?

794
01:03:53,502 --> 01:03:57,106
We like to roll around in the mud.

795
01:03:57,173 --> 01:04:00,176
Is that so?

796
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:02,611
Hey...

797
01:04:02,678 --> 01:04:03,845
where're you going, Fritz?

798
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:07,183
I'm not done talking
to you, come here.

799
01:04:07,249 --> 01:04:08,684
Hey, come here, hey, don't!

800
01:05:04,072 --> 01:05:05,341
Hey...

801
01:06:06,868 --> 01:06:10,071
So that's the, uh, super weapon.

802
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:15,411
Yeah, that's it, just as
the Colonel described it...

803
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:17,913
but bigger.

804
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:20,316
I think you're up, sir.

805
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:22,384
Yeah.

806
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:27,589
Remember your training, soldiers.

807
01:06:27,656 --> 01:06:29,157
Stay alert.

808
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:30,826
Yes, sir.

809
01:06:51,347 --> 01:06:52,948
Hang in there, kid!

810
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:55,351
You're doing great, you look fine!

811
01:06:58,554 --> 01:06:59,488
I'm OK.

812
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:02,190
He punches like a girl.

813
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:10,632
It seems you're quite
the little artist.

814
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:14,870
Tell me, why are you drawing this?

815
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:23,245
The real important stuff
is on the next page.

816
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:46,502
What is your objective here?

817
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:49,671
Why have they sent you?

818
01:07:49,738 --> 01:07:54,576
I'd love to help but...
my hands are tied.

819
01:08:05,253 --> 01:08:07,489
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

820
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,696
Who sent you to spy on us, huh?

821
01:08:14,763 --> 01:08:18,099
What did they send you to find?

822
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:34,950
Danke schoen.

823
01:08:48,697 --> 01:08:51,900
Grosser fehler.

824
01:08:51,967 --> 01:08:55,337
Believe me, the mistake is yours.

825
01:09:07,816 --> 01:09:16,224
Hey... hey, Fritzie, come over here.

826
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:29,270
Tough little army boy...

827
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:32,173
I'll be proud to wear your patch.

828
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:27,155
Heil Hitler.

829
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:52,480
What's going on?

830
01:11:52,548 --> 01:11:53,749
Shhh...

831
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:57,653
Just sit tight, yeah?

832
01:12:00,155 --> 01:12:02,090
Oh, you're a gentlemen.

833
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:05,426
Were's the Lieutenant?

834
01:12:05,493 --> 01:12:08,163
I don't know.

835
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:11,032
He's probably still looking
for August and York I guess.

836
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:20,942
Holy scheissen.

837
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:22,611
That doesn't sound good.

838
01:12:22,678 --> 01:12:26,682
Sir... no, sir, it is not.

839
01:12:38,694 --> 01:12:40,962
We're not dead?

840
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:43,098
Not yet.

841
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:14,723
Good thing we had
all that rope training.

842
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:17,325
Hang in there, kid.

843
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:22,964
Well, thanks for keeping
me alive this long.

844
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:24,425
Pretty handy in a knife fight, sir.

845
01:15:26,427 --> 01:15:32,968
I didn't think you'd come for us.

846
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,635
You're OK?

847
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:36,004
Yeah.

848
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:40,008
You look like shit.

849
01:15:40,075 --> 01:15:42,243
Sergeant.

850
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:45,746
You got a plan?

851
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:55,156
I do now.

852
01:15:55,223 --> 01:15:56,958
You want this?

853
01:15:57,959 --> 01:15:59,394
Let's get out of here.

854
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,253
What's going on up there, sir?

855
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,755
Not much.

856
01:16:27,823 --> 01:16:31,993
Just waiting for the lieutenant
to bring back our boys.

857
01:16:36,431 --> 01:16:39,034
Sir, are you OK?

858
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,535
Yes, I'm fine.

859
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:47,542
What are they saying?

860
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:54,249
They're saying... they're gonna
test fire the gun very soon.

861
01:16:54,315 --> 01:16:56,017
It's operational?

862
01:16:57,618 --> 01:16:59,720
Remember what I told you...

863
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:03,558
don't say a word and you might
just make it out of here alive.

864
01:17:32,187 --> 01:17:33,154
We've got a problem.

865
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:34,422
Moffatte, start her up.

866
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:36,925
Do not engage unless you have to.

867
01:18:00,348 --> 01:18:02,383
That's our cue.

868
01:18:12,027 --> 01:18:12,793
Now!

869
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,461
Now what?

870
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:15,030
Fire!

871
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,501
You can thank me later.

872
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:54,169
For what?

873
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:55,170
Germans.

874
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,356
Take that, you dirty kraut bastards!

875
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:28,836
In the half-track, everyone!

876
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:31,706
Move, go!

877
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,108
Preacher, we need to move now.

878
01:19:33,174 --> 01:19:34,609
You got it, sir!

879
01:19:37,178 --> 01:19:38,078
Move it!

880
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:39,580
Get in here, sir!

881
01:19:39,647 --> 01:19:43,084
Close it up,
that's an order, Sergeant!

882
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:54,395
Captain, take out that gun!

883
01:20:04,705 --> 01:20:10,245
Captain, stop the tank,
stop the tank!

884
01:20:10,311 --> 01:20:13,248
Take the shot, take the shot!

885
01:20:33,234 --> 01:20:35,170
Let's make it count.

886
01:20:41,176 --> 01:20:44,612
I say that's a successful
mission, Captain.

887
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:47,115
That was a beautiful
bang of a shot, sir!

888
01:20:47,182 --> 01:20:51,619
Get us out of here, Preacher,
get us out of here.

889
01:21:08,903 --> 01:21:12,140
Division is gonna be
mighty happy with these.

890
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:14,675
You and your men are quite
the talk around town.

891
01:21:14,742 --> 01:21:18,146
Thank you, sir.

892
01:21:18,213 --> 01:21:21,549
So, you wanna talk to me?

893
01:21:21,616 --> 01:21:24,819
Sir?

894
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:27,655
What the fuck went
wrong out there?

895
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:31,159
I don't understand, sir.

896
01:21:31,226 --> 01:21:33,661
Well, your orders, soldier,
were for a recon mission.

897
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:36,030
You weren't supposed to
destroy the fucking gun.

898
01:21:36,097 --> 01:21:38,333
Sir, the millipede gun was
operational, I made a judgment

899
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:43,871
call and I was not about to
leave my men behind, sir.

900
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:47,342
You just thought to ignore
your orders, your mission,

901
01:21:47,408 --> 01:21:48,509
disrespect me?

902
01:21:51,946 --> 01:21:54,915
I thought that might be
your answer, Captain.

903
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:02,056
You might need those to
go with your new rank.

904
01:22:02,123 --> 01:22:04,091
Thank you, sir.

905
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:07,528
It also seems that somehow
your court marshal papers

906
01:22:07,595 --> 01:22:09,864
mysteriously disappeared.

907
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,700
Is that right, sir?

908
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:16,771
You bet your ass, soldier.

909
01:22:16,837 --> 01:22:21,209
Division is very impressed
with you and your War Pigs.

910
01:22:21,276 --> 01:22:23,711
They deserve that, sir.

911
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:28,883
They want to keep you
on as their commander.

912
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:30,585
It would be an honor.

913
01:22:30,651 --> 01:22:32,853
Go celebrate, Captain.

914
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:41,396
Thank you, sir.

915
01:22:41,462 --> 01:22:45,065
Hey, soldier...

916
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:48,135
you were the right man
for the job.

917
01:22:54,209 --> 01:22:56,244
Now don't sew those on
too tight there, Corporal,

918
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:58,145
people are gonna think
you just got them.

919
01:22:58,213 --> 01:23:01,916
Alright, leave him be, Sarg,
the kid's earned his promotion.

920
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:04,151
Hey, I lost a tooth to
those kraut bastards.

921
01:23:04,219 --> 01:23:06,421
You know, I got captured too,
where's my promotion?

922
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:08,756
You think you might be
officer material, Sergeant?

923
01:23:08,823 --> 01:23:11,158
No, I ain't no "sir."

924
01:23:11,226 --> 01:23:14,128
We'll see.

925
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:15,930
It's a good day...

926
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:19,099
we didn't lose anyone.

927
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,935
And that's because
you're the best squad

928
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:22,770
in the whole damn army.

929
01:23:22,837 --> 01:23:26,006
I mean it.

930
01:23:26,073 --> 01:23:30,144
Even with the two things that
can really screw up your day...

931
01:23:30,211 --> 01:23:33,448
officers and orders.

932
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:40,621
Cheers.

933
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:42,056
Salute.

934
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:50,798
Captain, huh?

935
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:51,866
To the War Pigs.

936
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:54,635
War Pigs!
