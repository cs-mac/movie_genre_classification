1
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,495
- This is awesome.
- Oh, my God.

2
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,076
Oh, my God.
This is crazy.

3
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,548
Oh, my God!
So incredible.

4
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,040
Do you want to know a secret?
I took a Viagra.

5
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,124
What?
This is awesome!

6
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,720
Why aren't I
using this every day?

7
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,887
What'd you do?
Wait. Stop, stop, stop.

8
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,088
Stop.
What?

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,729
What's the matter?

10
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,053
"What's the matter?"

11
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,389
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,314
I thought it
would make it better.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,310
It was better. It takes
some of the pressure off.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,228
Because you can't get
hard without a Viagra?

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,063
Is it because you
don't think I'm sexy?

16
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,649
I thought you'd
think it was fun

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,317
for me to
super-size it for once.

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,951
That is the worst birthday present
you could ever give someone.

19
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,908
I was just trying to go
turbo for your birthday.

20
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,835
My hard-ons are still in analog.
This shit's digital.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,504
I don't want a turbo penis.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,174
I like your
medium-soft one.

23
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,878
Look, I can get it up.
Just not that far up.

24
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,386
Where did you get this?

25
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,672
I got it from Barry.

26
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,343
What?
You got it from Barry?

27
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,929
Why do you care? This is my
dick we're talking about.

28
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,978
Not yours.

29
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,351
We are young people-

30
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,934
We don't need
medication to have sex.

31
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,937
I only took it because it's your birthday.
I thought you'd like it.

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,862
Happy fucking 40th birthday.

33
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,819
I am not 40.

34
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,234
And I don't want
to have a husband

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,282
who has to take
Viagra to get a hard-on.

36
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,947
I don't have to take it every
time, but once in a while.

37
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,205
Fuck 40.
Forty can suck my dick.

38
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,191
Stop it. Dad, stop.

39
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,851
I love you.

40
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,436
Time to get up.

41
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,608
Your breath smells weird.

42
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,779
Wake up.

43
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,743
I really need you to wake up.

44
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,696
Wake up. Come on.

45
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,077
Time to wake up.
Okay.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,178
Whoo!

47
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,784
Ready!

48
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,629
Make a wish!

49
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,642
Hello, Sayid.

50
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,858
Can I watch Lost?

51
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,239
You can't handle Lost.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,863
It's too violent,
and you won't understand.

53
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,991
If I don't understand it,
why can't I handle it?

54
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,072
Because you're eight.

55
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,580
I can handle it. I've seen a
shark eat a guy on Shark Week.

56
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:03,830
Shark Week is fake.

57
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,415
No, it's not.

58
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,418
All of it is reenactments.

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,498
I know, but they...

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,925
And that's scary. You shouldn't
be allowed to watch that.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,005
They show the reenactments,
but they actually happened.

62
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,718
It's gonna give you nightmares.

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,018
I can handle a nightmare. You're
a nightmare every day for me.

64
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,430
Hey-

65
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,020
Don't eat that cupcake.

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,101
What?

67
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,731
The one you just
put into the sink.

68
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,487
I saw you were hiding that.

69
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,849
This cupcake? You think I'm
going to eat this cupcake?

70
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,574
Yeah. I so don't want this cupcake.
Look.

71
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:37,489
You're still going to eat it.
I'm going to eat that cupcake?

72
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,911
Just put it in the trash.

73
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,489
What would you like to do?
Your choice.

74
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,533
Anything?
Yeah, anything.

75
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,542
Just hang out with you guys.

76
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,046
Don't you want to get a
massage, or do something fun?

77
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,714
Forty's huge.

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,791
I'm turning 38.

79
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,753
Okay, 38. We will move on.

80
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,547
Isn't it weird that our
birthday is the same week,

81
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,553
and then we're going to have a
party, and it's just for me?

82
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,509
No, I don't think
it's weird at all.

83
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,804
Because you're turning
40 and I'm turning 38.

84
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,980
Come on, do you really want
to be one of those ladies

85
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,558
who's just so
insecure about their age?

86
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,081
And they lie, and then they gotta
remember, and it gets all...

87
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,401
You don't get it. See, you
don't understand how it works.

88
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,949
I don't want to shop
at old ladies' stores.

89
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,741
I don't want to go to J. Jill and
Chico's, and Ann Taylor Loft.

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,288
I'm not ready yet.

91
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,740
I need two more years.

92
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,542
That is so insane,
it kind of makes sense.

93
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,079
What'd you get me
for my birthday?

94
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,334
Wait a minute,
I thought you said that

95
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,336
we shouldn't get each
other gifts this year.

96
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,758
What do you mean?

97
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,598
You're supposed to
get me a surprise gift.

98
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,254
This is a big birthday.

99
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,255
I'm turning 40.

100
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,927
Mom!

101
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,352
Mom, why can't I get
new clothes?

102
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,186
What the fuck?
Nothing fits me!

103
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,105
God damn it!

104
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,278
I'm going to go work out,
I'll be back in about an hour.

105
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,935
Hey, did your father call
to wish you a happy birthday?

106
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,703
No, but that's no surprise.

107
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,422
Come on.
Coming.

108
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,429
You got to keep up with us, sweetheart.
Yeah, I'm in.

109
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,725
That's why your body
looks like your body

110
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,122
and her body
looks like her body.

111
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,772
Before, after.
Before, after.

112
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,102
You guys just go on without me.
I'm just gonna...

113
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,777
I think I gotta...

114
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,145
Fuck.

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,115
Thanks for letting
me join this team.

116
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,241
It's not really a team.

117
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,867
It's just a bunch of guys
that get together and ride.

118
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,082
I know, I know. PETE: Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

119
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,787
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!

120
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,209
It's always the guy in
the fucking lnfiniti.

121
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,137
Good. See, you're getting
tight here. Yeah.

122
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,919
This, we need to work on.
Okay.

123
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,096
So, why on earth is Pete taking Viagra?
What's going on?

124
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,343
I don't know.

125
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,346
I think maybe he isn't attracted
to me anymore or something.

126
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,146
I don't know.
Well, that is ridiculous.

127
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,691
If you were my girlfriend,
I would not need a Viagra.

128
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,690
I would need
an anti-Viagra pill...

129
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,609
To try not to get a boner.

130
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,773
But everyone gives you a boner.

131
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,033
Don't sell yourself
short like that.

132
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,697
You give me a boner.

133
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,071
Barb doesn't give me a boner.

134
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,747
Maybe things are
just getting stale.

135
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,951
That's why if maybe I
work out really hard...

136
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,250
Maybe he'll be able
to get a boner again.

137
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,582
Why do you need
to have sex, Deb?

138
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,834
Sex is the number one thing
people fight about.

139
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,425
You stop having sex,
there will be no more fights.

140
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,756
I am living proof.

141
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,178
I have no sex,

142
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,181
and I am the happiest
I have ever been.

143
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,767
I knew it. I knew you
were not having sex.

144
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,223
I can see it on your face.

145
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,979
It's all...

146
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,570
Puckered and pained.

147
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,573
I'm enjoying our non-sex
period, that's all I'm saying.

148
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,821
Don't you miss it?

149
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,191
I wouldn't know, because I don't
have any feeling down there anymore.

150
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,571
I have nerve damage
from my C-section,

151
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,077
so everything's just kind of...

152
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,949
She's numb down there.

153
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,157
I could sit down
hard on a fire hydrant,

154
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,165
and I wouldn't even
know that I was sitting.

155
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,631
I could get stung by a hornet down
there, and I would not feel it.

156
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,755
You could put
anything in there,

157
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,595
and I would not know
what the object was.

158
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,631
I used to pee in a nice stream,

159
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,058
and now it just kind of goes
like a shower head.

160
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,885
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

161
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,347
I think you need a family.
Don't you want a family?

162
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,394
No, I think
I want to Clooney it.

163
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,192
Clooney it?
Yup.

164
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,393
He doesn't seem happy.

165
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,145
Yeah, he is.

166
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,821
No, he's lonely.

167
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,944
No, he's not.

168
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,867
See, I think he has sad eyes.

169
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,111
You sweet little thing, no.

170
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,415
He's doing sad, lonely eyes
to get the next lady.

171
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,618
Look, I can do it, too.
Watch.

172
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,834
I bet George Clooney
is really lonely.

173
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,961
Just him and his pig.

174
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,838
You'd fuck him.
I wouldn't.

175
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,043
So would you.
I would.

176
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,366
I wouldn't feel it,
but I would.

177
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,458
You'd fuck him with your numb vagina.
Yes, you would.

178
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,801
Ocean's Thirteen Inches, that's
what you'd find out.

179
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,930
Do you think?

180
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,434
I mean, that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

181
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,186
That's the one
thing you don't do,

182
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,437
is tell her that
you used Viagra.

183
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,315
I think that's even
on the warning label.

184
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,897
We're in one of
those phases where

185
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,441
everything that
the other person says

186
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,401
just annoys
the shit out of each other.

187
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,283
All the time. It's a blast.
Don't worry about it.

188
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,035
You just gotta ride that out.

189
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,786
This sounds terrible.

190
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,492
Okay, I like it.

191
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,838
But...

192
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,414
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like if, say,

193
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,085
you were separated
by something bigger.

194
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,681
Like death? Like her death?

195
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:51,223
I have given it
a fair amount of thought.

196
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,891
Not in a painful way,
just quietly slid into death.

197
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,142
Like a gas leak.

198
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,019
Absolutely.
It's gotta be peaceful.

199
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,975
I mean, this is the mother
of your children.

200
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,773
You want her to die...

201
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,156
No, I'd want it
to be a peaceful...

202
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,525
gentle, you know.

203
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:09,484
Yeah, just like drift into a coma
from which she never awakens.

204
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,444
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

205
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,788
That's just it,
people love widowers.

206
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,658
They love widowers. It's like the
polar opposite of divorced guys.

207
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,742
It's the best.

208
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,543
It's like,
"Oh, that poor widower."

209
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,378
"If I could only
make him happy."

210
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,962
"Somehow, ease his pain."

211
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,042
"Cock-suck
away his sadness."

212
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,310
Do you know that this song,
Pixies did this song,

213
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,393
it's about a Salvador Dali short
film called Un Chien Andalusia.

214
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,194
This music doesn't
make people happy.

215
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,523
This song kicks off Doolittle, one of
the best albums of the last 30 years.

216
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,074
Look how angry you get
while listening to it.

217
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,492
An important record.

218
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,116
It's my birthday. You don't
control the radio on my birthday.

219
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,791
I do.

220
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,992
I control the radio
on my birthday.

221
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,260
Sadie's watching Lost.

222
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,132
Sadie, how many times have
you watched Lost this week?

223
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:19,725
I only watched 11. But I have eight
more, and then I'm done, so...

224
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,681
How many are there?
114.

225
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,731
Are you kidding me?

226
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,686
You can't watch over 100 episodes
of a show in five weeks.

227
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,020
It'll melt your brain.

228
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,774
It's not melting my brain,
it's blowing my mind.

229
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,574
That's really bad, Sadie.

230
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,573
You're not allowed to do that.

231
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,454
My relationship with Lost
is not your business.

232
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,827
It's extremely personal.

233
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,868
Stop!

234
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,957
Stop it.
Be nice to your sister.

235
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,380
You guys are going to
cherish each other one day.

236
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,966
Stop it! Stop!

237
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,965
It's your birthday. You
don't need to go to the store.

238
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,218
No, just five minutes.
Desi and Jodi are fighting.

239
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,513
All right, five minutes,
but then I'm pulling you out.

240
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,469
Hi.

241
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,720
Hi.

242
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,647
How's Jodi treating you?

243
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,103
Jodi?

244
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,025
Oh, Jodi's my new BFF.

245
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,444
She's like a little kitty-cat.

246
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,193
Sometimes she comes
and rubs up against my leg.

247
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,190
And you're a ball of shit.

248
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,821
She loves me.

249
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,151
Huh.

250
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,164
Can you do inventory so that
we can do the sidewalk sale?

251
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,621
And you really need to pay
attention to the numbers

252
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,709
because we have
$12,000 unaccounted for.

253
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,052
I think it's probably Desi.

254
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,227
She's been having a really hard
time using these simple computers.

255
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,552
It's because she's stupid.

256
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,301
I think she might be stealing.

257
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,516
She's not stealing.

258
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,771
She's our best employee. She
made nine grand last month.

259
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,317
How much did I make?

260
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,645
You brought in $2,200.

261
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,816
That's not bad.

262
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,106
Well, it's not that good.

263
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:58,069
I mean, I'm not comparing you,
but you're not as good.

264
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,711
All right. See you.

265
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,549
I don't think she's
wearing underwear.

266
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,553
What?
It's all dark up there.

267
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,174
Why are you looking?

268
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,762
I didn't mean to look.

269
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,845
I just said, "Hey, whoa."
And there it was.

270
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,810
Maybe she's wearing
dark underwear.

271
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,898
Yeah, maybe she has underwear that has
a picture of a vagina painted on it.

272
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,232
Stop looking.

273
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,819
Some deep oranges and browns,
and maybe some dark greens.

274
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,525
That would really
play up your features.

275
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,532
I'll just take out my AmEx and you
pick what stuff you think's good.

276
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,369
Whoo!

277
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,626
Good job!

278
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,786
Whoo!

279
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,166
Where's Daddy?

280
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,838
I think he went to poop.

281
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,336
Pete!

282
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,801
Q-A-T.
Suck on that, bitch.

283
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,430
Hey.
What are you doing?

284
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,266
Going to the bathroom.

285
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,017
We're all downstairs,
waiting for you.

286
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,849
You've been up here
for a really long time now.

287
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,855
I'm almost done.
I'll be down in a second.

288
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,404
Charlotte just did her first
flip on the trampoline

289
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,560
and she landed on her feet.

290
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,845
She was really
proud of herself.

291
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,150
That's great!
And you missed it.

292
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,619
She'll do it again.

293
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,281
It's the fourth time you've
gone to the bathroom today.

294
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,872
Give me a break.

295
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,584
Why is your instinct to escape?

296
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,377
It's not my instinct
to escape from you.

297
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,132
It is my instinct to
come into the bathroom

298
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,790
when I need to go
to the bathroom.

299
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,530
How come I don't
smell anything?

300
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:39,468
It's because I shoved an Altoid
up my ass before I came in here.

301
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,716
Let me see, then.

302
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:42,381
What?
Let me see.

303
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:43,635
No, I'm not going
to let you see.

304
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:44,762
You're not going to let me see,

305
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:45,842
because you're
not taking a poop.

306
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,685
I've been flushing as I go.

307
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,182
You're flushing as you go.

308
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,481
Who takes a half-hour
to go to the bathroom?

309
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,773
John Goodman.

310
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,108
Don't press "Enter." I'm not
sure I want to make that move!

311
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,942
PETE". Thank you. Wow.

312
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:04,235
You know, when I
first started this label,

313
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,289
my dream was to work
with musicians and bands

314
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,627
whose music
I just admired so much.

315
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:13,169
The person that I thought, "My God,
wouldn't it be incredible to work with,"

316
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,291
was Graham Parker.

317
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:20,960
Tonight, we have him, solo

318
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:23,216
because we couldn't afford
to fly in The Rumour.

319
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,843
Graham Parker.

320
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:17,649
It's just not my kind of music.

321
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,192
Really? What is
your kind of music?

322
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:20,644
I like Lady Gaga.

323
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,650
Oh, God, of course you do.

324
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,447
What?
Shallow dance music.

325
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:27,196
It's not. it is fun.

326
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:30,325
And it's about
release and sex and power.

327
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:33,658
You don't have to like it. It's
really not for you, that's fine.

328
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,334
This is a job.
This is not a hobby.

329
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,289
Can't you love him,
just as a hobby

330
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:43,466
and sign a 15-year-old
hot girl so we can eat?

331
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,385
Graham Parker & The Rumour
had two albums

332
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,430
in the Rolling Stone Top 500
Best Albums of All Time.

333
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:50,506
Two of them.

334
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:55,136
If I can just sell 10,000 records
to his hardcore fanbase,

335
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:56,266
we're golden.

336
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,196
The last of Graham
Parker's fans just died.

337
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:14,785
I do know. Hardly. That sort
of music depresses people.

338
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,286
Hi, Charlotte.

339
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:19,164
Sadie. Sadie,
what are you listening to?

340
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,881
Okay. This is music
that makes people happy.

341
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:26,425
And this is what people buy.

342
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,136
What?

343
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:33,015
Right, girls?

344
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,093
Come on, Sadie.

345
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:55,496
Okay.

346
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,119
Why did you take it off?

347
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:00,205
Now, something
that really rocks.

348
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,163
This is called good music.

349
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:07,091
From somebody's heart.

350
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,009
This is bumming me out.
This isn't fun.

351
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:12,054
Just listen to these words, okay?
Just listen to the words.

352
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,520
I don't understand the words.

353
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:21,275
This is lyrics.
This is poetry.

354
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:25,102
This is what is going to
survive in a hundred years.

355
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,312
It just doesn't
make people happy.

356
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,524
Makes me happy.
I can dance to it.

357
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,081
But you're the only one
in the room who's happy.

358
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:49,717
Sometimes I wish just
one of you had a dick.

359
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,303
Well, we don't want one.

360
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:04,102
Is there something that you can
do to be helping me right now?

361
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,313
Yeah, I'm ready to help.
Just tell me what to do.

362
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,739
Can you go get
a lunch box or something?

363
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:09,986
For me or for them?

364
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,321
Charlotte!
I've got a test!

365
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:16,069
I'm coming, I'm coming.

366
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:18,950
Charlotte, I'm going to kill you!

367
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,000
Hi, Debbie.

368
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,373
Hi. Any day now, huh?

369
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,251
Not really.
Three months, still.

370
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:28,835
Hi.
Hi.

371
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,337
Katie's dying for a play date.
Let's hook these two up.

372
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,670
That would be great. Okay,
I'll call you. Great.

373
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:34,845
Okay, great.

374
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,887
No.

375
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,215
No, what?
No.

376
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:38,845
What?
No.

377
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:39,967
She's sweet.

378
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,428
She's evil.

379
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:44,560
Hello. Hi.
Hi.

380
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:48,017
Listen, Charlotte really
needs to get here on time

381
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
because she needs the extra
time to just settle in.

382
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:52,070
Oh. We are on time.

383
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,281
Being on time
means being early.

384
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,941
Okay-

385
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,617
It's nice to see you in class.
We'd like to see more of you.

386
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,576
I come to...

387
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:03,453
Hi, Debbie.

388
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:04,579
Grandma Molly.

389
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,580
How are you? I'm so happy
about the science fair.

390
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:10,881
Thank you for coming.
It's going very well, I heard.

391
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:13,459
Yeah. I love you. You
look so beautiful!

392
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,634
Happy birthday. I just
learned that you're 40.

393
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,056
Are you 40?

394
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:20,807
Yeah.

395
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:23,811
I remember when I was 40,
and then I blinked,

396
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:25,399
and there I was,
going to be 90.

397
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,724
My God, where did it go?

398
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:30,977
One day, you're going to blink
and you're going to be 90.

399
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,314
And I won't be around to see it,
and that makes me very sad.

400
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:37,154
I'm telling you.
I'm warning you.

401
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,994
Don't blink. Don't blink.

402
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,252
And then
you missed the mortgage payment,

403
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,924
and that's the second mortgage.

404
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,468
You gotta tighten your belt.
You gotta go home, sit down,

405
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:59,423
look at your expenses,
come clean with Debbie.

406
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:01,220
Oh, God.
I can't tell Debbie.

407
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:02,470
You've got to tell her, Pete.

408
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,303
I mean, she knows it's bad, but
she has no idea just how bad.

409
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:08,185
If you sell the house, it'll
really buy you some time.

410
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:10,524
No, Debbie's not really
into selling the house.

411
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:13,193
As your business manager and your
friend, I can't recommend that.

412
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:17,110
Hey, how funny would it be
if I bought your house?

413
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,362
Okay. Bye.

414
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:20,910
Hang in there.

415
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,084
From the
retro label, Unfiltered,

416
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,336
comes the first Graham Parker &
The Rumour record in 30 years.

417
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,261
When we play together,
the magic was just ridiculous.

418
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:40,599
And I think what we've
got is just so great.

419
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:42,556
What are you doing?

420
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,225
I'm contextualizing him as one of
the great figures in rock history.

421
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:49,477
You can't show him
in his prime in '77,

422
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:52,274
and then jump straight
to him as he is now.

423
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,566
It's terrifying.

424
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:55,857
You have got to reverse it.
You have got to show him

425
00:21:55,936 --> 00:22:00,157
as he is now, very briefly,
and then show him in 1977.

426
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,620
You have got to
Benjamin Button it.

427
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:04,496
I don't know what you're talking about.
All rock stars are older now.

428
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,164
Steven Tyler, David
Bowie, Mick Jagger...

429
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,411
Paul McCartney.
Okay. Stop it.

430
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,745
Everybody that you are mentioning
looks like an old woman now.

431
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:14,414
You're just mentioning
a bunch of Jessica Tandys.

432
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:16,757
Keith Richards
gets away with it.

433
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,011
But that's because Keith Richards
looked 70 when he was 40.

434
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,679
And now that he's 70,
he looks 69.

435
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:24,798
He's regenerating.

436
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,805
I like it, and I think
Graham Parker's sexy.

437
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:28,268
Well, would you fuck him?

438
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:29,937
Yes.
You'd...

439
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:32,939
You'd fuck him and
you won't fuck me?

440
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:34,726
I mean, I kind of
fucked you once,

441
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,769
if you could have finished.
Oh. I finished.

442
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:39,776
Okay, enough of who fucked
who and who finished what.

443
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:41,149
I finished.

444
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:44,448
Look, it's a retro label. That's
our niche, that's our market.

445
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:47,371
It costs money to break new bands.
I can't do that.

446
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,790
Okay, and also, you're the guy
who turned down Arcade Fire.

447
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:51,371
Everybody turned
down Arcade Fire.

448
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,872
It's crazy.
There's so many of them.

449
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,295
We don't have the money
to market a new band.

450
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,373
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

451
00:22:57,957 --> 00:22:58,958
Who's he talking to?

452
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:00,262
The Jewish Journal.

453
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,216
The Jewish Journal?

454
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:06,800
Apparently, old Jews are the only ones
who still buy hard copy of records.

455
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,850
Because they don't
like to download music.

456
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,388
Because they don't know
what "downloading" means.

457
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:15,315
Why is this album different
from any other album?

458
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,150
It isn't.

459
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:18,435
What is he wearing?

460
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,195
It's a hat with
the Oreo logo on it.

461
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:22,361
Why? I don't think
he's being ironic.

462
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:23,842
I think he just
really likes Oreos.

463
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,630
Look, Paul Westerberg
record did okay.

464
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:28,162
Frank Black record
did all right.

465
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:29,705
The Haircut One Hundred,
not so much.

466
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,203
We have to break this record.
Otherwise, we're not here next year.

467
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,126
He's coming, he's coming.
Oreo Man is coming.

468
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:35,327
Hey, guys, how are you?

469
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:36,412
Good, man.

470
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,213
Aren't cookies the best?
Yeah.

471
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:41,129
Jewish Journal guy
loves the record.

472
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,255
Great!

473
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:44,678
Got a bit of a problem, though.
A touch of gout.

474
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,384
Gout?

475
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:49,008
My whole family,
they all had gout.

476
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:51,719
Jesus.
That's very unfortunate.

477
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,976
My auntie Queenie,
she had a foot like this.

478
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,979
It's like a size of a small pig.
I've got a photo of it.

479
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,565
I'd love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

480
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,275
And a couple of
bunions as well.

481
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:03,401
Fuck.

482
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,027
I've got to go
to the podiatrist,

483
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:06,700
and I hope he can
shoot me up with something.

484
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,198
Yeah, well, let's get
you to the podiatrist.

485
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,119
Bye, Graham.
See you later, Graham.

486
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:13,620
Good luck with your gout.

487
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:15,042
Rock and roll, baby.

488
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:20,415
The happiest period in people's
lives is from age 40 to 60.

489
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:23,671
So, this is it.
We're in it right now.

490
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,461
It's true.
Says who?

491
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:28,218
Says a lot of people.
Most people say that. Oh!

492
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:33,349
We have everything we need right
now to be completely happy.

493
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:36,605
We're going to blink, and be 90.
What?

494
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,274
So, let's just
choose to be happy.

495
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:41,144
Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:42,443
Your eyes are
kind of glazing over.

497
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,146
No, I'm processing it all.

498
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,607
Some of these, I wrote for you.

499
00:24:46,774 --> 00:24:48,651
So, we have to exercise every day.
Mmm.

500
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,532
Spend more time alone together.

501
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:52,747
And we have to go
to the therapist, every week.

502
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:55,244
It's a little pricey.

503
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:58,081
No stressing over tiny things.

504
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:00,003
Yeah, that's good. You should do that.
Mm-hmm.

505
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,002
We have to get more
involved in school.

506
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,292
Yeah. Have more
patience with the kids.

507
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:07,253
And we need to
work on our anger.

508
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,808
Yeah, I think it would be good if
you could take care of your anger.

509
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:11,173
No, I said both of us.

510
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,428
That's what I said.
Our anger.

511
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,178
Okay, and no more smoking.

512
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,558
Yeah, you gotta cut that out.

513
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,361
I don't want to make this about a fight.
I want to just be positive.

514
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,101
Yeah. Sorry.

515
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:26,109
Okay, and then no more
holding onto resentments.

516
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:28,190
We have to just let that go.

517
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:29,946
So, you're saying
that if we're arguing,

518
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:31,736
and I apologize,
you'll let it go?

519
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,339
And not throw it
back in my face later?

520
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:35,455
Well, I don't do that,

521
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:39,206
but I will continue
not to do that.

522
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,624
And what did you write?

523
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:43,789
All of that. That's plenty.
That's a lot.

524
00:25:44,123 --> 00:25:46,376
And you're going to eat better?

525
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,586
Oh, yeah. I've been
doing a decent job.

526
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:50,230
But I don't think
there's anything wrong

527
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:51,763
with having some
fries every now and again.

528
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,341
And then I'll smoke that day.

529
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:55,764
That's not the same thing.
It is the same thing.

530
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:56,973
I like fries.

531
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,309
And the other thing
is your dad's stuff,

532
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:02,688
the not letting him
guilt-trip you all the time

533
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:05,770
because that puts a lot of
pressure on you, and stress,

534
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:07,567
and then the whole family feels it.

535
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,865
And he is a grown man, and
he's not our responsibility.

536
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:12,405
And you're not giving him
money anymore, right?

537
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:15,488
No. No, I haven't
been giving him money.

538
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:17,211
I haven't done that
for years. I told you.

539
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,498
Can you please put that down?

540
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:25,582
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

541
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,416
You sure you don't want to just
do a joint birthday party?

542
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,500
No.

543
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:29,756
We always used to.
No.

544
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,552
Did Jodi tell you she
thinks Desi's stealing?

545
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:35,425
Are you serious?

546
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:37,805
How much?
$12,000.

547
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,845
Oh, God.

548
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:41,100
And Desi's taking it?

549
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,352
Well, I don't know.

550
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,728
That's what Jodi said.

551
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,768
We really need
the store to work.

552
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:48,524
It is.

553
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:50,652
Don't put that kind
of pressure on me.

554
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:54,485
No, no. It's not
what I mean. I'm just...

555
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:57,530
Are you nervous about money?

556
00:26:57,863 --> 00:26:59,285
Are we okay?

557
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,082
Yeah.
All right.

558
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,957
Maybe we just suck it up
because she's clearly

559
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:06,459
earning so much more than
any other employee we have.

560
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,749
Oh, yeah, for sure.
We can't fire her.

561
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:10,797
We're barely
breaking even with her.

562
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,116
That's why we have to keep her.

563
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:15,431
Look at this. She's
making out with somebody.

564
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,064
Is she screwing him?

565
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:23,097
That might be like a dry hump.

566
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,353
Look at the position
of her skirt.

567
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,810
That's too grainy
to know for sure.

568
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:32,527
Oh, my God. This is in the middle of the day.
Customers could be in there.

569
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:33,983
At least she's getting some.

570
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,240
What did you say?
"At least she's getting some"?

571
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,824
Yes.

572
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:41,327
What are you talking about?
We had sex the other night.

573
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:42,794
You gotta give me
a little credit for that.

574
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:46,003
It's not about credit.
It's about...

575
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,001
We need to have more passion.

576
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:49,377
Like this.

577
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,212
That's not passionate.

578
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,964
It looks passionate to me.

579
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,257
What?

580
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,933
What is she doing? Okay.

581
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,055
Oh, my God.

582
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:03,846
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh.

583
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:07,562
Don't do that.
What am I doing?

584
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,526
Don't fart in the bed.

585
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:11,316
I'm not. It's the springs.

586
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,154
This is why we never have sex.

587
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,232
That's disgusting,
you're gross.

588
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:16,862
I don't know what
you're talking about.

589
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,531
You're so...

590
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,873
God!

591
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:23,790
Sadie, Sadie,
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie

592
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:26,581
Charlotte,
I'm doing my homework.

593
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:28,079
Okay, watch this.
Watch this.

594
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,169
There's a haunted cow
back here.

595
00:28:31,248 --> 00:28:35,628
I'm pretty sure
it does not have milk.

596
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,216
Moo.

597
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,473
Moo!

598
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:46,388
See that?
They took me away.

599
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,393
You're no fun.
You never want to play.

600
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:54,898
Charlotte, how many times
do I have to tell you?

601
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,028
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie

602
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:01,320
Sadie is boring

603
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:14,792
You're so mean since
your body got weird.

604
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,888
Close the door.

605
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,587
You're no fun.

606
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:21,150
If you can just move
just a little bit more.

607
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:22,745
On, shit.

608
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:23,944
Ah!

609
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,616
Ow. Ow.

610
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:27,864
No, my boob is in there!

611
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,866
Did I tell you that my
son's going to Stanford?

612
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:33,165
No, that's great. Great for
us, and great for him.

613
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:34,291
Cough again.
Great school.

614
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:37,499
Everything looks good.

615
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:39,550
Your face is close to my face.

616
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,758
Descending colon.

617
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:43,555
I'm about four
feet in right now.

618
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:46,720
That's what he said.

619
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,680
Are you a grinder?
Do you grind your teeth?

620
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:53,689
I grind all night.

621
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,312
Oh!

622
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:58,375
I think we need to
turn the gas down.

623
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:59,699
Turn it up!

624
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:01,261
No, we're going to
turn it down.

625
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:02,782
Turn it up!

626
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:12,868
Ooh!

627
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:14,512
Do you have to breathe
right on my neck?

628
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:15,753
Sorry.

629
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,002
What are you all
doing for Christmas?

630
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,333
Um, I don't know.

631
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,839
You have a tree and everything?
Mm-hmm.

632
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:24,171
Isn't that fun?
In the spirit?

633
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:25,801
Sorry, I just had
one quick question.

634
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,349
On your form, you said
you were born in 1974,

635
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:31,554
but your paper, it said '72. So I
just need to know which it is.

636
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:32,808
It's 1974.

637
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,479
Oh, wait.
Because on your last form,

638
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:38,652
you said that you
were born in 1975.

639
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:41,483
Didn't you tell me
you were born in 1976?

640
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,613
No.
That's funny.

641
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:45,942
So, you want to go with 1974?

642
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:50,617
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974.
It is 1974.

643
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:52,281
Okay-

644
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,039
Just remember to write
"1974" every time.

645
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:58,629
It's okay. It's 1976.

646
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:02,170
I lie about my age, okay?

647
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:05,511
Okay.
Okay? Okay? Okay?

648
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,175
Okay-
Okay-

649
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,972
You're tightening up.

650
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,470
Oh, my gosh.

651
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:15,096
I know how old you are by
counting the rings.

652
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,647
A little gyno joke.

653
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:20,438
Oh, my God. Please.

654
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:25,865
What are you doing?

655
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,743
Getting ready to
go for my ride.

656
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:30,949
You want a blow job?

657
00:32:31,028 --> 00:32:32,951
Yeah. Why?

658
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:35,495
I really want a cigarette right now.

659
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:37,121
Wow, happy to help.

660
00:32:37,618 --> 00:32:39,666
Charlotte,
where is my backpack?

661
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,499
Hello?

662
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,338
Mom's busy!

663
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,044
Why are you locking the door?

664
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,967
Mom, what's going on in there?

665
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:50,639
Mom, I can't be late
for school. I have a test.

666
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:51,806
Mommy can't talk right now!

667
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:54,305
This isn't funny, Mom.
I need to go!

668
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:56,012
Mom, let me in!
Please!

669
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:57,597
That's not gonna help!

670
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,728
Put on your shoes.
We'll meet you in the car.

671
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,601
Ow. Sadie hurt me!
I didn't!

672
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:03,152
So, hit her back!

673
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,312
She's faking.

674
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,194
- I'm not!
- Go downstairs!

675
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:08,313
Please! Sadie gave me a...

676
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:10,109
Stop crying!
Stop crying!

677
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:11,444
Stop it!
God damn it!

678
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:14,163
Quit killing each other!
Mom, please come out.

679
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:15,990
Shut up!
Stop it!

680
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:18,167
- Open the door!
- Go away!

681
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,373
Open it up!
Please!

682
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:21,544
Forget it.

683
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,373
No, don't forget it, don't forget it.
Don't, don't...

684
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:26,504
Oh, God.

685
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:30,050
Hey, boychik!

686
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:31,968
Hey!

687
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:37,850
It's the 11:00
from London.

688
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:41,899
Drop something valuable,
you shit!

689
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,313
How you doing?
How are you, bubeleh?

690
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,780
That's loud.
Every eight minutes, buddy.

691
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:51,859
You look pretty good.
Your hair is different.

692
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:53,406
Yeah, I'm growing it out.

693
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:55,161
I'd get it cut.

694
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,531
Daddy, you never play with me.

695
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:59,618
I do, but right now,
look who I'm talking to.

696
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,078
Hi.
It's your brother!

697
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:05,130
Hi. You don't look
like my brother.

698
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:09,005
I told you, honey, that's
because of the egg donor.

699
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,512
Remember?
I came from a test tube!

700
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,634
How's business?
It's not good.

701
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,594
Nobody wants curtains.

702
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:21,810
They think of it like a luxury.
It's not a luxury.

703
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:24,354
You need shade.
You need privacy.

704
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:26,443
Who wants to have
other people watch you fuck?

705
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,653
I know how you feel.

706
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:31,107
My business is going through
some growing pains right now.

707
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,237
Daddy!
Daddy!

708
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:34,489
Don't jump on Daddy. Be
careful, don't jump on Daddy!

709
00:34:35,152 --> 00:34:37,621
Remember,
Daddy has high blood what?

710
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,118
High blood pressure.

711
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:40,996
That's right.
My daddy's old.

712
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,998
Can you go outside
without me for a little bit?

713
00:34:43,243 --> 00:34:45,541
Yeah. Don't go near
that little pool!

714
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:47,006
All right? We're going
to pee in the pool.

715
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:49,630
Do The Three Stooges routine
you were practicing.

716
00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:51,885
I can't tell them apart.

717
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,713
I swear to God, I need tattoos.

718
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,844
Look, I wanted to
talk to you about

719
00:35:00,552 --> 00:35:02,691
scaling back a little bit.

720
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:06,893
You know, Deb and I are... We're
thinking about selling the house.

721
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:08,728
I think that house
is more than you need.

722
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:11,360
I think it was too big of a
purchase when you made it.

723
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:15,367
Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going
to have to make some changes.

724
00:35:16,276 --> 00:35:17,539
I'm going to have to cut back.

725
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,948
I understand.
What do you mean?

726
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:21,790
With you.
Oh.

727
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:22,954
I'm sorry. What?

728
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:25,043
I can't lend you
any more money.

729
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:28,877
No, that's a bad idea. That's
not the way to cut back.

730
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:30,924
I have three children here.

731
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,256
What about Claire?
Can't she get a job?

732
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:35,220
Claire takes care
of your brothers!

733
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:36,630
What do you want her to do?

734
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,716
If she goes to work,
then I gotta hire somebody!

735
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:40,008
Well, you've got to
figure something out

736
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,969
because I can't do it.
I can't do it.

737
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:43,663
Okay, fine.
Why don't we kill them?

738
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,211
Come on,
we'll kill two of them.

739
00:35:45,222 --> 00:35:46,644
I'll keep the best one.

740
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,522
Really, it'll save us
both a lot of trouble.

741
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,147
Come on.
Line up!

742
00:35:50,227 --> 00:35:52,355
Line up for murder! Come on!

743
00:35:53,564 --> 00:35:55,362
Who wants to be killed?
I do!

744
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:58,820
Okay, we're eliminating one already.
We're cheaper. You're gone.

745
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:00,449
Murder me.
Okay. Boom. Dead!

746
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,156
I'm dead!
You're dead! You're dead!

747
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:04,158
Kill me, kill me! All right,
the kids are murdered.

748
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:05,493
That will save us some money.
Daddy is the best!

749
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,502
Why would you have
three kids, anyway?

750
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:09,421
I mean, you're 60 years old.
You have no money.

751
00:36:09,538 --> 00:36:11,791
Because Claire wanted a baby.

752
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,297
If we didn't at least try,
she would have left me.

753
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:17,801
She was 45 years old.
Nobody thought it would take.

754
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,099
The doctor, when we're doing in
vitro, is winking at me like...

755
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:21,762
"Don't worry, don't worry."

756
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:23,188
We were very unlucky.

757
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,308
And now, we have these
three beautiful children.

758
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:27,477
Come on. I gotta
tell you something.

759
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:35,606
What?

760
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,952
Your mother wanted you aborted.

761
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,286
Oh. Jesus Christ.

762
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:44,330
No, no. It's the truth.

763
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:47,042
You know, it was the '70s.
We were 22 years old.

764
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:50,838
That's what everybody did. You did
some blow, had sex, had an abortion.

765
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,418
Really?
Yes.

766
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:54,421
We were on the way to
the doctor's office.

767
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,174
I said, "Let's stop,
have a pizza, talk about it."

768
00:36:57,252 --> 00:37:00,131
"If you still wanna do it
after lunch, it's okay."

769
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:02,349
The pizza saved your life.

770
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:05,803
But don't give me money,
because I'm not worth it.

771
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,764
So, how much do I owe
you for saving my life?

772
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,521
I don't have a number. You just
keep giving like you're giving.

773
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,567
Hey. Oh, hi, Pete.

774
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:13,735
Hey-
Hey-

775
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:14,983
Why aren't you
playing with the kids?

776
00:37:15,062 --> 00:37:16,814
We were playing
all day with them.

777
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:20,993
Pete is just talking to me
about his 40th birthday party.

778
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:22,577
Whatever I can do to help.

779
00:37:22,653 --> 00:37:23,996
Okay. Did you feed them?

780
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,618
I fed half of one.

781
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:27,040
Half of...

782
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:29,083
Let's go, we'll feed them.
Mommy will feed them.

783
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:33,714
Who wants tuna with
a side of jet fuel?

784
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,005
Hi, I'm looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man.

785
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,519
So, how's Sony treating Pete?

786
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,739
He's not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

787
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:02,200
Now he's able to
focus on the artists

788
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:04,074
that he's really
passionate about.

789
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,320
Hmm.

790
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:07,031
How's Sadie doing?

791
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:10,414
The last time I saw her, she was
throwing her Cheerios on the floor.

792
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:11,880
What a mess.

793
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:13,204
Right.

794
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:15,918
She just got her period.

795
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:21,429
Well, I guess she's not
a little baby anymore.

796
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:25,382
It would be nice to
see more of each other.

797
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:29,349
Well, we can certainly arrange for that.
I'd love to see the girls.

798
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:32,181
That would be nice.
Mm-hmm. It would.

799
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:37,858
Do you have a day that is better...
A good day?

800
00:38:38,103 --> 00:38:40,572
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

801
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:42,657
Soccer competitions,
kids' exams.

802
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,986
Right, right.
I mean, we're both so busy.

803
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,663
I have young children,
you have young children.

804
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:52,369
I don't think we should judge
ourselves too harshly about that.

805
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,372
I know, I wasn't...
I didn't say anything.

806
00:38:56,455 --> 00:39:00,585
No, I'm glad we're here.
I think this is a good start.

807
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:04,217
And then, we can spend more
time together, it'd be nice.

808
00:39:05,422 --> 00:39:06,719
It'd be nice.

809
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:12,012
Do you want to see
pictures of the kids?

810
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,775
Oh. Yeah.

811
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,145
This is Kel, my son.

812
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:23,362
He's handsome. He's 13?
Mm-hmm.

813
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,697
And that's Alexandra, my daughter.
She's a real perfectionist.

814
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:30,747
A lot like you.

815
00:39:31,073 --> 00:39:34,077
That's the whole gang at Cabo.

816
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:37,667
Excuse me, dear,
I gotta go to the restroom.

817
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,794
Be right back.
Okay.

818
00:40:13,198 --> 00:40:16,077
Daddy and I are
making some changes

819
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:18,161
so that we can be
happier and healthier.

820
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,589
And we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.

821
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:23,921
I think it looks great.
Doesn't it look good?

822
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:25,201
What is that, grilled cheeses?

823
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:27,675
No, baked tofu.
Oh.

824
00:40:27,963 --> 00:40:29,431
It's actually really tasty.

825
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:31,725
And the lettuce is
so fresh and tasty

826
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,270
that you forget how good
lettuce tastes on its own,

827
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:36,813
without dressing.

828
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:40,063
No, dressing always gets in the way
of the natural taste of the lettuce.

829
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:42,276
And another thing we've decided

830
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:46,983
is to cut back on
all of the electronics we use.

831
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:51,870
Basically, what we're going to
do, is get rid of the Wi-Fi

832
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:53,785
and only use the computer...

833
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:55,958
What? ...from 8:00
to 8:30 at night.

834
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,433
How are we gonna
go on the computer?

835
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:59,829
We're gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

836
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:01,504
Yeah. We'll supervise that.

837
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,254
You can't do this. You
can't take away the Wi-Fi.

838
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,721
No Wi-Fi!
A-ha-ha.

839
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:08,511
You don't spend
enough time with the family

840
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:12,467
when you're constantly on your
iPhone and your computer.

841
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:15,974
And, you know, you're only
here for five more years.

842
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:17,896
So, you won't see
me after five years?

843
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:20,394
No, but you won't
be living with us.

844
00:41:20,474 --> 00:41:22,275
And you should get to
know your little sister.

845
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,232
You've got the perfect
friend, right here.

846
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:26,188
I don't wanna be
friends with her now.

847
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:29,525
I'll be friends with her when
she's 20 and a normal person.

848
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:32,327
I don't wanna hang out
with her when I'm in my 20s.

849
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:33,790
You're on the computer
too much as it is.

850
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:36,661
You need to get outside more,
do some playing outside.

851
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,665
Yeah, you could build things.
You could build a fort outside.

852
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:42,997
What?
Yeah, build a fort.

853
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,502
Play with your
friends and have...

854
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:47,300
Make a fort? Outside?

855
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,714
And do what?

856
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:50,592
Do what in the fort?

857
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,846
When I was a kid, we used to build
tree houses and play with sticks.

858
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:57,556
Nobody plays with sticks.

859
00:41:58,095 --> 00:41:59,312
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

860
00:41:59,596 --> 00:42:00,597
Play kick the can.

861
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,148
Look for dead bodies.

862
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:03,771
It's fun. That's fun to do.

863
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,528
Get a tire and then just take a stick
and run down a street with it.

864
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:09,322
Nobody does that crap.
It's 2012.

865
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:10,910
You don't need technology.

866
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:12,609
No technology!

867
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:13,781
Charlotte, put that down.

868
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,081
I don't need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

869
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:19,499
I don't do anything bad.

870
00:42:19,574 --> 00:42:20,917
Nobody said you were bad.

871
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:22,539
I don't do things
I'm not supposed to.

872
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,292
I don't illegally
download music.

873
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:26,214
I don't look at
porn like Wendy.

874
00:42:26,373 --> 00:42:29,377
She is up to no good. She's not
allowed to come over here anymore.

875
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,460
What's porn?

876
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:31,591
No, she said "corn."

877
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,968
This isn't turning out
the way I wanted it to.

878
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:35,139
I'm not hungry.

879
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:37,430
No computer.
Listen to your mom.

880
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:38,977
I need to use it
for my homework.

881
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:43,482
She's outplaying us.

882
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:46,605
I know. She's tough.

883
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:52,023
This is the best
birthday present.

884
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:53,154
It's good to get away.

885
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,826
We haven't been to Laguna
without the kids in years.

886
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:56,903
I know. If we're
happy, they're happy.

887
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:59,115
Yeah, I mean, I can't take it.

888
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:01,370
With the hormones,
and the crying.

889
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,247
Jesus.
And "do my homework."

890
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:04,498
Them's lil' bitches.

891
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:08,082
Them's lil' bitches. Bugging
us for shit all the time.

892
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,418
And they never
appreciate anything.

893
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,424
No! God, no.
They're selfish assholes.

894
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:18,100
Aw, I feel bad.
I love them.

895
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:19,222
I know.

896
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:21,891
I miss them already.
Should we go home?

897
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:23,471
Nah.

898
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:07,182
Why do we fight?

899
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:08,608
I don't know,
it makes no sense.

900
00:44:08,683 --> 00:44:09,946
It makes no sense.

901
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:11,812
When we get in a fight,

902
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:14,990
look at my eyes and let's
remember this moment, right now,

903
00:44:15,065 --> 00:44:16,612
and know that we
never have to fight.

904
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:18,826
But you're such
a dick sometimes.

905
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:20,245
I know, lam a dick sometimes.

906
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:22,667
People think I'm so nice,
but I'm such a dick.

907
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:25,075
Thank you for admitting that.

908
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:27,911
And you get so mad at me, I
feel like you want to kill me.

909
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:29,705
I do want to kill you.

910
00:44:29,955 --> 00:44:31,081
How would you do it?

911
00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:33,258
I don't know. I'd poison you.

912
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:37,380
I'd poison your cupcakes that you
pretend not to eat every day.

913
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:40,261
And just put enough in
to just slowly weaken you.

914
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,341
I love it.

915
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:43,424
I would enjoy our last few
months together. Me too.

916
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:46,013
Because you'd be
so weak and sweet.

917
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:47,939
And I could take care of you...

918
00:44:48,098 --> 00:44:49,395
But while killing you.

919
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:51,480
See, you know
what I love about us?

920
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:53,027
You can still surprise me.

921
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:56,232
I figured, for sure, you'd knock me
out with one fell swoop of poison.

922
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:58,612
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

923
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,532
Have you ever
thought about killing me?

924
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:02,658
Oh, yeah.
Really?

925
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:03,738
Sure.

926
00:45:03,822 --> 00:45:05,143
How would you do it?
Wood chipper.

927
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,708
A wood chipper?
Yeah.

928
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:07,875
A wood chipper.

929
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:09,043
Yeah.

930
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,211
Wow.

931
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:11,630
I know. Did you see Fargo?

932
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:12,752
Yeah.

933
00:45:14,374 --> 00:45:15,466
Ugh.

934
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:18,549
That's a bad plan. The
cupcakes is a way better plan.

935
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:19,800
It is. You're right.

936
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:21,631
You know what?
I won't murder you.

937
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:22,973
Aw!

938
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:24,892
I love you.

939
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:26,474
I love you, too.

940
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:28,709
Do you know what I brought?
What?

941
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:31,312
A medical marijuana cookie. Ben
gave it to me last Christmas.

942
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:32,521
What?

943
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:33,609
Yeah. I brought it.
You did?

944
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:34,732
Chocolate chip kooky.

945
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:35,812
Should we do it?

946
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:38,858
Let's eat the cookie and then we'll
order a bunch of cheeseburgers.

947
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,692
Let's order the entire
room service menu.

948
00:45:40,817 --> 00:45:44,242
Just get all of it. You
deserve it, you really do.

949
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:45,948
Wouldn't you
rather have me around

950
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:49,080
for less years and I'm incredibly
happy, than longer and miserable?

951
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:52,086
Yes, and I just
realized that right now.

952
00:45:52,162 --> 00:45:53,334
Go get the cookie.
I'm getting the cookie.

953
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:54,881
Go get the cookie.

954
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,166
Ow!

955
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,011
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

956
00:45:58,835 --> 00:46:00,508
Yeah. Should we
get a block of porn?

957
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,843
I don't think we
need 24 hours of porn.

958
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:06,517
But you know, two porns costs just
about as much as a 24-hour block.

959
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:08,186
I think that's too much porn.

960
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:11,898
We don't have to watch it all, but
for the value, it makes sense.

961
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:14,089
How much are we
supposed to eat?

962
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:16,236
I don't know. I think six
or seven cookies, right?

963
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:19,022
Plus, it's old, it probably
has lost some of its...

964
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:20,782
Potency.

965
00:46:23,026 --> 00:46:25,199
We should have sex more.

966
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,288
I mean, girls have it so easy.

967
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:30,789
You just show up with your sexual
organs and you're good to go.

968
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:32,107
All the pressure is on the guy.

969
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,161
It's true.

970
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:36,214
And I look at guys... Like, I
look at a guy like Prince,

971
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:37,632
and you know that guy fucks.

972
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:38,708
Yeah.

973
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,131
I know I don't fuck like Prince.
Uh-uh.

974
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,508
Prince can fuck.
Uh-huh.

975
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:44,302
I fuck like David Schwimmer.

976
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:47,721
You do.

977
00:46:49,135 --> 00:46:51,729
You know, I fuck
like Ross from Friends.

978
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,368
Mmm.

979
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:04,491
Looks good.

980
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:05,909
How does he do it?

981
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,072
The floating spoon.

982
00:47:10,281 --> 00:47:12,420
Check it out.
It's my dick and balls.

983
00:47:12,826 --> 00:47:15,579
Oh, my God.
I don't eat my own dick.

984
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:17,459
I ate my dick!

985
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,125
Kelly, I think
this room has rodents.

986
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,507
There! Just saw it.

987
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,763
Have you seen my starfish?

988
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:28,259
Where did I put my starfish?

989
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:30,427
My God.

990
00:47:30,593 --> 00:47:33,312
I'm gonna deep
throat this clair.

991
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:35,877
I wanna make out
with you so bad.

992
00:47:40,854 --> 00:47:42,948
I felt like I was gonna choke!

993
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,643
That was nice.

994
00:48:15,722 --> 00:48:17,315
That was nice.

995
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:22,604
Mom, Charlotte's crying

996
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:24,314
because she's got
an ear infection again.

997
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:26,324
I didn't know what to do.

998
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,327
We're home.

999
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:32,239
Are you okay?

1000
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:33,706
What's the matter?

1001
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:37,748
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

1002
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:41,335
I told you that pediatrician didn't
know what he was talking about.

1003
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:43,507
Come on, you can't
blame it on our doctor.

1004
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,184
Ear infections are
common in little kids.

1005
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:47,679
Not in kids over six years old.

1006
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:49,973
We're going to
the Eastern doctor.

1007
00:48:50,048 --> 00:48:52,488
If she's in this much pain, then
we should call a real doctor.

1008
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:55,064
Are you kidding right now?

1009
00:48:57,305 --> 00:48:59,307
I know. Okay. Yup.

1010
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:02,694
What we should do
is easy and simple.

1011
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:05,359
No more dairy, no more
wheat, no more sugar.

1012
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,775
Sugar, wheat and dairy.
Okay. Yeah.

1013
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:09,443
What the fuck is left?

1014
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:10,698
Sorry.

1015
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:13,245
Isn't everything sugar,
wheat, and dairy?

1016
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:15,286
She can have
vegetables and fruits.

1017
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:17,125
Oh, but she can eat fruits.

1018
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:18,710
Fruits. Yeah.

1019
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,085
Any kind of fruit?

1020
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:21,580
Mangos, pineapple-

1021
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:23,047
It isn't, there are safe fruits

1022
00:49:23,164 --> 00:49:25,166
and then there are unsafe fruits?
No, no.

1023
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,633
What about French fries?

1024
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,389
Could we do something like that?
Are you okay?

1025
00:49:28,628 --> 00:49:30,708
Would you like to come on the table?
I'm okay, I'm...

1026
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:31,913
Why don't you go on the table?

1027
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:33,165
I don't wanna go on the table.

1028
00:49:33,216 --> 00:49:34,468
No. It looks like you
need to get on the table.

1029
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:35,791
I don't wanna get on the table.

1030
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,062
Pete!

1031
00:49:48,314 --> 00:49:49,702
God damn it.

1032
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:53,615
What are you doing?

1033
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:56,740
I need you to look at
something. In my butt.

1034
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:00,626
Why?

1035
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:02,420
I think I got
something in there,

1036
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:05,381
and I'm not
limber enough to see.

1037
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:07,629
I need you to look
at it, all right?

1038
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:11,930
I think I might have an anal fissure, or
a hemorrhoid, or a worm or something.

1039
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:16,346
What are you
doing with your phone?

1040
00:50:16,426 --> 00:50:19,466
I'm trying to take pictures of it so I
can compare it to something on Google.

1041
00:50:20,847 --> 00:50:25,569
Can we just keep
just a small shred of mystery

1042
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,154
in our relationship, please?

1043
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:30,356
Look, I saw you
have two babies, okay?

1044
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:32,116
Seriously, I need you
to get up all in that.

1045
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,861
I do not want to
investigate your anus.

1046
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:37,034
Payback time.

1047
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:46,627
It's a hemorrhoid.

1048
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,792
Thank you.

1049
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,298
Now, erase that
from your memory.

1050
00:50:56,716 --> 00:51:00,061
Where'd she get those clothes?
Those are expensive clothes.

1051
00:51:00,803 --> 00:51:02,931
Think. Where do you think?

1052
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,608
I don't want
this to sound harsh,

1053
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:11,727
but everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

1054
00:51:11,773 --> 00:51:14,071
Everything that
goes into it is a dick.

1055
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:15,985
Everything that
goes in is dicks?

1056
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:17,369
A dick.

1057
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,662
Don't say that.

1058
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:22,083
I'm sorry. I'm just being
protective of the store.

1059
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,202
I'm going to go talk to her.

1060
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,125
Hey, Desi.

1061
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:32,464
Hi.
Hi.

1062
00:51:32,835 --> 00:51:34,587
Is that your new
Acura out front?

1063
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:36,093
Uh, yeah.

1064
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:37,344
It's so nice.

1065
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:38,549
Do you love it?

1066
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:41,765
I mean, it's not a fucking
Porsche, but it'll do for now.

1067
00:51:42,387 --> 00:51:43,513
Huh.

1068
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,356
Hey, Desi,
would you mind wearing

1069
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:47,232
some of the clothes that
we have in the store?

1070
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,318
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1071
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:50,861
Will that be okay?
Yeah.

1072
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:54,611
Perfect.

1073
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:56,113
Good?

1074
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,408
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1075
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:00,780
Did you?
Yeah.

1076
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:04,038
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

1077
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:06,996
and then I actually
transferred it to the T-shirt.

1078
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,212
Wow.

1079
00:52:08,496 --> 00:52:11,420
So, you stenciled on the tiger?

1080
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:13,425
I drew it on
a piece of paper and then

1081
00:52:13,543 --> 00:52:16,046
I transferred
the drawing to the T-shirt.

1082
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:18,548
You have an amazing body.

1083
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:19,807
Really?

1084
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:22,385
Yes. Are those real?

1085
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,812
My boobs?
Yeah.

1086
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:27,391
Yeah. Do you wanna
touch them?

1087
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:28,683
Really?

1088
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:30,105
Touch them.

1089
00:52:30,226 --> 00:52:31,398
Okay-

1090
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:36,577
Wow.

1091
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,192
Huh.

1092
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:39,902
Jesus.

1093
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,666
I mean, they really are amazing.
That's firm, for real.

1094
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:48,836
They're like a memory mattress.

1095
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,624
It's, wow, like
Tempur-Pedic, you know?

1096
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,758
They look amazing.

1097
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:57,382
My kids just sucked
the meat right out of mine.

1098
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,842
No.
Yeah.

1099
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:00,013
There's some meat in there.

1100
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:04,102
My boobs are just gone. Since I
had kids, my boobs are just gone.

1101
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:06,930
They didn't even say goodbye, you know?
They just left.

1102
00:53:07,305 --> 00:53:10,684
By the time I'm 40, these are gonna
go National Geographic on me.

1103
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:13,903
I feel bad about
myself right now.

1104
00:53:15,438 --> 00:53:17,987
I think this is a
really good offer on the house.

1105
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:19,700
We expected more.

1106
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:21,278
I know it's a bad market,

1107
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,454
but that's still way under
what we were looking for.

1108
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:27,124
I know, but based on what the market's
like, it's like you're gaining money,

1109
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,080
because it's so much
more than what you deserve.

1110
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:30,986
But these people are from Iran

1111
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:33,373
and they don't really know that
they're offering too much.

1112
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:36,130
Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?

1113
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:38,086
I doubt it.
I mean, I don't know.

1114
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:40,009
There's a lot of
inventory out there.

1115
00:53:40,129 --> 00:53:41,972
I mean, what is her problem?

1116
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,884
She has
unrealistic expectations.

1117
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:47,728
I'm faster than you!

1118
00:53:47,845 --> 00:53:49,358
We're Jewish!

1119
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,893
Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?

1120
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:55,194
It's Jack.

1121
00:53:55,728 --> 00:53:56,945
Hey, Jack.

1122
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,482
My daddy doesn't know my name!

1123
00:53:58,606 --> 00:53:59,858
Okay, come on, let's go.

1124
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:02,990
Can I go show them my
crystals before they leave?

1125
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,202
Yeah, really quick.

1126
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,493
It's all right with me.
Elevator down!

1127
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,834
Okay. Go play with
your tiny uncles.

1128
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:11,707
- Let's play murder!
- Yeah. Let's go.

1129
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:13,584
So, what are you doing?
Spring cleaning?

1130
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:18,339
I'm getting rid of everything in the
house that has gluten or sugar.

1131
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:20,170
Why? What's wrong
with gluten?

1132
00:54:20,253 --> 00:54:21,596
Gluten's really bad for you.

1133
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:23,301
I don't think so.
It's wheat.

1134
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:24,636
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?

1135
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:26,050
As in, "The Wizard of"?

1136
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:29,687
Hey, Mom, we were wondering if we
can use the computer to iChat?

1137
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:32,098
Remember the rules?
8:00 to 8:30.

1138
00:54:32,348 --> 00:54:33,861
Yeah, but I have a friend over.

1139
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:35,988
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.

1140
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:39,356
Why don't you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1141
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,823
Hey, remember the Alamo?

1142
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,408
Have you ever
built a fort, Wendy?

1143
00:54:42,525 --> 00:54:43,697
Like, on Facebook?

1144
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:46,321
I will take this if you're
gonna throw it away,

1145
00:54:46,404 --> 00:54:48,702
because at our house,
we're wheat-eaters.

1146
00:54:49,532 --> 00:54:52,052
But don't you want to live long
enough to see your kids grow up?

1147
00:54:52,451 --> 00:54:53,873
That's up to God, honey.

1148
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:56,084
No, but that's really
not good for the kids.

1149
00:54:56,372 --> 00:54:58,340
Eh, the kids eat grass,
this is fine.

1150
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:01,294
Wendy's mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

1151
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,007
Yeah, my mom's
pretty cool about it

1152
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:04,839
as long as
I finish my homework.

1153
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:06,344
Yeah.

1154
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:08,301
Well, I guess
I'm not the cool one,

1155
00:55:08,384 --> 00:55:10,853
but the rules are just
different in our house.

1156
00:55:11,345 --> 00:55:13,347
Well, I get better
grades than Wendy.

1157
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:15,482
She does. She's so smart.

1158
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,314
Let me just grab
the candy worms.

1159
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,903
See, your rules are ridiculous.

1160
00:55:19,228 --> 00:55:20,275
Don't sass me.

1161
00:55:20,605 --> 00:55:23,575
I'm only sassing you because you're
throwing out all the food in our house

1162
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:25,276
and I'm freaking starving.

1163
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:26,493
You're being stupid.

1164
00:55:26,652 --> 00:55:28,404
Wendy, could you go stand
in the other room, please?

1165
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:29,780
Yeah.
Mom.

1166
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:31,073
Give me your iPhone, now.

1167
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,583
The nougat things are good.

1168
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:34,578
I have all my
contacts in there.

1169
00:55:34,744 --> 00:55:36,496
Okay, if you don't give me
your phone right now,

1170
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:39,019
then I'm gonna have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1171
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,168
Jesus Christ, I need
my computer to do homework.

1172
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,923
That's it.
No phone, no computer.

1173
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:44,132
This is B.S.

1174
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:46,969
This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You're acting like a B.

1175
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:49,050
Kids! Time to go!

1176
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:50,931
You go to your room, right now.

1177
00:55:51,177 --> 00:55:52,474
You are not allowed to use

1178
00:55:52,803 --> 00:55:57,229
iPhone, iPad,
iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,

1179
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,276
Pandora, or Spotify.

1180
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:02,523
She's a little pip,
just like her mommy.

1181
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:06,572
So, I might have
a job tomorrow.

1182
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,829
At least, I'm gonna go
try to give an estimate.

1183
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:11,864
Do you mind taking the kids
for a couple of hours?

1184
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:13,620
Um...

1185
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:14,784
Okay-

1186
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:17,454
This is nice.

1187
00:56:17,703 --> 00:56:19,797
You and I don't spend
enough time together, do we?

1188
00:56:20,456 --> 00:56:21,878
We spend enough time together.

1189
00:56:22,124 --> 00:56:23,125
We do?

1190
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:25,419
It's quality time.

1191
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,052
Then we do.

1192
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:30,978
I'll go with what you think.

1193
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:33,724
What else did they say?

1194
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,643
All right,
some kid named Joseph...

1195
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:37,394
I know Joseph.
You do?

1196
00:56:37,556 --> 00:56:39,183
He's making
a "hot-or-not" list.

1197
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,692
What?

1198
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:43,112
Sadie said, "That's so lame and
immature that you're doing that."

1199
00:56:43,187 --> 00:56:47,067
And then Joseph says, "Yo, girl,
we're just having some fun."

1200
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:48,818
"So don't be a bitch, yo."

1201
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,283
That is not nice.

1202
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:53,489
So then Sadie said,
"Don't call me a bitch."

1203
00:56:53,572 --> 00:56:55,085
And Joseph said,
"I didn't call you a bitch."

1204
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:56,750
"I said don't act like a bitch."

1205
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:58,920
"And by the way, you're
in the 'Not-Hot' column."

1206
00:56:59,412 --> 00:57:01,460
Who made him
the judge of "hot"?

1207
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,702
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

1208
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,169
What a little fuckhead.
I'll kill him.

1209
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,588
Then Sadie said, "You're
in the jackass column."

1210
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:10,469
"I gotta go,
I'm bored of you."

1211
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:13,514
That is cool.
That's taking the high road.

1212
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:15,053
And then, for some reason,

1213
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:18,231
there's an emoticon
of a panda doing push-ups.

1214
00:57:19,432 --> 00:57:20,854
I wonder what that means.

1215
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:23,895
I don't think it means anything.
I think it's just adorable.

1216
00:57:24,437 --> 00:57:25,563
Aww.

1217
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,027
Well, she's a good girl.

1218
00:57:27,314 --> 00:57:29,863
She was polite and she
stood up for herself.

1219
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:31,653
That's pretty cool.

1220
00:57:32,236 --> 00:57:33,283
What?

1221
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:34,534
Shit.
What?

1222
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,901
I thought she was coming in.

1223
00:57:35,948 --> 00:57:37,700
Oh, my God,
that scared me to death.

1224
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:39,414
If she caught us,
she would kill us.

1225
00:57:39,535 --> 00:57:40,878
She would.
She would kill us.

1226
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:42,204
Huh.

1227
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:50,220
I gotta make a call.

1228
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:54,474
We sold how many?

1229
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,599
612 album downloads.

1230
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,189
Wait a minute. There
are no zeroes after that?

1231
00:58:00,264 --> 00:58:03,894
There are zeroes, but all
of them are before 612.

1232
00:58:04,101 --> 00:58:05,318
There are none after.

1233
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:06,900
How is that even possible?

1234
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:09,402
Well, out of
300 million Americans,

1235
00:58:09,565 --> 00:58:13,445
612 people chose
to download the album.

1236
00:58:13,569 --> 00:58:16,664
You could personally call
everyone who bought this record.

1237
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:19,162
We're fucked, we're fucked.

1238
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:21,998
Here's the deal, I want you to
meet me tomorrow morning at 8:00.

1239
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:25,423
I want a list of at least 30 ideas
of what we can do to change this.

1240
00:58:25,498 --> 00:58:26,841
We have to change this.

1241
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:29,677
I started a record label
because I couldn't get a job,

1242
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:32,096
so I have no other options.

1243
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:52,536
What financial problems?

1244
00:58:52,983 --> 00:58:54,326
Well, I mean, for one thing,
you were right.

1245
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:57,746
You are missing about
$10,000 from the store.

1246
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:00,374
And then, Pete's
record not selling well.

1247
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:01,837
Pete's record not selling...

1248
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,128
I thought we weren't supposed
to hear for three weeks.

1249
00:59:04,328 --> 00:59:05,545
We heard.
You heard?

1250
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:06,838
And they're bad.

1251
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:09,209
It's that and it's the money that
he's been lending his father.

1252
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,134
That's creating a strain.

1253
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:14,339
How much have we lent him?

1254
00:59:14,463 --> 00:59:15,635
Eighty thousand.

1255
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,435
Did you say 8,000 or 80,000?

1256
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:22,146
80,000, over
the past couple of years.

1257
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,398
And then you missed
the mortgage payment.

1258
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:25,599
On the house?

1259
00:59:25,683 --> 00:59:29,233
And you missed
the rental on the office.

1260
00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:31,276
Does Pete know that?

1261
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:33,987
Yeah, we're on
the phone all the time.

1262
00:59:34,316 --> 00:59:36,159
Look, I know you're
going through a hard time.

1263
00:59:36,235 --> 00:59:39,830
And I want you guys to know
that we're here for you, okay?

1264
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:42,075
Anything you guys need,
that's why we're here.

1265
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:44,206
We're here for times like this.

1266
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:45,748
What are you gonna do?

1267
00:59:45,828 --> 00:59:47,830
There's not much I can do.

1268
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,137
What are you doing?

1269
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:02,545
I'm drawing the album cover
for Van Halen's Diver Down.

1270
01:00:02,803 --> 01:00:05,852
If you spent a little bit more
time focusing on Graham Parker

1271
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:07,274
instead of
drawing album covers,

1272
01:00:07,558 --> 01:00:09,026
I wouldn't be in
this predicament.

1273
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:10,853
I'm focused on Graham Parker.

1274
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,693
You're supposed to
help me with him.

1275
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:14,293
You're supposed to
call the companies.

1276
01:00:14,356 --> 01:00:16,700
You're supposed to
get people to the show.

1277
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:18,452
I've done
everything I can, Pete.

1278
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:20,245
You had me
pushing around a corpse.

1279
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:22,741
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham's.

1280
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:24,580
What should we do?
I'm out of ideas.

1281
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,452
You fly in The Rumour.

1282
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:30,753
I can't sell a reunion concert
without the band, it's ridiculous.

1283
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:33,050
With what?
I can't afford it.

1284
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:35,719
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility.

1285
01:00:35,794 --> 01:00:38,388
Take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

1286
01:00:38,464 --> 01:00:39,966
What did you call me?

1287
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:41,175
Chin.

1288
01:00:42,718 --> 01:00:45,062
Pete. Wait, Pete!

1289
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:46,900
Hey, I have an apartment.

1290
01:00:46,972 --> 01:00:48,815
I have health insurance,
I have car payments.

1291
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:50,108
I have responsibilities.

1292
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:52,983
You have responsibilities? Don't
talk to me about responsibilities.

1293
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:55,406
I have a life.
I have a family.

1294
01:00:55,648 --> 01:00:58,652
I can't afford to sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

1295
01:00:58,734 --> 01:01:01,408
and then going to Tommy's Chili
Burgers at 3:00 in the morning.

1296
01:01:01,487 --> 01:01:03,831
That's not even the order
that that happens in!

1297
01:01:04,406 --> 01:01:06,579
I have everything to lose, here.
Everything.

1298
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:10,588
Yes, because you spent thousands
of dollars on shit we don't need.

1299
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:14,834
You really need to spend $30,000
on a fucking neon sign, dude?

1300
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:19,006
Which is inside, it's not even outside.
We know where we work.

1301
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,849
If you want to sign a band, you gotta
look like you're the real deal.

1302
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:25,303
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

1303
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:26,519
It's 12,000.

1304
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:27,938
$12,000!

1305
01:01:28,097 --> 01:01:29,690
All right,
you know what? Fine.

1306
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:32,609
Fly in The Rumour.
Put it on my AmEx.

1307
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:36,897
No, you said it was impossible.

1308
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:39,116
I don't think
I said "impossible."

1309
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:40,442
Yeah.

1310
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:42,278
I usually don't
say "impossible."

1311
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:45,114
I like to leave
some wiggle room.

1312
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:50,291
You said that my fibroid
was like a giant boulder,

1313
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:54,044
like the one from
the Indiana Jones movies

1314
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:56,003
blocking up my uterus.
Uterus.

1315
01:01:56,542 --> 01:02:00,263
And I need to stop using that
reference of Indiana Jones.

1316
01:02:00,462 --> 01:02:04,968
I think that that's not appropriate when
talking about the reproductive system.

1317
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,518
It's okay.

1318
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:09,642
Anyway, somehow the
Eastern medicine has worked,

1319
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:12,524
and the fibroid has dissipated.

1320
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:15,482
That's great!
Yes.

1321
01:02:15,602 --> 01:02:16,774
Wow.
Yes.

1322
01:02:16,854 --> 01:02:19,903
Your fibroid shrunk and somehow

1323
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,073
it allowed you to get pregnant.

1324
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:27,580
What?

1325
01:02:28,991 --> 01:02:31,585
You're gonna have
your third baby.

1326
01:02:31,785 --> 01:02:33,378
Congratulations.

1327
01:02:36,206 --> 01:02:37,378
No.

1328
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:39,631
Yes.

1329
01:02:44,882 --> 01:02:46,350
Would you like some water?

1330
01:02:48,177 --> 01:02:49,724
That's good news.

1331
01:02:50,846 --> 01:02:52,189
Another baby.

1332
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:53,440
At 40.

1333
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:54,729
Debbie?

1334
01:02:55,851 --> 01:02:57,478
I am thrilled.

1335
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,824
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

1336
01:03:04,193 --> 01:03:06,036
So, you're okay?

1337
01:03:08,197 --> 01:03:09,619
What a relief.

1338
01:03:10,032 --> 01:03:12,831
Because I can finally
relax now, you know?

1339
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:15,000
It's been, like...

1340
01:03:21,543 --> 01:03:23,056
It's okay.

1341
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:26,090
I'm so happy, though, you know?

1342
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:28,551
I really am, because, I mean...

1343
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:30,265
It's good.

1344
01:03:31,095 --> 01:03:33,439
Great. Great.

1345
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:25,782
Hey-Hey'

1346
01:04:26,275 --> 01:04:28,448
Why are you in a bathrobe? It's
the middle of the afternoon.

1347
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:31,872
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1348
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:34,120
I'm sorry about the record.

1349
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:37,753
You're going through financial shit.
This is what I live with.

1350
01:04:37,953 --> 01:04:40,752
This is a horrible time in human history.
What is that?

1351
01:04:40,998 --> 01:04:44,047
It's something that might
help both of our situations.

1352
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:47,596
This is
a drawing by John Lennon.

1353
01:04:48,005 --> 01:04:50,133
I got it 10 years ago
for $5,000.

1354
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,603
I don't know how
much it's worth now.

1355
01:04:51,675 --> 01:04:52,955
It could be five,
it could be 20.

1356
01:04:53,969 --> 01:04:55,687
I don't want this.

1357
01:04:55,971 --> 01:04:57,894
I don't even like it.
I'm not gonna hang it up.

1358
01:04:58,098 --> 01:05:00,692
It's not for you to hang up.
It's for you to sell.

1359
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:02,928
That way, I can give it to you
and you make some money,

1360
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:04,491
and Debbie won't know
that I'm giving you anything.

1361
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:07,654
You're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project.

1362
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,449
I don't know how to sell this.
I'm not an art dealer.

1363
01:05:10,652 --> 01:05:13,155
I don't know.
Sell it online.

1364
01:05:13,322 --> 01:05:15,700
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1365
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:18,335
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

1366
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:20,462
All right.
Don't get snippy.

1367
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:24,215
Just because you write a great
song doesn't mean you can draw.

1368
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:27,010
It's incredible.
John Lennon drew it.

1369
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:28,758
I think it's a Ringo.

1370
01:05:29,254 --> 01:05:31,382
Don't beat me up if
I get $300 for it.

1371
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:34,017
Don't take anything
less than $6,500 for that.

1372
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:36,261
It's very valuable.
It's important to me.

1373
01:05:36,345 --> 01:05:37,938
I want you to sell
it so I can help you.

1374
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:39,390
Okay-

1375
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,650
All right.
I'll see you at my party.

1376
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:44,069
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1377
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:47,698
No, don't buy wine with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1378
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:48,903
That's mean.

1379
01:05:49,024 --> 01:05:50,617
I love you. Bye.
All right.

1380
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:53,028
How do I call eBay?

1381
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:57,993
I mean, he called me a bitch.
What am I supposed to say?

1382
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:02,504
But I think maybe that
might mean he likes me.

1383
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:06,004
I don't know. It's making me really...
It's really awkward.

1384
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:08,419
I think he might like you.

1385
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:13,553
She's so cute.
She's so tall.

1386
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:15,008
I know.

1387
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:16,180
How did that happen?

1388
01:06:19,054 --> 01:06:21,182
Do you ever wish we
had a bigger family?

1389
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:23,308
No.
Never for a second.

1390
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:26,395
Never

1391
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,022
Never?
Never

1392
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,697
I love what we have.

1393
01:06:29,982 --> 01:06:31,279
One? A breeze.

1394
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,989
Two? Brutal.

1395
01:06:33,402 --> 01:06:35,700
Three?
Put a bullet in my head.

1396
01:06:35,904 --> 01:06:36,905
Ugh.

1397
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:40,584
You know, I think about that
gray-haired pregnant lady from school,

1398
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:42,582
and I just feel bad for her.

1399
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:44,755
And I feel bad for the kid.

1400
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,457
Can you imagine?

1401
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:48,710
All the other little kids,
"Where's your mommy?"

1402
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:52,717
"Oh, she's the one sitting in that
scooter, eating a soft cracker."

1403
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:55,602
Kids don't want to
have old parents.

1404
01:06:55,882 --> 01:06:58,635
You know what? It would also be nice
for us to spend some time apart.

1405
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:01,851
Kind of rediscover who
we are, individually.

1406
01:07:02,097 --> 01:07:04,646
It'd be so great to not
see you for a chunk of time,

1407
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:06,318
so that I could
really just miss you.

1408
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:10,113
Remember when we
used to miss each other?

1409
01:07:20,657 --> 01:07:22,284
Hey! Hey, you.

1410
01:07:22,784 --> 01:07:23,910
Yeah, what's up?

1411
01:07:24,202 --> 01:07:25,465
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.

1412
01:07:26,913 --> 01:07:28,051
Sadie?

1413
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:30,046
Sadie, the one you
chat with on the Internet.

1414
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:31,426
No, man. That ain't me.

1415
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:33,253
Well, it was you.
I saw your picture.

1416
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:37,550
Did you make a hot list? And
not put Sadie on the hot list?

1417
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:39,096
She was not on my list, no.

1418
01:07:39,343 --> 01:07:40,560
You know what I'm gonna do?

1419
01:07:40,636 --> 01:07:41,888
I'm gonna make my own hot list.

1420
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,974
And you know what?
You're on the not-hot list.

1421
01:07:45,223 --> 01:07:46,361
How does that feel?

1422
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:48,968
It doesn't bother me. I'm
comfortable with the way I am.

1423
01:07:49,102 --> 01:07:51,321
Maybe you shouldn't be
so comfortable with yourself.

1424
01:07:51,605 --> 01:07:52,982
You know why?

1425
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:55,492
You look like
a miniature Tom Petty.

1426
01:07:55,817 --> 01:07:57,160
How's that feel?

1427
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:59,120
You think that
haircut's cool? It's not.

1428
01:07:59,363 --> 01:08:01,991
It looks like you put your
Justin Bieber wig on backwards.

1429
01:08:02,366 --> 01:08:04,118
Are you still
comfortable with yourself?

1430
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:06,294
Why are you wearing
a tank top? Huh?

1431
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:10,333
So you can show off your little bald
pits, you little hairless wonder?

1432
01:08:10,624 --> 01:08:12,922
Cool tank top,
man. Huh?

1433
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:17,927
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1434
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:21,135
on my daughter's Facebook
page, just remember me.

1435
01:08:21,301 --> 01:08:22,348
Remember me.

1436
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:26,690
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1437
01:08:26,848 --> 01:08:28,020
Okay, I'm sorry.

1438
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:30,018
Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!

1439
01:08:30,686 --> 01:08:32,154
Wait. You're not...
Are you crying?

1440
01:08:32,312 --> 01:08:33,359
Just let me go.

1441
01:08:33,563 --> 01:08:34,780
Oh, my...

1442
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,571
I'm sorry.
Okay.

1443
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,236
I'm sorry.

1444
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:41,622
I'm not in my right head.

1445
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:44,200
I understand. My mom's going
through menopause, too.

1446
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:45,371
It's a hard time.

1447
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:47,039
What'd you say?

1448
01:08:48,036 --> 01:08:49,504
Are you going
through menopause?

1449
01:08:49,621 --> 01:08:50,861
I'm not going
through menopause.

1450
01:08:50,872 --> 01:08:54,046
I'm not gonna go through
menopause for like 20 years.

1451
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:56,295
I'm pregnant, you little bitch.

1452
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:57,629
God damn it!

1453
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,552
God damn it!

1454
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:07,493
I'm going out with Desi to find
out if she's stealing from us.

1455
01:09:07,556 --> 01:09:09,684
I've got the Graham Parker concert.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

1456
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:12,064
I don't know.
Figure it out.

1457
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:19,742
I kind of just wanted to talk.

1458
01:09:19,818 --> 01:09:23,618
I thought maybe we could go
to a coffeehouse or something.

1459
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:26,283
You want coffee?
This place has coffee.

1460
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:28,289
They have all kinds of drinks.

1461
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:29,745
Um...

1462
01:09:29,995 --> 01:09:32,248
But someplace quiet, maybe.

1463
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,128
This place can be quiet.

1464
01:09:34,332 --> 01:09:36,551
There's a spot in the back.
It's pretty quiet.

1465
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:39,596
What sport do you guys play?

1466
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:41,013
We play hockey.

1467
01:09:41,465 --> 01:09:42,762
Oh, I like hockey.

1468
01:09:42,924 --> 01:09:44,050
Play for?

1469
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:45,886
We play for
the Philadelphia Flyers.

1470
01:09:45,969 --> 01:09:47,892
So, you guys are
all from Philadelphia?

1471
01:09:48,096 --> 01:09:49,439
No.

1472
01:09:49,514 --> 01:09:50,857
Actually, none of us are.

1473
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:52,601
Do you guys still
have all of your teeth?

1474
01:09:52,893 --> 01:09:57,273
Well, I got all my teeth
except these ones.

1475
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:58,614
Do you want to try them on?

1476
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:00,029
Yeah, I'll do it.
Go for it.

1477
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:05,364
Do I look sexy?

1478
01:10:05,447 --> 01:10:06,664
Yeah!

1479
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,480
Do you want to
make out with me?

1480
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:11,294
Oh, yeah.

1481
01:10:15,665 --> 01:10:16,837
Wow.

1482
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:18,885
They definitely look way better
on her than they do on you.

1483
01:10:19,002 --> 01:10:20,094
Here we go.

1484
01:10:21,922 --> 01:10:23,139
Thank you.

1485
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:26,185
So, should we go
to the quiet area?

1486
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,853
No, no, no.

1487
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:29,851
Where are you going?

1488
01:10:29,971 --> 01:10:32,394
We kind of have to have a little
business meeting tonight.

1489
01:10:32,516 --> 01:10:33,642
Business meeting?

1490
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,485
Girls, you gotta celebrate because
we won tonight. Let's go.

1491
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,278
I want to party with these winners.
Come on, Deb.

1492
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:39,080
Just come to the stage
and dance with us.

1493
01:10:39,606 --> 01:10:40,653
Yeah.
Okay.

1494
01:10:40,982 --> 01:10:42,245
Yeah!

1495
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:44,494
Okay, let's fucking dance!

1496
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:47,698
Yeah!

1497
01:10:49,866 --> 01:10:52,995
Don't be shy, feel free to come
down and fill up these empty seats.

1498
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:56,006
Thank you so much for coming.
This is so exciting!

1499
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:00,461
For the first time
in over 30 years,

1500
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:03,513
Graham Parker & The Rumour.

1501
01:11:44,754 --> 01:11:47,143
Where are his fans?
I mean, where are they?

1502
01:11:47,507 --> 01:11:52,604
It's hard to watch a band when you
know all of them remember D-Day.

1503
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,573
What was
the press turnout like?

1504
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,743
Oh. You're serious?

1505
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:06,284
Nobody came. Nobody.

1506
01:12:06,484 --> 01:12:07,701
Nobody is here?

1507
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:09,746
The guy from Green Day is here.

1508
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:12,036
Yeah, Billie Joe,
I emailed him. He's a fan.

1509
01:12:12,449 --> 01:12:14,201
You gotta get a photo
of the two of them.

1510
01:12:14,284 --> 01:12:15,911
No, he says he doesn't
want to do any press.

1511
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:17,337
He's just watching the show.

1512
01:12:17,412 --> 01:12:21,087
Oh, how punk-rock of him.
"I don't like photographs."

1513
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:23,711
Grow up, Green Day!

1514
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:25,720
Shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck!

1515
01:13:04,459 --> 01:13:05,631
You don't have, like...

1516
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:09,431
I wouldn't call them
classically good dance moves,

1517
01:13:10,256 --> 01:13:11,724
but you left it all out there.

1518
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,017
You're a blast to dance with.

1519
01:13:13,593 --> 01:13:14,640
Thank you.

1520
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:17,605
We're having a little shindig
at the hotel after this.

1521
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:20,776
You should come by
and hang out at the hotel.

1522
01:13:22,727 --> 01:13:24,900
You want me to
come to the hotel?

1523
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:27,153
Yes, I want you to come

1524
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:29,446
by the hotel with me.

1525
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:32,784
Well, what would we do there?

1526
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:37,118
Maybe we can find somewhere quiet and
have fun and kind of see where it goes.

1527
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:42,126
Do it like adults
do sometimes and...

1528
01:13:42,622 --> 01:13:44,169
Like, sex?

1529
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:48,011
I mean, if you want.

1530
01:13:48,253 --> 01:13:52,508
If that's on the docket, but
I'm not trying to force that.

1531
01:13:52,841 --> 01:13:54,809
So, you would do sex with me?

1532
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:56,268
"Do sex"?

1533
01:13:56,553 --> 01:13:58,021
What are you, Borat?

1534
01:13:58,263 --> 01:13:59,480
Are you hitting on me?

1535
01:13:59,597 --> 01:14:01,110
Yes, yes, I'm hitting on you.

1536
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:05,024
You're hot and cool and nice
and you have beautiful eyes.

1537
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:09,032
I'm sorry.

1538
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:12,327
I'm married, I have two
kids and I'm pregnant.

1539
01:14:14,529 --> 01:14:18,033
That is what we call
the hat-trick. Wow.

1540
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:19,751
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1541
01:14:19,868 --> 01:14:23,623
I was just really enjoying
you being so nice to me.

1542
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:28,051
I hope this doesn't
come off as super-cheesy,

1543
01:14:28,543 --> 01:14:32,264
but I think you're
a very rare find.

1544
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:33,969
Thank you.

1545
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,683
And I would totally
"do sex" with you.

1546
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,893
That was spectacular, guys.

1547
01:14:40,972 --> 01:14:43,066
Really well done. Amazing.

1548
01:14:43,141 --> 01:14:44,939
Thank you.
Good, good.

1549
01:14:45,893 --> 01:14:46,894
Hey, Graham.

1550
01:14:47,228 --> 01:14:48,741
Pete. How are you, man?

1551
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:51,233
Well, the first numbers
came in.

1552
01:14:51,482 --> 01:14:52,950
Yeah, right, yeah.

1553
01:14:53,234 --> 01:14:54,486
Happy? How's it looking?

1554
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:57,409
About half of your last record.

1555
01:14:57,655 --> 01:15:00,078
Ah. So, you were
expecting it to sell?

1556
01:15:01,034 --> 01:15:04,083
They never sell anymore. They
used to sell, but now they don't.

1557
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,089
I'm not a sexy
16-year-old girl.

1558
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,418
But I wanted to sell it.
It's such a good record.

1559
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,922
I feel like I let you down.

1560
01:15:11,169 --> 01:15:14,639
No, I'm gonna be fine, man.
My overheads are so low.

1561
01:15:15,006 --> 01:15:16,883
I just got a song in Glee.

1562
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:20,179
The guy in the wheelchair is gonna
sing it to the Asian girl, I believe.

1563
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:22,559
I don't know, I've never seen the
show, but that's what I'm told.

1564
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,934
The secret is, make sure
you have a small nut.

1565
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:27,936
That's the key to life.

1566
01:15:28,102 --> 01:15:29,979
Graham, I don't have
small nuts, all right?

1567
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:32,106
I have big nuts and I
need to provide for them.

1568
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,158
Graham!
Hey, what's up?

1569
01:15:34,275 --> 01:15:35,367
Billie!

1570
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:36,683
Graham, how are you doing, man?

1571
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:38,295
Great fucking show, man.
Good to see you.

1572
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,493
Thank you.
Fuck.

1573
01:15:39,614 --> 01:15:41,207
Yeah, I'm inspired.

1574
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:42,795
I want to write
a fucking song right now.

1575
01:15:42,867 --> 01:15:43,868
Inspired.
Yeah.

1576
01:15:43,951 --> 01:15:45,043
That inspires me.

1577
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:46,680
Let's go get a drink.
Let's get a drink.

1578
01:15:46,704 --> 01:15:47,876
All right. You coming?

1579
01:15:47,955 --> 01:15:50,424
No, no, I'm fine.
You guys go.

1580
01:15:51,084 --> 01:15:53,052
Congratulations on Glee.

1581
01:15:53,127 --> 01:15:54,845
Oh!
Yes, thank you.

1582
01:15:55,046 --> 01:15:56,468
All right.
See you, Pete.

1583
01:15:56,714 --> 01:15:58,341
All right. So long, guys.
Later.

1584
01:15:58,424 --> 01:15:59,516
Yeah, yeah.

1585
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:01,518
You got a song on Glee?
Yeah.

1586
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:03,809
That's killer, man.
That's so much money.

1587
01:16:04,055 --> 01:16:06,308
It's great.
It's good for all of us.

1588
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:37,134
Why did you put that
guy's teeth in your mouth?

1589
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:40,054
That's so gross.

1590
01:16:40,675 --> 01:16:42,348
I was drunk.
He was dirty.

1591
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:44,345
No, he was wearing a tie.

1592
01:16:45,012 --> 01:16:46,559
That's true.
He wasn't dirty.

1593
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:50,356
When I kissed him, I felt his little
tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.

1594
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:51,815
You did?
Yeah.

1595
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:53,483
It was like kissing a baby.

1596
01:16:53,604 --> 01:16:54,730
French-kissing a baby.

1597
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:01,454
Can I ask you something stupid?
Uh-huh.

1598
01:17:01,821 --> 01:17:05,041
Do you know why we're
missing money at the store?

1599
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,325
Are you guys missing money?

1600
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:08,753
Yeah. Like, $12,000.

1601
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,667
Do you think that I took it?

1602
01:17:12,832 --> 01:17:14,709
No. I mean...
Well, no.

1603
01:17:14,834 --> 01:17:17,053
I did and I don't now.

1604
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:18,470
It's not me.

1605
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:23,347
Why do you live in such a nice
apartment and have such a fancy car?

1606
01:17:23,718 --> 01:17:26,562
Yes, you're right.
Um... Look...

1607
01:17:28,973 --> 01:17:32,477
lam an escort.

1608
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:36,397
I get paid to go out on dates.

1609
01:17:36,898 --> 01:17:38,070
You...

1610
01:17:38,232 --> 01:17:39,324
Oh.

1611
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:42,073
But only three to
five times a year.

1612
01:17:42,361 --> 01:17:43,533
Ten times, max.

1613
01:17:45,364 --> 01:17:50,666
But it's not technically prostitution,
because I don't have to sleep with them.

1614
01:17:50,912 --> 01:17:52,038
Oh, well, that's good.

1615
01:17:52,121 --> 01:17:53,168
But I always do.

1616
01:17:53,372 --> 01:17:56,421
That's why I only do it
four to eight times a year.

1617
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:57,798
Fifteen times, max.

1618
01:17:58,085 --> 01:17:59,177
Huh.

1619
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:01,347
One year, I did it 20.

1620
01:18:01,631 --> 01:18:04,305
Well, as long as
you think it's safe.

1621
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:05,551
It's safe.

1622
01:18:06,052 --> 01:18:08,601
I only do it 10
to 30 times a year.

1623
01:18:09,138 --> 01:18:10,981
So, who do you
think is stealing money?

1624
01:18:12,475 --> 01:18:13,692
It's fucking Jodi.

1625
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:15,482
No.
Yeah.

1626
01:18:15,978 --> 01:18:17,446
She's a pilled-out whore.

1627
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:19,732
Huh.

1628
01:18:21,317 --> 01:18:23,740
Since you told me,
I want to tell you something.

1629
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:25,617
You're pregnant.

1630
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:27,285
How'd you know?

1631
01:18:29,784 --> 01:18:31,036
Wow.

1632
01:18:31,535 --> 01:18:32,707
Maybe you should tell Pete.

1633
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:34,038
You didn't tell Pete yet?

1634
01:18:34,288 --> 01:18:35,255
I haven't told Pete.

1635
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:36,628
Why?
I don't know why.

1636
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:38,634
I just want him to want me.

1637
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:41,383
I don't want him to want me
because I'm pregnant.

1638
01:18:41,796 --> 01:18:43,469
Go home and
fucking suck his dick

1639
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:45,304
and tell him then,
and he will love it.

1640
01:18:46,217 --> 01:18:47,810
You think?
He'll be so excited.

1641
01:18:48,135 --> 01:18:50,308
Or even better yet...
Better yet,

1642
01:18:50,596 --> 01:18:53,850
you should tell him while you're
sucking his dick, like...

1643
01:18:53,975 --> 01:18:55,067
"I'm pregnant."

1644
01:19:01,816 --> 01:19:03,409
What are you doing?

1645
01:19:03,526 --> 01:19:05,403
Um, returning some emails.

1646
01:19:05,861 --> 01:19:07,738
What time do you
have to go to work?

1647
01:19:07,863 --> 01:19:09,661
Like, 10 minutes ago.

1648
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:11,913
Do you wanna be late?

1649
01:19:12,243 --> 01:19:14,712
No, I can't be late, not today.

1650
01:19:25,965 --> 01:19:28,969
Do you see me standing
here in front of you,

1651
01:19:30,136 --> 01:19:31,308
half-naked?

1652
01:19:36,559 --> 01:19:37,606
Yeah.

1653
01:19:38,019 --> 01:19:39,737
And does that

1654
01:19:40,104 --> 01:19:42,152
make you feel anything, or...

1655
01:19:42,898 --> 01:19:45,367
Come on. Are you
trying to start a fight?

1656
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:48,279
No, I'm not trying
to start a fight with you.

1657
01:19:48,362 --> 01:19:49,614
I'm trying to fuck you.

1658
01:19:49,989 --> 01:19:51,536
Oh, God, you know what?

1659
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:53,746
Today, of all days,

1660
01:19:54,118 --> 01:19:56,212
is the day you need to
cut me a break, all right?

1661
01:19:56,454 --> 01:19:57,706
Whatever.

1662
01:19:58,164 --> 01:19:59,461
Oh, God.

1663
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:04,883
What?

1664
01:20:06,172 --> 01:20:08,766
I didn't realize
it was intentional.

1665
01:20:09,342 --> 01:20:12,642
I didn't say anything because I
didn't want you to be embarrassed.

1666
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,973
I thought I was being gallant.

1667
01:20:16,557 --> 01:20:18,730
All right, fine.
I'm an asshole.

1668
01:20:19,268 --> 01:20:20,520
God.

1669
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:24,406
You know what your problem is?

1670
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:26,155
You're never,
ever in the moment.

1671
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:29,703
You're never, ever present.
You're never in your body.

1672
01:20:29,904 --> 01:20:32,999
That's not true. lam in the moment.
You know how I know?

1673
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:34,826
I want to get
the fuck out of the moment.

1674
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:38,922
I swear, I can't win with you.
I just can't do it.

1675
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:40,714
You can't just walk away.

1676
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,212
Oh, God.

1677
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:45,590
Hey! How's the record
company going, Pete?

1678
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,013
What? Not great.

1679
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:49,928
I'm still waiting
for numbers to come in.

1680
01:20:52,093 --> 01:20:53,766
What have you heard?

1681
01:20:53,928 --> 01:20:55,771
A couple numbers
have trickled in.

1682
01:20:55,888 --> 01:20:57,561
It's lower than we expected.

1683
01:21:00,017 --> 01:21:03,112
Then why are you
giving Larry money?

1684
01:21:03,562 --> 01:21:04,609
What?

1685
01:21:04,897 --> 01:21:07,116
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

1686
01:21:08,067 --> 01:21:09,944
You know what? I don't wanna
get into some nasty fight

1687
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:11,533
so can we please
talk to each other

1688
01:21:11,612 --> 01:21:13,285
the way the therapist told us
to talk to each other?

1689
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:15,074
Fine. Fine.

1690
01:21:16,283 --> 01:21:20,663
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

1691
01:21:23,457 --> 01:21:26,711
I understand it makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

1692
01:21:26,794 --> 01:21:30,219
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

1693
01:21:30,297 --> 01:21:32,766
and corner me, and try
and trick me into lying.

1694
01:21:32,883 --> 01:21:33,930
Okay-

1695
01:21:34,009 --> 01:21:37,559
It makes me sad when it's so
easy to trick you into lying,

1696
01:21:37,638 --> 01:21:39,640
because you're
such a lying shit-bag.

1697
01:21:39,932 --> 01:21:41,932
That's not... You can't do
that, you can't do that.

1698
01:21:41,934 --> 01:21:43,527
The therapist said you're
not allowed to judge me.

1699
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,813
That's not a judgment,
that's just a fact.

1700
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:48,024
Fair enough.

1701
01:21:48,232 --> 01:21:51,452
Sometimes I withhold truth,
that is true.

1702
01:21:52,069 --> 01:21:54,572
But it's only because
I'm scared to death

1703
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:58,000
of your crazy-assed,
illogical overreactions.

1704
01:21:58,284 --> 01:21:59,501
Well...

1705
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:02,588
It hurts me
inside and triggers me

1706
01:22:02,663 --> 01:22:04,631
when you're such
a dishonest shit,

1707
01:22:04,707 --> 01:22:07,335
that you're lending your father
money without telling me

1708
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:09,674
while your record
company's going bankrupt

1709
01:22:09,753 --> 01:22:12,757
and we're on the verge
of losing our fucking house!

1710
01:22:26,854 --> 01:22:28,054
What else are you lying about?

1711
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:31,784
I've taken
Viagra for two years.

1712
01:22:32,067 --> 01:22:34,365
Late six muffins
downstairs a while ago

1713
01:22:34,445 --> 01:22:36,868
and my
cholesterol level is 305.

1714
01:22:37,364 --> 01:22:39,366
My heart could
explode at any second.

1715
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:41,244
These might be my
very last words.

1716
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:45,081
Oh, and I gave Charlotte antibiotics
when you weren't looking.

1717
01:22:45,247 --> 01:22:48,717
That's why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

1718
01:22:50,753 --> 01:22:53,882
What are we even doing?
What are we doing?

1719
01:22:55,174 --> 01:22:58,269
This is not making me happy.
You're not happy.

1720
01:22:58,552 --> 01:23:02,022
You don't like me.
I can feel that.

1721
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:04,183
I'm not blind.

1722
01:23:04,892 --> 01:23:06,189
Jesus.

1723
01:23:06,727 --> 01:23:08,980
We're like business associates.

1724
01:23:09,522 --> 01:23:11,240
We're like brother and sister.

1725
01:23:11,357 --> 01:23:12,609
There's no passion there.

1726
01:23:12,775 --> 01:23:14,652
We're not like brother and sister.
You know what we're like?

1727
01:23:14,735 --> 01:23:16,157
We're like Simon and Garfunkel

1728
01:23:16,237 --> 01:23:18,160
and, somehow,
you turned me into Garfunkel.

1729
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,497
I don't even know
what that means.

1730
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:20,620
Art Garfunkel.

1731
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:24,416
What's wrong with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

1732
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:26,831
He's got an amazing voice! He
could put a harmony to anything!

1733
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:29,383
But what I'm saying is that
you turned me into him.

1734
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,047
What the hell are
you talking about?

1735
01:23:31,418 --> 01:23:32,715
Simon controls him!

1736
01:23:33,003 --> 01:23:36,598
That's because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

1737
01:23:37,258 --> 01:23:38,805
He's the better one!

1738
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:40,769
You know what? I see the
way you look at our kids.

1739
01:23:40,844 --> 01:23:43,017
You have so much
love and compassion for them.

1740
01:23:43,097 --> 01:23:45,270
You never look at
me like that. Ever.

1741
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:47,522
Would we even still be together

1742
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:49,820
if I didn't get
pregnant 14 years ago?

1743
01:23:50,187 --> 01:23:53,236
You know what? I'm not
gonna go down that road.

1744
01:23:54,024 --> 01:23:55,412
Would we?

1745
01:24:10,082 --> 01:24:11,129
Okay-

1746
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:17,386
You know what? I don't
want to have a party here.

1747
01:24:17,506 --> 01:24:18,678
You need to cancel it.

1748
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:19,846
No, I'm not.

1749
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:22,516
I already paid for the catering.
I've put down deposits.

1750
01:24:22,595 --> 01:24:25,269
And I sure as fuck am not gonna
call everybody back in two days

1751
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:26,473
when you change your mind.

1752
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:35,653
Your girlfriend is not ugly.

1753
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:39,495
Actually, Larry, she's
not my girlfriend. She's just a...

1754
01:24:39,653 --> 01:24:42,873
It's cool, buddy. You don't have
to explain your girlfriend to me.

1755
01:24:43,616 --> 01:24:46,335
Can you please stop
licking your fingers?

1756
01:24:47,911 --> 01:24:50,881
Do you know how many
germs are on your hands?

1757
01:24:51,123 --> 01:24:53,296
And you're putting
them into your mouth.

1758
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:55,132
That's gross. Stop.

1759
01:24:58,672 --> 01:24:59,764
Stop it!

1760
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:01,429
I'm gonna kill you!

1761
01:25:01,508 --> 01:25:03,260
Hey! Sadie,
enough, all right?

1762
01:25:03,344 --> 01:25:04,391
She isn't hurting anyone.

1763
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,097
You want to say something,
just keep your mouth shut.

1764
01:25:06,221 --> 01:25:07,768
You have never been nice to her

1765
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:09,488
and now she's getting
aggressive with you.

1766
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:11,780
I told you this would happen.

1767
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:21,237
I'm sick of everybody fighting.

1768
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:04,663
What do you think you're gonna
be like when you grow up?

1769
01:26:06,573 --> 01:26:08,450
I don't know. Um...

1770
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:11,916
I don't know.

1771
01:26:12,413 --> 01:26:14,586
Do you think you want kids?

1772
01:26:14,707 --> 01:26:16,175
Mm-hmm. Just one.

1773
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:17,550
Just one, why?

1774
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:22,427
Because if I have two, then the other
will fight with the other one.

1775
01:26:23,257 --> 01:26:25,806
Does it make you
sad when you fight?

1776
01:26:26,385 --> 01:26:28,934
Mm-hmm. I don't want
anyone to fight.

1777
01:26:36,478 --> 01:26:37,479
I love you.

1778
01:27:07,092 --> 01:27:10,813
Why isn't anybody talking?
Why is it so quiet?

1779
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:16,019
It's the Sounds of Silence.

1780
01:27:46,507 --> 01:27:48,100
Will you stop, Dad?

1781
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,972
How many of those
are you gonna eat?

1782
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:55,683
As many as I want.

1783
01:27:55,974 --> 01:27:57,442
I'm gonna tell Mom on you.

1784
01:27:57,559 --> 01:27:59,482
Try it. See what
you get for Christmas.

1785
01:27:59,812 --> 01:28:00,859
Nothing.

1786
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:04,692
Snitches wind up in ditches.

1787
01:28:05,025 --> 01:28:06,538
Remember that.

1788
01:28:11,698 --> 01:28:12,870
Hey, Peter.

1789
01:28:13,033 --> 01:28:14,376
Hi.
Hiya.

1790
01:28:18,705 --> 01:28:20,503
All right. See you.

1791
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,592
Have a good one.

1792
01:28:23,168 --> 01:28:24,340
Peter.

1793
01:28:24,419 --> 01:28:25,511
Peter!

1794
01:28:27,506 --> 01:28:28,553
Hi.

1795
01:28:28,799 --> 01:28:29,800
Catherine.

1796
01:28:29,883 --> 01:28:30,930
I'm Joseph's mother.

1797
01:28:31,385 --> 01:28:33,387
Oh, right. No, I know.
Hi, Catherine.

1798
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,852
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.

1799
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:37,649
Sorry.

1800
01:28:37,891 --> 01:28:39,404
Hello, Joseph.

1801
01:28:40,727 --> 01:28:43,230
I hear our kids have
been chatting online.

1802
01:28:43,564 --> 01:28:46,283
Yeah? I heard that your wife
has been screaming at my son.

1803
01:28:46,358 --> 01:28:47,985
And I don't appreciate it.
Excuse me?

1804
01:28:48,235 --> 01:28:49,908
She screamed at my son.

1805
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:53,074
Right? She threatened you. She screamed at you.
She cursed at him.

1806
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:55,451
He's 13 years old,
for God's sake.

1807
01:28:55,534 --> 01:28:57,161
What the hell is
the matter with her?

1808
01:28:57,244 --> 01:28:59,204
Okay, you better check
her meds and get 'em right.

1809
01:29:00,455 --> 01:29:03,755
Okay, you know what? Why
don't you back the fuck off?

1810
01:29:03,876 --> 01:29:06,595
Because that's my lovely, sweet
wife you're talking about.

1811
01:29:06,753 --> 01:29:08,471
Oh, I need to back off?
Yeah, you need to back off.

1812
01:29:08,589 --> 01:29:11,217
Because your kid is an animal.
He's a fucking animal.

1813
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:12,472
Why don't you
put him on a leash?

1814
01:29:12,551 --> 01:29:14,474
Turn around,
turn around, turn around!

1815
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,017
If he insults my
daughter again,

1816
01:29:16,096 --> 01:29:17,576
I'm gonna hit him
with my fucking car.

1817
01:29:17,598 --> 01:29:18,645
Got it?

1818
01:29:18,765 --> 01:29:21,029
In fact, if you insult my wife
again, you know what I'm gonna do?

1819
01:29:21,101 --> 01:29:22,899
I'm gonna show up at your
house when you're sleeping

1820
01:29:22,978 --> 01:29:25,697
and I'll take your iPad
or your iPod or your iMac

1821
01:29:25,772 --> 01:29:27,445
and I'll shove them
up your fucking iCunt.

1822
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:30,444
I got nothing to lose.
Your kid is the problem.

1823
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:32,329
My kid is a fucking angel.
Turn around.

1824
01:29:32,738 --> 01:29:34,240
I don't have
time for this shit.

1825
01:29:34,573 --> 01:29:37,622
So I'm keeping it together, but if
I wasn't at school right now...

1826
01:29:39,286 --> 01:29:41,334
Touch my... Touch me?

1827
01:29:41,788 --> 01:29:43,631
I didn't touch your...
You touched my upper breast.

1828
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:45,880
I didn't. I didn't. I got
right below your shoulder.

1829
01:29:45,959 --> 01:29:48,712
You got right here. You actually...
He hit my nipple.

1830
01:29:48,795 --> 01:29:49,842
You what?

1831
01:29:49,922 --> 01:29:51,014
You're insane.

1832
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:52,932
Why would you do that? Did you
just touch my mom's nipple?

1833
01:29:53,008 --> 01:29:55,477
He just touched my nipple.
Why would you do that to me?

1834
01:29:55,594 --> 01:29:56,720
I poked you on the shoulder.

1835
01:29:56,803 --> 01:29:58,146
I have very high nipples.

1836
01:29:58,388 --> 01:29:59,389
I touched your shirt.

1837
01:29:59,473 --> 01:30:00,873
What do you think
is under my shirt?

1838
01:30:00,933 --> 01:30:02,310
I just... My breasts
are under my shirt.

1839
01:30:02,351 --> 01:30:04,103
Your shoulder. Your shoulder.
He just touched my breast.

1840
01:30:04,311 --> 01:30:06,985
Well, that's a funny place to
put a shoulder, on my boob.

1841
01:30:07,147 --> 01:30:09,195
Hello? There are
children around.

1842
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:12,240
This isn't over. This is not over.
You're gonna be sorry.

1843
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:14,321
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1844
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,158
And why the fuck
would you believe Desi?

1845
01:30:17,366 --> 01:30:19,164
You just admitted it.

1846
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:20,661
Did I?

1847
01:30:20,744 --> 01:30:25,341
You stole $12,000 from me, Jodi,
and I need you to pay me back.

1848
01:30:25,499 --> 01:30:27,752
Could you at least
give me a referral?

1849
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:31,509
You babysat my kids
while you were on OxyContin.

1850
01:30:31,588 --> 01:30:32,680
Oxycodone.

1851
01:30:32,839 --> 01:30:34,011
Well, oxycodone.

1852
01:30:34,091 --> 01:30:35,217
Oxy cotton .

1853
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:36,389
OxyContin?

1854
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,511
Oxykitten.

1855
01:30:37,594 --> 01:30:38,846
What's Oxykitten?

1856
01:30:39,262 --> 01:30:40,263
Meow.

1857
01:30:40,347 --> 01:30:44,318
Jodi, you put me in danger.
Me and my family.

1858
01:30:44,518 --> 01:30:46,361
It was a cry for help.

1859
01:30:46,687 --> 01:30:48,815
Help. Help.

1860
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:50,949
Why don't you help me?

1861
01:30:51,358 --> 01:30:53,326
Why don't you help me?
Just help.

1862
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,911
Just help.

1863
01:30:58,198 --> 01:30:59,541
You didn't help me.

1864
01:30:59,825 --> 01:31:01,327
Are you high right now?

1865
01:31:01,493 --> 01:31:03,416
Help me.

1866
01:31:06,248 --> 01:31:08,797
Is that about me?
Is that the cops?

1867
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:10,423
Is this a set-up?

1868
01:31:10,502 --> 01:31:11,754
I need to go.

1869
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,467
Okay, see you later.

1870
01:31:14,756 --> 01:31:16,804
Fuck you, Debbie.

1871
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:18,514
Fuck you.

1872
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:22,598
Joseph was very upset when
I spoke to him about this.

1873
01:31:23,389 --> 01:31:26,108
So I thought it
was important that we

1874
01:31:26,893 --> 01:31:28,440
join together and
work this through.

1875
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,692
Absolutely.

1876
01:31:30,104 --> 01:31:32,573
We're gonna work through it,

1877
01:31:32,648 --> 01:31:36,198
but Debbie told my son that
he looked like Tom Petty,

1878
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:37,866
in a negative way.

1879
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:40,373
Who's Tom Petty? You
know who Tom Petty is.

1880
01:31:41,282 --> 01:31:44,752
And she said that if she had to
come back that she was going to...

1881
01:31:44,952 --> 01:31:48,707
"F" up his pussy-ass,
which is what she said.

1882
01:31:48,789 --> 01:31:49,915
Oh, my...

1883
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:51,543
Are you serious?

1884
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:55,012
I didn't. I would never.
To a child?

1885
01:31:55,754 --> 01:32:00,726
Your son has been defiling my daughter's
Facebook page now for months.

1886
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,762
These people are liars.

1887
01:32:02,928 --> 01:32:04,646
He said that my
son was an animal

1888
01:32:04,722 --> 01:32:06,440
and that if I didn't
keep him on a leash,

1889
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:08,317
that he would hit
him with his car.

1890
01:32:08,767 --> 01:32:10,030
Did you say that?

1891
01:32:10,102 --> 01:32:11,274
That's ridiculous.

1892
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,942
Who talks like that?
You do.

1893
01:32:13,105 --> 01:32:14,948
He didn't say that.
He said it to me.

1894
01:32:15,024 --> 01:32:18,904
No. What I said was that we need
to keep an extra eye on our kids

1895
01:32:18,986 --> 01:32:21,660
because with all
the technological advances,

1896
01:32:21,739 --> 01:32:23,833
they need to learn to
use them responsibly.

1897
01:32:23,949 --> 01:32:27,294
No. What he said to me was...
He called me an iCunt.

1898
01:32:27,453 --> 01:32:28,750
A what? Language, Catherine!
Language.

1899
01:32:28,829 --> 01:32:29,876
I'm quoting!

1900
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,343
How am I gonna relay

1901
01:32:31,415 --> 01:32:34,134
what these two nutballs
said to me, unless I say it?

1902
01:32:34,585 --> 01:32:36,212
Can you please not
talk like that, Catherine?

1903
01:32:36,295 --> 01:32:37,717
Music Man is
rehearsing next door.

1904
01:32:37,796 --> 01:32:39,844
Sorry, fucking Music Man.

1905
01:32:40,132 --> 01:32:43,386
Maybe if I looked more like
this fake bullshit couple.

1906
01:32:43,469 --> 01:32:45,062
Looks like they're
in a bank commercial.

1907
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:46,392
That's what you look like.

1908
01:32:46,513 --> 01:32:48,777
Like you're a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

1909
01:32:48,974 --> 01:32:51,568
None of this
talk is productive.

1910
01:32:51,644 --> 01:32:54,648
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

1911
01:32:54,772 --> 01:32:57,651
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

1912
01:32:57,983 --> 01:32:59,860
You're just really scaring me.

1913
01:32:59,943 --> 01:33:01,786
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

1914
01:33:01,987 --> 01:33:04,206
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

1915
01:33:04,365 --> 01:33:05,662
I'll chew through you.

1916
01:33:05,824 --> 01:33:07,246
Catherine,
you're better than this.

1917
01:33:07,326 --> 01:33:09,920
Fuck you, Jill. You're a
horrible fucking woman.

1918
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,168
This is why everybody
hates you, Jill.

1919
01:33:12,247 --> 01:33:16,673
This kind of shit. Ineffective.
Fucking bullshit hair.

1920
01:33:17,961 --> 01:33:20,100
And I'm glad your husband died.

1921
01:33:20,255 --> 01:33:23,179
Because you're a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

1922
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:26,304
Okay, Catherine, I think we
know what's happening now.

1923
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:29,268
Now you know what
we're dealing with.

1924
01:34:12,474 --> 01:34:14,442
I'm not gonna eat that chicken.

1925
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,777
Why not?

1926
01:34:16,603 --> 01:34:18,697
Because I feel like I'm
gonna be a vegetarian.

1927
01:34:18,856 --> 01:34:21,200
Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow?
Uh-uh.

1928
01:34:21,275 --> 01:34:23,778
You guys
have been reading my texts?

1929
01:34:24,278 --> 01:34:26,121
No, we haven't.
Yes, we have.

1930
01:34:26,196 --> 01:34:27,948
We're supposed to
keep an eye on you.

1931
01:34:28,073 --> 01:34:29,120
How did you find out?

1932
01:34:29,324 --> 01:34:32,328
Joseph told me that you flipped
out on him and his mom.

1933
01:34:32,494 --> 01:34:34,542
And you guys are nuts,
and I agree.

1934
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,582
All right, you know what?
Don't be disrespectful.

1935
01:34:36,707 --> 01:34:38,334
You're the ones
who are disrespectful.

1936
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:40,590
Reading my texts is like
reading my diary.

1937
01:34:40,669 --> 01:34:42,842
And you were really
sweet on your iChats.

1938
01:34:42,921 --> 01:34:43,922
We were really proud of you.

1939
01:34:44,006 --> 01:34:46,179
Yeah, we were going to give you
your computer and phone back.

1940
01:34:46,258 --> 01:34:47,305
FUCK you!

1941
01:34:47,926 --> 01:34:50,315
Okay, there's the first
official "fuck you."

1942
01:34:50,387 --> 01:34:53,231
Okay, that is not how we talk
to each other in this house.

1943
01:34:53,307 --> 01:34:56,607
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time.

1944
01:34:56,769 --> 01:35:00,399
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

1945
01:35:00,731 --> 01:35:04,281
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

1946
01:35:04,526 --> 01:35:05,789
Shut up, Charlotte.

1947
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:10,700
You guys so desperately want me to be
so perfect and to make no mistakes.

1948
01:35:10,783 --> 01:35:12,626
Well, you two
are fucking insane.

1949
01:35:12,826 --> 01:35:13,873
Okay-

1950
01:35:13,952 --> 01:35:16,956
All you do is fight, or you don't
fight, which is even worse

1951
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:19,079
because it looks like you
hate each other for weeks.

1952
01:35:19,374 --> 01:35:21,672
You obsess over
every little thing I do,

1953
01:35:21,919 --> 01:35:24,047
and you don't trust
in me or believe in me.

1954
01:35:24,129 --> 01:35:25,642
Well, I'm fucking sick of it.

1955
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:29,310
Yeah, I said "fuck."
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1956
01:35:29,635 --> 01:35:33,230
Ground me forever, I don't care.
I don't care about anything.

1957
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:36,691
I hate everything.

1958
01:35:37,142 --> 01:35:40,737
Everyone's going crazy. I don't
care if I have no friends.

1959
01:35:41,563 --> 01:35:43,565
Are you still upset about Lost?

1960
01:35:43,649 --> 01:35:45,196
Of course I'm upset about Lost!

1961
01:35:45,275 --> 01:35:48,905
You guys took away my shit before I
could watch the last two episodes.

1962
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:51,915
And I don't know
what the fuck happened!

1963
01:35:56,078 --> 01:35:58,001
She's becoming just like us.

1964
01:35:58,997 --> 01:36:03,093
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

1965
01:36:16,056 --> 01:36:17,353
Where did you find this?

1966
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:19,529
I stole it.

1967
01:36:25,232 --> 01:36:26,575
Thank you.

1968
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:29,532
No big deal.

1969
01:36:33,031 --> 01:36:35,033
Our kids are fucking crazy.

1970
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,713
And it's our fault.

1971
01:36:36,994 --> 01:36:39,793
Do you think there's anything we
can do to turn it around, or...

1972
01:36:40,163 --> 01:36:42,916
Sadie's 13. She might
be a lost cause.

1973
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:45,168
Where did she learn
that kind of language?

1974
01:36:45,252 --> 01:36:46,629
We don't talk like that.

1975
01:36:46,712 --> 01:36:47,929
I have no fucking idea.

1976
01:36:48,547 --> 01:36:51,300
Do you think Sadie
is this crazy because of us

1977
01:36:51,383 --> 01:36:54,011
or is it hormones and Lost?

1978
01:36:54,469 --> 01:36:55,891
J. J. Abrams.

1979
01:36:56,388 --> 01:36:58,561
He's ruining our daughter.
Yeah.

1980
01:36:59,016 --> 01:37:00,609
That fucking geek.

1981
01:37:00,809 --> 01:37:03,562
I feel bad for us.
I feel bad for us.

1982
01:37:03,729 --> 01:37:07,074
All of a sudden, we're like
a magnet for negativity.

1983
01:37:07,524 --> 01:37:09,697
Why do people
keep attacking us?

1984
01:37:10,193 --> 01:37:13,333
What did we do?
We're just doing our best.

1985
01:37:14,114 --> 01:37:15,354
Should we talk about our fight?

1986
01:37:15,908 --> 01:37:17,706
I think we're
under enough pressure.

1987
01:37:17,784 --> 01:37:20,628
Let's just let
it go, this time.

1988
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:22,463
Yeah.

1989
01:37:22,748 --> 01:37:24,091
We can give each other a break.

1990
01:37:24,207 --> 01:37:26,175
All right, great.
Thank you.

1991
01:37:26,293 --> 01:37:28,842
And I'm sorry about my dad.
You're right.

1992
01:37:30,255 --> 01:37:34,226
I'm sorry that he's just
an endless mooch.

1993
01:37:35,302 --> 01:37:37,930
The truth is that
this isn't about us.

1994
01:37:38,263 --> 01:37:39,731
It's about our parents.

1995
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:42,393
We're not even mad at each other.
We're mad at them.

1996
01:37:42,476 --> 01:37:44,228
Exactly. Exactly.

1997
01:37:44,519 --> 01:37:47,614
Let's just take away our
parents' power by loving them.

1998
01:37:48,523 --> 01:37:49,615
Can we do that?

1999
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:51,284
Yes.

2000
01:37:51,526 --> 01:37:52,618
Thank God.

2001
01:37:53,362 --> 01:37:55,456
I kind of feel
better already, do you?

2002
01:37:55,781 --> 01:37:57,203
Do you?
I do.

2003
01:37:57,366 --> 01:37:59,164
I love you.
I love you, too.

2004
01:38:03,205 --> 01:38:05,958
It's not us, it's them.

2005
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:07,627
Totally.

2006
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:21,223
What are you doing? We have
to get ready for the party.

2007
01:38:21,306 --> 01:38:24,025
I just watched
the last episode of Lost.

2008
01:38:25,769 --> 01:38:26,861
Okay-

2009
01:38:27,312 --> 01:38:30,191
You know what? We don't have
time for this right now.

2010
01:38:30,315 --> 01:38:31,715
We have a lot of
people coming over.

2011
01:38:31,817 --> 01:38:33,114
They're all dead.

2012
01:38:33,652 --> 01:38:34,653
What?

2013
01:38:35,153 --> 01:38:38,657
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...

2014
01:38:38,865 --> 01:38:42,005
I don't care about the show right now.
Jin, Sun...

2015
01:38:42,202 --> 01:38:44,751
Okay? I need you to just get
in the shower, get dressed.

2016
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:46,047
Let's just put it on hold.
Walt, Juliet...

2017
01:38:46,331 --> 01:38:47,958
All those people.

2018
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:49,422
Don't think about Lost today.

2019
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:52,505
Tomorrow, Lost, all day.
I can't wait to hear about it.

2020
01:38:52,713 --> 01:38:56,013
Jack? No way, really?
Right now, shower.

2021
01:38:56,216 --> 01:38:58,685
I don't make fun of
your stupid Mad Men.

2022
01:38:59,011 --> 01:39:01,230
First of all, I don't get
worked up over Mad Men.

2023
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:02,932
That's because Mad Men sucks.

2024
01:39:03,015 --> 01:39:04,938
What Don Draper
has gone through

2025
01:39:05,017 --> 01:39:08,021
beats whatever Jack is running
from on some fucking island.

2026
01:39:08,103 --> 01:39:10,902
Bunch of people smoking in an office.
It's stupid.

2027
01:39:11,314 --> 01:39:13,191
You're getting me off topic.

2028
01:39:13,274 --> 01:39:15,322
Just, please, get dressed.

2029
01:39:20,031 --> 01:39:21,783
Hello.
Hi.

2030
01:39:21,866 --> 01:39:23,163
I'm glad you're here.

2031
01:39:23,284 --> 01:39:25,161
I need a buffer
in case it gets weird.

2032
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:27,212
Oh, well, I'm ready to buff.

2033
01:39:27,705 --> 01:39:29,673
Grab these napkins.
Let's buff. Okay.

2034
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:36,673
So, that's the girl
who works for you.

2035
01:39:36,839 --> 01:39:39,137
Yeah. That's her.
Works for Debbie.

2036
01:39:39,217 --> 01:39:40,685
She seems nice.

2037
01:39:40,885 --> 01:39:43,183
My wife would never let me
have a hot employee like that.

2038
01:39:43,346 --> 01:39:44,393
Yeah?
No.

2039
01:39:44,555 --> 01:39:46,273
Every woman who works for us

2040
01:39:46,474 --> 01:39:49,774
looks like they've been in some
kind of horrible accident.

2041
01:39:50,603 --> 01:39:53,106
I'm taking control,
and now you're my slave.

2042
01:39:54,899 --> 01:39:57,527
Are you comfortable with that
around your husband?

2043
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,034
Oh. Pete wouldn't know
what to do with that.

2044
01:40:01,405 --> 01:40:03,032
Do you think our wives are
looking at us right now?

2045
01:40:03,115 --> 01:40:04,503
Oh, definitely.
Yeah.

2046
01:40:04,909 --> 01:40:06,957
They look like pedophiles.

2047
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,844
Thank you. The girls are
so excited you're here.

2048
01:40:14,919 --> 01:40:15,966
They're all outside.

2049
01:40:16,045 --> 01:40:17,388
Hi.
Hi.

2050
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:19,548
Hey, how are you?
How are you, man?

2051
01:40:19,673 --> 01:40:20,811
Good to see you.

2052
01:40:20,883 --> 01:40:22,135
Happy birthday, Pete.

2053
01:40:22,218 --> 01:40:23,344
How wonderful to see you.

2054
01:40:23,427 --> 01:40:24,599
Thank you, Grandma Molly.

2055
01:40:24,678 --> 01:40:25,770
You're wonderful.

2056
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:29,651
And look at my gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous.

2057
01:40:29,892 --> 01:40:32,520
No, I get that. I'm just
wondering why I should do it.

2058
01:40:32,686 --> 01:40:33,687
Pete, Jason's here.

2059
01:40:33,771 --> 01:40:34,818
Peter, hi.

2060
01:40:35,147 --> 01:40:36,239
Hey, how's it going, Jason?

2061
01:40:36,315 --> 01:40:38,033
You look well.
Thank you.

2062
01:40:38,317 --> 01:40:40,277
How do you like what I've
been doing to your girl?

2063
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:42,037
How you like
Debbie's "after" body?

2064
01:40:42,321 --> 01:40:43,447
It's nice.
Come on. Show him.

2065
01:40:44,156 --> 01:40:45,829
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

2066
01:40:45,908 --> 01:40:48,878
Look at that "after" ass.
Now, it starts here.

2067
01:40:49,453 --> 01:40:51,501
But it used to start here.

2068
01:40:51,997 --> 01:40:53,795
And I brought it up.

2069
01:40:54,834 --> 01:40:56,302
You're welcome.

2070
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,337
So, are you a trainer?

2071
01:40:58,921 --> 01:41:00,514
Yes.
Oh.

2072
01:41:00,714 --> 01:41:04,093
But not just physical. Spiritual.
I'm sort of a guide.

2073
01:41:04,218 --> 01:41:08,394
Mm-hmm. You guys should talk.
I think you'll get along.

2074
01:41:09,974 --> 01:41:10,975
Come here, honey.
I gotta tell you something.

2075
01:41:11,058 --> 01:41:12,150
Yeah.

2076
01:41:21,443 --> 01:41:23,116
Who's that in the pool?
Mine.

2077
01:41:26,657 --> 01:41:28,455
Hello.
Hello, Debbie.

2078
01:41:28,534 --> 01:41:29,831
How are you?
Good.

2079
01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:32,079
Remember my husband, Pete?

2080
01:41:32,246 --> 01:41:35,500
Oh, right. I didn't recognize
you with the long hair.

2081
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:38,006
Oh, yeah.
I've been growing it.

2082
01:41:38,169 --> 01:41:39,421
Happy birthday.

2083
01:41:39,503 --> 01:41:41,016
Thank you so much.

2084
01:41:41,088 --> 01:41:42,180
Very old Scotch.

2085
01:41:42,256 --> 01:41:43,974
Wow. You know...

2086
01:41:44,133 --> 01:41:45,385
I hope it hasn't expired.

2087
01:41:46,969 --> 01:41:49,017
No, Scotch doesn't expire.

2088
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:51,228
It improves with age.

2089
01:41:52,975 --> 01:41:55,694
Yeah. No, I know.
Thank you so...

2090
01:41:55,811 --> 01:41:57,905
That's nice. Come on in. Sure.

2091
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,027
Sorry.

2092
01:42:02,276 --> 01:42:05,120
So, what do you do
in Chino, Oliver?

2093
01:42:05,196 --> 01:42:06,197
I'm a surgeon.

2094
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,702
Wow. What kind?
That's great.

2095
01:42:08,574 --> 01:42:10,372
Mainly of the spine.

2096
01:42:10,701 --> 01:42:13,921
My specialty is
scoliosis surgery.

2097
01:42:14,205 --> 01:42:17,960
My mom used to talk to me
like I had scoliosis

2098
01:42:18,042 --> 01:42:20,670
because I'm a little hunchy,
but that's a different thing.

2099
01:42:20,878 --> 01:42:22,551
Well, you definitely
don't look right.

2100
01:42:22,713 --> 01:42:24,090
Hey!
Hey!

2101
01:42:24,423 --> 01:42:25,891
Sorry we're late.

2102
01:42:25,966 --> 01:42:27,889
I was in the lab,
cloning myself.

2103
01:42:28,219 --> 01:42:30,096
We're gonna have
another seven tomorrow.

2104
01:42:30,387 --> 01:42:33,482
We cut their hair differently, so
we can finally tell who they are.

2105
01:42:33,557 --> 01:42:35,400
You like the new
haircut, Travis?

2106
01:42:35,601 --> 01:42:36,944
I'm Jack, damn it!

2107
01:42:37,019 --> 01:42:38,612
Oh. Of course.

2108
01:42:38,729 --> 01:42:40,356
Larry, this is my father.

2109
01:42:40,898 --> 01:42:42,696
Really? How are you?

2110
01:42:44,026 --> 01:42:45,494
Oliver.
Oliver?

2111
01:42:46,153 --> 01:42:47,996
"Can I have some more?"

2112
01:42:48,072 --> 01:42:50,746
"Please, Oliver?
I need a little more, sir."

2113
01:42:50,824 --> 01:42:54,078
I love that movie. You must
get that all the time.

2114
01:42:54,328 --> 01:42:56,376
Not really. JACK: My
nose itches right here.

2115
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:59,208
I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm
Claire and I'm Larry's wife.

2116
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:02,170
Very nice to see you,
but I'm gonna go get the kids.

2117
01:43:02,503 --> 01:43:05,097
We won't see her
now for the whole day.

2118
01:43:05,256 --> 01:43:07,600
I'd help, honey, but you know
I got the blood pressure,

2119
01:43:07,675 --> 01:43:08,767
and I don't want to.

2120
01:43:09,093 --> 01:43:10,174
Can I get you a drink, Dad?

2121
01:43:10,177 --> 01:43:11,645
Yeah, a little white wine.

2122
01:43:11,887 --> 01:43:12,979
White wine?
Yeah.

2123
01:43:13,097 --> 01:43:14,644
Heavy stuff.
Yeah.

2124
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:18,068
So, who knew that
Debbie had a dad?

2125
01:43:18,435 --> 01:43:20,312
Where have you
been for 15 years?

2126
01:43:20,396 --> 01:43:24,196
Never seen you at Hanukah or
Christmas or Ramadan, nothing.

2127
01:43:24,275 --> 01:43:26,528
How you get out of all that stuff?
Do you have a wife?

2128
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:28,203
Yeah, my wife's at home.

2129
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:29,496
Why didn't she come?

2130
01:43:29,571 --> 01:43:31,835
Uh, construction.
They're sanding our deck.

2131
01:43:31,991 --> 01:43:33,459
You let the woman
sand the deck?

2132
01:43:33,784 --> 01:43:35,252
She supervises it. Yes.

2133
01:43:35,786 --> 01:43:36,833
Okay-

2134
01:43:36,954 --> 01:43:37,955
Hey, guys.

2135
01:43:38,038 --> 01:43:41,918
Hey! Look how big
the kids are!

2136
01:43:42,293 --> 01:43:43,715
Sadie!

2137
01:43:44,795 --> 01:43:46,593
Hi, Larry.
Hi, Sadie.

2138
01:43:47,131 --> 01:43:49,884
Mom. Who's Oliver?

2139
01:43:50,092 --> 01:43:51,139
What do you mean?

2140
01:43:51,635 --> 01:43:52,682
Is he your dad?

2141
01:43:52,803 --> 01:43:55,056
Is he my...
He's my biological father.

2142
01:43:56,473 --> 01:43:57,816
What does that mean?

2143
01:43:58,309 --> 01:44:01,438
It means that my mom,
Grandma...

2144
01:44:01,603 --> 01:44:04,652
He and my mom had a baby,
and that was me.

2145
01:44:04,982 --> 01:44:06,655
Oh, so you're our grandpa?

2146
01:44:07,735 --> 01:44:09,362
Well, why don't
you ask your mother?

2147
01:44:09,486 --> 01:44:11,329
Yeah. I guess so.

2148
01:44:11,405 --> 01:44:13,578
Then that would make him
your grandfather then, yes.

2149
01:44:13,782 --> 01:44:14,999
Do you want him to be?

2150
01:44:15,075 --> 01:44:16,918
Yes, then we get
another grandpa.

2151
01:44:16,994 --> 01:44:18,211
Come on.

2152
01:44:18,287 --> 01:44:19,288
Well...

2153
01:44:19,705 --> 01:44:22,083
Another grandpa.
Trampoline time.

2154
01:44:24,126 --> 01:44:26,345
That was deeply uncomfortable.

2155
01:44:27,588 --> 01:44:31,218
At least that pretty girl was
here to divert our attention.

2156
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,617
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

2157
01:44:49,818 --> 01:44:51,491
Me, oh, my.
I did not see you there.

2158
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:53,083
Hi.
I saw you there.

2159
01:44:53,197 --> 01:44:56,167
Did you guys come together?
Are you a couple?

2160
01:44:58,243 --> 01:45:00,507
No, we didn't come together.
No, absolutely not.

2161
01:45:00,996 --> 01:45:04,216
I'm sorry, I thought...
The mustache is a little...

2162
01:45:04,416 --> 01:45:06,510
- Mmm. That's fair.
- I just assumed.

2163
01:45:06,585 --> 01:45:08,679
This is
a straight-man mustache.

2164
01:45:08,879 --> 01:45:12,383
What is the difference between
a gay man's mustache

2165
01:45:12,758 --> 01:45:14,226
and a straight man's mustache?

2166
01:45:14,385 --> 01:45:15,728
The smell.

2167
01:45:18,889 --> 01:45:20,402
Uh, excuse me.

2168
01:45:26,647 --> 01:45:28,399
So, spinal surgery.

2169
01:45:28,482 --> 01:45:32,658
It just seems to me to be at
the top of the surgery chain.

2170
01:45:32,861 --> 01:45:35,910
Well, we're not
cardio, we're not neuro,

2171
01:45:36,407 --> 01:45:40,037
but I like to think we're an
important part of the spectrum.

2172
01:45:40,244 --> 01:45:42,121
Do you operate every single day?
Most days.

2173
01:45:42,287 --> 01:45:43,425
Multiple times a day?

2174
01:45:43,747 --> 01:45:44,839
Three, four times.

2175
01:45:45,374 --> 01:45:48,423
So, what's the price range?
Like, if I wanted a...

2176
01:45:48,919 --> 01:45:50,671
I'd rather not say.

2177
01:45:51,088 --> 01:45:53,637
It's so big,
you're embarrassed to say.

2178
01:45:53,924 --> 01:45:55,437
I wouldn't say "embarrassed."

2179
01:45:55,592 --> 01:45:57,765
Are there hunchbacks today?
Of course.

2180
01:45:57,845 --> 01:45:58,937
I've never seen one.

2181
01:45:59,012 --> 01:46:01,231
Well, that's because
there are spinal surgeons.

2182
01:46:01,348 --> 01:46:02,349
That's because of you.

2183
01:46:02,433 --> 01:46:04,231
Each time I don't
see a hunchback,

2184
01:46:04,309 --> 01:46:05,777
you're getting
that much richer.

2185
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:08,773
You like The Beatles,
don't you?

2186
01:46:10,065 --> 01:46:11,191
Who doesn't like The Beatles?
Nobody.

2187
01:46:11,275 --> 01:46:12,276
No, nobody.

2188
01:46:13,152 --> 01:46:15,996
So funny. You're so funny.

2189
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,748
What is your sun sign?

2190
01:46:18,198 --> 01:46:19,541
Libra.
Oh, boy.

2191
01:46:19,616 --> 01:46:21,209
That's not good.
No, sir.

2192
01:46:21,285 --> 01:46:23,045
That's not good. Not for
me, that's not good.

2193
01:46:23,078 --> 01:46:24,921
Sexually, we're
completely incompatible.

2194
01:46:24,997 --> 01:46:26,214
That's not true.
Right?

2195
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:27,291
That's such a shame.

2196
01:46:27,374 --> 01:46:29,251
Yeah, it's as bad as it gets.

2197
01:46:29,334 --> 01:46:30,961
You don't know.
What is yours?

2198
01:46:31,587 --> 01:46:32,634
I'm a Cancer.

2199
01:46:34,214 --> 01:46:35,431
Really?
Is that good?

2200
01:46:35,507 --> 01:46:36,679
Wow.
What does it mean?

2201
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:37,958
That's kind of strange.
Well...

2202
01:46:38,135 --> 01:46:41,514
Taurus and Cancers are, sort
of, soul mates of the Zodiac.

2203
01:46:41,805 --> 01:46:43,807
We're, like,
perfectly compatible.

2204
01:46:43,891 --> 01:46:46,815
And I balance what you lack and
you make up for what I lack.

2205
01:46:46,894 --> 01:46:51,650
And a quiet Cancer almost
always has a huge penis.

2206
01:46:53,317 --> 01:46:56,036
You're making me embarrassed.
Thank you.

2207
01:46:56,653 --> 01:46:57,654
Thank you.

2208
01:46:57,988 --> 01:46:58,989
No. Fantastic.

2209
01:46:59,156 --> 01:47:00,999
Oh, I wanted to make a toast.

2210
01:47:01,533 --> 01:47:04,503
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you so much.

2211
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:06,497
Pete's turning 40.

2212
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:07,627
Weird.

2213
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:11,339
And we're ready to start this new
phase of our lives with open hearts.

2214
01:47:11,668 --> 01:47:15,468
Ready to just choose joy
and forgive everybody.

2215
01:47:16,298 --> 01:47:18,050
So, thank you all for coming.

2216
01:47:19,092 --> 01:47:20,844
Wait. Forgive who?

2217
01:47:21,512 --> 01:47:23,856
I think she just
means in a general sense.

2218
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:26,650
You know, just put
the past behind us...

2219
01:47:27,059 --> 01:47:28,180
And live without resentment.

2220
01:47:28,352 --> 01:47:30,775
But, specifically,
who are you forgiving?

2221
01:47:30,896 --> 01:47:34,116
I just like to know the details
before I make a toast.

2222
01:47:34,358 --> 01:47:38,864
Right. You and my dad
and, you know, others.

2223
01:47:40,489 --> 01:47:41,536
I see.

2224
01:47:43,242 --> 01:47:45,836
Well, I know you have
some issues with me,

2225
01:47:45,911 --> 01:47:47,959
but I'm curious,
what's he in for?

2226
01:47:48,038 --> 01:47:50,291
Before today, nobody
even knew he existed.

2227
01:47:50,374 --> 01:47:52,797
Well, my parents divorced
when I was really young

2228
01:47:52,876 --> 01:47:55,720
and we don't spend much time together
and I'd like to work on that.

2229
01:47:55,837 --> 01:47:59,216
Just like we
would like to work on

2230
01:48:00,467 --> 01:48:03,391
how you have financial issues.

2231
01:48:03,554 --> 01:48:06,182
She's talking about all the
lending and the borrowing and...

2232
01:48:06,306 --> 01:48:08,229
I know what she meant.

2233
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:13,531
You are a beautiful woman, but
you are not totally maxed out.

2234
01:48:13,814 --> 01:48:15,816
I would say,
honestly, you're a six.

2235
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:17,742
Oh.
A six-and-a-half.

2236
01:48:18,485 --> 01:48:20,408
I could make you an 11.
Really?

2237
01:48:20,487 --> 01:48:22,535
When I found Deb, she was a 7.

2238
01:48:22,823 --> 01:48:24,040
And now she's a 12.

2239
01:48:24,157 --> 01:48:25,909
I wanna be a 12.

2240
01:48:26,118 --> 01:48:27,870
You can't be lazy.
I don't wanna be lazy.

2241
01:48:27,995 --> 01:48:30,123
Look at me.
You cannot be lazy.

2242
01:48:30,372 --> 01:48:31,464
I won't be lazy.

2243
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,337
Do you know how she got her body?
How?

2244
01:48:33,417 --> 01:48:35,169
Bodies by Jason.
Wow.

2245
01:48:35,252 --> 01:48:36,925
Say it.
Bodies by Jason.

2246
01:48:37,254 --> 01:48:39,222
Say it again.
Bodies by Jason.

2247
01:48:39,423 --> 01:48:41,016
"And now " gust say,  Jason
Jason.

2248
01:48:41,258 --> 01:48:42,384
Again.
Jason.

2249
01:48:42,467 --> 01:48:43,667
That sounds right, doesn't it?

2250
01:48:44,386 --> 01:48:45,433
Yeah.

2251
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:50,188
What the fuck is
happening right now?

2252
01:48:51,059 --> 01:48:53,107
When was the last time you two
saw each other? I'm curious.

2253
01:48:53,228 --> 01:48:55,481
Actually, we had lunch
together last week. Uh-huh.

2254
01:48:55,689 --> 01:48:56,736
And before that?

2255
01:48:57,065 --> 01:48:58,453
It's been about seven years.

2256
01:48:58,692 --> 01:49:00,911
Seven years?
That's a joke, right?

2257
01:49:00,986 --> 01:49:02,112
That's like two Olympics.

2258
01:49:02,487 --> 01:49:03,579
But I'm the bad guy.

2259
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,827
All right, Dad.

2260
01:49:04,906 --> 01:49:09,412
What Debbie doesn't understand is
it's not bad to help out a parent.

2261
01:49:09,494 --> 01:49:12,498
And it's certainly not bad for
a parent to help out a child.

2262
01:49:12,873 --> 01:49:14,671
I'm sure Oliver would agree.
Well...

2263
01:49:14,791 --> 01:49:15,917
Are you really
doing this right now?

2264
01:49:16,001 --> 01:49:18,049
Am I doing what?
I didn't start the toast.

2265
01:49:18,253 --> 01:49:20,301
Are you really about to
hit up my dad for money?

2266
01:49:20,505 --> 01:49:22,473
What? He does four
operations a day.

2267
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:24,343
It's perfect.
It helps everybody

2268
01:49:24,426 --> 01:49:27,179
and it relieves his guilt from
all the abandonment issues.

2269
01:49:27,304 --> 01:49:29,807
You can't buy forgiveness.
Right, Pete?

2270
01:49:30,432 --> 01:49:32,992
I don't think anyone is looking for handouts.
I mean, you know...

2271
01:49:33,769 --> 01:49:34,986
We'd pay him back.

2272
01:49:35,062 --> 01:49:38,362
If you two are in a bind, I'd
be more than happy to help.

2273
01:49:39,107 --> 01:49:42,486
No. It's not good to borrow
money from family members

2274
01:49:42,861 --> 01:49:46,115
because it causes resentment.
Remember?

2275
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:47,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2276
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:51,378
What do you want me to do? Okay.
Admit that my life is shit?

2277
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:53,167
Is that what you want
me to say? You happy?

2278
01:49:53,246 --> 01:49:56,716
Aren't I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to have?

2279
01:49:57,501 --> 01:50:00,471
You have never once stopped
asking us for money.

2280
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:02,844
Family helps family.

2281
01:50:03,006 --> 01:50:04,679
It's true.
Family helps family.

2282
01:50:05,676 --> 01:50:08,646
Look, I don't expect
you to fully understand.

2283
01:50:09,137 --> 01:50:11,139
Your dad left.
You're broken inside.

2284
01:50:11,223 --> 01:50:13,021
It's not your fault
you can't feel love.

2285
01:50:13,433 --> 01:50:15,435
There's something
that you can't...

2286
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,772
This is coming out wrong.

2287
01:50:19,398 --> 01:50:22,197
You know what? I would rather
have my dad than your dad.

2288
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:24,778
Because he
doesn't drive me crazy.

2289
01:50:24,861 --> 01:50:26,829
You know what's the best
quality my father has?

2290
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:28,623
Is he asks for nothing.

2291
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,544
I don't know what the fuck
he's thinking right now.

2292
01:50:32,911 --> 01:50:35,881
Look at that.
Nothing. Nothing.

2293
01:50:36,123 --> 01:50:37,249
I don't even know him.

2294
01:50:37,332 --> 01:50:40,882
And I turned out perfectly
fine without his input, okay?

2295
01:50:41,503 --> 01:50:45,258
I just figured out
what your problem is.

2296
01:50:45,882 --> 01:50:47,270
You hate Jews.

2297
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,813
Which is so odd because
your children are Jewish.

2298
01:50:50,887 --> 01:50:52,275
Don't play the Jew card, Larry.

2299
01:50:52,431 --> 01:50:54,809
I'm not playing any Jew card.
Seriously, it's used up.

2300
01:50:54,891 --> 01:50:57,986
You can't use up a Jew card. That's
the whole point of a Jew card.

2301
01:50:58,186 --> 01:51:00,575
That's right. You can't use
it up, it goes forever.

2302
01:51:00,731 --> 01:51:02,904
You know what?
I have to go.

2303
01:51:03,191 --> 01:51:05,034
Yeah, great.
What a big surprise.

2304
01:51:05,152 --> 01:51:08,372
Bye, Oliver. See you later. See
you in another seven years.

2305
01:51:08,488 --> 01:51:10,888
Make sure and say goodbye to the
grandkids who you met today.

2306
01:51:11,032 --> 01:51:13,000
You know, nothing I do
is right because of you.

2307
01:51:13,452 --> 01:51:16,706
Nothing. No matter how hard I
try, I'm just the asshole here.

2308
01:51:16,788 --> 01:51:18,381
But you know what?
You know what I realized?

2309
01:51:18,457 --> 01:51:20,130
It's you. You're the asshole.

2310
01:51:21,418 --> 01:51:23,011
Good luck working that out.

2311
01:51:23,253 --> 01:51:25,756
Happy birthday,
and go fuck yourself.

2312
01:51:26,465 --> 01:51:29,014
Hey, see you when
the Cubs win the pennant.

2313
01:51:29,718 --> 01:51:32,813
I'm gonna go light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

2314
01:51:33,805 --> 01:51:36,325
Maybe we should try the toast again.
You know, can you be quiet?

2315
01:51:36,933 --> 01:51:38,685
You just threw
me under the bus.

2316
01:51:38,769 --> 01:51:40,646
No, I don't...
You threw me under the...

2317
01:51:40,812 --> 01:51:42,280
You threw me under the bus.

2318
01:51:42,606 --> 01:51:44,483
We agreed to let go
and forgive,

2319
01:51:44,566 --> 01:51:47,115
but then you started ripping
into my dad like a crazy person.

2320
01:51:47,277 --> 01:51:49,154
I'm not ripping into your dad.

2321
01:51:49,237 --> 01:51:52,537
I'm just saying to him
what you say to me.

2322
01:51:52,616 --> 01:51:53,833
Don't be such a ball-buster.

2323
01:51:54,034 --> 01:51:57,038
I am not a ball-buster.
You make me one.

2324
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:00,124
I am a fun girl.
Lam fun-loving.

2325
01:52:00,499 --> 01:52:03,878
I am a "Good-Time Sally."
I dance hip-hop.

2326
01:52:04,211 --> 01:52:07,135
I cannot beliieve I
have wasted my whole life

2327
01:52:07,255 --> 01:52:09,974
busting the balls of
people who have no balls.

2328
01:52:10,801 --> 01:52:13,520
I'm the only one
here who has any balls!

2329
01:52:56,096 --> 01:52:57,598
God damn it.

2330
01:53:00,892 --> 01:53:01,984
Mom?

2331
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,732
Mom? What are you doing?

2332
01:53:06,815 --> 01:53:07,816
What?

2333
01:53:07,899 --> 01:53:10,243
You're smoking,
and in the front yard?

2334
01:53:10,318 --> 01:53:13,242
No! No, they're Barb's.

2335
01:53:15,615 --> 01:53:16,707
Mom!

2336
01:53:16,992 --> 01:53:18,869
Since when have
you been a smoker?

2337
01:53:19,035 --> 01:53:20,036
I'm not a smoker.

2338
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,622
I thought you said smokers die.

2339
01:53:21,705 --> 01:53:23,799
I'm not smoking.
I wasn't smoking.

2340
01:53:23,874 --> 01:53:24,921
I saw you.

2341
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,001
No, I wasn't.

2342
01:53:26,084 --> 01:53:27,552
Mom, you're smoking?

2343
01:53:27,878 --> 01:53:30,506
Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant.
You've been doing so well.

2344
01:53:30,589 --> 01:53:31,761
You're pregnant?

2345
01:53:32,048 --> 01:53:34,642
No effing way. I don't
want another sister.

2346
01:53:34,718 --> 01:53:35,935
I don't want her as a sister.

2347
01:53:36,553 --> 01:53:38,806
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
It just slipped out.

2348
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,477
Are you pregnant? Since
when are you pregnant?

2349
01:53:40,557 --> 01:53:43,310
Since when do you care? You
don't even want another baby.

2350
01:53:43,727 --> 01:53:45,149
You have no idea what I want.

2351
01:53:45,228 --> 01:53:46,525
I want an Asian baby.

2352
01:53:46,646 --> 01:53:48,068
We're not gonna
have an Asian baby.

2353
01:53:48,148 --> 01:53:49,149
Yes, We are.

2354
01:53:49,232 --> 01:53:50,620
They're not Asian.
Sadie.

2355
01:53:50,692 --> 01:53:52,535
We'll buy one.
Shut up, Charlotte.

2356
01:53:52,611 --> 01:53:54,079
You shut up.
Shut up, Sadie!

2357
01:53:54,237 --> 01:53:55,750
Shut up, Charlotte!
Shut up!

2358
01:53:55,947 --> 01:53:57,915
Okay, Sadie, shut up.
Shut up, Charlotte!

2359
01:53:58,033 --> 01:53:59,626
Shut up!
Okay, stop saying "shut up"!

2360
01:53:59,701 --> 01:54:01,461
You're pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

2361
01:54:01,786 --> 01:54:03,663
When did you find out?

2362
01:54:05,165 --> 01:54:08,544
Will you stop
eating cupcakes, please?

2363
01:54:09,044 --> 01:54:13,265
Stop eating cupcakes!
Stop eating cupcakes!

2364
01:54:16,968 --> 01:54:20,939
Hey, we just heard.
You're having a baby?

2365
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,729
See, it can happen to anybody.

2366
01:54:22,807 --> 01:54:24,775
That is so wonderful.

2367
01:54:24,851 --> 01:54:27,855
Let me give you a hug.
Fantastic, congratulations.

2368
01:54:28,021 --> 01:54:29,694
It's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.

2369
01:54:33,526 --> 01:54:35,324
This is too adult for you.
Let's go outside.

2370
01:54:35,654 --> 01:54:36,997
Congratulations.

2371
01:54:39,282 --> 01:54:41,876
Well, I guess we're stuck together
then forever then, right?

2372
01:54:41,952 --> 01:54:42,953
Weren't we always?

2373
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:44,382
You didn't even want a baby.

2374
01:54:44,454 --> 01:54:46,456
Of course I do.
I never said that.

2375
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,792
I didn't want one
if I could choose.

2376
01:54:48,875 --> 01:54:51,298
I should put that on a Hallmark card.
That's beautiful.

2377
01:54:51,628 --> 01:54:52,675
Debbie...

2378
01:54:53,296 --> 01:54:55,173
Good luck with
the pregnancy, Debbie.

2379
01:54:55,256 --> 01:54:57,133
But please,
take care of yourself.

2380
01:54:57,217 --> 01:54:59,185
It's a much riskier
pregnancy after 40.

2381
01:54:59,594 --> 01:55:01,141
I'm not 40.
Of course you are.

2382
01:55:01,429 --> 01:55:04,273
You were born on
December 5th, 1972.

2383
01:55:04,349 --> 01:55:06,772
I'm not 40.
How do you know?

2384
01:55:06,851 --> 01:55:09,650
I was there. I'm the one who took
your mother to the hospital.

2385
01:55:09,771 --> 01:55:11,023
Well, that's not what she said.

2386
01:55:11,189 --> 01:55:13,658
Your mother was in labor
for only about 20 minutes.

2387
01:55:13,817 --> 01:55:16,536
You couldn't wait to meet me.
Can you imagine that?

2388
01:55:16,736 --> 01:55:18,158
I don't even know you.

2389
01:55:18,321 --> 01:55:22,417
You can't just come into
my house and reminisce.

2390
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:25,708
Look, maybe we're just not meant
to be in each other's lives.

2391
01:55:26,037 --> 01:55:28,756
I'm not sure this
was such a great idea.

2392
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,338
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute!

2393
01:55:34,587 --> 01:55:37,340
You did leave and
you didn't come back.

2394
01:55:37,632 --> 01:55:41,182
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

2395
01:55:41,344 --> 01:55:43,767
So, I ruined your life?
I was eight.

2396
01:55:43,847 --> 01:55:45,770
People do better when I
stay out of their lives!

2397
01:55:45,849 --> 01:55:47,146
That's what my son tells me.

2398
01:55:47,475 --> 01:55:49,022
You think my
life is so perfect?

2399
01:55:49,102 --> 01:55:51,605
I've got a 13-year-old
who's a pothead.

2400
01:55:51,688 --> 01:55:55,738
I've got a wife who's
keeping Zoloft alive.

2401
01:55:56,151 --> 01:55:57,494
You never said that before.

2402
01:55:57,652 --> 01:56:00,622
You don't think I wanna talk to you
about this, to share it with you?

2403
01:56:00,697 --> 01:56:02,697
It's just not our way.
We don't talk to each other.

2404
01:56:02,699 --> 01:56:05,873
We don't know each other. And I
thought that's the way you wanted it.

2405
01:56:06,536 --> 01:56:08,163
How do I get out of this?

2406
01:56:08,246 --> 01:56:12,126
How do I get you all to just
help me down off the cross?

2407
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:15,678
You sound just like Sadie.

2408
01:56:15,837 --> 01:56:16,884
Who's Sadie?

2409
01:56:17,005 --> 01:56:19,428
No, your daughter.
Your younger?

2410
01:56:19,549 --> 01:56:20,516
The big one.

2411
01:56:20,592 --> 01:56:24,062
Your older. I know, I know that.
A wonderful girl.

2412
01:56:24,846 --> 01:56:27,690
Hey, guys,
some of us need to leave.

2413
01:56:28,016 --> 01:56:30,735
Would this be a good
moment to sneak out?

2414
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:35,948
Where is Dad going?

2415
01:56:45,992 --> 01:56:47,744
Best birthday ever!

2416
01:56:53,917 --> 01:56:55,669
On, shit!

2417
01:56:55,752 --> 01:56:56,844
Bike lane, asshole!

2418
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:00,094
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

2419
01:57:01,132 --> 01:57:03,055
Your dad's still here.

2420
01:57:03,426 --> 01:57:05,895
I know.
It's kind of weird.

2421
01:57:06,221 --> 01:57:07,939
Where the hell is Pete?

2422
01:57:09,015 --> 01:57:10,107
Um...

2423
01:57:10,767 --> 01:57:13,020
Is it okay if Joseph
hangs out here for a while?

2424
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:15,487
Mm-hmm.

2425
01:57:16,689 --> 01:57:17,736
Hi, Joseph.

2426
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:19,196
Hi.

2427
01:57:20,443 --> 01:57:21,564
Do you want a piece of cake?

2428
01:57:21,778 --> 01:57:24,497
Oh! Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

2429
01:57:27,617 --> 01:57:28,789
All right, then.

2430
01:57:29,536 --> 01:57:30,833
They are so cute.

2431
01:57:30,912 --> 01:57:31,959
So cute.

2432
01:57:32,038 --> 01:57:33,460
He looks exactly
like Tom Petty.

2433
01:57:39,963 --> 01:57:41,510
Go around.

2434
01:57:44,384 --> 01:57:46,933
Watch it, watch it!

2435
01:57:50,807 --> 01:57:53,151
Hey, Pete! Great party!

2436
01:57:55,353 --> 01:57:56,479
Yeah.

2437
01:57:57,689 --> 01:57:58,986
The best!

2438
01:57:59,691 --> 01:58:00,943
And then we shake it.

2439
01:58:00,984 --> 01:58:03,237
And then a restaurant comes up.

2440
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:07,374
Dad, excuse me. I'm gonna
go look for Pete right now.

2441
01:58:07,532 --> 01:58:10,251
Would you mind staying with the
girls for just a little bit?

2442
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:11,832
Well, if you want me to.

2443
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:13,504
If you don't mind.
You don't have to.

2444
01:58:13,705 --> 01:58:14,831
Sure.

2445
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:18,840
Can I let Sadie show me
the last episode of Lost?

2446
01:58:19,002 --> 01:58:20,345
She asked me if I'd
seen it and I haven't.

2447
01:58:20,587 --> 01:58:21,759
Yeah, that would be nice.

2448
01:58:23,173 --> 01:58:24,971
Thank you.
Thank you.

2449
01:58:25,675 --> 01:58:28,178
She said we could watch it.
Come on.

2450
01:58:29,846 --> 01:58:32,440
I'm gonna let you
watch Lost. Come on.

2451
01:58:34,559 --> 01:58:35,685
Is it scary?

2452
01:58:35,935 --> 01:58:38,233
I'll cover your eyes
if it gets too scary.

2453
01:59:10,094 --> 01:59:12,142
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

2454
01:59:12,222 --> 01:59:13,519
Shh. Larry, please.

2455
01:59:28,071 --> 01:59:29,698
Are you fucking kidding me?

2456
01:59:30,907 --> 01:59:33,035
Are you fucking kidding me?

2457
01:59:34,244 --> 01:59:35,837
You opened your door on me.

2458
01:59:35,995 --> 01:59:38,589
I didn't open my fucking door on you.
I opened my door!

2459
01:59:39,082 --> 01:59:41,255
Aw, fuck.
I was right there!

2460
01:59:41,793 --> 01:59:43,795
You're supposed to look
before you open your door!

2461
01:59:43,878 --> 01:59:45,175
I was in a fucking bike path!

2462
01:59:45,255 --> 01:59:47,349
That's a blind spot.
There's no fucking bike path.

2463
01:59:47,423 --> 01:59:49,704
It's a residential section.
Get your head out of your ass.

2464
01:59:49,759 --> 01:59:50,760
Pay attention!

2465
01:59:50,843 --> 01:59:52,436
Open your goddamn eyes. What
are you doing, sleepwalking?

2466
01:59:52,762 --> 01:59:56,062
You're supposed to look to see
if a biker's coming through.

2467
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:57,187
You're supposed to look!

2468
01:59:57,267 --> 01:59:59,611
It's not my job to look out for you.
You look out for yourself.

2469
01:59:59,686 --> 02:00:01,326
I don't look out for you.
I don't see you.

2470
02:00:01,437 --> 02:00:03,678
I don't know where the fuck
you are or what you're doing.

2471
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:05,943
No one is ever
looking out for me!

2472
02:00:06,234 --> 02:00:08,453
I need your name
and your number.

2473
02:00:08,611 --> 02:00:09,612
Why?

2474
02:00:09,696 --> 02:00:10,743
Because you're
gonna pay for my door.

2475
02:00:10,947 --> 02:00:11,948
Fuck you!

2476
02:00:12,073 --> 02:00:15,452
Why don't you pay for my bike
and my face, you fucking prick?

2477
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:23,460
Don't disrespect me.

2478
02:00:26,838 --> 02:00:28,135
Are you sure that's him?

2479
02:00:28,798 --> 02:00:30,516
I don't think that's him.

2480
02:00:33,303 --> 02:00:35,146
I gotta write down
your license plate.

2481
02:00:40,059 --> 02:00:42,778
"Range Rover of Sunland."

2482
02:00:46,065 --> 02:00:48,193
What are you doing?
Ow.

2483
02:00:55,116 --> 02:00:58,336
I guess the party didn't
turn out like you planned.

2484
02:00:59,537 --> 02:01:01,460
It wasn't a good party.

2485
02:01:02,665 --> 02:01:03,712
Hi.
Hi.

2486
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:05,418
I'll bring you in as soon
as his X-rays are finished.

2487
02:01:05,501 --> 02:01:07,094
Okay. Is he okay?
Okay.

2488
02:01:07,337 --> 02:01:10,090
Yeah, he has a broken rib and
he's been crying a little bit.

2489
02:01:10,173 --> 02:01:11,846
But he'll be fine.

2490
02:01:13,885 --> 02:01:17,515
You know, Pete was
never a real fighter.

2491
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:21,779
But that's why he married you.
That's why he loves you.

2492
02:01:21,851 --> 02:01:23,853
Because you're the fighter.

2493
02:01:24,896 --> 02:01:25,943
And you need that.

2494
02:01:26,022 --> 02:01:28,992
One person in a relationship
has got to punch.

2495
02:01:29,859 --> 02:01:31,156
Do you mean that in a good way?

2496
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:34,368
Oh, it's a high compliment.

2497
02:01:36,783 --> 02:01:38,000
Thanks.

2498
02:01:39,494 --> 02:01:41,095
Listen, I know what
you're worried about.

2499
02:01:41,371 --> 02:01:43,624
You think he's
gonna turn into me,

2500
02:01:44,582 --> 02:01:46,050
but I don't think
it's gonna happen.

2501
02:01:46,292 --> 02:01:49,341
He's smarter and
probably a little cuter.

2502
02:01:50,546 --> 02:01:52,344
A little less Jew-y.

2503
02:01:52,799 --> 02:01:56,019
Although after 50,
that's all gonna change.

2504
02:01:56,177 --> 02:01:59,056
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a rabbi.

2505
02:02:00,014 --> 02:02:02,358
But the good news is, you know,

2506
02:02:03,601 --> 02:02:04,818
he'll love you forever.

2507
02:02:04,894 --> 02:02:06,612
That's in our DNA.

2508
02:02:07,063 --> 02:02:08,656
We stick around.

2509
02:02:10,233 --> 02:02:12,201
He worries about you, you know.

2510
02:02:12,276 --> 02:02:13,994
It puts a lot of
pressure on him.

2511
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:16,744
I know, I just don't have anyone
else to talk to about it.

2512
02:02:16,823 --> 02:02:18,245
Why don't you talk to Claire?

2513
02:02:18,324 --> 02:02:20,418
If I open up to her,
she'll leave me.

2514
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:21,832
No, she won't.

2515
02:02:21,911 --> 02:02:23,754
Mmm.
Larry, she loves you.

2516
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:27,175
I know, but there's a certain point
at which you just can't stay.

2517
02:02:31,587 --> 02:02:33,055
I guess it's hard
to forgive somebody

2518
02:02:33,131 --> 02:02:35,759
if they don't
formally apologize to you.

2519
02:02:40,096 --> 02:02:41,348
Are you apologizing?

2520
02:02:42,432 --> 02:02:44,605
I'm very close.

2521
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:47,857
Yes, I'm sorry.

2522
02:02:53,985 --> 02:02:56,033
I'm glad everybody's okay.

2523
02:02:56,863 --> 02:02:57,989
Okay, thanks.

2524
02:02:58,072 --> 02:03:00,074
Oh, thank you.

2525
02:03:06,914 --> 02:03:08,427
All right, I'm off.

2526
02:03:08,499 --> 02:03:09,625
Okay-

2527
02:03:11,377 --> 02:03:12,629
This is awkward.

2528
02:03:13,504 --> 02:03:14,551
What?

2529
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:16,632
I need $40 for a cab.

2530
02:03:17,633 --> 02:03:19,510
That's funny.

2531
02:03:20,219 --> 02:03:21,311
No, I'm not kidding.

2532
02:03:21,929 --> 02:03:22,976
Oh, yeah.

2533
02:03:23,181 --> 02:03:24,933
You drove me, honey.
I wasn't prepared.

2534
02:03:25,183 --> 02:03:27,231
I know.
I only have a hundred.

2535
02:03:27,310 --> 02:03:28,357
It's okay.

2536
02:03:29,353 --> 02:03:31,401
I'll bring you the change.

2537
02:03:32,148 --> 02:03:34,571
All right.
Give him a kiss for me.

2538
02:03:53,878 --> 02:03:55,926
I don't get it.

2539
02:03:56,422 --> 02:03:57,765
See, it's not sad.

2540
02:03:57,882 --> 02:04:01,853
It's happy, because they helped
each other achieve their destiny.

2541
02:04:03,179 --> 02:04:06,729
Great. I'm gonna have
some freaky-ass nightmares.

2542
02:04:18,945 --> 02:04:20,697
Hi.
Hi.

2543
02:04:30,623 --> 02:04:32,341
I really liked our
life so much better

2544
02:04:32,416 --> 02:04:34,919
before we tried to
change everything.

2545
02:04:35,628 --> 02:04:36,971
I'm sorry.

2546
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:41,305
No, I'm sorry. I don't want
to keep anything from you.

2547
02:04:42,593 --> 02:04:44,266
I love you, you're my wife.

2548
02:04:44,845 --> 02:04:47,268
I just didn't
want to let you down.

2549
02:04:48,558 --> 02:04:50,105
Are you mad that I'm pregnant?

2550
02:04:50,351 --> 02:04:53,070
No. I'm not mad,
I'm thrilled.

2551
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:54,693
You don't feel trapped?

2552
02:04:55,565 --> 02:04:57,488
I sometimes feel
like I trapped you.

2553
02:04:57,567 --> 02:04:59,069
I don't feel trapped.

2554
02:04:59,402 --> 02:05:00,779
Really?
No.

2555
02:05:00,987 --> 02:05:02,989
You should,
because I have trapped you.

2556
02:05:03,072 --> 02:05:04,073
You can't go anywhere.

2557
02:05:05,074 --> 02:05:07,668
I'm gonna get you pregnant every 10
years for the rest of your life.

2558
02:05:07,743 --> 02:05:09,916
You can never leave me. Ever.

2559
02:05:10,037 --> 02:05:11,755
I never feel trapped by you.

2560
02:05:11,831 --> 02:05:15,085
I'm so happy to be with you
and I love you so much.

2561
02:05:15,585 --> 02:05:18,509
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

2562
02:05:19,005 --> 02:05:21,599
God damn it, why am
I crying like this?

2563
02:05:22,049 --> 02:05:23,562
Something is wrong with me.

2564
02:05:23,926 --> 02:05:25,143
You're pregnant.

2565
02:05:25,303 --> 02:05:26,600
Oh, yeah.

2566
02:05:26,929 --> 02:05:28,021
Shit.

2567
02:05:28,723 --> 02:05:31,818
I was just outside telling
your dad that I liked him.

2568
02:05:31,892 --> 02:05:33,690
What if he thinks
I like him now?

2569
02:05:33,769 --> 02:05:34,770
No, he won't think that.

2570
02:05:34,854 --> 02:05:37,027
I don't want him to think
I like him that much.

2571
02:05:37,106 --> 02:05:38,619
No, it will never happen.

2572
02:05:39,358 --> 02:05:43,283
Can you believe it? This is
the craziest thing ever.

2573
02:05:43,362 --> 02:05:45,660
What are we gonna do
with a third baby?

2574
02:05:45,906 --> 02:05:48,125
I have no idea.
How are we going to afford it?

2575
02:05:49,035 --> 02:05:50,207
We'll sell the house.

2576
02:05:50,661 --> 02:05:51,833
We don't have to.

2577
02:05:51,912 --> 02:05:53,755
We kind of do.
We kind of do.

2578
02:05:53,956 --> 02:05:56,129
We'll make new memories
in a new house.

2579
02:05:57,126 --> 02:05:58,252
I love you.

2580
02:06:00,463 --> 02:06:02,966
Is there anything you want
to do for your birthday?

2581
02:06:03,049 --> 02:06:05,222
It's been the worst
birthday ever.

2582
02:06:06,302 --> 02:06:08,382
There is one thing, but I
don't think you'll like it.

2583
02:06:08,638 --> 02:06:09,935
What?

2584
02:06:10,056 --> 02:06:13,310
I wouldn't mind going to see some music.
Would you want to do that?

2585
02:06:13,601 --> 02:06:14,602
Yeah.

2586
02:06:14,685 --> 02:06:15,732
Really?
Yeah.

2587
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:18,030
I don't believe you, but
you're sweet for saying that.

2588
02:06:18,397 --> 02:06:20,115
How do we break
you out of here?

2589
02:06:20,232 --> 02:06:22,951
I can just leave on my own volition.
It's not a mental institution.

2590
02:06:23,402 --> 02:06:25,075
Can you?
Yes.

2591
02:06:25,154 --> 02:06:26,955
It's not like One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

2592
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:29,260
Please don't put
a pillow over my face.

2593
02:06:31,827 --> 02:06:33,067
Let's get outta here, McMurphy.

2594
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:34,121
You got it, Chief.

2595
02:06:34,330 --> 02:06:36,003
Will you carry me?

2596
02:06:36,957 --> 02:06:38,834
You've been carrying me
all this time.

2597
02:07:09,865 --> 02:07:11,037
Thanks.

2598
02:07:18,708 --> 02:07:20,335
I like this song.

2599
02:07:21,168 --> 02:07:22,385
Really?

2600
02:07:23,087 --> 02:07:24,179
Why?

2601
02:07:29,301 --> 02:07:30,814
Why don't you sign him?

2602
02:07:30,886 --> 02:07:34,607
Ryan Adams?
No, he wouldn't sign with me.

2603
02:07:34,974 --> 02:07:36,772
Why not? You're the best.

2604
02:07:37,393 --> 02:07:38,394
He is in between labels.

2605
02:07:41,021 --> 02:07:42,819
Let's go try and talk
to him after the show.

2606
02:08:34,909 --> 02:08:36,502
Thank you.

2607
02:09:09,819 --> 02:09:12,823
I'm sorry if I'm not all
fancy pants and wealthy

2608
02:09:12,947 --> 02:09:16,417
and showing it all off with
my Vidal Sassoon haircuts.

2609
02:09:16,992 --> 02:09:17,993
Sorry.

2610
02:09:18,285 --> 02:09:19,832
Quit slow-blinking at me.

2611
02:09:20,329 --> 02:09:21,672
I'm sorry.
Okay...

2612
02:09:22,289 --> 02:09:25,293
I would like to rear
up and jackknife my legs

2613
02:09:25,376 --> 02:09:28,346
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

2614
02:09:30,631 --> 02:09:32,725
That's what I
would fucking love.

2615
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:36,350
I wish my fucking foot would
go right through your skull.

2616
02:09:37,429 --> 02:09:39,773
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

2617
02:09:39,849 --> 02:09:41,021
I will fucking kill you.

2618
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,024
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

2619
02:09:44,186 --> 02:09:45,403
I'll chew through you!

2620
02:09:45,604 --> 02:09:49,199
Slow-blinking eyes. I will
chew off your fucking eyelids.

2621
02:09:49,608 --> 02:09:51,201
You won't slow-blink
at me, will you?

2622
02:09:51,318 --> 02:09:53,036
Did you drink
before you came here?

2623
02:09:53,112 --> 02:09:55,206
No, but I'm gonna
start drinking.

2624
02:09:55,406 --> 02:09:58,785
I'm gonna slit somebody open like
a fish and drink their blood.

2625
02:09:58,868 --> 02:10:00,211
That's what I'm gonna drink

2626
02:10:00,411 --> 02:10:03,415
if we don't start getting
to the fucking point here.

2627
02:10:03,873 --> 02:10:06,092
Probably I'm gonna start
with Karen Carpenter's head.

2628
02:10:06,709 --> 02:10:10,304
I'm gonna rip her head off
and I'm gonna drink her blood.

2629
02:10:10,588 --> 02:10:12,588
And then I'm gonna come back
and light you on fire.

2630
02:10:13,924 --> 02:10:15,312
I'm gonna light
you all on fire.

2631
02:10:15,384 --> 02:10:17,227
But I'm gonna
start with you, Jill.

2632
02:10:17,511 --> 02:10:18,728
I'm gonna fucking torch you.

2633
02:10:19,346 --> 02:10:22,566
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go buy a fucking pickup truck.

2634
02:10:22,683 --> 02:10:23,809
And a cord of rope.

2635
02:10:23,892 --> 02:10:26,111
And I'm gonna string it around
all three of your fucking necks

2636
02:10:26,186 --> 02:10:28,029
and then drive
around town, dragging you.

2637
02:10:28,146 --> 02:10:29,318
That's what I'm
gonna fucking do.

2638
02:10:29,398 --> 02:10:31,651
That's completely uncalled for.

2639
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:34,494
Really, Jill?
Do you think it is?

2640
02:10:34,778 --> 02:10:37,907
Fuck off, Jill. God,
everybody fucking hates you.

2641
02:10:38,574 --> 02:10:39,621
God!

2642
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:40,747
That isn't even nice.

2643
02:10:40,909 --> 02:10:43,958
Go suck a big
fucking dick, Jill.

2644
02:10:44,746 --> 02:10:46,168
That's totally
uncalled for, Catherine.

2645
02:10:46,248 --> 02:10:48,546
You're a fucking asshole.
Everybody hates you.

2646
02:10:48,667 --> 02:10:49,839
They hate your fucking bob.

2647
02:10:51,003 --> 02:10:53,131
And I'm glad your husband died.

2648
02:10:53,338 --> 02:10:56,558
Because you're a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

2649
02:10:57,467 --> 02:10:59,469
I would. Kill myself.

2650
02:11:00,262 --> 02:11:02,435
God, I'd kill myself, Jill.

2651
02:11:04,558 --> 02:11:06,526
Cut!
