2
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:15,785
93 degrees.

3
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,454
Seems okay.

4
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:21,383
Let's check to make sure.

5
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,543
90... 92.5.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,355
Awesome!

7
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,611
The weather really is hot.

8
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:39,288
Give me a cup of water.

9
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:40,950
Yes.

10
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,706
Have free time tonight?

11
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:55,947
Is something the matter?

12
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:59,270
It doesn't have to be something for us to meet.

13
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:00,749
Go out on a date.

14
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:02,400
Today?

15
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:05,485
I originally wanted to go home earlier to study.

16
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,524
Saying it like that makes it seem like
you're really serious about studying.

17
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:10,158
Starting today, I want to study hard.

18
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:11,014
Starting tomorrow.

19
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,574
Even so tonight, I can't.

20
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:15,695
Mom's complaining about how
a girl always comes home so late.

21
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,003
Still have to sew the stuffed dolls' eyes,
still have to shell the chestnuts.

22
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:18,554
Hey!

23
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:20,625
Then when are we going to go on a date?!

24
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:23,568
You're refusing on purpose?

25
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,366
Want to go see a movie?

26
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,003
Too noisy there and too many people,
don't want to go.

27
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:29,373
Then how about amusement park?

28
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,771
Right, you don't like crowds.

29
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:34,843
Then... theater?

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,189
Shopping?

31
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,563
Musical?

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,697
If that's no good then...

33
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,987
Chat in the park or...

34
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,238
Drive?

35
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:47,675
Go to my house.

36
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,996
DVDs. It'll be cozy.

37
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:59,262
Was crying and yelling before.

38
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,235
Now can't even close his mouth.

39
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,421
Oh Angel, sit here.

40
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,450
Should I go buy you a milk to drink?

41
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:12,922
Are you okay?

42
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:20,662
Sorry.

43
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,432
Walk this way.

44
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,041
What are you doing?

45
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,057
Tastes good?

46
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:45,317
Young man,

47
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:47,205
You haven't paid yet.

48
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,311
5000 won.

49
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,563
I won't.

50
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,100
Other than Eun Sae,
I won't see any other woman.

51
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,508
Standing outside the washroom holding a purse,

52
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:23,886
Toe nails covered with nail polish.

53
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,583
Are you a servant or an experimental object?

54
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:26,813
Don't live like that.

55
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,738
So what?

56
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,284
Sun Ki hyung has nail polish too.

57
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,305
Are willingly done and forced the same?

58
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,625
There isn't much difference.

59
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,968
You... really!

60
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:35,860
What?

61
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,360
See me and you seem like
you can't wait to eat me alive!

62
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:42,369
Maybe he's thinking of the time
when noona saw hyung's butt.

63
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:47,158
Ah, the pretty girl who winked standing at 11 o'clock.

64
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,460
You wall.

65
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,032
That's right, I'm a wall,
what can you do about it?!

66
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,842
You bad girl.

67
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,051
Come here.

68
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,250
Quickly come here.

69
00:03:57,998 --> 00:03:58,563
You,

70
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:00,627
hurry up and forget her sister,
go out with the girl I introduced you.

71
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:01,749
No.

72
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,194
Do as I say!

73
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,932
Why?

74
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,126
Don't ask why, go see her!

75
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:06,955
You big gorilla.

76
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,015
I like most Eun Sae.

77
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,573
Go clean.

78
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,626
Do you want the noodle to be broken up?

79
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,274
Just once.

80
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,299
I only eat egg white.

81
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,276
I only eat egg yolk.

82
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,086
Flavoring?

83
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,930
Only put spice powder.

84
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,572
Okay.

85
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:34,827
Hey.

86
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:36,727
How come you can't do anything right?

87
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,923
How can you use scissors to cut green onions?

88
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:46,551
For the most part, it was me who cooked.
Later you do the dishes.

89
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,015
That's not true, we cooked together!

90
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,131
Fairly, use rock paper scissors.

91
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,802
Then, don't use rock paper scissors.

92
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,319
Play five-words game.
(Five syllables in Korean)

93
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:57,401
The loser washes the dishes.

94
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:58,038
Okay?

95
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,234
Okay.

96
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,820
You like me, don't you?

97
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:08,064
Ob-vi-ous ans-wer.

98
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:10,648
Since when has that been?

99
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,336
From when you kissed me.

100
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,749
The kiss from which time?

101
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:19,108
Match-mak-ing date kiss.

102
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,453
It was that early?

103
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,471
The ramyun is done!

104
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,644
Look at you, acting weird all on your own.

105
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,322
You dare do whatever that's weird.
Nine words.

106
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:33,708
You wash the dishes.

107
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,452
Alright.

108
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,255
The cover's mine.

109
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,107
What kind of reason is that!

110
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:44,283
I'm not eating.

111
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:45,726
Don't eat then.

112
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:54,955
So rigid, rigid, look at the tint in your eyes.

113
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,716
Tastes so good.

114
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:00,645
It's really hot.

115
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:05,100
What do I like about you?
Why are you asking this type of question?

116
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:06,687
That...

117
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:10,837
Min Yeop said I'm strong, not feminine.

118
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,884
So he doesn't like me.

119
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,186
There are many beautiful and slim women.

120
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:18,691
Manager... you're handsome,
your family background is good.

121
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,517
All criterions are very good.

122
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:24,093
Honestly speaking, I'm not even a bit pretty.

123
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:26,042
Looks like a boy.

124
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,928
Family background isn't good either.

125
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:31,190
Educational level is also not high.

126
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,829
There aren't that many things
to like about me, but still, you do.

127
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,620
No kidding.

128
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:41,651
But what can I do?

129
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:45,353
Those qualifications don't mean much to me.
I just like you.

130
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,288
Too honest.

131
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:07,911
You can't do it.

132
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,191
Eating this after brushing
your teeth tastes good, right?

133
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,834
It's my habit.

134
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:19,863
Really is a strange habit.

135
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:25,225
You'll be leaving one month from now, right?

136
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,332
How about I don't go?

137
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,003
You have to go anyway.

138
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,171
How about we go together?

139
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:36,360
In Chelsea, find a condo with many trees as home.

140
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:42,201
After I go to work, you read
under the sunlight in a nearby park.

141
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,038
And when I leave for work,

142
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,408
you come to my office and
we go eat dinner together.

143
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:49,493
Then go listen to music.

144
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,769
If we get hungry,

145
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,561
Then we walk to a pizza store
from home and get a pizza to eat.

146
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,852
You need to eat a whole one.

147
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:03,620
Just pure imagination already makes me excited.

148
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:06,204
You say you're excited but
why is your expression like that?

149
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:10,559
Imagination is okay, but I can't really go.

150
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:12,668
Why can't you really go?

151
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:17,275
I don't plan on marrying yet.

152
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,409
What?

153
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:20,125
Didn't you want me to go to the U.S. with you?

154
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,127
Then isn't that living together?

155
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,362
Going together is living together?

156
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,133
Without marrying we can still live together.

157
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:29,325
What?

158
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,991
Ah, that.

159
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,547
I mean, the thing is.

160
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,637
If you really feel strange,
then we can live separately.

161
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,683
But if you actually slept with me,

162
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,877
You won't really bug me about marrying you, right?

163
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,767
Did I say something I shouldn't have said?

164
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:53,246
Lovers obviously have to sleep together.

165
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:54,608
Right?

166
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:03,345
You really make me hot talking about this.

167
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:07,649
It's not me who make you this hot.

168
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,552
It's the weather that's too hot.

169
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,522
Also.

170
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,580
If we sleep together,
of course we should get married.

171
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:23,588
So, if sleeping together means you have to get married,

172
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:25,732
Does holding hands mean you have to get engaged?

173
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:31,918
That... is that how it is?

174
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,035
How can there be so much ice cream left?

175
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,363
Hurry and eat.

176
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:51,492
I am really glad you're a woman.

177
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,304
It's all melted.

178
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,042
New York.

179
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:10,213
New.

180
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,975
New York.

181
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,155
What did you say?

182
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,824
Mom, are your ears not working?

183
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:24,796
Manager asked her to go
to America with him... New York.

184
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,651
He proposed to you, didn't he?

185
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,359
When did he say you are getting married?

186
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,074
Not getting married.

187
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:33,561
Even if we go together,
we wouldn't have to live together.

188
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,580
Mom.

189
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:40,336
Our manager works at
New York's biggest toy company.

190
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:41,898
Not marrying?

191
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,190
Then, what about us?

192
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,156
You should buy us a condo before marrying!

193
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:46,904
Hey, little girl.

194
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,105
Why would he do this for me?

195
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:50,946
Use your brain to think about it.

196
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,670
Hey! Hey!

197
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:54,452
Quickly finish eating and go out.

198
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,894
Don't you have to go out to see your friends?

199
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,873
Would I still be in the mood to go see friends?

200
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,513
She only cares about her own happiness.

201
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:00,764
Going off to New York!

202
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,891
Doesn't matter how we are,
it's fine as long as you're okay!

203
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,738
You alone eating well, you're happy, right?

204
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,474
You little girl, what's wrong?

205
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,433
Are you jealous that I'm doing well?

206
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:13,971
Yes, jealous to death, so what?

207
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,789
Why are you screaming and yelling
over the table early in the morning?

208
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,583
Mom, why do you always reprimand only me?

209
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,260
If unni leaves, how are we going live?

210
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:23,075
It's already difficult now,
how will just mom and I survive?

211
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,459
Relying solely on shelling chestnuts
and sewing eyes on dolls.

212
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,996
How will it finance me for university?

213
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:35,983
Eat.

214
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,920
Seeing her sister in love.

215
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,948
She's afraid the brother-in-law
will steal away her own sister.

216
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:44,045
She's like that for her heart is anxious.

217
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,191
Who is it?

218
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:11,050
Long time no see.

219
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:20,238
Tomorrow you and I, we'll bring Han Kyul
to the cinerarium of his biological mother.

220
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:23,877
Let him meet his biological father.

221
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:28,516
Thinking about it, that's the humane thing to do.

222
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,076
The child's mother...

223
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:33,176
I already told her.

224
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,223
What did she say?

225
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,827
She agrees.

226
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:48,638
I was interested in her,
I'll let you have her now.

227
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:52,025
Look. Check out her perfect female charisma.

228
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,273
Long flowing hair.

229
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,446
Soft and pale skin.

230
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:58,888
Also, captivating eyes.

231
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:01,124
Mesmerizing to death, right?

232
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:04,792
But, the most fatal point is...

233
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:07,234
Please eat.

234
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,602
A beautiful spirit who knows
how to take care of the other.

235
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:12,601
Hey, mesmerizing to death, right!

236
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,326
Don't take more than you're offered.

237
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,996
Women don't like it.

238
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,186
Don't be nervous.

239
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,095
Full of self-confidence.

240
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,551
Start!

241
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:33,212
You're... really beautiful.

242
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:38,430
Can we meet again?

243
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,483
How can I be doing so well?

244
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,987
Seems like I'm an expert at love too.

245
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,057
I'm really busy right now.

246
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,759
You must be joking,
what can you be busy doing?

247
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:02,181
I'm near the singing studio.

248
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,316
<i>I'm hungry, hurry up and come over.</i>

249
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:05,475
No.

250
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,260
No?

251
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:10,782
When did your guts* get outside of you?!
(*Word pun on "intestines" and "being ballsy")

252
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,970
My guts have always been safely inside.

253
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,113
Hanging up.

254
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:25,760
Eun Sae.

255
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:28,162
You came here from school?

256
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:29,992
Ahjussi, did you go somewhere?

257
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:32,708
Haven't seen you for several days.

258
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,296
Oh, traveled.

259
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:39,384
Following the wind, following the clouds.

260
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,180
Like a homeless wanderer.

261
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,263
Wandered around for a few days then came back.

262
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,863
You really are blessed.

263
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,115
You can go as you wish.

264
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,746
It's so good for you to be alone
by yourself without a care.

265
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,840
Why are you getting married with my mom?

266
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,441
That, it's because...

267
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,493
I like your mom.

268
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,891
Compared to one person,
it's better to have two people.

269
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,986
Did you get bullied by someone?

270
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:08,604
The person following me around everyday
saying he likes me hung up on me.

271
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:11,107
My unni said she might not get married.

272
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,430
What... marry?

273
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,512
Ah, that, that...

274
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,295
Heard she has that kind of relationship
with the coffee shop manager.

275
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,958
It shouldn't be true, right?

276
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:23,604
My gosh! Eun Chan really met someone good!

277
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,175
What's so good?

278
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:26,552
Because he's got lots of money?

279
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:29,931
My unni isn't the type who likes someone
just because of the money.

280
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:33,026
Why do you twist what other people mean?

281
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:34,949
When did I say he's good
because he has lots of money?

282
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,444
I only said he was good.

283
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,079
Why are you accusing me?

284
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:42,466
Are you sad?

285
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:45,364
If I release an album and earn lots of money,

286
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,676
I would buy her a car.

287
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,521
And open a coffee shop for her.

288
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,338
I originally wanted to do that.

289
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,711
She, however, doesn't understand my heart.
Mesmerized by a man...

290
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:58,180
If mom gets married too,
then I'm left by myself.

291
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,426
Eun Sae.

292
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,081
I like your mom.

293
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:07,257
But... if you don't like it,
I definitely will not get married.

294
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:11,064
Until you agree, I won't marry.
Definitely not.

295
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:15,252
Also, if your mom gets married,
why would you be alone?

296
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:19,227
It's one more family member.

297
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:21,853
Ahjussi, you're a little nice as well.

298
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,017
But I still don't like it.

299
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:25,624
Hey.

300
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:28,432
Why didn't you come straight home after school?

301
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,631
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:30,963
I'm going now.

303
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:32,627
Don't nag.

304
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:33,975
You little girl.

305
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,444
Did you go somewhere far?

306
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:43,355
Haven't seen you.

307
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:45,052
Yes.

308
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,621
What is it with him?

309
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:58,259
Who cares, I don't have time to care about a man.

310
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:01,105
But, this person really is...

311
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,357
Hey Min Yeop, come here.

312
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,548
Your hyung has been caught up in trot music.

313
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,844
Lately, I've always...

314
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:16,776
Really?

315
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,673
Who are you talking to?

316
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:21,077
What are you doing?

317
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,193
Hey, have you heard of this?

318
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:24,058
In love, in love, this...

319
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,611
This has so much feeling.

320
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:28,202
This has a good feel to groove to.

321
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,630
What?

322
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:31,703
Jealous of you.

323
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:37,619
Hyung.

324
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,906
Look at manager's shoulders.

325
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,481
Isn't it broad?

326
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:42,176
It's considered pretty broad.

327
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,868
Don't answer carelessly, take a look.

328
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,702
Legs are long as well.

329
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:49,545
Looks good no matter what he wears.

330
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:52,167
His taste in clothing is also very classy.

331
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,985
Seems like he's not nice,
but he's very kind when you spend time with him.

332
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,171
Seems like a player making no contributions,
but in fact he's very pure.

333
00:17:58,446 --> 00:17:59,792
He's full of charisma all over.

334
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:00,183
Hyung.

335
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,792
You've never seen manager's look
when driving, right?

336
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,733
Driving single-handed.

337
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:06,882
If you were a woman,
you would be attracted by him as well.

338
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:11,196
It was like that with the concert,
those girls were staring at manager.

339
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:13,704
They have good tastes.

340
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,723
When is manager going to U.S.?

341
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:19,033
I originally wanted to go with him.

342
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,361
But I need to provide for my family.

343
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,654
I'm actually the parent.

344
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,356
Discuss it with the manager.

345
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,194
Don't just worry about it on your own.

346
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:26,906
No.

347
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,716
I don't want to talk about this.

348
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,853
It won't be long till,

349
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:32,443
He'll have to go.

350
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,183
Not much time left to see him.

351
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:35,588
Grab onto him.

352
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:39,040
He liked you even when
he thought you were a guy.

353
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:42,795
Who knows, maybe he won't go.

354
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,968
An ambitious man…

355
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:52,480
They say it's really low to cling
to someone using love as an excuse.

356
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,192
It's very revolting.

357
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:10,057
[Han Yoo Ju]

358
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:33,386
<i>Unable to connect, after the beep...</i>

359
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,662
Yoo Ju, it's me.

360
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:43,223
You left your phone on.

361
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,676
Did you go relax a bit?

362
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,718
Yoo Ju.

363
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,923
You can take your time coming back.

364
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:58,127
But remember to turn on your phone.

365
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,590
It's better if you pick up as well.

366
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,101
Oh my gosh.

367
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,337
Why are you eating when it's already night time?

368
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,332
Careful your face will swell up.

369
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,757
Eun Sae went to bed already?

370
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:10,589
Yes.

371
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:12,949
You.

372
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:16,597
You and your manager are dating seriously, right?

373
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:18,601
Why?

374
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,360
Nothing much, just seems strange.

375
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,720
Claiming yourself to be a man,
cautiously going to work in the shop.

376
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,910
In the end, you meet this kind of fate.

377
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,891
When did a small little girl
grow up so much already?

378
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,712
You've raised me for twenty so years now.

379
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,162
Of course I've grown.

380
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,939
It's strange then if I haven't.

381
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,565
That's true.

382
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:44,566
Let's eat together.

383
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:45,896
Okay.

384
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,048
But.

385
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,786
Their family is a bit...

386
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,354
Aren't our family conditions too poor?

387
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,396
It's true that it'll only go smoothly
if both families match.

388
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:04,562
What's wrong with our family?

389
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,080
So delicious.

390
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:13,665
I'll taste it.

391
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,016
Okay.

392
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,655
Tastes so good.

393
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:28,139
Because of mom, my standards
in choosing women got a lot higher too.

394
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,774
How come my mom knows how to do everything?

395
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,310
Sweet talker.

396
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:34,495
Look at how you spoil him.

397
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,818
Why did you go so far early
in the morning to buy crabs?

398
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,982
It's not like you're the only one with a son.

399
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,161
Jealous again.

400
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:45,714
Just a moment...

401
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:48,021
Mom.

402
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,981
Mother, please wait.

403
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,688
Eat well.

404
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,217

[Jung Eun Sook]
[1947, Sept. 2 – 1979, July 8]

406
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:21,619
Han Kyul.

407
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,692
You, a few days ago...

408
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:27,688
Saw someone named Lee Myung Jae, right?

409
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,545
Yes.

410
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:34,954
That person is your biological father.

411
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:50,876
I... told him everything.

412
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,890
Hope the child will understand
the heart of parents is a type of greed.

413
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:58,849
If he blames you for not
having told him all this time,

414
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:01,160
You just listen.

415
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:07,370
It has taken him thirty years
to meet is birth mother.

416
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:10,482
I'll be going first.

417
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,951
You and Han Kyul come back together.

418
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:14,984
Yes.

419
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,416
You.

420
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:21,035
Worked hard.

421
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,075
Very good.

422
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:13,220
You can do anything now.

423
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,052
Come, a little reward.

424
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:23,702
Quickly go.

425
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:25,328
I know, I know.

426
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:30,286
Seems like you've practiced a lot.

427
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,361
Drawing a lot better than me.

428
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,954
Ahjussi.

429
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,576
How about I go for a test to become a barista?

430
00:24:36,914 --> 00:24:39,153
You're not being a tae kwan do instructor anymore?

431
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:44,060
I... don't have the ability to open a studio.

432
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:48,055
Furthermore, I like coffee.

433
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:50,336
But, Ahjussi.

434
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,380
Can a barista earn lots of money?

435
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:56,113
When I went to Torino.

436
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:57,750
I went there through a rumor I heard.

437
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:59,901
Give or take some,
it was about half our store's size.

438
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:01,331
But the sales...

439
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:04,434
Actually reached that of
an average medium-sized business.

440
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,522
Really?

441
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:07,659
It all depends on how it's operated.

442
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,674
You can't expect to earn
100 million per month just like that.

443
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:12,801
For me,

444
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:16,085
I'll be satisfied if I can earn
two times of the pay right now.

445
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,617
I don't have to worry about Eun Sae's tuition.

446
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,118
And I can give mom some spending money.

447
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:21,705
I have nothing more to ask for.

448
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,265
Ask for more.

449
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:25,037
Ask for more.

450
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:27,114
Otherwise, you want to be like me?

451
00:25:39,277 --> 00:25:42,639
I wonder how he's feeling right now?

452
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:46,679
If he can give a call back,
how good would that be.

453
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:53,422
I really liked your biological mother.

454
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:54,869
All alone.

455
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:59,206
The way she didn't mind hard work
in order to pay her tuition...

456
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,521
Was very beautiful.

457
00:26:00,938 --> 00:26:03,391
With Lee Myung Jae, the three of us
were very good friends.

458
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:05,652
Carelessly, I started to like her.

459
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:08,149
We already decided to spend our life together.

460
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:12,053
Agreed no matter what happened we won't split up.

461
00:26:12,263 --> 00:26:16,400
But because she was an orphan,
grandma strongly objected.

462
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,173
No.

463
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,364
It was my heart that changed.

464
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:23,986
It was I who didn't want her anymore.

465
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:25,002
But...

466
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,451
She didn't speak one word of complaint.

467
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:31,416
Whenever I see you.

468
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,417
Even though for your mother right now,

469
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,847
For the person who already
passed away, I feel very sorry.

470
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,970
However.

471
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:43,923
To have been able to raise you,

472
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:46,521
I feel very happy.

473
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,374
It makes me angry.

474
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:05,315
But I don't know why, exactly.

475
00:27:06,364 --> 00:27:09,680
Maybe it's because of the biological father
who's just now appeared,

476
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:14,789
or because you and Grandmother
suddenly revealed this now,

477
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:21,211
or because of myself, for believing I
was part of your bloodline.

478
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,254
Han Kyul.

479
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:23,344
Today.

480
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:27,746
That's it for today, father.

481
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,531
Didn't pick up for the whole day, really strange.

482
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,083
Hey girl.

483
00:27:48,118 --> 00:27:50,417
Did something happen to your lover?

484
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:53,983
Just now he said he'll come back
after going to see grandma.

485
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,185
Seems like he can't come back.

486
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,914
This lowly brother calls all day
and he doesn't return the call.

487
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:02,132
With Madam, however, he calls all the time.

488
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:04,493
An eight years friendship is destroyed like that.

489
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:05,797
Don't joke about me anymore.

490
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:06,556
Oh my gosh.

491
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:07,649
Who's joking?

492
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:11,166
Joking about Madam, in case Madam cries,

493
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:14,219
Says I'm impolite to Madam,
Manager will give me a good reprimand.

494
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:15,826
Is it not, Madam?

495
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:18,044
But, Han Kyul hyung,

496
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,383
Everyone's talking about having a farewell party.

497
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:21,843
Have you two talked about it?

498
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:22,866
What will happen after if hyung goes to the U.S.?

499
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,641
Hyung.

500
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:26,736
Does that toy have to be made in the U.S.?

501
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,400
Of course.

502
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,960
The States is the original place of manufacturing.

503
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:33,687
Also, he only got officially hired
as a designer after three whole years.

504
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:35,380
It's not easy.

505
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:37,913
Really, when?

506
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,963
Heard he received notice last week.

507
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:43,887
But hyung is really impressive.

508
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,477
Starting work from a block designer,

509
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:47,213
Sleeping only two, three hours a day,

510
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:50,709
He's succeeded after three years
of tireless hard work.

511
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:54,769
Also there's this place,
Coffee Prince had great improvements too.

512
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:58,342
Miss Eun Chan, I am earnestly
giving you a word of advice.

513
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:03,552
A man's ambition... can't use love to disconnect it.

514
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:05,092
Disconnect what?

515
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:06,579
It's not a flower, how can it be disconnected.

516
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,439
If you don't want to part,
then go to the U.S. together.

517
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:10,838
It's not a place where you can
go by hopping onto the subway.

518
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:12,043
How can we go together?

519
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,102
Costs for transportation, for living.

520
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:15,205
So much money to be spent.

521
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,644
What's the problem with this?

522
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,924
A lover who has the capabilities will cover it all.

523
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,026
Buy you a house, a car.

524
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,753
Your way of thinking is really strange.

525
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,853
He's him, I'm me.

526
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,096
Manager buys me whatever and I'll accept it whole,
you think I'm that type of person?

527
00:29:28,618 --> 00:29:30,444
If not then fine, why are you so serious?

528
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:32,445
Makes people awkward.

529
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:34,731
So don't say those things in front of me.

530
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,663
Even if you don't tell me to,
I'd still let him go.

531
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:56,065
Hello?

532
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,124
Are you sleeping?

533
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,397
I think I'm near the house.

534
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:04,035
Or I think I'm on my way home.

535
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,710
What do you mean I think?

536
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:10,950
I think I'm near your house.

537
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:12,988
Can you come here for a minute?

538
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,446
I'm tired but since you want me to come, I'll go.

539
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:18,725
<i>No, you must be tired. Get some rest.</i>

540
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:21,446
No, I'm not tired.

541
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:25,639
- How long will it take?
- 3 minutes.

542
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:33,669
What happened?
A lot of things happened.

543
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:36,361
Starting from nine in the morning,
there was a group order.

544
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:39,141
I thought I was going to die
trying to get their order.

545
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,403
Anything else?

546
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:44,404
At night these gangsters came and complained
that there was oil in the coffee.

547
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:46,733
I told them that the oil is
from the coffee beans.

548
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:50,376
They kept saying it was
because the cup was dirty.

549
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,846
I thought my head was going to explode.

550
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:54,674
- Anything else?
- Why do you keep saying anything else?

551
00:30:56,746 --> 00:31:00,899
Without you around…
I kind of missed you.

552
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,684
Me too.
I missed you too.

553
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,054
Did you go somewhere with grandmother?

554
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,255
To the cinerarium.

555
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:15,410
To see my birth mother.

556
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,969
I heard I was adopted.

557
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:28,191
The person who gave me a picture
of my mother few days ago is my biological father.

558
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:35,969
I don't know what you're talking about.

559
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:40,098
My birth parents and
my current dad were friends.

560
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:44,214
And a year later,
my birth parents divorced.

561
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:47,416
My birth father went to Australia
and they lost contact with him.

562
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:50,156
After that I was born
and my mom died in an accident.

563
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:55,823
Since I was alone and had nowhere to go,
my current parents took me in.

564
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,945
A friend's child.

565
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:01,401
He took in the child of the woman he loved,

566
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:05,540
and took care of it as his own son until now.

567
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:12,802
I was completely fooled by
my grandmother, mother, and father.

568
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:16,479
They treated me so well,
I didn't have a clue.

569
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:21,614
The three of them were so good to me…

570
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:28,824
I wonder why my mother
didn't tell me about it sooner.

571
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:33,768
They shouldn't have told me.
So suddenly like this.

572
00:32:33,803 --> 00:32:36,507
What can I do now?

573
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:42,221
Aren't I a pitiful son to my father?

574
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:46,276
I thought he had me with another woman.

575
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,988
I yelled and talked back to him.

576
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,446
For ten years...

577
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:04,232
You didn't know.

578
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,123
You didn't know.

579
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,091
Now I know why you do this.

580
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:32,571
It feels good when you are
in a difficult situation.

581
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:37,893
You have no skills.

582
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:41,188
I heard working at the New York
headquarters is a big thing.

583
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:43,607
Is there anything you can't do?

584
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:48,271
You have everything
so it makes me lose my nerve.

585
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,100
Did Ha Rim tell you?

586
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:53,613
Why are you so happy?
I'm feeling sad.

587
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,328
Let's go together.

588
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,704
I'm going to stay here,
so go by yourself.

589
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,911
I'll be sure to send a letter everyday.

590
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:06,439
More than one letter each week.

591
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,197
You're not going with me?

592
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,543
If I go, I'm just going to be
a disturbance to your work.

593
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:12,555
And I have to work here.

594
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:16,450
I'm the head of my family.

595
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:19,853
It's because of your family's
circumstances, I can...

596
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:24,682
I'll manage. Don't worry.

597
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,171
I did good until now without anyone's help.

598
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:30,515
I'm going to do good in the future too,
so don't worry.

599
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:36,622
When you're in the U.S. concentrate on
making toys and don't do anything else.

600
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:42,294
I didn't say this before because
I thought you'd get cocky.

601
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:45,581
Don't wear the black shirt.

602
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:51,978
Last time, all the female customers
couldn't stop staring.

603
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,270
Is there anything else?

604
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:57,970
I think the girls look at me
when I flip my hair like this.

605
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:58,991
Look at this. Look at this.

606
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:02,035
You show your eye laugh
to anyone and your dimples.

607
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,339
You better not show that to anyone.

608
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:21,118
- Eun Chan.
- Yes?

609
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:24,973
Should I not go?

610
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:27,347
What do you mean not go?

611
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:29,901
You suffered for three years.

612
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:34,631
I'll just think you're going to the military service
and wait patiently for you.

613
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:38,637
So don't you dare go off and
have an affair or else you're dead!

614
00:35:41,451 --> 00:35:43,754
You're so cute.

615
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,496
Are you that sad?

616
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:48,371
If you're going to miss me that much,

617
00:35:48,518 --> 00:35:52,700
I'll come once a month,
no once a week to see you.

618
00:35:52,937 --> 00:35:55,496
You can come to the U.S.
and I'll come to Korea too.

619
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:58,495
Do you know how much a plane ticket cost?
How can I go once a week?

620
00:35:58,683 --> 00:36:01,119
- I'll buy it for you.
- Is a guy, a servant?

621
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:04,172
I'm going to earn the money
and take care of it on my own.

622
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:10,563
We shouldn't see each other
for a long time so once a year?

623
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:13,167
Once every six months?

624
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,701
Once every six months?

625
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,628
No way.

626
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:23,872
Can we go on without seeing
each other for six months?

627
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:30,373
We have to endure it.
We have no choice.

628
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,389
Oh... hold on.

629
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:17,296
<i>Director Choi, this is Han Jung Hwan
from Chungwoon Film. I sent the scenario.</i>

630
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,060
<i>Please call me after you look at it.</i>

631
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:12,285
Why did you work until now?

632
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:13,760
That's why you have blisters on your fingers.

633
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,751
It's because I have no skill.

634
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:21,216
The ahjumma upstairs does more
than me and she's fine.

635
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:27,826
Aren't you coming home late often these days?

636
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,404
I know.

637
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:36,018
Look at your fingers.

638
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:41,334
It's fine now. Go to sleep.

639
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,785
- I'll do it.
- It's okay. It's tiring.

640
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,632
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

641
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,795
<i>Good night, Manager Choi.</i>

642
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,757
<i>Hyung, o... ppa.</i>

643
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,149
It's disgusting...

644
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,788
I'm hungry but your refrigerator is empty.

645
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,598
I'm going to go grocery shopping.

646
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,056
Are you not mad anymore?

647
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:28,706
Sleep a little more.

648
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:34,628
Yoo Ju, hurry back.

649
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:38,078
Okay.

650
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:57,756
How dare you stare at me like that.
Release your eyes.

651
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:01,224
What are you so mad about?
I didn't do anything wrong.

652
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:03,987
You were like mad for few days.

653
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:06,782
What about you?

654
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:09,892
I'm going to send my boss alone.
So put your lips back in.

655
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:10,996
Really?

656
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,385
Then do I pretend to send him?

657
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:18,394
You're going to complain that you didn't go
because of us. Just go. Go.

658
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:21,291
Bring me the brush and sit down here.

659
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,964
I get scolded whether
I say I'm going or I'm not going.

660
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:31,360
You've an opinion about everything.
Your hair is a mess.

661
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:35,616
But your boss is going to be sad.

662
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,581
Let him cry. He says he will
come see me once a week.

663
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,786
Do you know how much a plane ticket costs?

664
00:41:41,924 --> 00:41:45,517
So I scolded him saying
do you have money to waste?

665
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:51,046
Truthfully, if we are going to breakup like that
it's better breaking up now.

666
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,554
Since you are not listening,
your hair is not listening either.

667
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:59,941
But unni, I think Hwang Min Yeop
is cheating on me.

668
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,806
He's not answering my calls
and ignores my text messages.

669
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:03,797
Hwang Min Yeop is?
Is he crazy?

670
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:07,224
He's doing this to my angel?
I'll scold him.

671
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:10,862
Let's eat ddukbokgi* for dinner, with a lot of odeng**.
(*ddukobkgi is spicy rice cakes, **odeng is fish cakes)

672
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:13,238
I'm leaving.

673
00:42:16,845 --> 00:42:19,751
- Mom, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

674
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,862
Mom. Mom. Mom.

675
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,396
Unni's not going to the U.S.

676
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,193
She's not going?

677
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:28,257
What about the boss?

678
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,470
She's just letting the boss go.

679
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:31,651
Just the boss?

680
00:42:31,868 --> 00:42:33,511
You're happy, right?

681
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:04,056
Good morning.

682
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:06,558
You don't listen do you?

683
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:09,138
You still wore the black shirt?

684
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:10,287
You don't know?

685
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:12,988
When people say don't do something,
I do it more.

686
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:15,745
Are you okay?
I was worried.

687
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:17,933
About my mom?

688
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:20,180
I'm fine.

689
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:25,723
You look good, Manager Choi.

690
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:30,042
Even though I'm tired,
I do things that is necessary.

691
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:34,008
Good morning!

692
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:35,044
You're here.

693
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:38,454
Eun Chan... you need to clean the bathroom.

694
00:43:38,598 --> 00:43:40,858
Someone didn't aim right,
so the toilet is dirty.

695
00:43:40,983 --> 00:43:41,843
Okay.

696
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:46,508
My Chan, the bathroom is out of pads. Restock it.

697
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:48,517
Okay.

698
00:44:00,817 --> 00:44:03,177
What is this?
This is mine.

699
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:04,762
That? Isn't it mine?

700
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:07,578
You gave it to me as a present two years ago.

701
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:10,440
Let me see. Let me see.

702
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:14,409
Yes this, I bought this with my card last year.

703
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:16,386
I think I did.

704
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:20,075
I was shocked after I found out
that I had CDs missing.

705
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:21,705
A lot of these are mine.

706
00:44:21,853 --> 00:44:23,156
No, it's not.

707
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:25,260
All right. All right. You can have it all.

708
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:26,574
Did you go grocery shopping?

709
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:29,423
Yes. I'll make bean paste stew.

710
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:31,780
Should we have a party?

711
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:35,468
Let's invite Han Kyul and Eun Chan...
and have a party.

712
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,376
You don't want to?

713
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,133
No, I want to.

714
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:41,003
Okay.

715
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,235
I'll help you after I organize this.

716
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:44,454
Okay.

717
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:54,284
- Yeah... Han Kyul.
- Did Han Yoo Ju call?

718
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:56,675
I think her cell phone works.

719
00:44:57,168 --> 00:44:58,316
She came yesterday.

720
00:44:58,522 --> 00:45:00,103
Really?

721
00:45:00,316 --> 00:45:02,807
Where was she all along?

722
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:08,103
Yoo Ju wants to invite you and Eun Chan for dinner.
Do you have time tomorrow?

723
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:10,573
Why is she inviting Eun Chan?

724
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:12,580
Is Han Yoo Ju planning something?

725
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:14,869
I don't know. It's up to you whether you come or not.

726
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:17,722
Hang up. I'm busy. Hang up.

727
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:24,291
How is it?

728
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:26,593
It's a killer.

729
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:39,894
Where were you?

730
00:45:40,306 --> 00:45:42,017
A quiet beach.

731
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:44,104
What is the number to that beach?

732
00:45:44,346 --> 00:45:50,026
Write down all of your friends, family and that
beach's number in my phone book. All right?

733
00:45:52,402 --> 00:45:54,150
Why did you come back?

734
00:45:54,357 --> 00:45:56,295
It doesn't make sense.

735
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:58,465
I didn't think about how you felt,

736
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:01,566
and just because you had a
little change of heart, I made you a criminal.

737
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,412
It's funny of me leaving and such.

738
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,843
I missed you a lot.

739
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,781
When?

740
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:10,562
When the wind blew,

741
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:12,905
When I walked,

742
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:15,182
When I fell asleep alone at night,

743
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,588
When I woke up alone in the morning...

744
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:19,440
Etcetera... etcetera.

745
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:21,709
What about Eun Chan?

746
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:25,062
After being briefly swayed,

747
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:30,319
The moment you packed your bags,
and got over my feelings for her.

748
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:40,647
Thank you for coming back.

749
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:48,315
I never thought I'd be left behind.

750
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:54,298
Since you were always the one
who loved me more.

751
00:46:54,409 --> 00:47:02,099
But seeing the small changes in your gaze,
your sighs, your expressions…

752
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:06,193
Made my heart fall with a thump.

753
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:08,972
Hey, Han Yoo Ju.

754
00:47:09,474 --> 00:47:14,754
It's funny, that as my feelings for you grew,

755
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:18,527
I was loosing confidence in you.

756
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,502
So... I thought,
‘Let's preserve the last of my pride...

757
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:26,819
Before I'm left, let's leave first. '

758
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:29,764
That's why I ran away.

759
00:47:31,588 --> 00:47:38,556
I was so afraid of what would happen
if you didn't grab hold of me.

760
00:47:40,006 --> 00:47:43,144
You are like a fox.

761
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,559
Thank you for holding
onto me till the very end.

762
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:52,662
The weather is nice.

763
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,274
It's refreshing.

764
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:07,998
Late at night, in a closed surrounding
you two only played with blocks?

765
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:11,166
- We ate ramen too.
- Just ramen at midnight?

766
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:15,017
Was there any skinship?

767
00:48:15,848 --> 00:48:17,541
We did hug.

768
00:48:17,656 --> 00:48:21,091
You are trying to kill the guy, aren't you?

769
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:25,175
Girls really don't know guys.

770
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:28,358
The thing that comes to a girl
only maybe once per day,

771
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:31,883
Comes to a guy many times each day.

772
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,791
What is that thing?

773
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:38,180
You know when guys in the morning
get again and again.

774
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:43,062
You know hot, hot.

775
00:48:43,476 --> 00:48:46,779
Are you getting the grasp?

776
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:48,501
Really?

777
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,110
You're again making me
passionate about teaching.

778
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:55,044
Then, what do you do at those times?

779
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:56,919
Me?

780
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:05,198
Its different every time.
I read a book or watch a video.

781
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:07,830
Jin Ha Rim!

782
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,339
What are you saying to her?

783
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,647
I'm trying to make you feel comfortable.

784
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:25,433
Truthfully, every night you are
always like this with her.

785
00:49:25,668 --> 00:49:27,630
But your body feels different.

786
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:31,661
But why are you teaching her that yourself?

787
00:49:31,743 --> 00:49:32,599
I know.

788
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:36,125
It smells. The upstairs bathroom
is blocked up again.

789
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,442
Noonim. Eun Chan Noonim.
Can you fix the toilet?

790
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:40,988
Eun Chan noonim.
Fix the toilet.

791
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,426
Eun Chan, can you get me a bag of flour
from the basement?

792
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:49,794
Hey! Don't you have hands and feet?
Fix the bathroom, bring the flour!

793
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,712
You guys don't even do anything.

794
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,804
Why are you guys bossing around the poor child!

795
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,886
Hey! Jin Ha Rim!

796
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:58,759
Don't ever talk about how guys are...
whatever to Eun Chan, okay?

797
00:49:58,882 --> 00:50:00,884
You're too harsh.

798
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:03,165
I'm teaching her the facts of life.

799
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,389
My Chan is originally in charge of
the upstairs bathroom. So, what's with you?

800
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:09,538
My Chan? Why is Eun Chan your My Chan?
She's My Chan!

801
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,762
She is a girl.
Is it too hard to be considerate of her?

802
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,862
I call My Chan. My Chan.
Then what do I call her? Madam?

803
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:24,014
He cares too much.

804
00:50:24,118 --> 00:50:29,974
Consideration? I'll do that.
Since she is the wife!

805
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,804
This heavy thing. Give it to me.

806
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:38,003
Madam, sit down here.

807
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,514
Drink this.

808
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:47,693
What are you doing?

809
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,121
We're being considerate.

810
00:50:49,352 --> 00:50:52,504
Tell the boss about us.
About how considerate we were.

811
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:53,630
What are you talking about?

812
00:50:53,725 --> 00:50:56,009
The sun is strong.
Your face is going to get burned.

813
00:50:56,104 --> 00:50:57,531
Why are you doing this?

814
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,868
<i>What are you doing up there?</i>

815
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,148
We're being considerate to your wife!

816
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,924
I don't want it. Stop it.

817
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:14,640
Your wife is coming down.

818
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,478
Did you tell them to do it?

819
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:24,278
Why did you do it?

820
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,906
Because you seem tired.

821
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:31,695
Hold on.

822
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,873
Yes, mom. I was going to call.

823
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:40,268
I'll visit on the weekend.

824
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,210
<i>Go the airport tomorrow.</i>

825
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,754
Why the airport?

826
00:51:43,904 --> 00:51:45,822
<i>Your birth father is leaving tomorrow.</i>

827
00:51:45,961 --> 00:51:48,723
<i>If you let him leave like this
you will feel bad too.</i>

828
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,726
He's leaving tomorrow?

829
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:01,662
Really?

830
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:02,961
Did you meet Yoo Ju unni?

831
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:05,989
No, I talked to Han Sung hyung.

832
00:52:06,245 --> 00:52:09,069
They want to have dinner with us.
At Han Sung hyung's place.

833
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:10,953
Can I go?

834
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:14,136
Did Yoo Ju unni say I can come?

835
00:52:14,308 --> 00:52:17,129
It's okay if you go but when
you're there don't eat a lot.

836
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,130
Don't scare them away.

837
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:22,214
They already know I eat a lot.

838
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,414
I should bring a watermelon tomorrow.

839
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,476
You heard my phone conversation, right?

840
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,399
My dad's friend.

841
00:52:32,538 --> 00:52:36,584
He's leaving on the morning plane tomorrow
so my mom told me to go see him.

842
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:37,775
Yes.

843
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:40,645
Isn't she a angel?

844
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:44,616
She calls me and tells me to go see him.

845
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,527
Are you listening?

846
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:53,609
I was thinking.

847
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,610
How come there is a lot of things I don't know.

848
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,853
<i>I don't know if I should say cheer up.</i>

849
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:02,631
I don't know what to say to you.

850
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:06,421
I would feel the same too.

851
00:53:06,622 --> 00:53:08,464
What would you say.

852
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:10,598
Did I tell you this before?

853
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:13,645
No, if I say it you are going
to brag about yourself.

854
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:15,189
I won't say it.

855
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:18,261
What? You're making me curious.

856
00:53:19,382 --> 00:53:23,494
Well its...

857
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:27,495
Your phone voice is good.

858
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,495
Good night.

859
00:53:31,912 --> 00:53:35,462
She's playing with me.

860
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:45,283
What?

861
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:49,684
I wanted to say see off your father well.

862
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,683
I should of stayed quiet.
Why did I say it?

863
00:53:54,824 --> 00:53:57,358
I'll have a good meeting.

864
00:53:57,893 --> 00:54:00,048
Thank you, Go Eun Chan.

865
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:16,236
There's only a few days left until he leaves.

866
00:55:07,923 --> 00:55:10,039

Yes, Han Kyul.

872
00:55:45,641 --> 00:55:50,375
I want to see you.
Can I go see you right now?

873
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:02,899
How did you know I was leaving today?

874
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:06,255
My mom told me.

875
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:08,538
Did you eat breakfast?

876
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:14,981
Breakfast is important to people who work.

877
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:25,270
Truthfully, few days ago I met your dad.

878
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:29,999
I heard what happened to you
during the past few years.

879
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:33,810
I thought I would not be able
to see you before I left.

880
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:37,347
When are you coming back?

881
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:42,057
If I come back, are you going
to happily greet me?

882
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,469
How tall are you?

883
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:04,149
I'm about 184cm.

884
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:16,822
This is my contact information.

885
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,726
If there is a chance you're at Australia,
it would be good if you can call me.

886
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:27,796
Well, take care of yourself.

887
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:34,147
Excuse me.

888
00:57:36,512 --> 00:57:39,319
I heard you had a son.

889
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:41,583
What is his name?

890
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:47,126
Han Young. Lee Han Young.
He just turned 20.

891
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:52,448
He's tall as you.
You guys look alike too.

892
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,410
Hello?

893
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:49,406
Choi Han Kyul at 6:30,

894
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:52,407
Drank Go Eun Chan's milk
and got strength.

895
00:58:52,626 --> 00:58:55,518
<i>And at 8:10am, arrived at the airport.</i>

896
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:58,801
At 8:20am, I met my birth father.

897
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:03,815
At 8:50am, we shook hands and I never cried.

898
00:59:04,116 --> 00:59:08,037
and saw him off well.

899
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:12,796
Right now, it's 9:10am and Choi Han Kyul
is on his way to meet his grandmother.

900
00:59:13,005 --> 00:59:18,882
After I report the sales,
I predict I will arrive at the café after 12.

901
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,758
We didn't even complete the three months.

902
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:24,427
What's the hurry that
you are already reporting?

903
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,961
<i>Can you come a little early?</i>

904
00:59:27,235 --> 00:59:28,975
Eun Chan.

905
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:31,719
Yes.

906
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,570
Let's tell each other everything.

907
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,991
<i>About what?</i>

908
00:59:36,237 --> 00:59:38,593
Just everything.

909
00:59:39,069 --> 00:59:40,304
Saying that we love each other,

910
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:42,289
<i>about being sad, missing each other,</i>

911
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,362
<i>being mad at each other, hating each other.</i>

912
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:46,708
Everything.

913
00:59:47,371 --> 00:59:51,353
Let's don't make it so we can't do
anything for each other.

914
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:54,446
<i>because we don't know
anything about each other.</i>

915
00:59:54,616 --> 00:59:57,540
And don't make our hearts
hurt because of this.

916
00:59:57,695 --> 01:00:00,325
Let's say everything. All right?

917
01:00:01,566 --> 01:00:04,633
Okay. I will tell you everything.

918
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:10,180
I won't stay quiet and tell you everything.

919
01:00:10,322 --> 01:00:11,932
Everything.

920
01:00:12,301 --> 01:00:14,598
Okay, that's good.

921
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:41,084
<i>Habit.</i>

922
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,069
A shell-less habit.

923
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,698
<i>You have to be very grateful for Eun Chan.</i>

924
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:48,527
<i>She breathe life back into an empty person.</i>

925
01:00:49,336 --> 01:00:50,486
<i>I like Go Eun Chan.</i>

926
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:52,638
<i>Although I was confused at first,</i>

927
01:00:53,409 --> 01:00:56,909
<i>the more I see her, the more she looks cuter,
seems great, and becomes prettier.</i>

928
01:00:57,063 --> 01:01:00,863
<i>So you're mad. Why say you're not going,
when you are?</i>

929
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:03,170
<i>We have a baby.</i>

930
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:07,925
<i>Our responsibility has suddenly increased.
It's a strange feeling.</i>
