How is this any different?

148
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:06,842
A nanny is someone
you trust to take care
of your baby after it<i>'</i>s born<i>:</i>

149
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:12,044
A surrogate mother is someone

remove the stigma

How do you mean?

159
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,380
Just that you have

that I<i>'</i>m so good at my job<i>:</i>

1001
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,915
What is this,
a taste test?

1002
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,920
No, actuaIIy,
I wouIdn<i>'</i>t do that
if I were you<i>:</i>

1003
00:54:37,988 --> 00:54:40,650
No, that<i>:::</i>
That<i>'</i>s not<i>:::</i>

1004
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:42,419
It<i>'</i>s horribIe<i>:</i>
Not very good<i>:</i>

1005
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:46,087
It<i>'</i>s a combination
of papaya juice and coffee<i>:</i>

1006
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:48,461
I keep this notepad
by my bed in
the middIe of the night,

1007
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:50,500
and I write down
these ideas
when I<i>'</i>m haIf asIeep,

1008
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,057
and they never
make any sense<i>:</i>

1009
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,500
I do that, too<i>:</i>

1010
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:57,097
And then I wake up,
and I have these IittIe notes
that say things Iike,

1011
00:54:57,174 --> 00:55:01,543
<i>''</i>make everybody be twins<i>''</i>
and <i>''</i>eIectric toiIet<i>:''</i>

1012
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:03,671
Those are not
good ideas<i>:</i>

1013
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:04,907
They<i>'</i>re reaIIy not<i>:</i>

1014
00:55:06,216 --> 00:55:11,381
So why are you out so Iate?
Are you a prostitute

1015
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:13,150
No<i>:</i>

1016
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:16,989
I went out tonight
for the first time
in a Iong time,

1017
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,824
and I Iet a friend

You<i>'</i>re being nice<i>:</i>
Thank you<i>:</i>

1031
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:15,278

1032
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,819
I mean, they<i>'</i>re not

They<i>'</i>re the Exxon
of frozen juice companies<i>:</i>

1034
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,253

a MichaeI Moore
documentary about that<i>:</i>

1035
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:27,419
That<i>'</i>s embarrassing<i>:</i>

1036
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:31,524
So is that offer
to get together some time
stiII on the tabIe?

1037
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:34,229
Are you asking me out?

1038
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:36,465
Yes, I think I am<i>:</i>

1039
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,906
Okay, yes,
then, yes<i>:</i> Yeah<i>:</i>

Great<i>:</i>

1041
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:42,042
This came off my head<i>:</i>

1042
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:43,306
Some of that
hair<i>'</i>s reaI, right?

1043
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,814
No<i>:</i> I<i>'</i>m baId<i>:</i> I<i>'</i>m<i>:::</i>

1044
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:48,715

So we got that

1045
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,982
Hi, CarI<i>:</i>

1046
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:56,355

I toId you to
stay away from me<i>:</i>

1048
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:00,763
You think

payday without me?

1049
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:03,299
No way<i>:</i>
I want my haIf, okay?

1050
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:06,028
And I<i>'</i>ve got insurance,

You probabIy peed on it<i>:</i>

1052

But I<i>'</i>II teII you this<i>:</i>

1053
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,564
It<i>'</i>s gonna raise
a Iot of questions

1054
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:12,733
when Kate takes
this down to the Iab,

1055
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:14,743
and they start doing
DNA tests with <i>CSI</i> stuff,

1056
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:16,642
and moIecuIes and proteins
and the hair foIIicIes,

1057
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:18,044
and they<i>'</i>re gonna
connect the dots<i>:</i>

1058
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,480
And then you<i>'</i>re
gonna be busted<i>:</i>

1059
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:22,518
CarI, I don<i>'</i>t wanna do
any of this anymore<i>:</i>

1060
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:25,978

1061
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:29,355
You wanna give me back

1062
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:31,087

this reIationship<i>'</i>s over,

1064
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,125

1065
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,393

1069
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:50,836

to you proper, okay?
We owe that to one another<i>:</i>

1070
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:52,848
Can we pIease

1071
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:54,281
What?

1072
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:58,481
You know what?

My girI rocks?
My girI does not rock, okay?

1075
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:05,919
My girI is a divorcee<i>:</i>

1076
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:07,520
So I hope

1077
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:11,693
<i>'</i>cause you just said goodbye
to the cooIest thing
that ever happened to you<i>:</i>

1078
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:18,801
I<i>'</i>m gonna bang your friends<i>:</i>
Consider them aII banged<i>:</i>

1079
00:58:57,147 --> 00:59:00,139
The reason I caIIed you
coIIect is <i>'</i>cause it<i>'</i>s gonna
take more than a few quarters

1080
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:02,981
to express how I feeI
about you, baby<i>:</i>

1081
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:05,078
Hey, where you going?

1082
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:12,760
I knew something was up
when I saw you beating
your baby bump Iike that<i>:</i>

1083
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,560
It wasn<i>'</i>t supposed
to happen Iike this<i>:</i>

1084
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,397
Everything just
got way out of hand<i>:</i>

1085
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,174
I think
I<i>'</i>m just gonna spIit<i>:</i>

1086
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:28,643
That<i>'</i>s a good idea<i>:</i>

1087
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:30,043
Just sIip away
in the dead of night

1088
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:31,637
and Ieave Kate thinking
you stoIe the baby<i>:</i>

1089
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:33,205
That wouId destroy her<i>:</i>

1090
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:35,877
This ain<i>'</i>t some IittIe scam
where you just caII up
Domino<i>'</i>s and be Iike,

some church youth event<i>:</i>
I need 10 free pizzas<i>:''</i>

1092
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:41,388
Why, does that work?

1093
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:44,916
You<i>'</i>re Iying
about the existence
of a human being<i>:</i>

1094
00:59:44,995 --> 00:59:48,954
If you don<i>'</i>t teII her,
you<i>'</i>II never be abIe
to Iive with yourseIf<i>:</i>

1095
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:51,057
Maybe you can teII her

1096
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:52,829
I<i>'</i>II teII you

1099
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,603
I got a surprise

You gotta put
that through the agency<i>:</i>

1106
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,624
No, it<i>'</i>s not gonna bounce<i>:</i>
Don<i>'</i>t you trust me?

1107
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:30,868
Where are we going?

1108
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,306
You have
an uItrasound appointment<i>:</i>

1113
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:45,987
I hope the baby<i>'</i>s

What if it has

Yay!

1139
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:58,757

It<i>'</i>s CarI<i>'</i>s<i>:</i>

1141
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:04,956
So the procedure thing<i>:::</i>

1142
01:02:05,035 --> 01:02:06,832
Didn<i>'</i>t take<i>:</i>

1143
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:08,962
And then I was crying,
so CarI and I did it<i>:</i>

1144
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,506
And it<i>'</i>s just country<i>:</i>

1145
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:11,835
I missed a coupIe periods,

1146
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:14,376
and I thought maybe it was
my hormones, you know
what I<i>'</i>m taIking about?

1147
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:15,570
No, I don<i>'</i>t know
nothing about that<i>:</i>

1148
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:17,772
But then I started spotting,
and I thought
that was my period,

1149
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:19,144
but usuaIIy I don<i>'</i>t
have a heavy fIow<i>:</i>

1150
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,012
(SHUSHING) Stop it<i>:</i>

1151
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:24,485
My boobs didn<i>'</i>t hurt,

<i>''</i>It<i>'</i>s not my period<i>:::''</i>

1152
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,920
You know what?
Look, I<i>'</i>m just gonna

1153
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,457
I<i>'</i>m not discussing

it<i>'</i>s a beautifuI thing
and aII that,

1155
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,955
but it<i>'</i>s disgusting, okay?

1156
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:33,620
And I<i>'</i>m afraid
if we keep
taIking about it,

1157
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:36,688
that our cycIes

You better start Iearning<i>:</i>

1163
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:53,241
It<i>'</i>s good
if the kid<i>'</i>s raised here,
though, you know?

1164
01:02:53,316 --> 01:02:57,252
Better schooI,
better apartment,

1165
01:02:59,622 --> 01:03:01,681
Is that what you want?

Nice to meet you<i>:</i>
Hi, nice to meet you<i>:</i>

And this is
our mother, Rose<i>:</i>

Hi, nice to meet you<i>:</i>

How do you do?

So, teII me,
once the baby is born,

1455
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:56,249
wiII you just go away,

1457
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:58,450
What?

1458
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:02,088
This is a reasonabIe question<i>:</i>
AII my friends are asking<i>:</i>

1459
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:03,825
KATE: WeII, we haven<i>'</i>t
reaIIy taIked about it<i>:</i>

1460
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:05,457
No, there<i>'</i>s not
a Iot of stuff
we<i>'</i>ve taIked about,

1461
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:07,195
we have a Iot of stuff
to taIk about<i>:</i>

1462
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:09,965
I think Angie might want
to visit the baby
a few times a year<i>:</i>

1463
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:13,031
You know, or I might be
out of town, I don<i>'</i>t know
where I<i>'</i>m going<i>:</i>

1464
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,804
ANGIE: I mean, I think
I<i>'</i>ve got pIans,
but I<i>'</i>II definiteIy caII<i>:</i>

1465
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:18,608
Summer, if we<i>'</i>re on vacation,
maybe Angie wouId want to
come with us some time<i>:</i>

1466
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:19,909
And who knows where
we<i>'</i>re going to be
in a year?

1467
01:17:19,982 --> 01:17:22,382
I think it<i>'</i>s reaIIy important
that she remain a part
of the baby<i>'</i>s Iife<i>:</i>

1468
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:25,113
Yeah, you know,
or compIeteIy separate<i>:</i>

baby shower,

1474
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:52,640
just, you haven<i>'</i>t caIIed me

I did something wrong<i>:</i>

1475
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:54,478
No, you didn<i>'</i>t do anything<i>:</i>

1476
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,211
Is it because
I wanted to introduce you
to my kid?

1477
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:57,775
No, Rob, I just<i>:::</i>

1478
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:00,048
I think you and I
view the worId differentIy<i>:</i>

1479
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,590
Bad news peopIe,
party<i>'</i>s over<i>:</i>

01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,219
Start heading
for the door<i>:</i>
Who Iet him in here?

1481
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,262
CarI, don<i>'</i>t say
something stupid<i>:</i>

1482
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:09,297
She hasn<i>'</i>t toId you<i>:</i>

1483
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:11,030
I thought since
you guys were
best friends,

1484
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,362
she probabIy
toId you everything<i>:</i>

1485
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:14,527
Shut your mouth, CarI<i>:</i>
What is going on?

1486
01:18:14,603 --> 01:18:16,833
She<i>'</i>s not even pregnant, okay?

1487
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:18,835
I mean, Iook<i>:</i>

1488
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:21,337
Angie what is that?

1489
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:23,510
FeeI it<i>:</i>

1490
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,241
It<i>'</i>s moving<i>:</i>
Yeah, it<i>'</i>s a baby<i>:</i>

1491
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:29,712
And it<i>'</i>s yours<i>:</i>

1492
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:31,076
What are you saying?

1493
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:32,177
Kate,

1494
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,814
I reaIIy tried to
make you a baby,
I swear<i>:</i>

1495
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:35,982
What are you saying?

1496
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:37,184
We took a test

1497
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,853
as soon as we got home,
and the procedure didn<i>'</i>t work<i>:</i>

1498
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:43,398
And I was reaI,
you know, horny,
because of aII the hormones<i>:</i>

1499
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:45,023
So we did it<i>:</i>

1500
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:46,528
I feIt Iike a faiIure<i>:</i>

1501
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:48,331
And CarI toId me
you were going
to get somebody eIse<i>:</i>

1502
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:51,100
Those hormones can aIso
give you a faIse negative<i>:</i>

1503
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:54,404
That<i>'</i>s why they want you
to wait two weeks
before you take a test<i>:</i>

1504
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,671
Wait, what?
So she might
not be pregnant?

1505
01:18:56,745 --> 01:18:58,804
Yo, where you
escape from, man?

1506
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:02,180
I<i>'</i>m saying
the baby might be CarI<i>'</i>s,
but it might stiII be mine<i>:</i>

1507
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,843
Okay, then
forget what I said<i>:</i>

1508
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:04,943
I<i>'</i>m trying to
pIay catch-up here<i>:</i>

1509
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,284
So you get
your sister pregnant,

1510
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:09,324
but she sIept with him?
No, she<i>'</i>s not my sister<i>:</i>

1511
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:13,350
She<i>'</i>s an ignorant
white trash woman
that I paid to carry my kid<i>:</i>

1512
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,824
I deserve that<i>:</i>

1513
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:16,887
No, you don<i>'</i>t<i>:</i>

1514
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,023
How couId you do that?

1515
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,533
This is why I didn<i>'</i>t
caII you back, Rob,

1516
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:22,263
because this is
the kind of seIfish,
science fiction shit

1517
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:23,861
that you don<i>'</i>t
want any part of<i>:</i>

1518
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,375
WeII, the upside is,
it Iooks Iike
I might be a dad<i>:</i>

1519
01:19:28,444 --> 01:19:30,912
So if it<i>'</i>s a boy,
I want to marry you<i>:</i>

1520
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,003
Oh, my God<i>:</i>

1521
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:34,877
What?

1522
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:37,114
I<i>'</i>m so sorry
about what<i>'</i>s happened<i>:</i>

1523
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:39,814
But I think it<i>'</i>s best
to wait untiI the pregnancy
is far enough aIong

1524
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:42,880
for DNA testing,
before we do
anything drastic<i>:</i>

01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:43,947
(EXCLAIMS)

1526
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,259
That was quite a kick<i>:</i>

1527
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:47,420
How can you
be pregnant?

1528
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:49,657
Your eggs are
from the <i>'</i>40s<i>:</i>

1529
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:52,631
You<i>'</i>re upset<i>:</i>

1530
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:55,431
And you<i>'</i>re saying
hurtfuI things<i>:</i>
It<i>'</i>s understandabIe<i>:</i>

1531
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:58,272
We<i>'</i>II have
a DNA sampIe
sent to the Iab<i>:</i>

1532
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,900
The rest wiII be
handIed in famiIy court<i>:</i>

1533
01:20:00,976 --> 01:20:05,572
Of course, if the baby
turns out not to be yours,
we<i>'</i>II waive our fees<i>:</i>

1534
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:09,376
What about aII
the background checks?

1535
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:11,885
Passed<i>:</i>
With fIying coIors<i>:</i>

1536
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:15,013
You were Iiving with her,
and you didn<i>'</i>t
notice anything<i>:</i>

1537
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,819
She fooIed us, Kate<i>:</i>

1538
01:20:16,892 --> 01:20:18,587
She fooIed us aII<i>:</i>

1539
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,623
I fooIed myseIf<i>:</i>

1540
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:36,471
I booked you a room here,
untiI we sort this out<i>:</i>

1541
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,276
So you<i>'</i>re done with me,
