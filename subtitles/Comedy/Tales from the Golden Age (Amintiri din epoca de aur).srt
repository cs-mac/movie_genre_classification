1
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:18,688
Tales From
The Golden Age

2
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:47,569
Urban legends from the Ceausescu era,

3
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:50,889
also called "The Golden Age",
in communist propaganda.

4
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:57,402
The legend of the air sellers

5
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:00,519
All her classmates are going.

6
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,358
Your soup's on the table, dear.

7
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:07,487
So when are you going
to this holiday camp?

8
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:08,637
It's not a camp.

9
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:13,165
May 1st is a Thursday this year
and we've no school on Friday.

10
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,761
You're going on your own?

11
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:17,806
Teachers are coming,
but we've organized it.

12
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:19,727
And where will you stay?

13
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:22,636
At the Forum, in Costinesti.

14
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,761
The Forum costs 300 lei?

15
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:29,716
It's 300 lei all included:
Transport, meals, everything.

16
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,802
Listen, we'd like you to go,

17
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:36,040
but this Monday
we have to pay an advance

18
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,278
on the Dacia and we're a bit short.

19
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,481
So, can I go or not?

20
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:45,167
Yes, but stay at aunt Didina's
in Constanta.

21
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:48,844
It takes half an hour
to go to Costinesti by bus.

22
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,877
You've been saving money
for this crappy car for years.

23
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,481
It'll be yours one day.

24
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:57,606
Better to take the bus
than eat yoghurt all your life.

25
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,123
Crina!

26
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:10,684
Crina!

27
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:13,801
Coming to the party?

28
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,038
No. I've just had a fight
with Dad.

29
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,961
Come on, they have a video player.

30
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:21,278
Shall I ring at your door?

31
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,047
No, don't bother.

32
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:24,927
Shall I wait for you?

33
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,805
I'm coming down.

34
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,716
I'm going down to talk to Roxana.

35
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,124
Don't you have
a French test tomorrow?

36
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,880
I've studied all week.

37
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:45,286
Be back by 10.

38
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,484
- Is he a student?
- I think so.

39
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:52,367
He's lent our block
his video player.

40
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,007
What's his name?

41
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:55,442
Bughi, I think.

42
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:58,361
I was trembling so much
I forgot my own name.

43
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,758
- He's damn gorgeous!
- Shut up!

44
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:26,403
Hi, what's your name?

45
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,285
Crina.

46
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,121
Crina, what a nice name.
Shall we dance?

47
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:31,118
No.

48
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,323
Why?

49
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,683
I don't want to.

50
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,803
Later, maybe?

51
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,287
Maybe.

52
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,646
Make room for my friend.

53
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,163
This is Bughi.

54
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,761
- Crina.
- Bughi.

55
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:34,197
What film is it?

56
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,801
Bonnie and Clyde.

57
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:46,036
Didn't you ask me
for a bottle today?

58
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:50,518
You said you were from
the People's Council.

59
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,721
Give me a smoke.

60
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,687
I'm going.

61
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,201
Stay...

62
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,407
Wait, where are you going?

63
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:31,921
Where's Roxana?

64
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:34,443
- Who's Roxana?
- Your date!

65
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,486
She's a nice girl
but she's not my date.

66
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:43,804
Listen, I'm not hitting on you
or anything,

67
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:46,477
I just wanted to say sorry
for today.

68
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,640
I don't usually do that
in my neighborhood, but...

69
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,161
Do what?

70
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,521
You know,
knocking on doors and...

71
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:57,801
So, what's the trick?

72
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,761
You want to know?

73
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,361
You've made me curious.

74
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,167
It's a long story.

75
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:05,966
Make it short.

76
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:09,683
It's a trick to make money.

77
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:12,043
I've got that much.
But what's the scheme?

78
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,085
You want to know too much.

79
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,799
Afraid I'll steal your trick?

80
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,083
You never know...

81
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,328
Come on,
I need to earn some money, fast!

82
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,043
Then work for it like honest folk.

83
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,081
Is that what you do?

84
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,201
Never mind me.

85
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,566
So, you won't tell me.

86
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:33,357
You have the time?

87
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,405
I've got to be home by 10.

88
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:36,683
You smoke?

89
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,446
Afraid your dad will smell it?

90
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,087
How did you guess?

91
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,726
I've got to go.

92
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,924
You can come with me if you want.

93
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:52,722
Can I?

94
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:54,037
You got the nerve?

95
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,924
Depends. What do I have to do?

96
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,362
You'll see.

97
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:00,717
Ok.

98
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:01,957
You free tomorrow?

99
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,880
I've got school in the morning.

100
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,561
School...

101
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,765
- After school, then!
- Ok.

102
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,241
- Bye.
- Bye.

103
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,444
What are you doing with that book?

104
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:35,484
Book?

105
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,560
The biology book
under your desk.

106
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:41,126
I wanted some more paper.

107
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,560
You haven't even started yet.

108
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,639
He has no inspiration, Miss.

109
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:47,162
Quiet!

110
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,958
Give me that book

111
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,800
so you're not distracted.

112
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:54,359
Yes?

113
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:55,722
Good afternoon.

114
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:59,642
Sorry to interrupt. Crina's father
from the factory sent me...

115
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:00,638
And?

116
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:03,726
The boiler in their block blew
and flooded the apartment.

117
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:06,800
She has to go home
and unlock the door.

118
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,048
We're in the middle of a test.

119
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,846
I've finished.

120
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:13,363
Alright.

121
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:15,847
You can go, then.

122
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,127
Is that your car?

123
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,163
It's the first one
I found unlocked.

124
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,040
Any particular block?

125
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:28,566
Don't say a word.
Just watch.

126
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,644
- Right?
- Yes.

127
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,205
Wait there, on the stairs.

128
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:04,882
Be quiet, Tarzan!

129
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:07,004
Good afternoon.

130
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:09,796
I'm from
the Ministry of Chemistry.

131
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:10,764
Yes?

132
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:13,840
I need to know
if your tap water's fine, Madam?

133
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,238
I mean, does it taste alright?

134
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:22,036
Citizens have complained about
the water, so we're doing a study.

135
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,281
Yes, it's cloudy.

136
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:27,087
Can we take a sample
from your apartment,

137
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,921
to test it?

138
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:33,198
Come after two o'clock
when my husband's home.

139
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:37,600
I have to give the samples
to the Ministry by two o'clock.

140
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:39,647
I don't know...

141
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:43,721
My husband did lodge a complaint,
but I know nothing about it.

142
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:47,881
It's very simple, you just have to
give me a bottle of tap water.

143
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,636
A bottle of tap water?

144
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:50,558
Yes.

145
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,686
From the kitchen or the bathroom?

146
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,406
Either will do.

147
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,203
It's dirtier in the kitchen.

148
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,165
From the kitchen, then.

149
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:01,967
Ok. One moment please.

150
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,487
- Is a litre enough?
- A litre is perfect.

151
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,766
All this nonsense
just for a lousy bottle?

152
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,117
Listen...

153
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,567
What's your father do?

154
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,761
What's his job?

155
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,566
He's a technician.

156
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,123
What does he earn?

157
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,084
A bit more than a couple of grand.

158
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,481
Let's say he earns 2400 lei, ok?

159
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,717
Divided by 26 days...

160
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:52,367
That works out at...
10 lei an hour.

161
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:58,886
If I want, I can earn 20 an hour.

162
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:03,566
And I don't have a boss,
I don't stand around all day.

163
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:05,446
I work as much as I want...

164
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,997
But you can't afford to buy a car.

165
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,841
A car? Take it slowly.

166
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:12,882
You can buy a video player.

167
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:15,278
- No, you can't.
- Sure you can.

168
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,365
Is that how you bought yours?

169
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:21,561
A guy bought a scooter
just selling bottles.

170
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,127
I don't believe it.

171
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:24,723
I'm telling you!

172
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:28,643
Shall we go in?

173
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:41,681
How long will it take
to make 300 lei?

174
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,560
Depends how hard you work.

175
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,526
- If you collect 100 bottles a day...
- Impossible.

176
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,203
- Why not?
- Not enough hours in the day.

177
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:55,205
I'd like to give it a go.

178
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:57,880
You'd like to give it a go.

179
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,641
Good afternoon!

180
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:18,639
Ministry of Chemistry.

181
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,800
We're testing the tap water.

182
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:25,040
Go to the 9th floor,
talk to the administrator.

183
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:25,845
The 9th floor.

184
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:30,445
We spoke to him, he said
your tap water has sand in.

185
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,759
It looks like coffee!

186
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:38,679
The Ministry doesn't believe it.
Could you give us a sample?

187
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:41,043
Let them come and see
for themselves.

188
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,802
We'll sort it out quicker
if you give us some.

189
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:46,283
- A jar's ok?
- A bottle's better.

190
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:50,919
Come and take one yourself
so I don't make a mistake.

191
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,837
- Is this one ok?
- Excellent.

192
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,441
Would you like some jam?

193
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:05,878
No, thank you.

194
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:07,919
It's rose jam.

195
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:10,602
Thanks,
but I'm allergic to flowers.

196
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,038
Look at that!

197
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,598
You should see the laundry!

198
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,521
The sheets come out of the wash
with rust on.

199
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,360
- It's the same in the bathroom?
- It is!

200
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,246
Give us a bathroom sample too.

201
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,638
- In the same bottle?
- No, another one.

202
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:26,446
Let me look for one...

203
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,881
Why shouldn't we go in?

204
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,965
There could be someone else
in the house.

205
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,562
The husband, the son,

206
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,523
anybody...

207
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,363
You're afraid?

208
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:40,838
No, but a bottle
isn't worth the risk.

209
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,964
It's not for the bottle.

210
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:45,725
You know what I'm talking about.

211
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,358
Listen, I have an idea.

212
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:20,439
Ministry of Chemistry,
about pollution from the factory.

213
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,360
Have you any ID?

214
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,086
Yes, sure.

215
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,928
I left it in the car.
I'll go and get it.

216
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:34,681
No, here it is!

217
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,003
What's it about?

218
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,079
The quality of the air.

219
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:44,159
It stinks awfully.

220
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,762
Indeed, we've received
a complaint and...

221
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:49,123
A complaint?
I've lodged three myself!

222
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:51,438
We've received several...

223
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:56,124
May we take some samples
from your apartment?

224
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,160
Why? You don't believe me?

225
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:01,558
We do, but...

226
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:04,526
a chemical analysis of the air
is required...

227
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:06,327
And what should I do?

228
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,956
We'll take some air samples.
It'll take 2 minutes.

229
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,927
Come in, then.

230
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,727
Where does it smell worst?

231
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:19,686
The whole house stinks
but the living room's the worst.

232
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,679
Please!

233
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,960
Yes, you can smell it.

234
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:25,637
You have a cat?

235
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:27,844
A tomcat, but it's not his smell.

236
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:31,205
I know his smell,
this is from the plant.

237
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:32,721
I can smell ammonia.

238
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:36,358
Listen, I hang my socks out
to dry on the balcony

239
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,325
and in the morning
they're yellow.

240
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,645
You know what we need to do?

241
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,487
I'll take a sample
from the living room.

242
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:44,319
Please do!

243
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,160
Do you have a jar?

244
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,486
You mean a sterile jar?

245
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,684
Any jar will do.

246
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,447
Coming right up.

247
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:56,084
Will this do?

248
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:59,206
No, it smells of mustard.
We need a glass one.

249
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:00,278
A glass one?

250
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:02,598
Can you choose one?

251
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:04,599
Look up there!

252
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,517
- It's 75 cl.
- It's perfect.

253
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,801
But it still smells.
It had pickles in it.

254
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,562
It's fine, that won't alter it.

255
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,639
- And a lid!
- A lid.

256
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,281
It does smell in here.

257
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:22,679
The entire house stinks!
Please, take it!

258
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,322
Sorry...

259
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,200
I'll take a sample.

260
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:29,359
Please!

261
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:35,999
And from the living room too.

262
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:36,839
Please do!

263
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:39,966
Do you have
another bottle or jar?

264
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:42,605
- What about these?
- They're perfect.

265
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:46,602
They're clean.
My wife washed them to sell.

266
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:48,956
In the bathroom?

267
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,598
No point,
there's no window in there.

268
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,326
In the bedroom, then.

269
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:02,956
The smell goes up.

270
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:06,245
Of course,
air is light and rises!

271
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,961
Ok.

272
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,523
That's it?

273
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:20,083
We're finished.

274
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:21,398
Thank you.

275
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,445
It's great you're doing this.

276
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:26,361
I hope you don't mind me asking...

277
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:29,645
How come you don't get
the samples mixed up?

278
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,321
- How come?
- Yes.

279
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:32,683
Well...

280
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:38,398
Why do you think we asked you
for a jar for the kitchen,

281
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:41,605
a beer bottle for the bedroom,

282
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:42,883
and a ketchup jar

283
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,686
for the hall?

284
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:48,603
And what do you do
in three-room apartments?

285
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,166
We ask for champagne bottles.

286
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,444
They can afford to drink champagne.

287
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,566
Well done, kids.
You've thought of everything.

288
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,956
We're in a hurry.

289
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:00,323
Goodbye, then.

290
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,444
My ID, please.

291
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,120
Listen, do you think
we can make 300 lei by tonight?

292
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:25,843
I'll give you 300.

293
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,680
I don't want you to.

294
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,447
You can't earn that by tonight.

295
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:34,603
You bet?

296
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,326
- How much?
- 50 lei.

297
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,004
Deal!

298
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,518
- Any more?
- These here.

299
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,567
I'm not taking this one.

300
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:01,525
- Why not?
- It's not clean.

301
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,485
They were all washed!

302
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:07,163
Don't argue! I don't have to take
80 bottles from you.

303
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,724
You have to take them all.

304
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:13,119
I'll take as many as I can pay for,
alright?

305
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:19,201
194 lei and 50 bani.

306
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:21,437
Together or separate?

307
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,007
- Together.
- Separate.

308
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,766
I'll give it to you together

309
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,920
and you sort it out.

310
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,917
Don't come again
with so many bottles!

311
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:36,407
Thank you!

312
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,642
What if he remembers me?

313
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:45,718
It's not good.

314
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:48,364
The lower your profile, the better.

315
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:52,205
How often do you think
somebody comes with 100 bottles?

316
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,800
- Here.
- Forget it.

317
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,004
No, I lost.

318
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:01,876
How long would this take
to buy a car?

319
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,846
Years.

320
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:06,081
How many bottles?

321
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:06,998
For a Dacia?

322
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,080
Not a Dacia, say a Lastun.

323
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:14,002
You'd need 5 or 6000 bottles
for a Lastun, maybe more...

324
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:17,956
If you collect 500 bottles a month,
you can buy it in a year.

325
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,004
You can't.

326
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:22,479
For example, today, two people,
three blocks, 200 lei.

327
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:25,924
- We need to be more efficient.
- Yeah, we rob a bank.

328
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:27,880
Want to watch a video tonight?

329
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,959
I have to be home by 10.

330
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:32,756
- I'll talk to your father.
- Right, thanks.

331
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,242
I've got it!

332
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,002
Excuse me.

333
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,484
Could you explain it again?

334
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:17,400
What didn't you understand?

335
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:22,086
Why do we need samples
from every apartment?

336
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,002
Like I said,

337
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:27,285
we measure the degree of pollution
on each floor

338
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:29,006
on both sides of the block

339
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,636
to determine the cause
of the pollution.

340
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,483
It's from the chemical plant.

341
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,798
Why do we need to test it?

342
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,045
Can you detect
the chemicals by smell?

343
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,525
No, I can't.

344
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:45,998
So, we have to carry out tests

345
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:49,285
to determine the cause,
to find solutions.

346
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,804
When will you come
to collect it?

347
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,561
Whenever you're ready.

348
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,002
I don't know...

349
00:24:57,568 --> 00:25:01,163
I can put a note up
on the bulletin board,

350
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:03,877
because calling at every apartment

351
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:06,648
would take a week!

352
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,281
We need them on Thursday.

353
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:10,564
That's in two days time!

354
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,288
- I don't know...
- Comrade Administrator!

355
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:18,317
Workers' Day is coming up.
We'll celebrate it properly. Agreed?

356
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:22,080
Agreed. But you'll have to
pick the bottles up

357
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,558
and take them back yourselves.

358
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:27,083
There's no way I can do it.

359
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,118
We'll come and pick them up.

360
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:32,797
On Thursday at 11.

361
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:34,924
Yes, Comrade. Thursday at 11.

362
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:36,885
Goodbye.

363
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:41,564
I don't know
if this is going to work.

364
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,483
Why?

365
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:47,482
We fooled him today,
but if he checks...

366
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:51,043
That's why I said Thursday.

367
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:53,684
One phone call and we're done for.

368
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:57,760
It was your idea!

369
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,278
I didn't really think we'd do it.

370
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:05,363
If you want,
we'll just forget about it.

371
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:08,561
If they call the police,
we're in deep trouble.

372
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,606
I'd get at least five years.

373
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,407
You're fine, you're underage.

374
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,764
They'd get me for corrupting you.

375
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:26,200
If they send me to jail,
will you wait for me?

376
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:31,437
Will you?

377
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,405
Listen, I have to go.

378
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:40,806
You and your school!

379
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:54,837
Is it raining?

380
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:56,567
It's just started.

381
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:00,998
- What are you making?
- French toast.

382
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:07,047
What's this for?

383
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:08,522
Your holiday camp.

384
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:10,041
It's not a holiday camp.

385
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:13,041
Aren't you glad?

386
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:14,522
Of course I am.

387
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:17,844
What about the Dacia?

388
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:19,926
We'll manage.

389
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:27,167
Thanks.

390
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,761
I'm looking for Bughi.

391
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:42,037
Who's Bughi?

392
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:44,756
The boy with the video player.

393
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:48,284
Is Bughi the guy with the video?

394
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:49,722
No idea.

395
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:53,242
I won't come in.
Can you please get him?

396
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:01,917
What's up?

397
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:03,885
I want us to go tomorrow.

398
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:05,003
Where?

399
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:07,796
To collect those bottles.

400
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:13,036
Are you sure?

401
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,961
Well, I'm going.
You coming with me?

402
00:28:16,648 --> 00:28:17,763
Sure.

403
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,958
Thanks.

404
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,528
I'm going home now.
See you at the block at 11.

405
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:24,161
- At 11.
- Bye.

406
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,165
Will we have room for them all?

407
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:51,885
We can make a second trip.

408
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:05,404
I asked them to put them all
together in one apartment.

409
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:09,001
Good day, Mr. Albu.

410
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:10,840
We've come for the bottles.

411
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:12,407
Please, come in.

412
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:15,002
We can't. They're in a hurry.

413
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:18,285
How come? I've made some coffee.

414
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:20,484
Really, you needn't bother.

415
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:23,685
It's no bother, come in please.

416
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:28,526
You take that down
and I'll wait for you here.

417
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:30,599
I'll go check the next block.

418
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,360
Go on, we'll wait for you.

419
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:52,047
Where's Bughi?

420
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:54,318
- Where's Bughi?
- Who's Bughi?

421
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:56,598
- What?
- They called the police.

422
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,121
They're downstairs.

423
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:00,199
What's this about the police?

424
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:03,007
Nothing.
It'll be cleared up immediately.

425
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,965
Don't play games with me!

426
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:07,005
We're not playing games.

427
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:09,238
- Hold still!
- Let him go!

428
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:10,918
You damn thieves!

429
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:12,837
Catch them!

430
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:14,043
They're thieves!

431
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:16,678
Catch those thieves!

432
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:34,005
It's not far, we can jump!

433
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:35,357
Let's jump!

434
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:36,597
They're coming.

435
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:38,167
Calm down, will you?

436
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:40,637
- They'll catch us.
- They already have.

437
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,161
We can jump!

438
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:45,559
You think if you jump,
there's somewhere to run?

439
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:47,596
You're scared.

440
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:50,158
Yes, I'm scared. So what?

441
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:53,483
The police will take you to jail.

442
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:55,798
Nobody's going to put me in jail.

443
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,524
My uncle's a Party Secretary.
One call and I'm out.

444
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:01,764
- He's a Party Secretary?
- Yes.

445
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,044
Stay calm, I'll talk to them.

446
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:49,606
There's nothing to see.
Gentlemen, move along.

447
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:52,688
Go home now, folks.

448
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:25,798
Legend has it that
with the end of communism,

449
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:28,357
Romanians bought Dacia cars
with empty bottles

450
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:35,319
The legend of
the chicken driver

451
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,596
Fane!

452
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:54,886
Do you have any more to do?

453
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,158
This one and I'm done.

454
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:02,598
- Grigore!
- What?

455
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,721
You want some fish? My nephew's
coming from Babadag today.

456
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:11,078
My wife's fasting for Lent.

457
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,280
It's Annunciation on Sunday.
We can eat fish.

458
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:19,365
I'll get back to you.

459
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:48,037
What?

460
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:49,885
Fane asked if we want fish.

461
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,321
What kind?

462
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:54,719
Fresh fish. His nephew's
bringing it from Babadag.

463
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:56,196
How much is it?

464
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:59,002
- He didn't say.
- Ask him.

465
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:02,481
Hold this.

466
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,240
You're losing a button.

467
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,638
How many eggs can you get me?

468
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:38,961
Last year, they gave each employee
two boxes, but you never know.

469
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:43,118
I'll see if I can have
my nephew's as well.

470
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:45,439
Has he got used to his job?

471
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:47,598
A job's a job.

472
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:51,956
Listen...

473
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:55,115
I met this guy
from the printing house.

474
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,120
I can get you some red paint
for Easter eggs.

475
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:00,562
We have some left
from last year.

476
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:04,766
If I've no eggs for Easter,
my wife will kill me.

477
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,596
Vladut! It's Daktari!

478
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,122
Come on, Daktari's starting!

479
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,603
Good morning, Grigore.

480
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:09,396
Ionut!

481
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,476
Normally you have
no business in here.

482
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:22,435
But before you leave, come
and get the stuff for the road.

483
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:23,881
What stuff?

484
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:26,561
For the police, if they stop you.

485
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:28,763
- Even if it's all in order?
- Yes.

486
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:32,715
When they see the chicken truck,
they'll stop you.

487
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:34,482
What's in there?

488
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,558
Gizzards and a chicken.

489
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,242
This is Sebi, the new driver.

490
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:40,726
- Sebi.
- Ionut.

491
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:42,800
What are you doing for Easter?

492
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,645
I'm going to my Grandma's.

493
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:47,878
Can I take your eggs, then?

494
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:50,004
I'll have to ask Grandma.

495
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:53,679
Can you get me a lamb for Easter?

496
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,520
Folks don't keep sheep any more
but I'll ask around.

497
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,798
- You've already driven livestock?
- No.

498
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,965
Rule number one:
You can't stop for the night.

499
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:08,881
Whether you're going 100 km or 800,
you don't stop.

500
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,321
Not even to give them water?

501
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:12,443
No food, no water, nothing.

502
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,996
You just get to where
you're going.

503
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:18,036
Rule number two:
The chickens stay locked up.

504
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,762
The truck stays sealed.
Understood?

505
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:21,677
Yes.

506
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:26,081
If you have time,
you can stop and have some soup.

507
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,283
But it's better
to take your own food.

508
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:31,325
When you can,
ask for gizzards or livers.

509
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:34,285
Nobody will notice if you
take half for yourself.

510
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:36,517
It's harder with a whole chicken.

511
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,439
You've been doing this long?

512
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:42,485
I've been driving poultry
to Constanta since '84.

513
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:43,602
You never sleep?

514
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:47,077
I nap in the cabin,
if I really have to.

515
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:50,325
I've always made it
to the destination by night fall.

516
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,205
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

517
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:54,677
Listen...

518
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:58,603
Why must we arrive
at the destination the same day?

519
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,320
That's the rule!

520
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:51,836
Is the boss in?

521
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:53,156
She's busy.

522
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:54,646
I'd like a word with her.

523
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,399
Sit down, she'll come over.

524
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,524
- What's today's soup?
- Beef.

525
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:02,083
Cheers!

526
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:03,635
How are you, Grigore?

527
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:07,319
How's the road over here?

528
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:08,437
Fine.

529
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:15,683
I got stuck in the blizzard
on Saturday.

530
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:18,839
By the time I found a tractor,
my side mirrors had gone.

531
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,599
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

532
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:23,158
Gelu got stuck too.

533
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:24,886
Three sheep died in his truck.

534
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,883
Listen, do you think Gelu
can get me a lamb?

535
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:31,321
He's in hospital.

536
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:35,316
He collapsed and an ambulance
took him to hospital.

537
00:41:35,487 --> 00:41:36,761
What's wrong with him?

538
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,485
Something with his liver.

539
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,682
I'm surprised, he rarely drinks,
and then only plum brandy.

540
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:47,160
At least I'll die knowing
I drank and fucked all I wanted.

541
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,005
Where's the boss?

542
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:54,324
She's with the guy
from the county offices.

543
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:57,679
Easter is coming up,
they're getting supplies in.

544
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,280
Come on, we're starving!

545
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:01,846
I'm by myself.

546
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:04,043
Leave the soup. Fetch more bread.

547
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:07,285
The boss is busy.
You can give me the things.

548
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,081
Get a move on!

549
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:15,517
And some sugar,
20 kilos...

550
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:17,166
For you, Miss...

551
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:20,440
And a few hundred eggs?

552
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:23,207
Why do you need so many eggs?

553
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:26,484
We paint some
and bake Easter cakes.

554
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,638
I'll try and get
a couple of crates.

555
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,241
It's not easy to get eggs before Easter.

556
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:32,840
And Turkish delight?

557
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:36,198
- Excuse me, Camelia.
- I'm busy.

558
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,278
I've brought you some gizzards.

559
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:40,805
Can I give you some sugar?

560
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:43,243
We'll settle up another time.

561
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,284
You sell them separately now?

562
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:49,156
Ask Mariana for whatever you need.

563
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,757
I'll be back before Easter,
we'll see then.

564
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:56,725
You think you can get me
some eggs?

565
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,240
I said I would.

566
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:01,166
You said two crates.
I need more.

567
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:06,277
Sure, I'll get you some eggs.
Will 100 do?

568
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:07,880
If you can.

569
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:16,121
- Name?
- Radu Marian.

570
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:18,122
Radu Marian. Two.

571
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:21,124
- Hello, Grigore.
- Hello.

572
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:22,880
I'll take Ionut's eggs too.

573
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:24,605
Does he know about it?

574
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,325
Sure. I've talked to him.

575
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,398
And his second crate?

576
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:30,957
New employees only get one.

577
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:33,559
Hey, some people get extra?

578
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:37,197
Mind your own business.
They're for his nephew, Ionut.

579
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:20,960
No hot water?

580
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:23,123
No.

581
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,925
The food is on the table.

582
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:30,163
They gave us our eggs
for Easter tonight.

583
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:32,279
A crate each.

584
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:36,641
Maybe Ionut will give us his eggs.

585
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,159
You don't think they need them?

586
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:45,279
Bring me the pot of hot water
on the stove.

587
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,006
You stopped fasting?

588
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,998
The fish roe salad is for you.

589
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:19,396
Shall I pour it for you?

590
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,115
I'll do it.

591
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:17,761
The boss?

592
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,486
In the kitchen.

593
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:22,883
Yes.

594
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:24,876
May I?

595
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:25,957
Please.

596
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:27,480
I've brought the eggs.

597
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:29,960
I could only bring 60.

598
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:34,484
60 is fine. We can't find
any eggs at all round here.

599
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,521
Sit down.
Are you in a hurry?

600
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:39,200
No, you carry on.

601
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:03,239
Do you want some peas?

602
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:04,483
No, thanks.

603
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,319
Why? You're in a hurry?

604
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:08,643
I have to be at the port by 11 pm.

605
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:10,561
Why?

606
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,479
Just wondering.

607
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:15,281
Drivers usually stop here
for the night.

608
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:19,158
With poultry, you have to arrive
before nightfall.

609
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:20,760
They're very strict about it.

610
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:23,523
Isn't it hard?
Always on the road?

611
00:47:25,127 --> 00:47:27,482
You get used to everything.

612
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:30,645
But I'd like to retire
to a place like this.

613
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,718
Really? You like it here?

614
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:35,760
Fresh air, peace and quiet...

615
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,646
It isn't easy here, you know.

616
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,318
Isn't it hard,
doing everything by yourself?

617
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:43,681
Of course.

618
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:47,601
And with the food shortages,
it's a struggle.

619
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,640
And it's harder for a woman.

620
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:56,840
Doesn't the guy from the centre
keep you supplied?

621
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:59,442
With what he gives me...

622
00:47:59,607 --> 00:48:04,727
Selling to the public
brings in more money.

623
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:08,522
By the way,
can you get hold of some chicken?

624
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:12,396
It's not easy.

625
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:17,522
Why? Does somebody count
the chickens in your truck?

626
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,838
It's sealed and can't be opened
until delivery.

627
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,445
You've some flour...

628
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:31,717
I got you some sugar and flour,
for Easter.

629
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:33,081
Thanks.

630
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:17,526
I understand.

631
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:19,716
I understand.

632
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:23,044
They've been told I'll be late?
Should I call them?

633
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:24,803
Fine.

634
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,406
If Sebi brings the tyres
in the morning

635
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,842
I'll be at the port by noon.

636
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,480
Yes, I understand.

637
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:36,363
Bye.

638
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:41,243
So, you're spending the night?

639
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:06,036
It's open.

640
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,479
- A clean towel.
- Thank you.

641
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:11,605
The bathroom's in the hall.
A blanket's in the wardrobe.

642
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:12,756
Right.

643
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:45,046
Anything else?

644
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:47,004
No, you can go. Thanks.

645
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,236
Goodnight.

646
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:16,480
Leave that.
I'll clear it up later.

647
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:17,921
No problem.

648
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:29,117
- You need anything else?
- No.

649
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:39,201
Is the yeast good?

650
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:40,516
Yes.

651
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:51,283
With bad yeast,
you can knead away, it won't rise.

652
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:53,039
You know how to cook?

653
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:54,715
A little.

654
00:51:55,127 --> 00:51:58,437
Men who can cook
are few and far between.

655
00:51:59,247 --> 00:52:02,125
In a household, it's good to know
how to do everything.

656
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:13,836
If you want,
there's some wine left.

657
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:15,326
Thank you.

658
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,241
- Shall I pour you a glass?
- No.

659
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:22,999
I can't drink alone.

660
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:25,997
Ok, just a drop.

661
00:52:37,847 --> 00:52:39,200
Cheers.

662
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,806
You can take the bottle
to your room.

663
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:04,041
I've had enough.

664
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,964
Goodnight.

665
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:57,402
Camelia? Come here.

666
00:54:58,567 --> 00:54:59,636
What is it?

667
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:01,399
I've brought you more eggs.

668
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:03,722
Where from?

669
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,605
The chickens in the truck.

670
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:08,520
You opened it!

671
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:11,884
They told me to give them water
before I leave.

672
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:15,879
And what happens
to all those eggs?

673
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:21,445
I don't know.
I never opened the truck before.

674
00:55:21,607 --> 00:55:24,804
Are you taking the chickens
to another farm?

675
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:28,399
I don't know.
They're for export.

676
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:31,479
And how many chickens
do you have in your truck?

677
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:36,076
Well, there are 400 cages...

678
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:39,683
So there must be
2000 or 3000 chickens.

679
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:42,686
Why?

680
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,246
Just thinking...

681
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:47,877
You have a 1000 lei's worth of eggs.

682
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,601
Possibly.

683
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:53,721
Know what?

684
00:55:54,007 --> 00:55:56,760
I could sell them like that,
with Easter coming.

685
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,838
But they're not mine.

686
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:00,806
Whose are they, then?

687
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,000
You think anybody's
going to ask for them?

688
00:56:07,887 --> 00:56:09,718
I don't know. Why risk it?

689
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:13,241
You could earn a few thousand lei.

690
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:17,166
I'm not desperate for money.

691
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:21,603
Besides, I have to deliver
by noon.

692
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,124
Gathering all those eggs
takes time.

693
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,166
It's up to you.

694
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:31,039
But it's a shame to waste them
before Easter.

695
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,486
Coming to bed?

696
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:52,522
No.

697
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:56,206
You're driving tomorrow?

698
00:57:56,567 --> 00:57:57,397
Yes.

699
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:00,720
To Constanta?

700
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:02,357
Yes.

701
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:54,646
Hello.

702
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:56,001
How are you?

703
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,725
Very busy.

704
00:58:57,887 --> 00:58:58,683
How's business?

705
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:01,964
Could be better
but I'm not complaining.

706
00:59:02,127 --> 00:59:03,685
- Did you manage...
- What?

707
00:59:04,047 --> 00:59:06,641
To sell those eggs?
Like hotcakes.

708
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:09,321
I could've sold twice as many.

709
00:59:13,407 --> 00:59:15,602
- Are you busy?
- Yes, but go on in.

710
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:19,646
I've brought a cake I made
and a bottle of wine.

711
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:23,436
There's people waiting outside.
I won't be free for a while.

712
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:24,517
How long?

713
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:25,722
You're in a hurry?

714
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:27,559
I have to be at the port by 7.

715
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:29,599
You're not staying tonight?

716
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,644
I can't.

717
00:59:32,847 --> 00:59:36,237
Pity. Tomorrow's Saturday,
people come from town to buy.

718
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:37,965
Yes, I know, but...

719
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:46,197
- Where are the blankets?
- Over there.

720
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:54,559
There's no way you can stay?

721
00:59:54,727 --> 00:59:56,683
Really, I can't.

722
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:20,364
- Madam?
- Eggs.

723
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:23,842
- You have any change?
- No, sorry.

724
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,563
Take these.
I'll get your change.

725
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:33,438
First he was kept
at the police station

726
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,282
and now he's in jail.

727
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:38,355
Why did it take so long?

728
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,597
He didn't want to sign
the statement.

729
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:43,798
- And now he's signed it?
- Yes.

730
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:47,523
The trial begins next week.

731
01:03:48,127 --> 01:03:49,640
What will he get?

732
01:03:49,887 --> 01:03:52,845
Who knows?
At least he's allowed visitors now.

733
01:03:57,367 --> 01:04:00,677
Four kebabs with mustard, please.

734
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:04,640
Are the kebabs fresh?

735
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:05,603
Yes.

736
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:08,600
Four kebabs with mustard.

737
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:12,083
Got used to the route?

738
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:37,606
- Surugiu.
- Present.

739
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:38,722
A visitor.

740
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:51,156
To the right.

741
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:38,117
Legend has it that many Romanians

742
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:41,836
were forced to steal
in order to survive during the '80s
