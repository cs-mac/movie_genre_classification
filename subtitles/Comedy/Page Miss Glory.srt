2
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,036
Ah, we haven't met.

3
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,249
I'm putting out rubbish, obsessively.

4
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:51,835
Do you want me to take it
downstairs for you?

5
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:54,712
No! No, no, it's fine. I'll do it later.

6
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:57,340
I've been living here for a year and
I've never caught sight of you.

7
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:59,843
- I'm Nancy Pierpan.
- Johnny Worricker. How do you do?

8
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,094
I'm wondering if I could
ask you in for a drink.

9
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:04,764
But you seem to have company.

10
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:06,516
Exactly.

11
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:08,602
That is why I am asking you in.

12
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:12,314
- So you started a website?
- That's right.

13
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:15,399
It's a place where people
can make contact.

14
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:19,321
People find it easier to talk to a machine
than they do direct.

15
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,779
Is that so?

16
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,656
Couples talk best in the car

17
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,326
'cause they're side by side, they
don't have to look at each other.

18
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,247
- Was it you who noticed that?
- That was my mom, actually.

19
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,914
Well, this has been nice,

20
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:33,751
but, bad news, Ralph, I'm going
to have to throw you out.

21
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,712
What, do you mean right now?

22
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:40,007
It's my fault. I'd completely forgotten
that I promised to talk to Johnny about
his novel.

23
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,842
- Johnny writes novels?
- Yes.

24
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,144
Am I going to see you soon?

25
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:53,730
Of course. I'm going to call you.

26
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,650
- It was great to see where you live.
- Yes.

27
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:00,486
It was nice for me, too.

28
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:09,746
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I want to apologize.

29
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,038
There's no need to apologize.

30
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,917
I assume you asked the young man
back and then changed your mind.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,211
Yes, that's what happened.

32
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:17,670
Whose novel is that?

33
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:21,508
I would love it if you stayed and had
a glass of wine with me.

34
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,425
I can't. I've got to go home.

35
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,303
It's because I'm out of practice.

36
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,723
You'll have to explain.

37
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,810
Well, it's been a long time since
I asked anyone back.

38
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,938
And, um...has this ever happened to you?

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,023
That you suddenly realize
you've made a mistake?

40
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,527
Huh.

41
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,279
And then I saw you on the landing.

42
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:47,533
It was like you were sent from God.

43
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:50,203
It's very strange that I've
never seen you before.

44
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,954
Do you live on your own?

45
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:54,499
I've got to work tonight,
if that's alright.

46
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,709
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, I...

47
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,381
Call me if it happens again.

48
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,385
It won't happen again.

49
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,784
What are you thinking, Johnny?

50
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:36,499
What have you been thinking?

51
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,760
Why did you ask me what was
I thinking? It's unbelievable.

52
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:51,180
Someone who's meant to be responsible,
someone who's meant to be my boss.

53
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,015
I thought it was funny.
No need to tell me.

54
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,851
Well, it isn't funny. Not
in a fucking lift.

55
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,936
Anger management, Johnny!

56
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,271
I can send you on a course if you like.

57
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,065
I don't ask you, <i>What are you thinking?</i>

58
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:04,151
'Cause my mind's a perfect blank,
that's why.

59
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:07,321
Things are that bad, I got home last night
and watched the X Factor.

60
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,076
Yesterday was Tuesday, X Factor's
Saturdays, so I know you're lying.

61
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:12,869
Not lying, testing.

62
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,584
- Jill.
- Good morning, boys.

63
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,837
I'm coming your way in half an hour.

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,464
Jill's office.

65
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:28,218
- Morning, Muna.
- Good morning.

66
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:31,011
So, there's an awful lot
of stuff going on.

67
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,930
An awful lot of traffic.

68
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:36,308
What does that mean? Intercept.

69
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:38,061
Among other things,

70
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:41,064
this building is swimming in information.

71
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,733
We have information coming out
of our ears.

72
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:44,858
So...

73
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,861
So, the difficult thing is to notice
when someone

74
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:50,282
finally tells you something important.

75
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,911
No reaction.

76
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:57,329
He thinks he can be rude to me.

77
00:05:57,414 --> 00:06:00,667
He thinks he can treat me how he wants
because we had a wife in common.

78
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:02,669
In my case, a long time ago.

79
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,378
All your wives are a long time ago.

80
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,923
Is Jill need-to-know on my wives?

81
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:08,758
Everyone knows about your wives.

82
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,886
So my point is this. I've called
the two of you together.

83
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,930
I want to share a source.

84
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:19,101
Now, before we go any further,
God's very excited.

85
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:20,228
Why is God excited?

86
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:24,732
I suppose like all home secretaries, God
can't resist a file marked <i>top secret</i>.

87
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,485
You're going to read this and you're
going to think, <i>Hold on.</i>

88
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,322
<i>The Americans are meant to be our allies.</i>

89
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:32,323
I've never suffered from that delusion.

90
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,285
Johnny doesn't believe in the
special relationship, do you?

91
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:39,079
They're not what you call sharing
partners, are they?

92
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,290
Even you can't claim to
have read it already.

93
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:44,001
I've seen certain words, I gather
we're back in the Middle East.

94
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:47,129
- We're always in the Middle East.
- I don't like faith jobs.

95
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:49,006
I don't like anything to do with faith.

96
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,717
Still no faith yourself, Johnny?

97
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,385
The sun will rise in the morning,

98
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:55,012
I'm going to have a drink at 6:00.
That's my faith.

99
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,890
Really? A lot of people in
your church, are there?

100
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,475
Most people. Most people are in my church.

101
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,688
You're going to want to talk to me
when you've read it properly.

102
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:08,902
This country is under threat,
it's under serious threat.

103
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:11,488
Our problem is we can't always tell you
the nature of the threat.

104
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,490
If we did, we'd be giving away
intelligence.

105
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,034
That's not something I'm willing to...

106
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,731
This is a bit close, isn't it?

107
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,609
- This place is a bit close.
- Rollo.

108
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,443
Thought this place was crawling
with professionals.

109
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:55,739
That's why we're eating at 11:30. No
one will see us, except your friend.

110
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,702
- How are you, Johnny?
- I'm well, Rollo.

111
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:02,372
- And yourself?
- Trying to get used to my new profession.

112
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,415
I was hoping you could help me
with an inquiry.

113
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,041
What inquiry is that?

114
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,585
She's called Nancy Pierpan.

115
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:10,171
Then she has a beautiful name.

116
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:11,339
Do you know anything about her?

117
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,966
Are we going to do business
before we have lunch?

118
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,383
We're going to do business over lunch.

119
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,760
You're not going to let me
have a drink first?

120
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,440
- He's putting on weight.
- Well, you would know.

121
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,152
You haven't asked me about my new job.

122
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,905
I read what you write, but some
of it goes over my head.

123
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,158
Really? Don't you have a double first?

124
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,909
I'm not really clever, Rollo.

125
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:43,079
I don't have what they call a first-class
mind. You were first class.

126
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,913
Sure. Look where it got me.

127
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:47,916
- I'm a journalist.
- A journalist who still works for us.

128
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,086
- Do I?
- Don't you get the checks?

129
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:53,298
What are the checks gonna get me, huh?
A house in Tuscany?

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,551
When? With whom? With the waiter?

131
00:08:57,926 --> 00:09:00,471
Can't you go and do some sort
of profile on her?

132
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,056
I work in the foreign desk.

133
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,225
What possible interest would
I have in Nancy Pierpan?

134
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,852
So you do know who she is.

135
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,479
You were always quick, Johnny.

136
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:10,357
Not too clever, right enough,
but you are quick.

137
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,610
- England's a small country, isn't it?
- You tell me.

138
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,736
I mean, it's multicultural, sure.

139
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,530
There's more chaps named Shah, Patel.

140
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,992
But nothing's really changed. It's
still run by the same old crowd.

141
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:22,910
Is it? I don't know who runs England.

142
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,621
The bankers did, and look
what happened to them.

143
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:27,790
What I'm saying is there's still an awful
lot of people named Baron,

144
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,250
and Worricker and Pierpan.

145
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:35,214
Nancy was born in Damascus.

146
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,549
Her father was an Arabist.

147
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,801
What sort of Arabist? Romance of
the desert, that sort of thing?

148
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:40,052
Lawrence of Arabia?

149
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,764
- Why do you need to know?
- Because she's taking an interest in me.

150
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,268
What sort of an interest?

151
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,561
Making a play? Is she making a play?

152
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,731
She was putting out the rubbish.

153
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:54,066
She pretended it was a coincidence.

154
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,903
- Well, aren't you flattered?
- No.

155
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:04,284
What's the file? Are you
gonna show it to me?

156
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,287
Do you know...

157
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,125
I don't think I am.

158
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:41,281
What is this? They're saying
I need a new pass.

159
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,449
I was given a temporary. What's going on?

160
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,950
Are you gonna throw a wobbly?

161
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:48,662
Of course I'm not gonna throw
a wobbly. When was the last time
I threw a wobbly?

162
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:51,499
- 7/7.
- Exactly. I threw a wobbly

163
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:54,001
because suicide bombers killed 56 people
on the streets of London

164
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,586
and we had no idea it was going to happen.

165
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,673
I didn't throw a wobbly because
my pass had been blocked.

166
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,966
No. You're really sweet.

167
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:06,972
Who changes the passes? Who orders
the passes to be changed?

168
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,767
Who do you think?

169
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:13,937
Take this and just make sure it's done.

170
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,357
What did you think of the file?

171
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,525
- What did I think of it?
- Yes.

172
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,695
I haven't finished it yet.
I haven't absorbed it.

173
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,491
I hardly need say, on no account
is that file to leave the premises.

174
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,117
Gold standard.

175
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:28,221
I didn't know if you'd make it.

176
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:29,973
I promised I'd make it, didn't I?

177
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,640
- I thought you were abroad.
- Who told you that?

178
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:32,808
Mom.

179
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:34,728
Mom said that she always
knows where you are.

180
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,189
Does she? Paranormal, is she? Physic?

181
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,359
- Hey, Dad.
- Hello.

182
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:46,197
You're going to have to
explain these to me.

183
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:48,950
Do you want to have dinner afterwards?

184
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,202
I thought you'd have lots
of young men attendant.

185
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,830
- You don't want to have dinner with me.
- Don't I?

186
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,001
I hate these things more than you do.

187
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:24,986
- Hello, Johnny.
- Max.

188
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:26,820
Goodness, what are you doing here?

189
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:30,949
I collect. I collect your famous daughter.

190
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,328
If there's anything you can do
to get me a family price...

191
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:36,498
You still where you used to be?

192
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,416
Of course I am. I like it.
Why would I change?

193
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,712
- And you, Max?
- Defense. Defense procurement.

194
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:43,837
Hmm.

195
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:47,467
That's one business that's never going
to suffer. Recession-proof.

196
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,595
And these days I also raise a little
money, you know, for the party.

197
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:52,429
Don't look at me, I'm apolitical.

198
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,723
You're <i>A</i> everything, aren't you, Johnny?

199
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,059
You'll have to choose sides one day,
you know.

200
00:13:57,142 --> 00:14:00,729
Remember, you'll get killed
in the middle of the road.

201
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,857
- Did you get my invitation?
- Did I? Remind me.

202
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,150
I wrote you, college reunion.

203
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:08,238
Oh, yes, I think I did get something.
Give me your card, I'll call you.

204
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,823
I don't have a card, I have a website.

205
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,535
Wake up, Johnny.

206
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,452
21st century.

207
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:26,922
- You again.
- You seem to be everywhere.

208
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,967
Why are you surprised? It's my
business, knowing people.

209
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,095
Including your daughter.

210
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,679
Beautiful.

211
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:37,183
That's what I do, remember?
Put people in touch.

212
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,810
By the way, how did Nancy like your book?

213
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:42,397
How many novels have you written?

214
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,066
Why do you want to know?

215
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,528
I'm asking you. I'm asking you
a civil question.

216
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,155
It's my first.

217
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,750
So? You haven't said what you thought.

218
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,669
- No.
- Why not?

219
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:09,716
- Don't look at me like that.
- Why not?

220
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:12,302
Because I never could refuse you.

221
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:18,183
You could tell me the truth.

222
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,228
For once in your life, you might
try telling me the truth.

223
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,063
Only if you insist.

224
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:26,566
I insist.

225
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:30,612
Alright. They look like works of despair.

226
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,823
If the despair isn't real,
then I don't like them

227
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,909
because they're fake, they're unfelt.

228
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:38,994
They're avant-garde protest
and nothing more.

229
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,164
But if the despair is real,

230
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,168
then that hurts, too, because...

231
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:49,213
Because you're my daughter, and
I don't want you to suffer.

232
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,885
- They're not fake.
- That's what I thought.

233
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,970
- So what bothers you?
- If I'm unhappy then it's your fault?

234
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:01,475
They make you feel guilty? The absent
father, the evasive father.

235
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,478
The pictures are morbid.

236
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,854
They're morbid, Julianne.

237
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,942
Okay, I can see it may be my problem
to do with getting older,

238
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:12,569
but why do you want to piss on life
before you've even lived it?

239
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,118
I don't think you should say any more.

240
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:37,012
- I was wondering...
- Yup.

241
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:40,599
- That young man you were talking to.
- Which one?

242
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:44,144
I think his name is Ralph. Ralph Wilson.

243
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:47,813
You're working.

244
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,775
Fuck! You're not even talking to me,
you're working.

245
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,616
- Oh, come on, let me take you home.
- No.

246
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,161
I don't want you anywhere near me.

247
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:08,417
Do you have any honest
relationships at all?

248
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:39,199
How did I know? How did I know this?

249
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:40,492
Know what?

250
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:43,036
That you would come to my door.

251
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,330
You look unhappy. Do you
want some company?

252
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,084
I'll come to your place.

253
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,462
I'm getting red wine.

254
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,964
I'd prefer whiskey. Do you mind?

255
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,218
Mmm, you had a rough day.

256
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:03,764
- So how old's your daughter, then?
- She's, let's see, mid-20s.

257
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:06,934
I split up from her mother when
Julianne was very young.

258
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,144
Here you go.

259
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,147
That's not true.

260
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:13,984
I'm going to tell you the truth.

261
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,361
I split up with her when she was pregnant.

262
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,279
Why did you do that?

263
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:21,866
Because I was in love with someone else.

264
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,617
You fall in love easily.

265
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,203
Perhaps that's why my daughter
doesn't trust me.

266
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,331
It was hard for her,

267
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:31,084
watching her father keep losing his heart.

268
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,919
- Hmm. Children don't like that.
- No.

269
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:39,341
Tonight, I felt I had the right to say
what I thought about her work.

270
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:44,389
Clearly I didn't.

271
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,515
Same thing's true with writers.

272
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,892
Well, you can say what you like
about their personalities

273
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:51,688
because they think,<i>Oh, I can change,
I can improve.</i>

274
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,106
But work's different.

275
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,945
- What about you?
- Me?

276
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,116
Isn't your father a writer?
Joseph Pierpan.

277
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,162
Writer and activist. Yeah.

278
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,414
Must be odd, having a famous father.

279
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:13,084
I'm actually surprised
you've heard of him.

280
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:15,210
Just how famous can you be in Syria?

281
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,796
- You were born in Damascus?
- Yes.

282
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,219
My brother was killed by the Israelis.

283
00:19:25,972 --> 00:19:28,891
- When?
- Two years ago.

284
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:33,562
- What was he doing?
- Waving a white flag.

285
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,524
Trying to stop the Israelis from
knocking down a house.

286
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:42,364
The Israelis were building a wall
through the occupied territories

287
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:45,408
and the wall went right through the house.

288
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,373
Been in that part of the world?

289
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,000
What were you doing?

290
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,962
- Oh, you know.
- No.

291
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,421
I don't know, you're going
to have to tell me.

292
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,925
I was on holiday.

293
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:03,676
On the West Bank?

294
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,513
Where else do you go on holiday?

295
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:09,181
Darfur? Afghanistan?

296
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:11,309
Maybe this is the moment...

297
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,732
to tell me what's going on.

298
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,234
Nothing's going on.

299
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:24,279
My life was changed when
my brother was killed.

300
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:28,617
He was killed by the Israeli
Defense Force.

301
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,496
Nothing they say makes...

302
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:36,667
any sense, we don't believe a
word of the official inquiry.

303
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:40,922
So...it's hard enough
to grieve, isn't it?

304
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,844
I mean, grief is hard enough anyway,

305
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:51,182
but when you don't know the truth,

306
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:54,893
everything freezes and you can't move on.

307
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,700
Alright, let's just forget about it.

308
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,286
I asked you in for a drink, that's all.

309
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:15,873
I'm like you, I go to work,
I get through the day.

310
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:18,543
Since Jake died, I haven't been
interested in making friends.

311
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:23,131
Please, it's nothing dramatic. I'm not
asking for anything, but...

312
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,134
You seem a nice man.

313
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:44,235
You see, it's almost unbearable.

314
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,153
The way she looks.

315
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:51,116
She's so desperately in love
with Lester Young

316
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,952
she can scarcely bear it when he plays.

317
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,504
He wears high-draped pants…

318
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:04,339
All the same,

319
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,635
she doesn't forget when it's her turn.

320
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:15,599
He wears high-draped pants

321
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:20,480
Julianne, I wish I could find you.
I wish I knew where you were.

322
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,608
I made a fool of myself tonight.

323
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,904
And it's not the first time.

324
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,200
You were right to be angry.

325
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,399
Alright, let's start the bloody meeting.

326
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,192
God knows, you're hard enough
to get hold of, Benedict.

327
00:23:07,277 --> 00:23:09,237
You're far grander than I am.

328
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,866
Would you like me to get you a cup
of coffee, Home Secretary?

329
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:14,116
Some mineral water?

330
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,869
I had no idea you were going
to be invited, Johnny.

331
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:18,747
Well, I am.

332
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,165
This is going to need
long hours, Minister.

333
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:23,500
It's going to need expertise and judgment.

334
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:27,339
As my mother used to say, <i>A problem shared
is a problem halved.</i>

335
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:28,632
So, what's your next move?

336
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:31,009
Give the whole thing to the Daily Mirror?
Post it on the internet?

337
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:33,510
I'm trying hard not to be offended,
Home Secretary.

338
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:34,720
Please try.

339
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:37,556
Home Secretary, do you want to come
back in and restart this meeting

340
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:39,391
at a lower level of tension?

341
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:42,228
I don't know about anyone else,
but I've got a heart condition.

342
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:46,149
I've got fatty deposits on my arteries.
I have a stent.

343
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:49,318
Benedict, I can take this file
out of the room,

344
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:52,656
across the river to SIS, & your department
will be royally fucked.

345
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,074
The service has been royally
fucked many times.

346
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:59,704
Usually by your government jumping on us
like Rover with a hard-on,

347
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,580
and we've always survived the experience.

348
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,415
Oi, out!

349
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,502
With respect, Minister, politicians
come and go.

350
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,837
I've counted them in and
I've counted them out.

351
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:11,215
And if you want to get rid of me, you can.

352
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,717
That's on the record, by the way.

353
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,514
I'd like to go walking in Patagonia. I've
heard the wildlife there is extraordinary.

354
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:18,932
- Johnny went.
- I did.

355
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,349
He loved it.

356
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:24,854
So if you want a new DG,
go ahead, get one.

357
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:29,858
I'll gather up my whole family & take them
on a packet boat to Antarctica.

358
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:35,072
And a double bonus, I won't be around
for the end of the Atlantic Alliance.

359
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:38,158
Anthea, it won't have happened
on my watch.

360
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,831
Okay, what are the Americans up to?

361
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,834
The Americans are up to what we've
always suspected they were up to.

362
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,545
This is different. This is proof.
If this is true.

363
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:53,048
They have prisoners all over the world
who don't officially exist on black sites.

364
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,468
- So it appears.
- Unknown sites that don't exist either.

365
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:56,593
Not officially.

366
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:57,929
And these prisoners are
telling them things

367
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:00,265
which they then don't have
the courtesy to tell us.

368
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:04,268
Well, worse than that.
Specifically, the Americans are
failing to keep us abreast

369
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,854
of things that are happening
on our own doorstep.

370
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:08,982
Dangerous things.

371
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:12,944
If we're willing to trust intelligence
obtained by torture.

372
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:14,362
Quite.

373
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,947
Where did you get this?

374
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,866
Well, I thought that might
be your next question.

375
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:19,533
It is my next question.

376
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,744
Thought it might be.

377
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:22,704
And don't give me any of
that Jesuitical bullshit

378
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:24,580
about not revealing your sources.

379
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,374
I can't reveal my sources.

380
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,668
Benedict, you and I can play the game...

381
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,421
Seems like we've already begun.

382
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:34,131
But at the end of the road,
you work for me.

383
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:36,676
Remember, the people don't vote for you,
they vote for me.

384
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,470
They don't like the people
who work in the dark.

385
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:40,471
They don't know the people
who work in the dark.

386
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:42,056
If they did, would they be reassured?

387
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:46,269
- My view is we go to the Americans.
- No.

388
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:48,562
- We speak to the Americans direct.
- No.

389
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,982
We tell them we know what they know.

390
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,525
That they have a network of sites

391
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:55,654
where they're illegally detaining
and torturing prisoners.

392
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:58,156
We frighten them by naming the sites.

393
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:02,077
Thailand, Afghanistan, Morocco,
Poland, Romania.

394
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,661
Show them we're not idiots.

395
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:05,872
- Why not?
- Because.

396
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:09,876
- Because what?
- Because you're going to tell your allies

397
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,502
that they've been lying to you.

398
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:13,754
You have to think through
the implications.

399
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:14,965
Are you saying I haven't?

400
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:18,300
You also have to remember that
going back to the Americans

401
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:20,053
might endanger my source.

402
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:22,179
You'd need my permission.

403
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,187
What would you prefer me to do?

404
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,897
- Right now?
- Yes.

405
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:33,441
- If it were my call?
- Please, imagine that.

406
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:36,444
Right now, I'd prefer you to do nothing.

407
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,197
If you want me to do nothing,
why did you give me the file?

408
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,032
Because I don't want you to be able to say
I didn't give you the file.

409
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:46,161
- Further down the road?
- Exactly. I answer to you.

410
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:48,372
You gave me the file so that
I would do nothing?

411
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:51,710
I gave you the file so that you
would know everything.

412
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,877
Makes sense.

413
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,798
Johnny Worricker thinks it makes sense.

414
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,008
Johnny's an excellent judge.

415
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,676
Weak on tactics occasionally,
but strong on strategy.

416
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,178
Is that what you think? You
back Johnny, do you?

417
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:04,013
Johnny's my best friend since Cambridge.

418
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:09,101
Well, then perhaps <i>best friend</i> can tell us
what the argument for doing nothing is.

419
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:15,482
The argument for doing nothing, Minister,
is that as yet you know so little.

420
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,277
And you shouldn't move
until you know more.

421
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,445
Continue.

422
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,281
One simple thing: Her Majesty's Government
has always denied complicity in torture.

423
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:25,452
You've stood up in Parliament many times,
you've said it in the press.

424
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:28,662
Changing the story is going
to be embarrassing.

425
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,499
Well, it's only going to be embarrassing
if people find out.

426
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,003
How will they find out?

427
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:38,589
Why would this intelligence leave this
room? Who here would leak it?

428
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,885
I hope that question answers itself.

429
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,763
I hope it does. I hope so, too.

430
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,226
And anyway, remember, I thought
the claims were true at the time.

431
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,020
When I made the claims, I didn't know
they were untrue.

432
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,483
That may or may not be sufficient defense.

433
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:59,068
These things can get messy, politically.

434
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:02,321
- And...
- What?

435
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:05,617
You said <i>one simple thing</i>. What's
the second simple thing?

436
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:09,245
Oh. I haven't talked to Benedict
about this, Minister.

437
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:12,081
So? Does <i>best friend</i> need
permission to speak?

438
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:13,374
Very well, it's this.

439
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,377
Has anyone actually read this thing?

440
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:18,630
I don't mean cast your eye over it,
I mean read it.

441
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:21,340
- Jill?
- Yes, I believe I've read it.

442
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,512
Home Secretary, you say you didn't know
the Americans had these prisoners.

443
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:27,681
I didn't know.

444
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:29,975
And you had no proof they'd
been torturing them.

445
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:34,437
I take your word. But perhaps someone else
in your government did.

446
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,688
Someone else?

447
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:38,691
Take another look at the bottom
of page eight.

448
00:28:38,774 --> 00:28:39,858
- Page eight?
- Yes.

449
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:42,319
- What's on page eight?
- You haven't read it, have you?

450
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,822
I thought not.

451
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,240
Page eight, please.

452
00:28:54,665 --> 00:29:00,213
American source quoted saying, <i>Downing
Street already knows about this.</i>

453
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,804
I imagine that's what bothering Benedict.

454
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,906
There are two possibilities, aren't there?

455
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,577
Either our source is wrong

456
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,787
and the Americans lied to all of us...

457
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:37,833
in which case, Downing Street
is going to be furious...

458
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,836
or our source is right,

459
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:44,465
and the Prime Minister knew
everything all along,

460
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,092
he just didn't bother to tell you.

461
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:55,684
Now, I'm not sure which of those
two possibilities you prefer.

462
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,233
It's been an interesting meeting.

463
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,194
Thank you. It has indeed.

464
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,197
I'm going to do as you suggest and
leave this for a day or two.

465
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:09,406
Fine.

466
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,284
- Johnny?
- Fine.

467
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:13,952
We'll reconvene. Anna will be in touch.

468
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,792
You keep staring at that painting.

469
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,544
It's from the government art collection.

470
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:23,337
Don't blame me, I didn't choose it.

471
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,423
Actually, it was painted by my daughter.

472
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:29,678
Christ, then you're in more trouble
than I am.

473
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:37,060
Thank you.

474
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:41,106
I'm glad you said that.

475
00:30:41,648 --> 00:30:43,566
- I'm sorry?
- About page eight.

476
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:45,277
I was hoping someone would say it.

477
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,611
Glad it was you.

478
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,237
Oh, okay.

479
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,617
I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure
whether to speak.

480
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,035
No, that was a good move.

481
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,371
It means the game's in play.

482
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:02,042
You. Need to talk to you.
Need a word, urgently.

483
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:06,714
Not here. Somewhere discreet.

484
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,341
Traditionally, it's the stationary
cupboard.

485
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,860
- What were you doing?
- When?

486
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:28,278
At that meeting. What were you up to?

487
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,528
- What was I up to?
- Yes.

488
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:31,656
I was doing my job. I'm
an intelligence analyst,

489
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:33,783
I was analyzing intelligence.
What's wrong with that?

490
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:36,577
First thing wrong, you never mentioned it.

491
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:41,498
You blurt out this extraordinary
allegation before you talk to us,
before you tell us.

492
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:46,421
What's happened to you? Suddenly
you can't speak? Well?

493
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,592
Do you know the source?
Do you trust the source?

494
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:53,010
Of course I don't know the source.
I don't need to.

495
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:54,137
You don't need to?

496
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,014
Come on, Jill. If Ben says it's good,
it's good.

497
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:01,019
Oh, right. I forgot you were
at college together.

498
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:03,187
That just about sums up
this whole fucking place!

499
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,315
What's the problem, Jill?
I don't get the problem.

500
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,108
When are you gonna wake up?

501
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,444
There's a revolution going on. You
don't seem to have noticed.

502
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,654
What sort of revolution is that?

503
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:13,031
You live in the past.

504
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:16,617
You still think there's something
called pure intelligence.

505
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,328
The world's changed. Brits
are being killed by Brits.

506
00:32:19,412 --> 00:32:21,914
They're being killed on British streets.

507
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,459
Oh, fuck!

508
00:32:25,752 --> 00:32:26,795
If you don't know what I'm saying,

509
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:27,963
I'm not gonna spell it out for you.

510
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:29,589
- Why don't you spell it out?
- Get your hands off me.

511
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:31,091
I'm not one of your conquests.

512
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:33,343
What are you gonna do? Charge me
with assault in a cupboard?

513
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:36,512
You asked me in, remember? I'll
counter-sue for enticement.

514
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,640
Sure, if you're still here next week.

515
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,524
The Prime Minister, Alec Beasley,
today described

516
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:53,405
Britain and America as two countries with
shared values and common purposes.

517
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,615
<i>Nothing,</i> he said, <i>could divide
our two countries</i>

518
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:57,826
<i>in the worldwide fight against terror.</i>

519
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,286
The Prime Minister is visiting Washington
at the request of the president.

520
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:05,874
Well, it's great to be here. For me,
it's home from home.

521
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:15,468
- Oh, I see.
- What?

522
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:18,762
- You're just gonna go home.
- Yes, do you mind?

523
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:20,472
I was thinking of going home.

524
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:24,893
It's choir practice in 40 minutes,
and the M4 is hell.

525
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:26,771
And you're not going to tell me
what you're up to?

526
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,607
Me?

527
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:30,567
- Yes, Ben.
- What am I up to?

528
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:32,527
That's my question.

529
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,321
It's pretty obvious, I would have thought.

530
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:36,905
I put a bomb in the water

531
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:39,951
and I'm waiting to see where
the dead fish land.

532
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:43,038
And you didn't think it best
to warn me first?

533
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,165
Or am I one of the fish?

534
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:51,546
If you don't trust me, Ben,
who do you trust?

535
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,889
Distrust is a terrible habit.

536
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,934
Do you find that?

537
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:08,562
There's a fine line, isn't there, between
calculation and deceit?

538
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,733
Must do better.

539
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,236
You're right, I should have
shown you page eight.

540
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,493
Johnny, I'm sorry.

541
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:27,289
Good. Tomorrow we're going to
talk it over, you and I.

542
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:29,792
And we won't do it on the fourth floor,

543
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:35,048
because this is about the survival of the
department and the Prime Minister.

544
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:39,677
- Coffee shop in Ebury Street?
- When?

545
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:40,971
10:00.

546
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,686
The old team.

547
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:56,630
Well, I think...

548
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,132
So, what did you call it?

549
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,705
- Emma?
- Yes.

550
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,914
It's me.

551
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,627
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- I knew you'd be up.

552
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:39,922
I'm feeding the chickens.

553
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:42,968
The point is this. I've had
a row with Julianne.

554
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,134
Yes, she told me.

555
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:47,054
She had every right to be angry.

556
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:50,140
She asked you to stay because she
wanted to tell you something.

557
00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:51,851
What did she want to tell me?

558
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:54,396
That she's having a baby.

559
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,524
- I don't believe you!
- It's true.

560
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,024
She's pregnant.

561
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,736
Do you know who the father is?

562
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:04,364
I don't. She hasn't told me.

563
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,782
She hasn't told you?

564
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:10,494
Johnny, it's the 21st century.

565
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:15,083
How many more times? People keep saying
that like it justifies everything,

566
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,417
every piece of stupidity.

567
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,502
Julianne isn't being stupid.

568
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:19,837
She knows what she's doing.

569
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,673
She wouldn't take it on if she
couldn't see it through.

570
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:24,550
Well, is she alright?

571
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,051
She was.

572
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:29,681
When will I see her?

573
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,559
Johnny, you need to watch out.

574
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,483
- Who was that?
- Johnny.

575
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,446
So you gave him the news?

576
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,786
One egg, or two?

577
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:56,874
I'm sorry.

578
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,337
- I wanted to see you were alright.
- I'm alright.

579
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,214
It's funny, I came to find you last night.

580
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:05,257
Sounded as if you had company.

581
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:06,968
Why did you come looking for me?

582
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,304
Oh, because I bought you a CD.

583
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,513
Can I come in?

584
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:14,016
Yes. Yes, you can come in.

585
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,191
Wow!

586
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,234
I know.

587
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:27,363
It's a little overwhelming. I started
collecting years ago.

588
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:30,951
Believe it or not, I started with £100.
It grew from there.

589
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:36,373
You've got good taste. That's
Christopher Wood.

590
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:37,748
It's wonderful.

591
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:42,087
There's no plan. I've just always
bought what I've liked.

592
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,756
It must be worth a fortune.

593
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:47,466
Yeah. But that's not why I do it.

594
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,010
My second wife had very good taste.

595
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,680
How many wives have you had?

596
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,765
- Fewer than five.
- Ah.

597
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:56,308
- Do you really have it?
- What?

598
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:57,519
The CD.

599
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:01,439
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

600
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,614
- Lester Young.
- Aw.

601
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,118
Thank you.

602
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:19,289
My daughter's pregnant.

603
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,627
It turns out that's what
the row was about.

604
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:25,504
I thought it was about art, but it wasn't.

605
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:29,009
She knew I was going to be upset because
I don't think the father's around,

606
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:31,428
so she was frightened that I'd judge her.

607
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,351
I don't really know what is it you do.

608
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:40,853
I assume you're some sort
of secret service.

609
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:44,608
The other night I was pissed off
because you wouldn't tell me.

610
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,109
What makes you think I'm
in the security services?

611
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:51,322
Because most people can tell you
why they visit the Middle East.

612
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:56,535
And uh, the person I was with
last night was my dad.

613
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,414
Oh, I see. He's in London?

614
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,209
Did you just work that out? Was that
your professional training?

615
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:06,296
No, it's more my nerves.

616
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:07,839
Why are you nervous?

617
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:11,592
Because I find myself confiding in you.

618
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:14,596
Do you? Do you really?

619
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,431
Or are you just pretending?

620
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,145
Well, I think it's brilliant,

621
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:24,897
because I can tell everyone I know
I live opposite a spy.

622
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,524
I'd rather you didn't, but...

623
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:30,070
Don't you think we have to be honest?

624
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:31,571
You and I?

625
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:35,574
I mean, isn't it important at this point?

626
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:46,877
- Yes?
- Johnny.

627
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:48,046
Emma.

628
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,090
It's not about Julianne.

629
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:51,591
Then what is it about?

630
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,345
Yesterday, stock exchanges reacted sharply

631
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:58,514
to demonstrations throughout
the Arab world.

632
00:40:58,597 --> 00:41:01,976
The chancellor said, <i>These are
volatile times.</i>

633
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:11,486
You should come down right away. The
sooner you get here, the better.

634
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,071
Fine.

635
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,989
Hold on. Worricker's here.

636
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:18,575
Okay, I've got to go. Goodbye.

637
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,205
- What's the verdict?
- It's a heart attack.

638
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:24,541
- There's a coroner coming.
- Real coroner?

639
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:26,667
Of course, real coroner.

640
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:51,109
You're going to examine him, are you?
That's going to help, is it?

641
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:56,781
Who did you call first?

642
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:58,490
Downing Street.

643
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:01,995
Are you from Downing Street?

644
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:03,495
I was asked to take charge.

645
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,831
You're not taking charge, I am.

646
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,342
Where's Julianne?

647
00:42:17,093 --> 00:42:18,470
I'm not sure.

648
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,432
Have you rung her yet?

649
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:42,243
I might have guessed. You're going
through his stuff.

650
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,120
Not going through it, taking it away.

651
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:46,873
Then you'll go through it.

652
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,338
Do you think with his podgy fingers
he could work that thing?

653
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:56,758
I was there when he had
his first heart attack.

654
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,594
I was there for the second.
They were identical.

655
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:02,764
The doctor warned him, he said,
<i>You're living an injury time.</i>

656
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,684
So you're not going to tell me
there's anything suspicious.

657
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:08,102
- I don't want a circus.
- I know.

658
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:12,815
And I most certainly don't want
a territorial spat with that woman
downstairs.

659
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:15,693
Had he talked about dying?

660
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,448
He was worried about the future.

661
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:25,869
But he said whatever mess he left behind,
he could trust you to clear it up.

662
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:31,960
Benedict was honest and hard-working.

663
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,962
And he looked things in the eye.

664
00:43:36,296 --> 00:43:39,925
So I'd say it's important that
you don't let him down.

665
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:45,557
Julianne, it's your father.

666
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,895
I've got bad news. Can you call me?

667
00:43:53,272 --> 00:43:54,691
Or call your mother.

668
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:57,736
I may be hard to get hold of for a while.

669
00:43:57,819 --> 00:43:59,695
Did he say he'll take over?

670
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:00,632
You must be Mr Worricker?

671
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:02,841
- Joseph Pierpan.
- How do you do?

672
00:45:02,926 --> 00:45:05,678
- My daughter's told me so much about you.
- How is she?

673
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:08,431
Nancy says you know a lot
of influential people.

674
00:45:08,514 --> 00:45:10,099
You work at the Home Office.

675
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:11,976
Oh, she told you.

676
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,853
My son was murdered.

677
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:17,482
Can you imagine?

678
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:23,530
And I am daily mocked by people who
refuse to admit who did it and why.

679
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,866
Do you have children?

680
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,243
A daughter.

681
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,910
I'm not going to detain you.

682
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:33,415
But it would mean the world to us
if you could help.

683
00:46:10,493 --> 00:46:11,745
This is kind of you.

684
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,538
Why is it kind of me?

685
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:16,290
Don't you think it might be
what I want as well?

686
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:30,346
What are they saying up your way?

687
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,641
Well, they're saying it
was a heart attack.

688
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,477
Do you have any reason to think
differently? You went up there.

689
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,479
Yeah, I saw the guilty egg.

690
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:46,237
We were at university together.

691
00:46:47,655 --> 00:46:49,198
Ben was my tutor.

692
00:46:49,824 --> 00:46:53,327
We even went on the Vietnam
marches together.

693
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:54,788
He recruited me.

694
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,124
First it was counter-espionage,
then counter-terrorism. There's
no difference.

695
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:03,253
He still said it was dishonorable work
you could do in an honorable way.

696
00:47:03,338 --> 00:47:04,714
The better man?

697
00:47:04,797 --> 00:47:07,509
I betrayed my wife and he married her.

698
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,802
I never knew if he did it for her
or if he did it for me.

699
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:15,684
Whichever.

700
00:47:17,477 --> 00:47:19,144
I'm in his debt.

701
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:26,235
He was an all-round decent person.

702
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:39,666
When's your husband getting back?

703
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:42,460
- He's not getting back.
- Why not?

704
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:44,879
Because we had a disagreement.

705
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:50,844
Yeah, I'm up the Swanee.

706
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:53,554
I work for an unprincipled maniac.

707
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:56,724
God, she's as mean as cat meat.

708
00:47:56,808 --> 00:48:01,563
And meanwhile, I am trying to hold down
my pathetic high-powered job.

709
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,230
You want to get out?

710
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:05,524
I don't have the courage.

711
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:08,360
I don't have the guts.

712
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:16,119
They're gonna go after you, you know that.

713
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:18,370
- Tell me.
- What, you hadn't guessed?

714
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:20,832
Jill Tankard took me into a cupboard

715
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:24,376
and told me there was no such thing
as pure intelligence.

716
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:25,754
Well, then.

717
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:29,298
They don't trust you.

718
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:30,591
They're gonna use Benedict's death.

719
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:33,845
There's gonna be a departmental shake-up.
They've been setting you up.

720
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:35,304
Setting me up? How?

721
00:48:35,388 --> 00:48:38,974
They're gonna say you
put Benedict up to it.

722
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,936
It was you that gave Benedict the source.

723
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,896
I didn't. I didn't give him his source.

724
00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:45,273
I only saw the file for the first time
this week.

725
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:47,274
- I know that.
- I don't know the source.

726
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,945
I'm sure. But they don't care.

727
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:56,493
They're gonna tie a tin can around your
tail and run you out of the building.

728
00:48:57,451 --> 00:48:58,994
They don't like you, Johnny.

729
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,207
It's personal.

730
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,457
Do they have a reason?

731
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,085
Well, the usual reason. They think
you're anti-American.

732
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,963
I'm not.

733
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:13,134
Alright, then, they just feel that you
have more fun than they do.

734
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:21,059
I've got a question.

735
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:24,853
I mean, I don't mind if you don't answer.

736
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,189
I don't mind. I'll answer anything.

737
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:30,902
When I said, <i>I only saw the file for
the first time this week,</i>

738
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:32,820
you said, <i>I know.</i>

739
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:36,116
- Oh, yeah, so?
- How do you know?

740
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,995
It's important, Anna. How do you know?
How do you know I hadn't seen the file?

741
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:43,999
I know

742
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:48,878
because when I started sleeping with you,
I made a decision.

743
00:49:48,962 --> 00:49:50,379
What decision?

744
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:53,674
I decided to trust you.

745
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,306
It's a bit arbitrary, isn't it?

746
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,433
Yes.

747
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,062
But so far you've never let me down.

748
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,660
North Utsire, northerly, becoming
cyclonic four or five,

749
00:50:20,744 --> 00:50:25,581
occasionally six in far north. Becoming
variable three later.

750
00:50:25,665 --> 00:50:27,459
Fair, good.

751
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:30,295
South Utsire, north-westerly five or six,

752
00:50:30,378 --> 00:50:33,548
veering easterly or south-easterly,
four or five.

753
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,008
Becoming variable three later.

754
00:50:36,092 --> 00:50:37,385
Fair, good.

755
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,232
Nothing if not predictable.

756
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:05,246
Shit!

757
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:08,040
Johnny? Johnny?

758
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,460
Are you there? It's Jill.

759
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:13,129
I'm answering. Good morning, Jill.

760
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:16,048
Have you forgotten? We're due
to meet, we've got a meeting.

761
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,174
Well, that's it.

762
00:51:17,258 --> 00:51:20,971
Problem is, I've got that tickle you get
at the back of your throat

763
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:22,304
when you know you're gonna be ill.

764
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:23,639
Where are you, exactly?

765
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:26,142
Aren't I at home? I'm in Battersea,
aren't I?

766
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:27,309
That's not what it says here.

767
00:51:28,143 --> 00:51:30,105
This is hardly the day to go undercover.

768
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,898
Goodness, you're playing with the toys.

769
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,318
Are you playing silly buggers?

770
00:51:35,442 --> 00:51:38,863
No, not at all. I thought it was you that
was playing silly buggers, very much so.

771
00:51:38,947 --> 00:51:40,991
After what happened yesterday,
we're on amber.

772
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:42,367
Everyone's got to open their safe.

773
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:43,742
I'm happy to open my safe.

774
00:51:43,827 --> 00:51:46,413
There's nothing in it but half a bottle
of brandy and some shaving cream.

775
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:48,914
But I can't do it today.

776
00:51:48,998 --> 00:51:51,500
Not if the whole department's
to avoid the flu.

777
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:55,046
You think with Benedict gone
you move up a peg.

778
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,339
But you don't, you move down.

779
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:01,553
I hope to God you know what you're doing.

780
00:52:22,865 --> 00:52:25,242
Oh, Mr Eliot, I thought I heard you.

781
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:27,494
Mrs Ashanti.

782
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,706
It's been so long since we saw you.

783
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:32,292
I've been traveling. I'm only in this
country for a couple of days.

784
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:43,345
The death has been announced
of Benedict Baron,

785
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,804
the Director General of MI5.

786
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:48,140
Baron will be remembered for his policy of

787
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:50,810
making the security service
more accountable.

788
00:52:50,894 --> 00:52:53,604
Under his direction, the secretive
organization...

789
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:08,243
The Road House. Rather
a come-down, isn't it?

790
00:53:08,328 --> 00:53:10,121
Isn't this where you used
to meet Gerry Adams?

791
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:12,207
Is it, Rollo? You'd know better than me.

792
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,374
So, who are you this time?

793
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,418
My name's Eliot, after the poet.

794
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:16,711
Mmm? Eliot who?

795
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:17,836
Tom Eliot, you idiot.

796
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:19,880
Never heard of him. What does he do?
Christmas cards?

797
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,799
- Two coffees, please.
- Sure.

798
00:53:21,883 --> 00:53:23,677
- You vanished.
- I was in Israel.

799
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,094
Good. Do I owe you?

800
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:26,805
No, it's fine. The paper paid.

801
00:53:29,683 --> 00:53:32,060
- You can open it.
- I'd rather hear it from you.

802
00:53:32,685 --> 00:53:35,604
- Well, she's perfect, isn't she?
- Is she? Tell me.

803
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:38,108
Well, if they'd invented her, they
couldn't have done a better job.

804
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,859
You gonna have to tell me who <i>they</i> are?

805
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:41,736
I'm assuming that <i>she</i> is Nancy.

806
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,029
Is there anyone else in your life?

807
00:53:44,072 --> 00:53:46,366
- Nobody at all?
- Since you ask.

808
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,995
Well, Nancy is a perfectly
pitched creation.

809
00:53:50,078 --> 00:53:51,745
Is she? Is she a creation?

810
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,415
If you want to know, yeah.
It all stacks up.

811
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:56,334
Yes, she did have a romantic-looking
brother, who was indeed killed.

812
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,878
And yeah, there was one of those
Israeli Army inquiries

813
00:53:58,962 --> 00:54:01,422
where they concluded the Israeli Army
never does anything wrong.

814
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:04,384
Her father is indeed an impeccable
Arab scholar,

815
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:07,220
living a quiet and saintly life
in Damascus.

816
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:10,222
There she is, Johnny. The wronged woman,
the grieving sister.

817
00:54:10,307 --> 00:54:14,685
Waiting for you, brilliantly rehearsed,
learnt her lines, ready to go.

818
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:17,731
What are you saying? Too good to be true?

819
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:20,399
I didn't ask you to pimp for me, Rollo.

820
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:24,195
Nor did I ask you to vet a
girlfriend. She's not a girlfriend,
she's a neighbor.

821
00:54:24,278 --> 00:54:27,115
Oh, she's kind of a fantasy neighbor,
isn't she?

822
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,034
Perfect for an old spy who's
lost faith in the old values.

823
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:31,660
I haven't lost faith.

824
00:54:31,745 --> 00:54:33,538
- Haven't you?
- No, I still believe in them.

825
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:35,624
The purpose of intelligence
is to find the truth,

826
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:37,500
not to confirm what we already believe.

827
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,045
We're meant to look for what's there,
not for what we want to be there.

828
00:54:40,128 --> 00:54:42,838
Come on, Johnny! Once they
wanted communists, we gave
them communists.

829
00:54:42,922 --> 00:54:44,590
- Now they want Arabs, we give them Arabs.
- Thank you.

830
00:54:44,673 --> 00:54:46,801
They decide what they're looking for,
we find it for them.

831
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:48,802
What has really changed? Nothing.

832
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:51,639
Look, I know what you're going through.
You must be in tricky place, Rollo.

833
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,058
It was a bad day for Ben. It
wasn't a great day for me.

834
00:54:54,142 --> 00:54:56,143
Ben ran his own agents and
he kept them close.

835
00:54:56,227 --> 00:54:58,647
So there are quite a few people
waking up in your position.

836
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,982
Benedict did a good job on you.

837
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,901
The whole service believes that
you leaked security secrets

838
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:07,905
to a newspaper in return
for money because that's
what Benedict told them.

839
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:10,407
There's a flap going on, isn't there?

840
00:55:10,617 --> 00:55:12,160
A turf war, that's what I'm hearing.

841
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,619
Are you? Where are you hearing that?

842
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:17,040
Don't give me that <i>answer a question with
a fucking question</i> lark, Johnny.

843
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:20,042
I didn't go on the interrogation course,
I wrote it, remember?

844
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,211
- Sorry.
- What's more, I just went
to Israel for you

845
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:23,545
on what could be a wild-goose chase.

846
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,631
Alright, I dipped into the Tel Aviv
beach scene,

847
00:55:25,715 --> 00:55:27,467
I got tanned on every inch
of my sexy body.

848
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,886
But even so, you owe me this!

849
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,766
Alright. What this is about,

850
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:40,145
Benedict had proof the Americans
have sites, black sites.

851
00:55:40,272 --> 00:55:41,772
- Of course they do.
- Yes, but now

852
00:55:41,856 --> 00:55:44,358
we can tell you exactly where they are,
we can draw the map.

853
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:46,278
Why is that news? That's not news.

854
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:48,529
You could hear the screams
for the last 10 years.

855
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:52,492
Little bits of intelligence, we're
so careful not to inquire too closely
where they came from.

856
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,619
They came from torture chambers,
we knew that.

857
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:59,040
We guessed, we didn't have evidence.
And this is actually different.

858
00:55:59,124 --> 00:56:00,583
Why? Why is it different?

859
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:04,087
Because it establishes who knew.

860
00:56:04,169 --> 00:56:05,921
Who's known all along.

861
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,552
So, who knew? Who knew the sites?

862
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:13,638
Our Prime Minister.

863
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,683
Our Prime Minister knew.

864
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:25,358
I see.

865
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:29,194
Party of one, is it? Dining alone?

866
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:31,989
Too right, table by the fucking window.

867
00:56:33,032 --> 00:56:35,659
Our Prime Minister had access
to American intelligence

868
00:56:35,743 --> 00:56:40,290
which might have helped save British
lives, and  he didn't tell us.

869
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,292
He didn't tell anyone.

870
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:45,503
Okay. Okay, I'm getting a picture here.

871
00:56:45,586 --> 00:56:47,297
Good. I'm glad you're getting
a picture, Rollo.

872
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:50,841
Presumably our Prime Minister didn't tell
us because he doesn't trust us?

873
00:56:50,925 --> 00:56:52,134
Correct.

874
00:56:52,218 --> 00:56:55,096
And he didn't tell his Home Secretary
because he doesn't trust her either.

875
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,140
- Correct.
- Our Prime Minister doesn't trust anyone,

876
00:56:57,223 --> 00:56:58,682
- is that right?
- That's the way it looks.

877
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:02,227
'Cause he stands alone, the true
savior of his nation.

878
00:57:02,311 --> 00:57:05,731
And everyone else, except for him,
is a wishy-washy liberal fuck!

879
00:57:05,815 --> 00:57:07,609
They don't believe.

880
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,445
- Then what happened?
- Benedict finds out.

881
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:12,113
- How?
- Through a source.

882
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,239
Yeah, but a source of his own. A source's
name you don't know.

883
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:16,158
That's the interesting bit.

884
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:19,286
What does Benedict do, in that situation,

885
00:57:19,371 --> 00:57:22,623
on discovering that his Prime
Minister hides secrets from his
own security service?

886
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:26,502
Of all the things that Ben could do,
what does he do?

887
00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:32,384
Remember your first day, Rollo.
First day in the service.

888
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:36,470
Of course, Monday morning, 10:00 a.m.
you give the first lecture.

889
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:37,847
And what did I say?

890
00:57:39,683 --> 00:57:42,685
<i>Never share intelligence you
don't need to share.</i>

891
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:49,733
Consider. Benedict is given
lethal information about his
Prime Minister.

892
00:57:50,652 --> 00:57:52,319
And what does he do with it?

893
00:57:52,404 --> 00:57:55,197
He gives it to Anthea. He gives it to you.

894
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,619
What was his plan, then?

895
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:04,123
Bring down the government?

896
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,678
- Weather's changing.
- Certainly is.

897
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:21,683
Feels like the end of an era.

898
00:58:22,976 --> 00:58:24,935
As for me, I'm fucked.

899
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:30,691
Live out my life inventing stories
for a national newspaper.

900
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:35,196
Can't even come to the funeral.

901
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:44,204
Rollo. Rollo, you have me.

902
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:48,959
Sure. How long are you gonna last?

903
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:29,249
I thought it would be you.

904
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,127
Don't be ridiculous. Why?

905
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:35,589
Because I dreamed of you this morning.
I had my Johnny dream.

906
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:38,009
Whoever taught you to lie like that?

907
00:59:38,093 --> 00:59:39,510
Who do you think?

908
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:43,723
So, how many years since I saw you?

909
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:45,474
I guess five.

910
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:47,978
You sold me a little Gertler, remember?

911
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:59,948
You're sure? You really want to sell it?

912
01:00:01,825 --> 01:00:05,035
Christopher Wood. Died at 29.

913
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,913
Threw himself under the train.

914
01:00:06,997 --> 01:00:09,332
- I wouldn't sell it, if I were you.
- I have to.

915
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:11,960
Bad times?

916
01:00:13,085 --> 01:00:14,296
Why did you bring it here?

917
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,797
There are places in London
you would get much more.

918
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,549
Because you have a safe.

919
01:00:19,217 --> 01:00:21,427
- Because you have cash.
- How do you know?

920
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,139
Because you showed me.

921
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:30,937
Well, will you take 60?

922
01:00:31,812 --> 01:00:33,147
Do I have any choice?

923
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:55,336
- Here.
- Thank you.

924
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:01,592
Well done.

925
01:01:03,177 --> 01:01:06,348
- That daughter of yours, she's doing well?
- Hmm.

926
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,266
Does she still adore you?

927
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:11,518
I think she does, she's just scared
of showing it, that's all.

928
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:13,730
And you, Johnny?

929
01:01:13,812 --> 01:01:15,981
Still winging it on charm?

930
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:19,109
I'm late. Thank you, Leona.

931
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,988
I've got to go.

932
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:02,153
Thanks, sir.

933
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:09,536
- Hi
- Hi

934
01:02:12,122 --> 01:02:13,665
- Yes?
- Dad, it's me.

935
01:02:13,747 --> 01:02:16,209
At last. Where are you?

936
01:02:16,293 --> 01:02:18,752
I've been worried sick.

937
01:02:18,837 --> 01:02:21,423
I know. I couldn't leave Mom by herself.

938
01:02:21,506 --> 01:02:22,799
Julianne, are you at the farm?

939
01:02:22,881 --> 01:02:25,217
Dad, a man came to see me.

940
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,761
What man? Who?

941
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:29,848
I don't know. He came to my studio. He
wanted to know where you were.

942
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,056
What did you say?

943
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:33,642
I told him the truth.

944
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,729
I said I hadn't seen you, then I packed
a bag and came up to Mom's.

945
01:02:36,813 --> 01:02:39,983
Julianne, I'm going to see you
so soon, I promise.

946
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:42,776
Stay at your mom's, whatever you do.

947
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:44,862
I need to talk to you.

948
01:02:44,946 --> 01:02:46,363
He said they're looking for you.

949
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:48,366
Ah! Here's a surprise.

950
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:51,953
Julianne, I've got to go. I'm sorry.
Stay where you are, please.

951
01:02:55,247 --> 01:02:57,833
Blow me down. Thought the shy boy
wasn't coming.

952
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,587
- I wasn't.
- What made you change your mind?

953
01:03:00,669 --> 01:03:03,797
Oh, you know, whim, caprice.

954
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,475
Good evening.

955
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:41,877
Amen.

956
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:56,475
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

957
01:03:56,558 --> 01:03:59,061
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Prime Minister.

958
01:04:29,383 --> 01:04:31,677
The Prime Minister will now say
a few words.

959
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:34,139
Thank you.

960
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:37,017
Thank you, thank you.

961
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,645
Well, I don't want to spoil
such a wonderful occasion
with a long speech.

962
01:04:40,729 --> 01:04:43,064
As my daughter says, <i>Daddy,
you spoil everything.</i>

963
01:04:44,566 --> 01:04:49,111
But I would like to say a few words,
if I may, about liberal values

964
01:04:49,194 --> 01:04:52,157
and the price of defending them
in the modern world.

965
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:57,453
What do you think? What do
you think of him?

966
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:02,125
I don't know. I've never known
what to make of him.

967
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,628
At least he believes what he says.

968
01:05:05,544 --> 01:05:06,796
Is that enough?

969
01:05:07,379 --> 01:05:09,633
The Prime Minister wants a word.

970
01:05:09,715 --> 01:05:11,676
- Not now.
- When?

971
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,219
Afterwards.

972
01:05:13,595 --> 01:05:15,429
We'll tell you when.

973
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:30,528
Sorry, it's past 1:00. He had
a long phone call.

974
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:37,368
The White House doesn't admit
we're in a different time zone.

975
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:42,791
Ah, Johnny.

976
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:46,543
- It's been a long time.
- So it has.

977
01:05:46,628 --> 01:05:48,045
I'm surprised you could make it.

978
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:50,048
- Why?
- I heard you had flu.

979
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:51,757
Really? Who told you that?

980
01:05:51,841 --> 01:05:53,385
Why? Isn't it true?

981
01:05:54,593 --> 01:05:57,429
- Isn't it?
- Maybe the beginnings. The onset.

982
01:05:58,222 --> 01:06:01,268
Oh, and having just lost the DG,
I didn't think you'd come.

983
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:05,188
I'm sorry, everyone, but we're
going to need some privacy.

984
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:15,990
Please.

985
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:25,666
I remember when peace
first came to Northern Ireland,
I took Ben for a drink.

986
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,378
In those days I was just an MP.

987
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,631
Benedict said, <i>The Cold War's over.
Northern Ireland's fixed.</i>

988
01:06:32,716 --> 01:06:34,843
<i>This could be very bad news
for the service.</i>

989
01:06:34,926 --> 01:06:37,721
Well, all honor to Ben, but it
turned out he was wrong.

990
01:06:37,803 --> 01:06:39,306
- On the contrary.
- Yes.

991
01:06:39,388 --> 01:06:42,892
- We're busier than ever.
- And larger.

992
01:06:42,976 --> 01:06:46,104
That's the problem, isn't it? There's
so much intelligence.

993
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:50,442
Ceaseless intelligence, and there's
barely time to consider it.

994
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:54,028
The difficult thing being to
decide what's important.

995
01:06:54,112 --> 01:06:56,363
- That's right.
- And what's not.

996
01:06:58,617 --> 01:07:00,242
Basic point.

997
01:07:00,326 --> 01:07:01,911
There are times when the interests of

998
01:07:01,995 --> 01:07:05,497
the government and the interests
of the country are coincident.

999
01:07:05,582 --> 01:07:07,833
You can't put a cigarette paper
between them.

1000
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:09,460
Do you agree?

1001
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:13,797
- Do you agree?
- I don't disagree.

1002
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,718
So, I need to be clear.

1003
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:21,430
I'm contemplating reorganization.
Had you heard that?

1004
01:07:21,514 --> 01:07:22,891
As a matter of fact, I had.

1005
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:24,266
Oh, really. Who from?

1006
01:07:27,645 --> 01:07:29,271
Yes.

1007
01:07:29,356 --> 01:07:33,067
A department of Homeland Security.

1008
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,779
It'd be a popular move after the failures
of the last 10 years.

1009
01:07:36,863 --> 01:07:38,782
Let's have a Royal Commission
to give us cover,

1010
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:41,284
then let's reconfigure
the services entirely.

1011
01:07:41,368 --> 01:07:42,702
Why not?

1012
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:45,497
I hardly need say for everyone
already in place

1013
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:47,706
it could mean huge advancement.

1014
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:49,333
Johnny?

1015
01:07:50,084 --> 01:07:51,294
Huge opportunity.

1016
01:07:52,378 --> 01:07:54,004
Or its opposite.

1017
01:07:55,215 --> 01:07:57,633
Right. You understand me.

1018
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,103
There's one other thing
I'd like to discuss.

1019
01:08:09,187 --> 01:08:11,856
Before he died, Benedict gave you a file?

1020
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:17,320
My own view is that file should
not have been distributed.

1021
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:19,780
And for that reason, I'd like it returned.

1022
01:08:24,493 --> 01:08:25,662
Well?

1023
01:08:26,371 --> 01:08:27,747
I don't know what to say.

1024
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,792
I don't carry secret files about my
person, so I don't have it with me.

1025
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:34,670
After all, I came here tonight
for social reasons.

1026
01:08:34,754 --> 01:08:36,840
I find that very hard to believe.

1027
01:08:36,923 --> 01:08:39,718
You don't strike me as an overly
sentimental kind of person.

1028
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,179
Didn't you come here because
you wanted to talk to me?

1029
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:47,517
I think we both know we have a question
to answer, Prime Minister.

1030
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:49,352
And what question is that?

1031
01:08:49,436 --> 01:08:52,188
Why do you imagine Benedict
gave me the file?

1032
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:55,232
- You tell me.
- Why did he show it around?

1033
01:08:55,317 --> 01:08:56,817
Why did he do that?

1034
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:58,028
I've no idea.

1035
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:00,487
- He showed it to the Home Secretary.
- Indeed.

1036
01:09:01,196 --> 01:09:04,408
What's your view, given the sensitivity
of the subject matter?

1037
01:09:04,492 --> 01:09:07,329
My guess is Benedict knew he was ill.

1038
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:10,165
Sorry, he'd already had a heart attack?

1039
01:09:10,248 --> 01:09:13,500
- But also his arm was dragging.
- His arm?

1040
01:09:13,585 --> 01:09:15,503
I noticed at a meeting with
the Home Secretary.

1041
01:09:15,586 --> 01:09:17,338
It's a familiar sign. He couldn't
pick up his papers.

1042
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:20,466
- What meeting was that?
- I think Benedict knew he was dying.

1043
01:09:20,549 --> 01:09:25,012
He handed out the file because he
wanted certain issues discussed.

1044
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:28,016
He wanted everything out in the open.

1045
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:33,647
And so, whatever else, we must
respect his wishes.

1046
01:09:35,732 --> 01:09:37,149
He was my friend.

1047
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:39,945
So for me it's a matter of honor.

1048
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:41,612
Honor?

1049
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,411
Do you know the famous saying
about the yellow box?

1050
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:51,414
I've not heard it, no.

1051
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:55,085
<i>Do not enter the yellow box
unless your exit is clear.</i>

1052
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,420
I wonder where you think your exit is?

1053
01:09:57,503 --> 01:10:00,340
I don't have an exit, so I don't
have a strategy.

1054
01:10:00,422 --> 01:10:02,133
I'm not thinking that far ahead.

1055
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:05,971
I'm very conscious, Prime Minister, that
I've been forced into an area

1056
01:10:06,054 --> 01:10:08,514
closer to politics than it is to security.

1057
01:10:08,598 --> 01:10:09,724
What I was saying earlier.

1058
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:12,935
In times of national emergency,
the two are the same.

1059
01:10:13,019 --> 01:10:15,605
Nothing is more dangerous than
when people make mischief

1060
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,398
by trying to separate them out.

1061
01:10:17,983 --> 01:10:20,068
But surely that's something you're
going to have to take up

1062
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:21,485
with your Home Secretary.

1063
01:10:21,568 --> 01:10:23,780
Yes. I'm working on that.

1064
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,409
Right now, I'm working on you.

1065
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:33,164
Alright. If the file is
correct, it suggests that
you had intelligence

1066
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:35,082
which you failed to share.

1067
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:38,628
You knew the names of potential
British terrorists,

1068
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:40,337
but you failed to pass them on

1069
01:10:40,422 --> 01:10:43,008
because you didn't want to reveal
where you'd got them.

1070
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:44,758
You risked lives.

1071
01:10:45,259 --> 01:10:49,055
And you knowingly misled Parliament
about illegal practices.

1072
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:51,933
Let's look at the facts.

1073
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:55,394
The man who compiled that file is dead.

1074
01:10:55,478 --> 01:10:58,230
And with him died the knowledge
of who his source was.

1075
01:10:58,314 --> 01:11:00,525
I don't know the source. Do you?

1076
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:05,070
You know as well as I do, without
a source your file is worthless.

1077
01:11:05,155 --> 01:11:07,240
The allegations can't be corroborated.

1078
01:11:07,324 --> 01:11:09,701
Therefore, the allegations
can't be correct.

1079
01:11:09,784 --> 01:11:11,910
Is that what you're telling me, sir?

1080
01:11:11,994 --> 01:11:13,246
It's false?

1081
01:11:14,163 --> 01:11:15,706
The allegations are false?

1082
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,632
What time is it?

1083
01:11:25,425 --> 01:11:26,468
Just gone 2:00.

1084
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,345
All other copies of the file
have been returned.

1085
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:31,514
I want yours back within 12 hours.

1086
01:11:33,224 --> 01:11:35,059
2:00 tomorrow, shall we say?

1087
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,816
You've been a loyal servant to
this country for many years.

1088
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,153
I'm not expecting you
to throw it all away.

1089
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,114
No. Nor am I.

1090
01:11:53,995 --> 01:11:55,829
It's late. Can we get you a room?

1091
01:11:56,706 --> 01:11:59,334
No, thank you. I'm staying at a friend's.

1092
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:01,753
Goodnight, sir.

1093
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:08,468
Goodnight, Max. Goodnight, Ted.

1094
01:12:15,976 --> 01:12:18,395
- How did it go?
- I want Special Branch.

1095
01:14:19,306 --> 01:14:22,893
- Alright?
- Yes, but I'm freezing.

1096
01:14:25,354 --> 01:14:27,148
Where are we going?

1097
01:14:33,029 --> 01:14:34,196
I love it.

1098
01:14:35,447 --> 01:14:38,159
- Is this what you do for a living?
- Occasionally.

1099
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:39,493
Wow!

1100
01:14:41,454 --> 01:14:42,579
Wow!

1101
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:45,083
I had a feeling that if I asked a favor,

1102
01:14:45,165 --> 01:14:47,251
you were the sort of person
who'd come through.

1103
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:48,460
You trust me.

1104
01:14:48,877 --> 01:14:50,630
Why on earth would you trust me?

1105
01:14:50,714 --> 01:14:54,216
Because that's the job. Deciding who
to trust. That's what the job is.

1106
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,972
Also, you told your father that
I work for the Home Office.

1107
01:14:59,055 --> 01:15:00,306
- I lied.
- Yeah.

1108
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,058
You trust me because I lied.

1109
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:05,854
Hmm.

1110
01:15:06,313 --> 01:15:08,188
Well, what were you doing in Cambridge?

1111
01:15:08,272 --> 01:15:10,442
Why, seeing the Prime Minister, of course.

1112
01:15:16,113 --> 01:15:18,450
- Anyone behind us?
- No.

1113
01:15:21,827 --> 01:15:24,706
- Are we going back to London?
- No.

1114
01:15:39,511 --> 01:15:42,390
- Two rooms, please.
- One room, two beds, please.

1115
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,309
Don't we need to talk?

1116
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:54,277
I don't want to spoil the evening,
but I have a question.

1117
01:15:54,485 --> 01:15:57,821
- The first time we met, the young man...
- Ralph.

1118
01:15:58,697 --> 01:16:00,366
Tell me, how did you know him?

1119
01:16:01,325 --> 01:16:03,703
- He came to the meetings.
- For the campaign?

1120
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:06,247
He just turned up out of the blue?

1121
01:16:06,331 --> 01:16:07,999
Said he was keen to help.

1122
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,667
Did he?

1123
01:16:13,546 --> 01:16:15,923
- What's this about?
- I got you something.

1124
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:18,592
Something to thank you
for coming to fetch me.

1125
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:20,719
What is it?

1126
01:16:22,055 --> 01:16:24,390
It's the truth about your brother's death.

1127
01:16:25,849 --> 01:16:27,977
I got hold of the Shabak report.

1128
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:29,896
How on earth did you do that?

1129
01:16:30,772 --> 01:16:32,274
It's powerful stuff.

1130
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:37,195
You were right. Jake was killed in cold
blood. There was a cover-up.

1131
01:16:37,987 --> 01:16:42,367
You have a cast-iron
case for manslaughter.
You might get murder.

1132
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:43,659
It's all in there.

1133
01:16:48,123 --> 01:16:49,373
Have you read it?

1134
01:16:58,173 --> 01:17:01,094
The problem is going to be with using it.

1135
01:17:05,014 --> 01:17:06,598
Why shouldn't I use it?

1136
01:17:06,683 --> 01:17:09,059
Because everyone will know
where you got it.

1137
01:17:09,143 --> 01:17:10,227
How would they know?

1138
01:17:10,311 --> 01:17:13,064
You're not cut out for this
line of work, are you?

1139
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:15,108
Tell me what you mean.

1140
01:17:15,191 --> 01:17:18,444
I mean you live opposite me.

1141
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:19,738
We share a landing.

1142
01:17:22,156 --> 01:17:23,408
I see.

1143
01:17:38,089 --> 01:17:39,340
Do you want a drink?

1144
01:17:40,216 --> 01:17:41,425
Um...

1145
01:17:43,594 --> 01:17:46,055
- Am I driving?
- Not with me, you're not.

1146
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,266
Brandy.

1147
01:18:16,586 --> 01:18:20,547
They say you can only begin to mourn
once you know the facts.

1148
01:18:23,676 --> 01:18:25,761
Do you think that's true?

1149
01:18:30,308 --> 01:18:32,059
I'm mourning, too.

1150
01:18:33,478 --> 01:18:34,645
Who?

1151
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:36,940
Who are you mourning?

1152
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:39,316
My oldest friend died

1153
01:18:41,026 --> 01:18:42,486
a couple of days ago.

1154
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,240
He made an allegation.

1155
01:18:47,658 --> 01:18:52,205
An allegation that, as yet,
I've failed to make stick.

1156
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,125
I see.

1157
01:19:02,256 --> 01:19:03,466
Must be tough.

1158
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:07,887
Well, it is.

1159
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:14,810
He left me a job to do.

1160
01:19:16,605 --> 01:19:18,355
And my life's not...

1161
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,320
worth living

1162
01:19:24,904 --> 01:19:26,822
till I see it through.

1163
01:19:34,705 --> 01:19:36,749
I just got my life back.

1164
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:43,881
I don't suppose you'd let me thank you.

1165
01:19:44,923 --> 01:19:47,469
I think I'd die if you thanked me.

1166
01:19:55,059 --> 01:19:58,520
I think some people have been quite
surprised by your new appointment.

1167
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:01,858
Yes. Well, as you know the Prime
Minister & I haven't always seen

1168
01:20:01,942 --> 01:20:03,233
eye-to-eye on every issue,

1169
01:20:03,317 --> 01:20:06,820
but recently events have thrown us
together. And do you know what?

1170
01:20:06,904 --> 01:20:08,906
We've found we actually like each other.

1171
01:20:09,699 --> 01:20:11,742
- You get on.
- Extremely well.

1172
01:20:11,826 --> 01:20:14,079
We've always got on, on a
personal level, and now…

1173
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:15,664
Didn't hear you get up.

1174
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:17,414
Good morning. How are you?

1175
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:20,210
- Better, much better.
- Good.

1176
01:20:20,794 --> 01:20:22,127
Do you know the Home Secretary?

1177
01:20:22,212 --> 01:20:24,422
The one who says, <i>We can't be free
because we have to be safe</i>?

1178
01:20:24,506 --> 01:20:25,756
That's her.

1179
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,926
- Thank you, Mr Eliot.
- Thank you very much.

1180
01:20:28,009 --> 01:20:29,678
She's our deputy Prime Minister.

1181
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,512
I thought we didn't have
a deputy Prime Minister.

1182
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:35,557
We do now. Beasley is saying he thinks
of her as his natural successor.

1183
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:37,226
She's been bought.

1184
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:38,811
We need to go to work. Are you
coming with me?

1185
01:20:38,895 --> 01:20:40,021
Try and stop me.

1186
01:20:40,105 --> 01:20:43,899
Well, as you know, some Prime Ministers
designate a deputy, some don't.

1187
01:20:43,983 --> 01:20:46,527
Obviously, it's a mark of how well
we're now working together

1188
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:49,780
that the Prime Minister has wanted
to give me this particular job title.

1189
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,625
- Emma. How are you?
- Busy.

1190
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:05,088
You haven't met, have you?
This is Nancy Pierpan.

1191
01:21:05,754 --> 01:21:08,174
- Okay.
- So sorry to hear your news.

1192
01:21:09,134 --> 01:21:10,426
She's my neighbor.

1193
01:21:10,509 --> 01:21:12,846
She's kindly doing a stint
as my chauffeur.

1194
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:15,848
Come in.

1195
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:25,442
Go to the barn. She's waiting for you.

1196
01:21:27,818 --> 01:21:31,447
Do you think Nancy could possibly
have a cup of coffee?

1197
01:21:58,599 --> 01:22:01,560
I'm so sorry. I said terrible things.

1198
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:04,229
It's my fault. I've been stupid.

1199
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:05,898
I'm a bad father.

1200
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:08,234
Just put my mind at rest.

1201
01:22:09,443 --> 01:22:12,322
It's not Ralph Wilson, is it?

1202
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:14,031
Ralph Wilson?

1203
01:22:15,157 --> 01:22:16,700
Why would it be Ralph?

1204
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:18,869
Because I saw you together.

1205
01:22:19,037 --> 01:22:21,206
- Are you out of your head?
- Thank God!

1206
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:23,624
Is that what you've been thinking?
Is that what you think of me?

1207
01:22:23,708 --> 01:22:25,418
I didn't know what to think.

1208
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:27,420
If you must know,

1209
01:22:29,254 --> 01:22:32,217
- it was a conceptual artist.
- Oh.

1210
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:34,636
Good.Well...

1211
01:22:36,346 --> 01:22:39,474
I'm glad conceptual artists
are good for something.

1212
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,267
How long did it last?

1213
01:22:43,144 --> 01:22:44,853
It lasted a week.

1214
01:22:46,314 --> 01:22:47,606
A good week?

1215
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:52,362
Well, then, your daughter's
in with a chance.

1216
01:22:52,445 --> 01:22:54,114
How do you know it's a girl?

1217
01:22:54,196 --> 01:22:56,074
Because I had a girl.

1218
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:17,012
I don't know why I bothered
to make you all lunch.

1219
01:23:17,095 --> 01:23:19,180
- God knows, I've got enough to do.
- It's delicious.

1220
01:23:22,516 --> 01:23:25,060
Everyone says Benedict knew he was dying.

1221
01:23:25,144 --> 01:23:28,398
So why didn't he at least leave us
an order of service?

1222
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,317
Did he ask for anything in particular?

1223
01:23:32,027 --> 01:23:36,740
Oh, you know. Stuff about England.

1224
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,870
So typical. So typical of him.

1225
01:23:42,828 --> 01:23:46,625
I don't think Benedict gave a damn
about England, did he? Except...

1226
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:49,126
as some version of paradise.

1227
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,128
Imaginary, like all paradise.

1228
01:23:52,005 --> 01:23:54,840
I'm sure it's what the Belgians
feel about Belgium.

1229
01:23:54,924 --> 01:23:56,425
I'm sure they do.

1230
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:58,136
And the frigging Albanians.

1231
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:02,724
And you're no use.

1232
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,142
You like jazz.

1233
01:24:13,401 --> 01:24:16,111
Johnny, can you come with me, please?

1234
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,961
- There was a politician.
- I'm sorry?

1235
01:24:34,463 --> 01:24:37,424
An American politician
came here for lunch.

1236
01:24:37,508 --> 01:24:39,051
Couple of weeks ago.

1237
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:43,014
I don't suppose you remember his name.

1238
01:24:46,433 --> 01:24:49,561
He piloted his plane
to the local airfield.

1239
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:55,234
You didn't mention this before.

1240
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:58,821
I was angry before.

1241
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,917
Is the plane enough of a clue?

1242
01:26:16,482 --> 01:26:21,862
It's not certain, but there's a
fair chance that I'm going to have
to leave the country.

1243
01:26:23,531 --> 01:26:27,869
I have a feeling this week
may not end well.

1244
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:31,957
I'm running out of rope.

1245
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,253
They're not gonna make me
Deputy Prime Minister.

1246
01:26:41,758 --> 01:26:44,093
Will I see you at the funeral?

1247
01:26:44,928 --> 01:26:46,261
I'll try.

1248
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:51,184
<i>Try</i> as in you will, <i>try</i> as in you won't?

1249
01:28:11,431 --> 01:28:12,641
He's on his way.

1250
01:28:20,564 --> 01:28:22,149
You're going to tell me what you're doing?

1251
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:23,734
I'm doing what you do for a living.

1252
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:26,154
Aren't you in the surveillance business?

1253
01:28:26,237 --> 01:28:29,073
Going through your things,
seeing what's there.

1254
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:33,243
Don't worry. I don't do guns or violence.

1255
01:28:35,162 --> 01:28:36,372
How did you get in?

1256
01:28:37,123 --> 01:28:39,084
There's a dead-lock in the combination.

1257
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:43,045
We still have skills in the public sector
you don't in the private.

1258
01:28:43,421 --> 01:28:44,672
Contact, contact.

1259
01:28:45,966 --> 01:28:48,510
Nancy, you can come up now.

1260
01:28:48,593 --> 01:28:50,136
This is an expensive outfit.

1261
01:28:50,762 --> 01:28:53,682
I was wondering who'd stake
such a serious investment.

1262
01:28:53,765 --> 01:28:56,225
And then I saw the photo on the fridge.

1263
01:28:56,309 --> 01:28:58,102
I had you marked from the beginning.

1264
01:28:58,185 --> 01:28:59,853
- I know you did.
- From the moment I met you.

1265
01:28:59,938 --> 01:29:01,897
I've been taking photos of your operation.

1266
01:29:01,982 --> 01:29:05,235
- Are they on that camera?
- And sending them to a computer.

1267
01:29:05,318 --> 01:29:07,195
You're Jill Tankard's little boy.

1268
01:29:09,196 --> 01:29:10,280
Nothing to say?

1269
01:29:14,368 --> 01:29:18,455
This is the man who pretended
to support your campaign.

1270
01:29:18,665 --> 01:29:20,250
I can't believe what you did.

1271
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:21,918
I can't believe it.

1272
01:29:23,168 --> 01:29:26,589
- How far would you have taken it?
- I'd have slept with you.

1273
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:28,340
For Queen and country,
I would have done it.

1274
01:29:28,424 --> 01:29:31,093
I was never interested in you,
I was interested in him.

1275
01:29:31,177 --> 01:29:33,637
I meant to believe that
it was a coincidence.

1276
01:29:34,138 --> 01:29:38,602
An MI5 man just happens to live
opposite a known subversive.

1277
01:29:38,685 --> 01:29:39,893
I'm not a subversive.

1278
01:29:39,977 --> 01:29:42,104
- Then what the fuck are you?
- Ralph!

1279
01:29:42,188 --> 01:29:44,189
It's time to have a word with your mom.

1280
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:02,500
I'm going to leave early. Please
cancel all my appointments.

1281
01:30:09,006 --> 01:30:10,257
He's back in contact.

1282
01:30:25,398 --> 01:30:26,940
What made you choose this place?

1283
01:30:27,025 --> 01:30:29,026
Best reason, because the food is good.

1284
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:32,948
Hello. I've got whiskey, but my friend
usually drinks white wine.

1285
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,324
- Whiskey.
- Of course.

1286
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:40,121
So, interesting choice. How does
it feel to be unemployable?

1287
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:42,165
What's in the bag? Have you
brought me the file?

1288
01:30:42,248 --> 01:30:45,042
I've been trying to calculate how long
you've been working this racket.

1289
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:46,210
What racket is that?

1290
01:30:46,294 --> 01:30:49,005
You're running a cowboy unit
out of Downing Street.

1291
01:30:49,089 --> 01:30:52,509
Don't think you can call it a cowboy unit.
We answer to the Prime Minister.

1292
01:30:52,592 --> 01:30:55,094
- Clearly you've forgotten, so do we.
- What's your point?

1293
01:30:55,178 --> 01:30:57,012
The Prime Minister never liked
the security services

1294
01:30:57,096 --> 01:30:59,349
because we refused to tell him
what he wanted to hear

1295
01:30:59,432 --> 01:31:01,141
and we were always bothering him
with facts.

1296
01:31:01,225 --> 01:31:03,520
So he started his own intelligence unit.
Am I right?

1297
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:05,479
Dealing directly with the Americans.

1298
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:12,404
In traditional practice, the torturers are
meant to be held at arm's length.

1299
01:31:12,778 --> 01:31:14,072
You have no proof.

1300
01:31:14,154 --> 01:31:16,824
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

1301
01:31:17,242 --> 01:31:19,160
I found Ben's source.

1302
01:31:19,368 --> 01:31:21,578
I've spoken to Ben's source.

1303
01:31:21,662 --> 01:31:25,083
- I don't believe you.
- Believe what you like.

1304
01:31:25,165 --> 01:31:27,085
And will that source go on the record?

1305
01:31:27,627 --> 01:31:31,673
- Can you produce that source?
- That's a gamble you're going to have to take.

1306
01:31:31,756 --> 01:31:34,968
Johnny, you're bluffing
with an empty hand.

1307
01:31:35,343 --> 01:31:37,845
Is the Prime Minister willing
to take that risk?

1308
01:31:37,929 --> 01:31:39,681
I know the source.

1309
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:51,026
Face it, the world's changed.

1310
01:31:51,734 --> 01:31:53,777
What are the British gonna do?
Get new allies?

1311
01:31:53,861 --> 01:31:57,240
- Allies who behave better?
- Benedict was onto you, wasn't he?

1312
01:31:57,324 --> 01:31:59,451
He'd worked it out. That's why
he put the file out.

1313
01:31:59,533 --> 01:32:01,660
Because he knew you were betraying
your own department.

1314
01:32:01,744 --> 01:32:04,539
Reporting to the Prime Minister
isn't betrayal.

1315
01:32:04,623 --> 01:32:09,043
You financed a piece of private enterprise
and employed your own son.

1316
01:32:10,044 --> 01:32:12,422
I've taken photographs of his premises.

1317
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,180
Fuck this. This isn't the student union.
I'm not here to debate.

1318
01:32:20,263 --> 01:32:22,473
The world's moving on,
and it's time it did.

1319
01:32:22,556 --> 01:32:25,936
Because you guys, with your
public-school ties and your,

1320
01:32:26,019 --> 01:32:30,065
<i>After you, old chap,</i> didn't make much
of a job of it, did you?

1321
01:32:30,148 --> 01:32:33,276
Last meeting of the club, Johnny.
Last meeting of the club.

1322
01:32:37,154 --> 01:32:40,908
In the last 48 hours you've broken
every rule in the book.

1323
01:32:40,992 --> 01:32:44,453
You're no longer in the service.
You will never work again.

1324
01:32:44,536 --> 01:32:45,664
Your pension's gone.

1325
01:32:45,747 --> 01:32:49,417
And if you blow the whistle now
you'll also go to prison.

1326
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:50,793
Is that what you want?

1327
01:32:51,126 --> 01:32:54,922
Because that's what lies ahead
if you don't give me that file.

1328
01:32:56,216 --> 01:32:58,677
- I'm willing to cut a deal.
- What's the deal?

1329
01:32:59,176 --> 01:33:01,930
No Royal Commission, no reorganization.

1330
01:33:02,013 --> 01:33:03,473
- Is that all?
- No.

1331
01:33:04,099 --> 01:33:08,560
Publication of the internal Israeli report
on the death of Jake Pierpan.

1332
01:33:09,854 --> 01:33:11,773
- You're crazy.
- We leak it.

1333
01:33:11,856 --> 01:33:14,526
The government admits
it's deeply concerned.

1334
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:18,738
It's shocked at the cover-up in
the occupied territories. That's
the deal.

1335
01:33:19,155 --> 01:33:20,573
- You know it's impossible.
- Is it?

1336
01:33:20,657 --> 01:33:22,742
- Of course!
- It's the quid pro quo.

1337
01:33:22,826 --> 01:33:25,536
You give me something,
I give you something.

1338
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:30,041
Think about it. This is far worse.

1339
01:33:33,961 --> 01:33:37,882
Isn't the temptation of heroism coming
a little late in your career?

1340
01:33:39,216 --> 01:33:41,802
I've watched you work.
I always admired you.

1341
01:33:41,885 --> 01:33:46,473
I thought, <i>Johnny's clever. Johnny keeps
out of trouble.</i>

1342
01:33:47,558 --> 01:33:49,853
<i>Johnny's a lucky man, he's got a life.</i>

1343
01:33:53,897 --> 01:33:56,483
Don't you have a life, Jill?

1344
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:05,577
It's the girl, isn't it?

1345
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,788
You're doing this for the girl.

1346
01:34:10,749 --> 01:34:13,918
They come and go. Don't they, Johnny?

1347
01:34:14,878 --> 01:34:16,046
They come and go.

1348
01:34:19,923 --> 01:34:21,467
Not this time.

1349
01:34:27,723 --> 01:34:29,434
Is the file in there?

1350
01:34:43,156 --> 01:34:45,283
- Hello?
- Is that Allegra?

1351
01:34:45,366 --> 01:34:46,408
It is.

1352
01:34:46,909 --> 01:34:49,871
I believe my friend Rollo
gave you a document.

1353
01:34:49,955 --> 01:34:51,121
He did.

1354
01:34:51,498 --> 01:34:54,917
Go ahead, broadcast. You
have my permission.

1355
01:34:57,796 --> 01:34:59,839
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1356
01:35:38,378 --> 01:35:40,087
- What are you doing?
- Just reading.

1357
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:41,339
Okay.

1358
01:35:42,465 --> 01:35:44,299
Looking for the next great novel.

1359
01:35:45,218 --> 01:35:47,220
They don't seem to understand
that feelings are interesting,

1360
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:49,848
but the world is interesting, too.

1361
01:35:53,018 --> 01:35:55,686
- Want some coffee?
- I have to say goodbye.

1362
01:35:57,271 --> 01:35:59,816
- Goodbye?
- Yeah.

1363
01:36:01,901 --> 01:36:03,736
What does goodbye mean?

1364
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,368
If you want a Saab, it's waiting
in Cambridge.

1365
01:36:11,452 --> 01:36:13,830
You'll have to pay the parking charges,

1366
01:36:14,706 --> 01:36:16,540
but it's nicer than your Peugeot.

1367
01:36:19,293 --> 01:36:21,795
This is a small painting you might like.

1368
01:36:22,714 --> 01:36:24,799
It's by the same artist,

1369
01:36:26,301 --> 01:36:27,802
but not as good.

1370
01:36:28,218 --> 01:36:29,720
Couldn't possibly take it.

1371
01:36:29,803 --> 01:36:31,097
You can take it.

1372
01:36:31,889 --> 01:36:34,391
You're going to live for many years
and be an old woman.

1373
01:36:34,475 --> 01:36:38,062
And this way, you'll always have
something decent on your wall.

1374
01:36:39,647 --> 01:36:41,732
Going to tell me why you have to go?

1375
01:36:41,816 --> 01:36:43,233
I've cut a deal.

1376
01:36:43,317 --> 01:36:46,320
They've gone along with it,
but they don't like it.

1377
01:36:46,403 --> 01:36:48,447
They'll make my life not worth living.

1378
01:36:49,448 --> 01:36:51,409
Would you like me to come with you?

1379
01:36:54,955 --> 01:36:57,289
I couldn't ask you to do that.

1380
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:03,587
Couldn't or...won't?

1381
01:37:11,137 --> 01:37:14,683
I'm not really used to the idea
of having feelings again.

1382
01:37:16,725 --> 01:37:19,521
It's dangerous, isn't it?

1383
01:37:27,946 --> 01:37:29,864
Too dangerous for you?

1384
01:37:34,494 --> 01:37:37,747
I'm frightened. I fuck everything up.

1385
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:40,959
Shh.

1386
01:38:14,326 --> 01:38:15,617
Thank you.

1387
01:38:15,702 --> 01:38:17,871
- You're welcome.
- This is very kind of you.

1388
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,003
We're heading north.

1389
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:48,484
We're here today to remember
the life of Benedict Baron.

1390
01:38:49,401 --> 01:38:52,364
The hymns and readings have
been chosen by his family.

1391
01:38:52,946 --> 01:38:56,742
And the first hymn by his oldest friend,
John Worricker.

1392
01:38:57,452 --> 01:38:59,621
I Vow to Thee, My Country.

1393
01:39:12,341 --> 01:39:17,847
I vow to thee, my country

1394
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:22,685
All earthly things above

1395
01:39:22,768 --> 01:39:27,816
Entire and whole and perfect

1396
01:39:27,898 --> 01:39:32,862
The service of my love

1397
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:39,493
The government today responded officially

1398
01:39:39,576 --> 01:39:41,871
to the document obtained by the BBC

1399
01:39:41,954 --> 01:39:44,665
which reveals that the peace
campaigner Jake Pierpan

1400
01:39:44,748 --> 01:39:47,127
was gunned down in the occupied
territories

1401
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:50,462
when he was clearly holding a white flag.

1402
01:39:50,755 --> 01:39:54,301
The Prime Minister, Alec Beasley,
today visiting his constituency,

1403
01:39:54,384 --> 01:39:57,846
acknowledged the strengths of public
reaction to the revelation.

1404
01:39:57,929 --> 01:40:04,352
Even at times of national crisis,
certain basic human freedoms have
to be protected.

1405
01:40:04,435 --> 01:40:07,897
We must never stop insisting on telling
the truth to our enemies,

1406
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:12,068
but sometimes we have to tell the truth
to our friends as well.

1407
01:40:12,152 --> 01:40:16,947
That's a difficult duty, but between
democracies with shared values

1408
01:40:17,031 --> 01:40:18,615
it's an essential one.

1409
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:24,039
And there's another country

1410
01:40:24,122 --> 01:40:28,959
I've heard of long ago

1411
01:40:29,127 --> 01:40:34,298
Most dear to them that love her

1412
01:40:34,382 --> 01:40:39,303
Most great to them that know

1413
01:40:39,804 --> 01:40:42,139
Politicians on all sides in Britain

1414
01:40:42,223 --> 01:40:44,099
are today expressing their shock

1415
01:40:44,183 --> 01:40:48,480
at the news that the Israeli Army
suppressed a highly critical Shabak
report,

1416
01:40:48,563 --> 01:40:51,482
which established the truth about
the death of a British peace…

1417
01:40:51,566 --> 01:40:53,901
I wonder, could we change the station?

1418
01:40:53,984 --> 01:40:55,653
Anything you want?

1419
01:40:55,737 --> 01:40:57,530
I'd like some jazz.
