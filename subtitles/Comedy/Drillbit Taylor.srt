1
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,948
<i>Please enjoy the music
while your party is reached.</i>

2
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,328
<i>- Hello?
- So what do you think?</i>

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,591
<i>- About what?
- About tomorrow.</i>

4
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,189
<i>It's our first day of high school.</i>

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,736
<i>If we want to be popular,
we just have to be proactive.</i>

6
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,668
<i>Calm your proactive ass down.</i>

7
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,174
<i>Saying you want to be popular
guarantees it isn't gonna happen.</i>

8
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,836
I'm gonna get a girlfriend.
You think that's possible?

9
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,936
Anything's possible, Wade.

10
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,037
<i>Just don't be needy.</i>

11
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,640
<i>You got to let it come to you.
And one more thing.</i>

12
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,185
From now on,
I don't want you calling me Ryan.

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,290
Call me T-Dog.

14
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,726
- T-Dog?
- Yep.

15
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,056
<i>- What does the "T" stand for?
- I don't know.</i>

16
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,223
<i>- But it sounds better than R-Dog.
- Yeah.</i>

17
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,960
You know, like, if a hot girl
went up to you, and she goes,

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,096
"Hey, have you met T-Dog?
Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?

19
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,800
"Man, that T-Dog is crazy!"

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,469
<i>That sounds like a guy
every woman would want to know.</i>

21
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,514
- Hey, do I need a nickname?
- You have one. Skeletor.

22
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,516
That was last year.
I look good now. I'm filling out.

23
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,950
All right, name one part of your body
that filled out, Wade.

24
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,579
Name one part of your body
that isn't filled out, huh?

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,123
I'm not trying to offend you.

26
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,716
<i>I'm just saying you shot up too fast
and you're freakishly skinny.</i>

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,092
Oh, yeah? Well, you're too fat
and that's equally unattractive.

28
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,960
- You wanna go there?
- I'm sorry.

29
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,863
It's just, I want things to go well,
you know?

30
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,562
- Sorry I said you're freakishly skinny.
- It's okay.

31
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,002
<i>You just are.</i>

32
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,301
Hey, go to sleep!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

33
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,433
- What are you, crazy?
- Sorry.

34
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,532
<i>- Is that your stepdad?
- No one.</i>

35
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,611
- Give me that phone! Give it!
- It's...

36
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,203
<i>You're in high school now.
Don't take his...</i>

37
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,577
Go to sleep.

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,848
How about some
chicks on the walls in here?

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,854
It's like a nerd paradise.

40
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,042
Time to make the donuts.

41
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,879
Hoo-rah!

42
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,052
Touchdown!

43
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,021
We won! We won the game!
And Wade loses again!

44
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,097
- Get out of my room!
- Dad said get up.

45
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,665
He's not my dad. He's your dad.

46
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,734
Fine, the guy who does your mom
says get up.

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,700
- Just leave!
- Loser!

48
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,666
Morning, sunshine. First day of school.

49
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,145
- Mom!
- Oh, my God!

50
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,077
Since when did you start
sleeping naked?

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,912
I'm in high school now,
don't you remember?

52
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,885
I don't like elastic squeezing
on my ass when I sleep!

53
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,011
Okay.

54
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,119
Hey! What are you doing
in this shower?

55
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,354
Dawn? Rachel, that's right.
Nice to see you.

56
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,731
<i>Put your hands up
Put your hands up</i>

57
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,528
<i>I'm the best white rapper
you've ever seen</i>

58
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,364
A hair!

59
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,571
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

60
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,343
Thank you, ladies!

61
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,482
What's up, winners? You stoked?
Pedal to the metal?

62
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,580
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,659
All right. Who's a winner?

64
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,748
- I am!
- I am!

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,849
Morning!

66
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,762
- Look at you, with your magic stick.
- What do you think?

67
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,423
Magic is stupid.

68
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,763
No, no, honey.

69
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,234
- Mom!
- What?

70
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,067
You forgot the sausages!

71
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,100
- I'll get the sausages.
- Come on. I'm hungry.

72
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,871
All right, I'll get the sausages.

73
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,811
Excuse me, listen,
I'm really sorry to bother you.

74
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,507
My family and I, we just ran out of gas

75
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,949
and we're trying to get to the kids
to SeaWorld.

76
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,680
And, I, like an idiot forgot my wallet.
If I can just...

77
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,222
- Your legs work okay?
- Yeah, why?

78
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,417
You should walk somewhere
and get a job.

79
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,187
- Harold...
- I'll take care of it.

80
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,887
That's what I have, a job.

81
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,055
We'll get to SeaWorld
one way or the other.

82
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,532
We're on our way to church.
Maybe that's where you ought to go.

83
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,536
Thank you. Have a great day.

84
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,831
- Can you help out a veteran?
- Not today.

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,908
- Get away from the car.
- Honey, roll up the window.

86
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,067
Get away!

87
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,905
- What's your name?
- Drillbit.

88
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,877
Listen, Drillbit, I wasn't born yesterday.

89
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,110
I don't want you using this on
any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?

90
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,778
- You got my word on it.
- You know what?

91
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,789
- I'm gonna write "not for pot" on there.
- You don't have to write.

92
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,018
Yeah. "Not for pot. "

93
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,028
You're gonna feel pretty silly if you try
to buy weed with that, won't you?

94
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,859
Remember, put your best foot forward.

95
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,867
People decide what they think about you
in the first five seconds.

96
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,335
So, let me smell your breath.

97
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,427
Minty.

98
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,473
- You swipe on some deodorant?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:13,204
- You dust the nuts?
- No, Jim. I did not dust my nuts.

100
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,008
I'll never get tired of that one, Dad.

101
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,207
You know, you should hit the weights
with the boys and me.

102
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,410
- I'll pass.
- We'll get you in the gym.

103
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,511
We'll beef you up. Look at these guys.
Show them. Give him a gun shot.

104
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,180
Give him a crab.

105
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,781
Worship the sun.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,555
- Yeah, look at these guys.
- They're freaks.

107
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,562
Not in my house!

108
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,822
<i>- Have a great day.
- Okay, I love you, Dad.</i>

109
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,027
<i>I love you, too.
Have fun at school, Ryan. Bye.</i>

110
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,574
- So what'd your dad say?
- He told me to have fun.

111
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,008
Wow, great parenting.

112
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,512
I don't know how
we're surviving without him.

113
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,775
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

114
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,377
- He's a piece of shit, anyway.
- Thank you, honey.

115
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,285
<i>- Enchanté.
- Hello.</i>

116
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,956
You got room for two
in this little speedster?

117
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,692
I am in a rush now. But I hostess up
at Moon Shadows on the one.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,325
So if you get up there just, you know,
ask for me. I'm Jessica.

119
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,370
- Thanks, Jessica.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,372
'Cause our chef, Louis,
always makes too much chowder.

121
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,500
So he'll set you up with
a nice plastic bowl of it out back.

122
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,349
- You're late today.
- Hey, get a job!

123
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,816
- You get a job.
- I already got one, giving money to you.

124
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,285
- How're you doing, Mrs. Lampanelli?
- All right.

125
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,052
- You look beautiful today.
- You're a liar. But it works for me.

126
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,922
- Go on, get out of here, you nut!
- You earned it.

127
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,621
And don't spend it on food. Porn only!

128
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,093
First day of high school.

129
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,838
- It's kind of scary.
- Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.

130
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,311
Sure, last year we were the oldest
so we got to sit in the back of the bus,

131
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,349
but now we'll probably have to sit
in the front with the losers.

132
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,443
We'll be all right.

133
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,956
You have to have a proactive attitude
if you wanna be popular in high school.

134
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,584
People decide what they think of you
in the first five seconds.

135
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,194
I think you're a dork.

136
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,400
Oh, Wade.

137
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,937
- Oh, no.
- This is uncool.

138
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,870
We can't start high school like this.

139
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,340
You got to be shitting me. Come on.

140
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,571
- Please, am I dreaming here?
- No.

141
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,806
We're never allowed
to buy the same shirt again!

142
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,439
Whoever sees it first gets to buy it.

143
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,178
You guys should wear
red ribbons in your hair, too.

144
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,277
See? We both look like dorks.
Go change.

145
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,754
No! I'm the one who was
planning on wearing this.

146
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,452
Wade, I run the mile in 21 minutes!

147
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,158
How fast do you think I can go?

148
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,199
- Go! Hurry!
- I'm going!

149
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,627
Wade, bus!

150
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,764
- Perfect!
- Come on!

151
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,172
What a way to start high school, huh?

152
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,275
Let me guess.
Two-for-one sale at Hot Topic?

153
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,851
- Losers!
- Dorks!

154
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,318
We're dead.

155
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,226
First day of our high school careers.

156
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,565
All right, let's light this fuse
and see what happens.

157
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,631
- Let's go, man.
- All right.

158
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,172
Are you guys part of a bowling team?

159
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,707
Last one.

160
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,843
Hey, at least it'll be easy
to find each other.

161
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,888
Yeah. I'll just look
for the kid with the same shirt.

162
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,556
- Come on!
- No, you have to spin it a few times first

163
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,961
to get it to work.

164
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,793
Thank you.

165
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,600
No, wait! Wait!

166
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,035
- What are you guys doing? Guys!
- Now, shut it. Move!

167
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,510
- No, thanks.
- Guys!

168
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,171
- Get out of the way!
- Man!

169
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,682
- Here we go.
- But that... That's not for me.

170
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,274
- That's for my books!
- Okay, here we go.

171
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,353
- In there.
- I am not a book!

172
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,182
- Get in there!
- This is bad.

173
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,917
- This isn't my locker! Please!
- No, this is good.

174
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,152
At least we know we're not
the biggest dorks in school.

175
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,784
- Please, please, please!
- Maybe we should say something.

176
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,157
It's survival of the fittest.

177
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,629
I've got to say something.
I got to. I have to.

178
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,599
Say something? It's hilarious.
The kid fits in the locker. Come on.

179
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,260
- That's not funny.
- Somebody, help!

180
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,701
This is the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

181
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,035
- Help! Please!
- Stop!

182
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,713
- I mean, you don't have to, but...
- Harry Potter.

183
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,619
You need to keep your big mouth shut.

184
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,385
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to tell him.

185
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,552
- Hey!
- Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!

186
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,599
Hey, check this out.
Matching shirt geeks.

187
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,861
Oh, my God.

188
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,960
Yo, Ron, these bitches
really wanna wear the same shirt.

189
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,402
Let's make them
wear the same shirt, huh?

190
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,268
Sounds good. Yeah.

191
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,642
The fat one here, the skinny one there,
and just let go.

192
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,103
There.

193
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,507
You better keep that shit on,

194
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,746
'cause if I see you trying to take it off,
you're dead.

195
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,118
And you know what happens
if one of you dies? Both of you dies.

196
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,748
'Cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!

197
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,925
That's very cute.

198
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,003
You look like those Velcro monkeys
who hug each other.

199
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,963
How was school, Wade?

200
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,634
We made so many friends,
I can't even remember all their names.

201
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,577
- Great! You got to be in it to win it.
- I am in it!

202
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,669
Great.

203
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,638
Yeah!

204
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,016
- Yeah.
- So school went well, huh?

205
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,748
Oh, it was great.
It couldn't have gone better.

206
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,155
It was the shirt, right?
I'll have to get you more of those.

207
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,125
Hey! What are you doing?
That's my stuff!

208
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,288
This is city property.

209
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,263
Nobody's supposed to be
camping out here.

210
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,958
Your stuff's in the dumpster
around the corner.

211
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,061
That's where I eat! You don't put
a man's belongings where he eats!

212
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,699
- My taxes pay for your salary.
- You don't pay taxes.

213
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,437
- You don't even have a job.
- What else you wanna remind me of?

214
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,276
That I don't have good health care?
That I don't belong to a good gym?

215
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:27,182
Where's the compassion?
Protect and serve. That's what it says.

216
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,116
- Compassion?
- Yeah, compassion.

217
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,280
You wanna know
what I have compassion for?

218
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,656
The homeless who are mentally ill,
the homeless who are drug-addicted.

219
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,752
Buddy, you're just a jackass.

220
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,694
Oh, guy hits a little bit of bump
in the road and he's a jackass?

221
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,564
Maybe I should go smoke some crack
and get your sympathy.

222
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,103
- Go back to the Village People!
- Back up!

223
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,229
Damn!

224
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,073
All right, today is the first day
of our high school careers.

225
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,942
Yes, it is.

226
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,018
There she is.

227
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,784
That's the girl who came up to me
at my locker.

228
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:11,289
- Well, make your move.
- What move? I don't have a move.

229
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,606
All right, thanks for signing up.

230
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,112
How're you doing?

231
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,150
Is this your first time signing up
for the Heritage Club?

232
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,311
- Yeah, it is. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

233
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,390
What'd you sign up for?

234
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,988
- Photography and Asian Heritage.
- Asian Heritage, huh?

235
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,588
- I like your commitment.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,225
- I like it a lot.
- Hey, buddies! Remember me?

237
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,895
- Hi.
- Oh, Jesus H.

238
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,499
Oh, God.

239
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,968
Guys, why aren't you wearing them?

240
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,344
- Why are you talking to us?
- I just wanted to say thank you

241
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,041
for helping me out yesterday and all.

242
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,676
You guys are definitely the type of
people I'm gonna want to hang out with.

243
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,017
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Emmit Oosterhaus, by the way.

244
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,249
- Hi.
- Wade. That's T-Dog.

245
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,384
T- Dog? Dude,
that's a really cool nickname.

246
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,621
Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?

247
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,755
We need to ditch this guy.
He's like a stray cat.

248
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,628
Once you feed him,
he'll never go away, okay?

249
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,429
Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.

250
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,763
I'm off to U.S. History.

251
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,030
- U.S. History.
- Hey, look!

252
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,732
The Siamese queers had a baby.

253
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,968
I guess that makes them triplets,
now doesn't it?

254
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,909
Well, actually,
we still wouldn't be triplets, see.

255
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,578
You see, they'd be my parents,
and I'd be the baby.

256
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,808
Don't get smart with me.

257
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,717
I said you're triplets and I think that
you guys need to get into his shirt

258
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,584
- and be triplets.
- We can do that.

259
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,283
You know what? Emmit, shut up.

260
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,361
Look, you really have to
do this crap, guys?

261
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,328
Come on, give us a break.
It's the second day of school.

262
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,763
Hey, I like this kid. Yeah.

263
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,902
Double Stuf's got an attitude.

264
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,140
Yeah. We have to do this shit
because it's hilarious.

265
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,203
This school is boring.

266
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,146
Watching you freak out amuses me.

267
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,850
And, yeah, it's just the second day
of school. So guess what?

268
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:20,290
It's gonna keep coming
and coming and coming!

269
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,122
Party time!

270
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,265
- Stop peeing on me!
- Wait! Wait! No!

271
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,103
He pissed himself. What a loser.

272
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,553
Help.

273
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,514
Help me!

274
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,625
- Is that Mario Lopez, dude?
- Whoever he is, he's cute!

275
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,066
Take his pants off! Pants off!

276
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,313
- Up, down, up...
- Write your name!

277
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,958
No! Please, don't! No! Don't!

278
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,662
Bernie?

279
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,404
- Come on, give me one match, here.
- That's funny.

280
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,878
- All I need is one.
- Yeah, I like it.

281
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,472
- Will you just give up?
- Damn it! Look at that.

282
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,212
God, I can't even get one card!
Not one thing!

283
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,586
State of California just robbed me, Don.
You saw it.

284
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,058
You'd think... Where's my quarter?
Did you see my...

285
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,994
- You're always looking at me.
- Is the pill bottle... I forget,

286
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,363
- is that the castle or is that a rook?
- Don, did you just take my quarter?

287
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,868
No, I didn't take your quarter, Drillbit.

288
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,962
Not my fault you can't keep track
of your finances.

289
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,405
I don't know why you're spending all
your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.

290
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,136
You're unbelievable.
I got to get out of here.

291
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,508
You know,
I can't take this anymore, man.

292
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,309
Rich people don't like us,

293
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,043
and the tourists are scared of us.

294
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,642
- When they see Bernie, they're terrified.
- Terrified.

295
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,450
They're not scared of me, I'm sexy.

296
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,149
- Sanitizer?
- Yeah.

297
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,191
Yeah. Thanks, man.

298
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,529
I just get... I'm like a bird.
I just wanna fly north. I want to...

299
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,534
I'd like to go to Canada.

300
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,598
What was it last year? I think it was,

301
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,500
- "I was gonna go to Iceland. "
- Reykjavík.

302
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,594
- No, no.
- Where's that?

303
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,641
Yeah, but the thing about Canada,
if you go high enough north...

304
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,233
- That's right.
... the government pays you

305
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,743
- to take the land.
- That's the truth.

306
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,508
Yeah. Lookit, man,
the beer's twice as strong.

307
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,413
They don't lock the doors,
that should appeal to a man like you.

308
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,713
And what about
a British Columbian girl?

309
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,084
Does that sound like
a pretty potent mix?

310
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,191
Yeah, that's not too bad.
I kind of like that.

311
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,859
Okay, now, man, check this out.

312
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,861
One-way flight to Canada, $287.

313
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,329
You got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing,
what're they called,

314
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,263
- the Federales, the...
- Mounties.

315
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,959
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.

316
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,698
Another...
I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.

317
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:25,573
<i>So we're talking $387 and it's a new
life for your old hombre, Drillbit.</i>

318
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,441
I dig it, man. Follow the dream.
Chase that thing.

319
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,310
How you gonna come up
with that kind of money, though?

320
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,542
Get a job.

321
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,118
I was an Army Ranger.
There are a lot of people dying for that.

322
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,949
Watch this kid play Hendrix.
He really jams. Look at him.

323
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,523
Oh, yeah, there he goes.

324
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,649
Yeah, I like how he looks
a little bit like Hendrix.

325
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,058
Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.

326
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,997
- I'll give him a couple bucks.
- A buck? Give him a compliment, man!

327
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,067
Give me a buck!

328
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,851
Why is he in my house?

329
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,013
Are we trying to attract
after-school bullies?

330
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,455
I'm here because
Wade invited me to be here.

331
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,652
Because I'm your friend now.

332
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,828
This fantasy land you live in,
Emmit, are there rides?

333
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,526
Stop picking on him, all right?
This is our guy.

334
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,124
I don't want him to be our guy.

335
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:28,036
Well, the good news is, I think I found
a solution to our problems.

336
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,865
- Kill Emmit?
- No, bear with me.

337
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,706
This might sound stupid,
but I was on the Internet last night

338
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,714
and there's a bunch of sites where
we can hire a professional bodyguard.

339
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,274
- What do you mean by bodyguard?
- Like he beats up kids that bother us.

340
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,322
A bodyguard? Wade,
that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

341
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,654
We should just be men
and fight these kids!

342
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,090
Are you serious?

343
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,226
Of course not. I've never been in a fight.

344
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,867
Have you seen those
high school fights on YouTube?

345
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,527
Kids are brutal.

346
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,808
He gave us an earthquake
when we were peeing in the urinal.

347
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:04,898
He shoved me in a locker.

348
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,741
And he put my head in his shirt
and called us Siamese queers.

349
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,017
How's that funny?

350
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,917
It's not funny. It's just, it's rare that,

351
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,785
you know,
kids say things that surprise me.

352
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,792
Siamese queers.
I'd never heard that one.

353
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:28,021
- What would you like me to do?
- We really just want it to stop.

354
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,331
So are they pretty much free to say
whatever they want?

355
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,734
Or am I allowed to defend myself?

356
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,033
Oh, no. Principal Doppler,
I thought this was gonna be anonymous.

357
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,341
In this country, we give the accused
the chance to face his accusers.

358
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,937
Terry, come over here for a second,
will you?

359
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,813
Now we've known each other for...
Yeah, have a seat.

360
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,150
- What's your take on this?
- Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?

361
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,324
Be polite! There you go.

362
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,851
- Wade.
- Hi.

363
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,087
Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.

364
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,291
Yeah. Principal Doppler, sir,
I was really excited

365
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,392
about starting this new school year.
I'm not gonna lie.

366
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,364
Who knows?
I, maybe, was hazing them a little bit,

367
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,875
but I'm sorry.

368
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,274
I really am.

369
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,279
You know, I appreciate you taking
responsibility. It's refreshing.

370
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,611
- He doesn't mean it!
- We need to call his parents in.

371
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,981
- Now.
- He doesn't have any parents.

372
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,055
Well, not in this country, anyway.
They live in Hong Kong.

373
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,954
- He's an emancipated minor.
- What does that mean?

374
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,323
It means he's legally an adult.

375
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,455
He answers to no one.

376
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,259
He's above the law.

377
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,901
- What a nightmare, huh?
- Yeah.

378
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,727
Oh, crap.

379
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,029
Oh, no.

380
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,703
- Run.
- Go! Go!

381
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,781
- Run! Go, go!
- Hurry.

382
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,508
Wait for me!

383
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,694
Go, go!

384
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,502
- Do you think he sees us?
- No.

385
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,322
Open the door! Open the door!

386
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,549
What do they want?

387
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,092
Just keep driving, Mom.
It's none of our business.

388
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,433
Let's go, let's go!

389
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,556
Have you guys lost your mind?
Come on, let's go!

390
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,622
Go, go, come on!

391
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,990
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

392
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,558
- Run! Run!
- Go!

393
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,226
Get them, baby!

394
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,807
There! The garage!

395
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,522
You gonna rat on me, boys?

396
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,431
Try to get my parents involved
in this situation?

397
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:56,005
Now I have to make it my mission
to destroy you punks!

398
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,509
Hey! You kids get the hell off
my property!

399
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,774
I'm gonna give you three seconds,
then I'm getting my shotgun!

400
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,008
- No!
- You better get out of here right now!

401
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,381
- Please don't!
- No! Please!

402
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,754
One! Two! Three!

403
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,995
- Go! Go!
- And stay out, you gang bangers!

404
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,266
Charles, chai latte up.

405
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,877
- Hey! Get off my computer!
- Keep your shirt on.

406
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,947
Come on.

407
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,548
If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

408
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,212
When it works,
you're going to kiss my ass.

409
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,381
How are we gonna know
which one's the bodyguard?

410
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,764
Have you ever done
this kind of thing before?

411
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,431
I worked for the hardest gangstas
in the world.

412
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,600
Kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.

413
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,175
Hell, I still work for Tupac,
even though he dead.

414
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,572
I am Israeli Military Secret Service
Antiterrorist Squad.

415
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,685
So when I kill this kid,
do you want me to do it quickly,

416
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,279
- or do you want him to suffer?
- Suffer.

417
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,454
If you hire Tiger's Protection Services,

418
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,427
not only do you get the Tiger,

419
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,556
but you get the protection
of his entire pride.

420
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,136
Do you like hip-hop?

421
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,864
What the hell you implying
I like hip-hop for?

422
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,634
'Cause I'm dressed this way?
I like country. You like country?

423
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,904
That's the kind of music I like. Alabama.
Gimme some of that.

424
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,174
Some Brooks and Dunn.
The Dixie Chicks, bitch.

425
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,415
Kids hiring a bodyguard
to take care of a bully?

426
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,044
Stupidest thing I ever heard.

427
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,647
Back in my day, if a kid was getting
beat up, it was called childhood.

428
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,852
Pick somebody, anybody.
I'll go beat their ass

429
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:01,023
right here, right now, and then you can
ask them for a goddamned reference.

430
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,362
How about you, lady?

431
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,665
I'll kick your ass right now!
Close. Closed.

432
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,969
- Yeah!
- This is very disturbing.

433
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,236
You want an ass kicking?

434
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,175
What do you do
when you're not body guarding?

435
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,516
I work at Raging Waters.

436
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,922
I sense great hesitation.
Wait one moment. Excuse me.

437
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,157
I'm going to borrow this.

438
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,490
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, God damn!

439
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,498
- $2,100 a week.
- $10,000 a week.

440
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,662
We're hoping you'd say, like,
around $100.

441
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,204
- Not interested.
- I hate kids like you.

442
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,903
I can't help you. No one can help you!

443
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,919
- Susan, your double espresso's up.
- I'm Susan.

444
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,464
I'm Drillbit Taylor.

445
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,347
U.S. Army Ranger, black ops operative,
decorated marksman,

446
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,384
- improvised weapons expert.
- Are you still in the military?

447
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,653
I was discharged.
Unauthorized heroism.

448
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,817
Yeah. They call it an army of one
in the ads, but they don't mean it.

449
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,056
Unless they mean the whole army
working together as one.

450
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,534
But they certainly don't want one man
out there kicking ass

451
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,765
like an army of one,
which is the way I took it.

452
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,868
As a bodyguard
I protected three Vice Presidents,

453
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,340
Bobby Brown, Sylvester Stallone...
Not as tough as he looks.

454
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,677
So what's the story?
Who do you guys need protection from?

455
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,084
It should be easy for you.
Just a high school bully.

456
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,987
Yeah. Run into a few of those in my life.

457
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,460
- What'd you do to provoke him?
- Well, he's fat, and he's a dork,

458
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,929
- and I'm awesome.
- Shut up, Wade.

459
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,160
By "awesome" do you mean
scared, skinny and lonely?

460
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:19,826
Yeah.

461
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,106
Yeah.

462
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:27,106
- So how do we know you're legit?
- Come here. Go on, come here.

463
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,907
I'm not gonna bite.

464
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,383
I want you to look at my eyes.

465
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,811
Take a good look.

466
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:41,190
Come here! What do you see?
You looking?

467
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,229
- What the hell have you seen?
- You want some?

468
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,459
These eyes have seen
unspeakable horror.

469
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,068
That's my evidence.

470
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:58,802
That's how you know if a guy's legit.
You need some evidence, too?

471
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,178
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.

472
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,840
I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark
near the Tannhauser Gate.

473
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,317
<i>Isn't that Blade Runner?</i>

474
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,647
Look closely 'cause it's all in there.

475
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,991
Boo!

476
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,689
So, how much do you charge?

477
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,499
$387 a week.

478
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,229
- One second.
- I say yes.

479
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,269
I'm not even sure if I'm available.

480
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,740
- He's good.
- No! No! He's weird.

481
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,437
You know, we might be able
to work up to that.

482
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,145
But right now, we've only got $83.

483
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,750
Okay, well, give me that now
and we'll figure out the rest later.

484
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,389
You know what this is?

485
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,759
It's a wing.

486
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,895
And you're under it.
All three of you, right there.

487
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,968
Okay, here's the mission plan.

488
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:02,267
Using my expertise at stealthy
and covert ops, I'll infiltrate the school

489
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,207
where I will watch over you
like the Lord almighty himself.

490
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,938
Careful.

491
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,211
Like the good Lord,
I'm gonna use some mysterious ways,

492
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,784
so you're not always gonna see me,
but I'll be there.

493
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,546
Especially when you don't see me.

494
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,553
But first, I'm gonna need some supplies.

495
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,316
- I want to go in and get...
- Like nunchucks?

496
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,391
Maybe.

497
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,358
But a lot of stuff, I'll just get from
just what's laying around the house.

498
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,450
You'd be surprised.

499
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,463
Anything can be turned into
a weapon of mayhem or destruction.

500
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,863
- Even a puppy?
- Especially a puppy.

501
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:34,302
Germans used them in World War I.
Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.

502
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,771
They'd attach dynamite to them.
Rommel did it. Jerry bastard.

503
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,110
- Now, listen. One thing that...
- This is my house.

504
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,812
Wow.

505
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:48,978
- We can go in. Nobody's home.
- Let's hit it. Deploy, soldiers.

506
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,955
- Soldiers? Cool. You hear that, T-Dog?
- Beeline, front door! Single file!

507
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,285
Officers first!

508
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,254
You, get me a bowl of cereal.
Go on. Scram.

509
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,474
- Okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here.
- What for?

510
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,272
You take that,
my mom'll rip my head off!

511
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,040
At ease, Casper!

512
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,013
Okay. Observe its momentary
reflective blinding capabilities.

513
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,610
Bang! You're defenseless.

514
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,053
Silver alloy,
one of the strongest ever constructed.

515
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,149
Probably stop an armor-piercing bullet
at point-blank range.

516
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,694
You don't really think
it could come to that.

517
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:32,922
You tell me.

518
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,663
Filkins is a whack job.
He almost ran over us with his car!

519
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:40,704
- He's a menace.
- Yeah, I was my dad's favorite, too.

520
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,932
He once cut a kid's arm off
with a samurai sword.

521
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,838
- Bladed weaponry?
- Yeah.

522
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,737
Okay. I'm not gonna take any chances.
You're now on orange alert.

523
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,643
Okay, now this will be good
for video surveillance.

524
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,449
This is good.

525
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,952
You take the guts out of this
and use it for wiretapping.

526
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,547
I think we can use this as a...
I don't know, as a timekeeping device.

527
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,489
I think I'll wear it on my wrist, possibly.

528
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,824
You think you might need this?

529
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,694
This piece of crap's not worth anything.

530
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,325
As a weapon. It's too obvious.

531
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,666
<i>Testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?</i>

532
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,365
<i>- Testing, one, two.
- Can you come back now?</i>

533
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,806
Guys, you got to go far back!
I can hear you!

534
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,606
<i>Testing, testing, one, two.
Can you hear me now?</i>

535
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,049
- They work pretty good.
- These are great.

536
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,138
- Yeah.
- These are invaluable.

537
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,479
- They get a little staticky, though...
- Yeah.

538
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,109
...I think, some places in the house.

539
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,448
Why you need all this stuff for?

540
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,283
I thought we were gonna give
Filkins a beat down.

541
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,482
I am gonna beat him down,

542
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,855
but sometimes
after that first beat down,

543
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,860
then they get a little, you know...
They want a little payback.

544
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,430
I'm home!
Who wants grilled-cheese sandwiches?

545
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,896
- Go! Go! Mom! Mom!
- Okay.

546
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,059
- Exit! Exit!
- Go, out the back, out the back, go.

547
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,692
Just 'cause you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

548
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:49,466
- Shut the door.
- Act natural. Hey, Mom.

549
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,041
- Hey, Barbara, how you doing?
- Hi, boys.

550
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,734
- Who's your new little friend? Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,471
- Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus.
- Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.

552
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,342
- He's not our friend.
- Yeah, he is.

553
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,505
He's like our hamster.

554
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,276
Smell like something?

555
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,817
- Ryan? You washing?
- Yeah. You?

556
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,088
It's a funny smell. It's all right.
Grilled-cheese sandwiches.

557
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,523
Hey, come on! Buzz us in!

558
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,722
You're gonna wanna see this!

559
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,990
Big money coming in!

560
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,532
This ain't a bunch of
aluminum cans here.

561
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,794
Where do you want it?
Priceless treasures.

562
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:19,233
Go set them down there.

563
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,897
So you don't think those kids
are gonna miss this stuff?

564
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,906
No. They got two of everything.

565
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,910
They got the iPod, the iPod Nano.
And I don't care if they do,

566
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,311
'cause after this little transaction,

567
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,817
well, the old Drillbit's taking his act
to the Great White North.

568
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,080
- What?
- Yeah, I'm going to Canada.

569
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,679
Well, that's stupid.
You're gonna cut out now?

570
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,988
- I'm going...
- These kids are a cash cow, Drillbit.

571
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,289
You need to hang in there.
You don't cut and run.

572
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,660
You got to get in there and milk this.

573
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,198
Okay, come on back.

574
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,994
All right, I'll tell you what.
I give you $125 for the whole lot.

575
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,094
What?

576
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,970
I just heard you say
you took it from some kids.

577
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,374
So? Don't get all righteous on me.

578
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,174
Half this store you guys got
from crackheads and thieves.

579
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,442
Hey. Who the hell
do you think you are, man?

580
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,177
Let me tell you something.
Those people are our customers!

581
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,480
We're not that harsh on them,
so you shouldn't be!

582
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,555
How would you like it
if we called you a crackhead?

583
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,987
You have called me one.

584
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,491
- Have we? Have we?
- I think I might have.

585
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,985
<i>- Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in.
- What is that?</i>

586
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,657
I'm sorry, hold it just a second.
D.B. one-four-niner-eight, come in.

587
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,358
<i>- Just take this.
- We just wanted you to know</i>

588
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,402
<i>that Emmit was holding out
on some bar mitzvah money.</i>

589
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,064
<i>Emmit, I don't care how many times you
get bar mitzvahed, you're not a man.</i>

590
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,231
<i>- I am a man.
- No, you're not.</i>

591
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,639
<i>- Drillbit! Milk it, milk it.
- So we'll have another 50 bucks for you</i>

592
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,871
<i>- on Monday.
- Grab the udder and milk it.</i>

593
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,345
Ten-four, good buddy.
I will see you tomorrow.

594
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:41,179
Commence radio silence in three, two.

595
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,915
Today's the official start
of our high school careers.

596
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,391
Last week's history.
Nothing good came out of last week.

597
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,827
- We became best friends.
- Nothing good came out of last week.

598
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,330
There's the sword. Man, we're so dead.

599
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,732
- Where's Drillbit, Wade?
- Hey. Calvary's here.

600
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,895
- Please, where have you been?
- Yes. What's up, man?

601
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,473
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

602
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,806
We got 40 bucks we promised,
plus we got an extra 17.

603
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:08,901
I sold my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

604
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,207
Okay, this is gonna be sweet.

605
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,177
I can't wait to watch
you kick Filkins' ass.

606
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,377
- Yeah. What, is he here?
- Yeah, over there on his car.

607
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,919
I want you to be
the last face he ever sees.

608
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,079
What are you gonna do?

609
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,713
- What am I gonna do?
- Come on.

610
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:20,813
I want you to gnaw on his skull.

611
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,392
- What's the plan?
- Shut up.

612
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:27,157
Guys, I'm gonna check this dude out.

613
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,400
Yes.

614
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,999
Excuse me.

615
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,432
Yeah.

616
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,381
Just got to kind of stand here
for a second.

617
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,347
All right. Hey, take it easy, man.

618
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,353
He's thin, but sinewy and muscular.

619
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,627
He's got a low center of gravity which
means he's fast like a jack rabbit.

620
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,759
He didn't take a shower today
or yesterday. He's got bad breath.

621
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,997
He's got a couple of cavities
which is not improving...

622
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,131
This is serious. I thought
you were gonna go kick his ass.

623
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,265
Yeah.

624
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,639
Look at Tommy Trigger Finger.
You want the blood and the guts.

625
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,177
Well, it doesn't work that way.

626
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,871
I can't just kick his ass.

627
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,917
Physically, I can,
but if you kick a bully's ass,

628
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,248
then maybe you guys live till lunchtime.

629
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,821
And then what?

630
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,722
"Teach those victims how to kick
the bully's ass and they live forever. "

631
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,259
Steven Seagal.

632
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,261
So you're gonna teach us
how to beat him up?

633
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,764
- Like train us?
- So we're gonna beat up Filkins?

634
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,768
What I'm about to show you are
top-secret black ops fighting moves.

635
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,772
And it's all about technique.

636
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,273
I don't care if you're talking about

637
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:49,438
karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis,

638
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,481
kung pao, Panda Express.

639
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,814
It's all about technique.
I want you to watch my technique.

640
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,815
It's pretty flawless.
Come on, Ryan, charge me.

641
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,720
I'm serious. Try to kill me.

642
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,589
Come on. You ready?
Go! Yeah. Come on.

643
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,389
I got you!

644
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,424
I got you! I got you!

645
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,333
Damn it!

646
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:18,033
Okay. Tripped right there.
That was the bear hug.

647
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,240
Okay. Wade. Come on!

648
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,579
Here you go! Watch the elbows!

649
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,171
Don't! Stop!

650
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,844
Okay. Last but not least. Charge me.

651
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,651
Everyone, up! Circle me!

652
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,091
Come on.
Let me see some fight from you.

653
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,928
Okay, you guys ready for the blizzard?

654
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,999
- Go get him, boys!
- Yeah. Go, get it, all three of you!

655
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,993
I call truce! Truce! Back up! Three's
too many. Three's too many. Stop.

656
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,974
Wow, one of you
really charley-horsed me.

657
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,602
Okay.
Now it isn't all oriental martial arts.

658
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,374
Sometimes you give
a little Mexican judo as in

659
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,073
"Ju don't know who
you're messing with, homes. "

660
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:03,085
<i>Come on, Ryan, one more. Last one!
Show me your mettle. Come on! Olé!</i>

661
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,022
Wow!

662
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,181
Ryan!

663
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,186
Man down!

664
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,029
Ryan!

665
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,398
Was that my fault?

666
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,599
Hey! Check this out.

667
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,104
Dude! You fell like 60 feet.

668
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,502
Jeez, that was crazy.

669
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,801
What is this?

670
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,310
This is a strategic outpost.

671
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,380
I got these posted all over the city.

672
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,812
Don't even look at it, okay?

673
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,850
Now let's get back up there
and get to work.

674
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,784
What's this for?
To wash your balls in the morning?

675
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,817
No. Look like a squeegee to you?

676
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,018
Or does it look like a weapon
with a straight edge

677
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,459
and a little mop to clean up the blood?

678
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,829
T- Dog, Emmit, this way.

679
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,628
- Where's Drillbit?
- I don't know.

680
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,794
- Wait up.
- Should be right up here.

681
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,072
Man down!

682
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,905
Take this.

683
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,380
- Take a swing at my head.
- Oh, no.

684
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,280
Wade, come on. Just hit me.

685
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,148
- But it'll hurt.
- Wade hit me.

686
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,016
- I'll do it.
- Shut up.

687
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:19,356
I feel no pain,
'cause I have a trained mind.

688
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,430
- Go!
- Come on.

689
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,931
- Let's beat it.
- Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

690
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,200
- Hey, Drillbit. We could make s'mores!
- No.

691
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,139
- How much does a Hug Me Bear cost?
- No.

692
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:35,234
- Where'd you get the kids, Drillbit?
- I won them in a poker game.

693
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,947
Order up!

694
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,573
- How's this part of the training?
- It's called bulking up.

695
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,278
- I'm already fat.
- Hey. You're not fat.

696
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,015
I don't want to hear you say you're fat.

697
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:49,616
Words like lard ass, fat pig, butterball,
landslide, mudslide.

698
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,491
I don't want to hear that.
What are you tipping the scales at?

699
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,063
180.

700
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,291
What?

701
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,293
Whenever you're ready, boys.

702
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,562
Okay, one of you guys
got to pick this up,

703
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,659
'cause I'm still on the clock.

704
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,974
Filkins. Filkins.

705
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,442
Avoidance technique!
Avoidance technique!

706
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,515
<i>Come out here, Capone!
You want to fight?</i>

707
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,243
<i>You want to fight,
you and me, right here?</i>

708
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,149
This is very important. See that?

709
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,948
<i>What's the matter? Afraid to
come out from behind your men?</i>

710
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,545
<i>- He has a holdback guy.
- Afraid to stand up for yourself?</i>

711
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,784
Now that allows people to think
that you want to fight

712
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,257
when really he doesn't want to fight.

713
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,192
<i>You got nothing in court.
You don't got the bookkeeper.</i>

714
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,763
When I'm here I'm your holdback guy.

715
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,798
So now you can act crazy.

716
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,661
No, hey, hey, calm down.

717
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,766
I'm gonna kill you!

718
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,398
Hey, stop! Stop!

719
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,874
Calm down.

720
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,103
- Hoo-rah.
- Hoo-rah.

721
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,078
Get under the wing.

722
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,643
Put all the bills facing
the same direction.

723
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,085
Yeah, don't worry about it, Don.

724
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,315
I thought these kids were loaded.

725
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,583
It's like all you read about are how
14-year-olds rule the marketplace,

726
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,025
and look at this.

727
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,530
Hardly got anything. You think this is
gonna get me to the Great White North?

728
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,793
Allow me to make a point real quick.

729
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,160
Hello, delicious.

730
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,636
Drillbit? Do you know
why we come here every day?

731
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,934
It's because these businessmen
can't eat all their food.

732
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,203
They have more than they need.

733
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,974
These kids are a lot like
these businessmen, okay?

734
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,209
They have way more than they need.

735
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,718
It's our job to go into their houses
and take all their excess.

736
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,948
I get a kick out of these kids.

737
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,420
I told you that little fat one
says some funny shit.

738
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,051
I like these kids, too, man.

739
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,222
I mean, from what I gather,
they're some pretty cool dudes.

740
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,925
But if you like them,
you should think about helping them.

741
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,093
- If you care about them.
- What do you mean?

742
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,534
Steal their TV.

743
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,934
Maybe they'll read a book.

744
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,602
Steal their iPod. Heck, I don't know.
Maybe they'll learn to play the piano.

745
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,669
They don't need all this crap.

746
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,407
You think Mozart had a Game Boy?

747
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,349
I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me.
I was outside playing, climbing trees.

748
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,253
Yeah, man, me, too.
I'm still outside hanging around in trees.

749
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,456
And the parents are never around.
There's no one there in the daytime.

750
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,825
One big hit. It's all we need.

751
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,738
Boobies.

752
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,246
Penis!

753
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:39,757
All right. Open your eyes, let your body
drift back into consciousness.

754
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:46,968
<i>Namaste. Thank you for your practice.
That concludes the meditation time.</i>

755
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,532
- Okay. How do you feel?
- I feel good.

756
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,302
- Doing all right?
- Yeah. I think my biceps are coming in.

757
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,637
Guns are coming in.

758
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,008
Now, listen.
We're about 10% done with the training.

759
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,102
- Next...
- 10%?

760
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,081
Are you high?
We can't sit in the woods anymore.

761
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,051
- We got to go back to school.
- Yeah, and I can't forge any more notes.

762
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,451
How many diseases can a kid have?

763
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,360
You guys think you're ready?

764
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,391
You know,
I am really scared to go back.

765
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:21,471
Look. If you're not ready to fight,
there is another alternative.

766
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,630
But I got to be honest with you,

767
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,073
only the strongest of warriors
can pull this one off.

768
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:32,082
It's so difficult that most men
tremble at its mere thought.

769
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,047
What is it?

770
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,118
What the hell is it?

771
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,417
Love him.

772
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,749
- What?
- Love him.

773
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,090
You know, I don't know
what's going through your head, Drillbit,

774
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,254
but I'm not gonna bang him.

775
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,259
When I'm talking about love,
I mean compassion.

776
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,494
- I'm not going to...
- Shut up. And understanding.

777
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,136
Find your commonality.

778
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,402
Let him know you're more alike
than different.

779
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,335
Maybe that'll put out his fuse.

780
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,441
And remember, guys,

781
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:07,415
just because you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

782
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:11,579
I'll be there like a silent,
deadly poltergeist.

783
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:12,656
- Thanks.
- Okay.

784
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,950
All right, see you later, Drillbit.

785
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,719
Remember, you're under my wing.

786
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,990
Oh, no.

787
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,396
There he is. Should we hide?

788
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,333
No. We've been running
and hiding all week.

789
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,531
This is what Drillbit's been
talking about, finding commonalities.

790
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,508
He's rapping. You love to rap!
You can do this!

791
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,766
No, I can't.

792
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,903
<i>Yes, you can. It's just like in 8 Mile.
He'll respect you.</i>

793
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,743
No, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!

794
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,317
- You're crazy! Don't do it.
- You can do it, Ryan.

795
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,113
- I believe in you.
- Don't.

796
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,355
All right. I can do it. I can do it.

797
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,254
- Whassup, whassup?
- Whassup?

798
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,259
I wanna rap with you.
Hey, flip the script, Ronnie.

799
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,595
Hit that beat.

800
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,268
- Yo, this cool, Fil?
- Sure, whatever.

801
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,970
<i>Yo, call me whatever you want</i>

802
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,599
<i>but you know I gets busy I'm so badass</i>

803
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,304
<i>I'm the king of Vice City
Like the Buddha, I'm Zen</i>

804
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,643
<i>Like Beckham, I bend, I tell suckers</i>

805
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,740
<i>"Say hello to my little friend"</i>

806
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,947
Snap! This guy!

807
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,686
<i>Hey, meatball, where's your spaghetti?
Your rapping's like a nightmare</i>

808
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,384
<i>But I don't see Freddy
You best</i>

809
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,224
<i>not even try to spit rhymes, dude
'Cause when you spit</i>

810
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,821
<i>all I ever see is chewed-up food</i>

811
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,925
Yeah, that's how we roll!
That's how we do!

812
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,024
Hold on!

813
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,433
<i>I know you didn't just go there</i>

814
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,563
<i>I got more skills than you
in my one and only nut hair</i>

815
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,171
Nice, man, nice.

816
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,438
<i>So you better step off
before you insult me and mine</i>

817
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,207
<i>'Cause if you decide to step on, see
I'm like a land mine</i>

818
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,611
Boom!

819
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,881
<i>Oh, my God, look
it's a punkass rapping</i>

820
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,489
<i>He say one more word
I'm gonna have to bitch-slap him</i>

821
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,252
<i>So surprised you're moving
ass is so damn fat</i>

822
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,625
<i>You're lucky I don't hit you
with my Wiffle, Wiffle Ball bat</i>

823
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,224
<i>Can't hurt my head with a bat
I'm the Incredible Hulk</i>

824
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,734
<i>I'm like Costco
I'm serving ass kickings in bulk</i>

825
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,499
<i>You don't like my words
Mister King of the School?</i>

826
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,769
<i>Well, guess what?
You can suck on my family's jewels</i>

827
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,241
<i>Bitch!</i>

828
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,079
That was awesome.

829
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,486
What have I just done?

830
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,148
Hey, that was amazing. I mean,

831
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,748
telling him to suck on
your two family jewels

832
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,555
was in questionable taste, but still...

833
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,960
I know, I got caught up
in the moment, okay?

834
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,157
Keep walking.
I don't want to get shot like Tupac.

835
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,201
You know, most of those people
were cheering for you.

836
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,329
Really? That could be good.
Maybe Drillbit was right.

837
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,104
Think you're so funny?

838
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,238
Good. 'Cause you're not gonna laugh
when you're dead.

839
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,579
You're gonna get it now,
worse than ever.

840
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:55,910
All of you.

841
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,245
Ryan, holdback technique.

842
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,984
You don't like the fact that
he's better than you, Filkins!

843
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,583
You better back the hell off before I...

844
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:13,596
- Thanks for holding him for me.
- Holy crap, you guys are retarded!

845
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,208
How did he do so much damage
with one punch?

846
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,539
It's like his fist is the size
of your whole face.

847
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,476
I guess it's true.

848
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,808
Rap really does promote violence.

849
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,383
Yeah, but the question is, where was
Drillbit when we needed him?

850
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,076
Maybe he got called to the black ops.

851
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,949
Wade, come on.
You really believe that garbage?

852
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,113
There's my little soldiers.

853
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,659
There are my pooper troopers.

854
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,696
Hey, sorry I missed that walkie-talkie
call. I had something come...

855
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,562
- What the hell happened to you?
- Filkins punched me.

856
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,666
- Filkins did that to you?
- Yeah.

857
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:49,932
Where were you?

858
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,235
- With one punch?
- Where were you?

859
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,340
- Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
- Stop.

860
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,675
- No, just let me get the blood off.
- No. Stop.

861
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,909
Man. Here, sit down for a second.

862
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,748
- Crap. It looks painful.
- Yeah, it is.

863
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:05,916
- Here, let me put a little pressure on it.
- No.

864
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,615
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

865
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,419
Ryan had a rap off with Filkins.

866
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,256
- You had a rap off?
- You said to find common ground.

867
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,525
He said he was like Costco,
serving up ass kickings in bulk.

868
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,725
That's what you said?
That's not common ground.

869
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,564
Even though it's funny.

870
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,865
That's not exactly what I meant
when I said common ground.

871
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,770
Why didn't you get punched?
Why'd he slug you?

872
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,866
'Cause of your brilliant
holdback technique.

873
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,741
The holdback technique?
You really tried that?

874
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,442
Yeah. Bottom line is
your advice backfired.

875
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,142
Now we're more screwed than ever.

876
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,413
All because you wanted to protect
the hobbit over here.

877
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,045
- Hey, let's just stop for a second.
- I am not a hobbit.

878
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,953
- You're a damn hobbit, okay?
- I am not!

879
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,687
Hold it! Hey.
Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.

880
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,286
Problem isn't the holdback technique,

881
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,525
although I don't think you guys
had it perfected enough to try.

882
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,226
The problem is Randy
starts rapping insults.

883
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,237
It's not Randy! Okay? It's Ryan!

884
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:59,673
And all this talk about you being there
when you're not there, it's bull! Okay?

885
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,042
I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!

886
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:06,343
Hey! Sit down here.
Sit down here for a second.

887
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:11,080
All of you, sit down. You take the bass
out of your voice when you talk to me.

888
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,723
Now, we just completed phase one.

889
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,486
See if this guy has any mettle.
And guess what we found out?

890
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:20,188
Filkins does have some mettle.
So now we move to phase two.

891
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:23,733
Know what phase two is?
Direct contact.

892
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,496
That's where I come in.
Because I will not let this happen again,

893
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,504
if I can help it.

894
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,301
So what's the plan?

895
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,875
- The plan?
- Yeah.

896
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,638
How early do you guys
have to get up for school?

897
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,738
- 7:00.
- 7:00.

898
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,253
Oh, God. Okay.
Tomorrow, we all go in together.

899
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,453
Hey, Wade, what's up?

900
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,031
Where'd you get the shiner?

901
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,261
Come in here, boy. Talk to me.

902
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,940
I was protecting this one kid
in my school

903
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,943
from a bunch of bullies
and one of them punched me.

904
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,173
What? Why would you protect
the kid from a bully?

905
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,316
So he doesn't get beat up.

906
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,279
Then you're interfering
with the natural order.

907
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,646
When I was a kid, I was kind of a bully.

908
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,920
But it's not a bad thing. There was
this kid. I don't know what it was.

909
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,986
Maybe it was his stupid face.
But he'd just really get under my skin.

910
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,067
So I pushed him around a little bit,
called him some hurtful names,

911
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,535
and I honestly think, if I met him today,
he'd thank me for it.

912
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,471
I prepared him for the harshness
of the real world.

913
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,039
Thanks, Jim.

914
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,408
I'm a resource, Wade.
You should use me more often.

915
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,816
Is it locked?

916
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,147
- You got lunch money?
- Yep.

917
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,581
- You got any tests today?
- See you and the questions.

918
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,419
Don't fresh-off to any of your teachers.

919
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,452
All right, come here,
give mommy a kiss.

920
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,792
Come on, punky-wunky. I love you.

921
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,192
- Okay.
- Be good.

922
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,103
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye. I love you, Mommy!

923
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,972
"I love you, Mommy. "

924
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:17,573
Black ops in the hizzouse.

925
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,081
This old soldier could use
a kissy from mommy.

926
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,844
Come on.
I'm going in to the school today.

927
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,011
Drillbit is going in. Very visible.
Let's do it.

928
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,248
- You can't go in there looking like that.
- Why?

929
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,256
You look like Crocodile Dundee
or something.

930
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,053
Screw you. What're you talking about?

931
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,491
I'm just saying we need to clean you up.

932
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,428
Wrong. This soldier doesn't clean up.
What you see is what you get.

933
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,328
Drillbit, you just don't look
like a teacher.

934
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,731
I mean, we need you to blend in.
The camouflage technique.

935
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:41,065
- In my house. Come on.
- Let's go.

936
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,764
"Camouflage technique"? I like that.

937
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:49,105
...if I remember how to do this.
It really is strong enough for a man.

938
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,118
Did your dad leave any socks behind?

939
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,562
How many tardies can you have
before they give you a detention?

940
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,734
Emmit, you're drying my eyeballs.

941
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:18,006
All right, here's our class schedules
and a detailed map of the school.

942
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,077
We have the first class together,
so just meet us by the Life Skills room

943
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,270
so you can walk us to our lockers.

944
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,142
Okay, now, remember,
I'm not just gonna walk in there

945
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,511
and start kicking ass, okay?
I got to protect you guys,

946
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,050
but I need to blend in and lay low.

947
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:33,612
I'm gonna be visible to you guys,
but invisible to everyone else.

948
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:45,200
That's a look that says,
"I have no idea what I'm doing here. "

949
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,531
All first-time subs have it.
Welcome to McKinley!

950
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,610
- Thanks. Was it that obvious?
- Well, yeah, a little bit.

951
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:57,872
Whoa!

952
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,617
Not you kids. Please, go to class.
Go, go, go. Get away from me.

953
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,285
You, second floor, teachers' lounge.

954
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,379
They'll give you your assignment
up there. It's right over there.

955
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,153
- I'm gonna head up there. Okay.
- Yep? You got it.

956
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,525
How're you doing?

957
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,805
Teachers' lounge. They're all the same.

958
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,042
Put your names on the food. Smart.

959
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,772
Sneaky.

960
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,944
<i>- See Grey's Anatomy last night?
- Yeah.</i>

961
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,716
- Hey, Lis.
- Hi.

962
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,688
Got half an orange with your name on it.

963
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,258
Oh, no, thanks.

964
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,369
- Can I help you?
- No. With what?

965
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,706
- Are you lost?
- No. Why?

966
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,775
- You look like a lost parent.
- No.

967
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,820
No. I'm a substitute.

968
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,988
- For what?
- For whatever needs substituting.

969
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,792
Yeah, they'll just plug me in.
I think I'm just gonna wait here until,

970
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,994
you know, if they need me in
French, then that's where I'll go.

971
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,799
- You know French?
- A little bit. Yeah.

972
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,569
Enough to get by,
or enough to teach these animals.

973
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,807
- What do you teach?
- English.

974
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,946
My native tongue.

975
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,278
I'm Lisa Zachey.

976
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,581
Now is that Miss or Missus Zachey?

977
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:55,063
<i>- Miss.
- Miss. It had to be. Enchanté.</i>

978
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,067
And who are you?

979
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,760
Drill... Dr. Illbit.

980
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,673
Oh.

981
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,001
- Yeah.
- A doctor.

982
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,805
Teacher. Teacher and a doctor.
Just want to help.

983
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,939
People don't care how I do it.
Just give me a chance to help.

984
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,084
- You want some hot coffee?
- Only in the worst way.

985
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,148
Who can give me
another name for gonorrhea?

986
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,560
That's a little hint.

987
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:31,066
That's right, the clap. Or the drip.

988
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,469
All right, Dane? Get the lights.

989
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,564
<i>In the male, the bacteria of gonorrhea
usually enters by way of the urethra.</i>

990
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:41,701
<i>From two to five days later,
the guy feels a painful burning,</i>

991
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,540
<i>particularly when he urinates...</i>

992
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,945
They make these things to scare us.
I'm not scared of this.

993
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,018
<i>...looks like this.</i>

994
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:53,586
- I really like your suit.
- Yeah. I really like your everything.

995
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,214
Now what do we do?

996
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,816
Not many teachers
can afford a suit like that.

997
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,861
- Yeah?
- If he wants to eat.

998
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,261
Well, I mainly eat out of a dumpster.

999
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,460
I should try that.
I need some new dresses.

1000
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:11,529
Don't. Or if you do, stay away from
the one at Ocean and Wilshire.

1001
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,407
That's mine. Seriously, stay out of it.

1002
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,715
- What are we doing? Let's go.
- I don't know.

1003
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,681
You're a bad boy.

1004
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,510
- Maybe I need a detention.
- You're funny.

1005
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,454
- I'm not joking.
- Me, either.

1006
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,598
Look, I want nothing more
than to spend the rest of the day

1007
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,966
sitting on this couch with you,

1008
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:44,768
but I got to get to class because
my students need me. Okay?

1009
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,639
No. You still have five minutes
before the next class.

1010
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:49,967
We do?

1011
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,278
And you seem like someone who could
accomplish a lot in five minutes.

1012
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,448
I hope so.

1013
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,647
Although five minutes
might be four too many.

1014
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,921
Let's go, let's go!

1015
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,622
We really like Life Skills.
Can we just stay in the room, maybe?

1016
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,892
Why don't you practice
some life skills out here in the hallway?

1017
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,591
It's just as important.

1018
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,524
Okay, where is he?

1019
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,469
This is bull. Maybe I should
just beat the crap out of you two.

1020
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,438
There's Brooke!

1021
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,947
Oh, no. There he is.

1022
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,848
I think I'd better get...

1023
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,446
When are you free? I want to see you.

1024
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,718
- I have sixth period free.
- Sixth period? Okay.

1025
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,487
I think I have that period free, also.

1026
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,426
Why don't we meet back here? Okay?

1027
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,020
- Okay.
- Meet me right here?

1028
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,622
I'll keep the couch warm.

1029
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,702
We better check the tags to make sure
this couch is flame retardant.

1030
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,100
- I will.
- You know?

1031
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,068
You know what I mean?
Flame retardant?

1032
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,731
- Yes.
- 'Cause you're hot.

1033
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,869
Where is Life Skills?

1034
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,578
Drillbit, come in, please!
Where are you?

1035
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,672
<i>Drillbit, come in!</i>

1036
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,310
I don't know!
I can't understand Emmit's map!

1037
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,881
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, Emmit. Come on.

1038
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,384
- Crap!
- I knew Drillbit was a fraud.

1039
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,587
- I told you!
- He's gonna be here!

1040
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:14,890
Life Skills!

1041
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,658
I need Life Skills!

1042
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,633
Out of my way!

1043
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,703
Open the door!

1044
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,177
How is that up to code?

1045
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,613
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

1046
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,315
Excuse me!
Mordor Castle coming through!

1047
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:53,326
This is real! This is not a drill.

1048
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,301
Everybody, clear the hall!

1049
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,169
That means you! Let's go!
Clear the hall!

1050
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,941
The freak actually came through, huh?

1051
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,441
Awesome!

1052
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,619
- Hoo-rah.
- Hoo-rah.

1053
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,157
All right.

1054
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,095
Mister Filkins!
Why don't you just come up

1055
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,969
to the front of the class and read from

1056
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,566
<i>The Collected Works
of the Romantic Poets?</i>

1057
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,781
"I like kissing this and that of you

1058
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:46,879
"I like slowly stroking the shocking fuzz"

1059
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,463
Hey, aren't you the guy that
kicked Filkins' butt freestyling?

1060
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,823
You better believe it.
They call me T-Dog.

1061
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,562
- Wow, that's cool.
- He is so cute!

1062
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:02,638
Wow.

1063
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,003
<i>Wade, this is Drillbit. Come in. Wade?</i>

1064
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,304
<i>- Yeah?
- Filkins is heading east down the stairs.</i>

1065
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,971
The first stairwell. He's coming
down now. Watch your ass.

1066
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,604
Read you. Copy. Roger.

1067
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,616
<i>F.Y. I., I just heard this pack of girls
yapping, and your girl, Brooke,</i>

1068
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,484
<i>just got cast in Romeo and Juliet.
You might want to check that out.</i>

1069
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,983
Madam, madam, your lady mother
is coming to your chamber!

1070
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,623
The day is broke, be wary, look about.

1071
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:34,200
Come on! You're dogging it!
Faster! Faster!

1072
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,105
Go! I want to see some more!

1073
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:41,571
Go! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! One more!

1074
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,576
And you guys!
I don't want you just watching!

1075
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,240
Do some bass fishing! Then reel it in!

1076
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,407
Come on!

1077
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,042
Let's go, keep going!
Work some thumbs!

1078
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,814
For texting!

1079
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:54,784
Look out, huh?

1080
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:59,060
- How was school, Professor?
- It is great.

1081
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,430
And as long as you got a coffee cup
in your hand, nobody says anything.

1082
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,932
I was thinking
about writing a paper on...

1083
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,527
- Hey!
- What the...

1084
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:10,663
Coffee cup.

1085
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,503
Now, Castro,
he knew that he was not gonna get

1086
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,407
any action with Marilyn Monroe.

1087
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,911
And that is why John F. Kennedy
was shot.

1088
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:25,617
- Don!
- Hello, fellow teacher.

1089
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,554
Come on, guys, hit the showers!

1090
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:39,124
Look, my rope's too short.
I can't get down.

1091
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,204
Where you going? Get back here!

1092
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,507
- Yo, hold on!
- What is this?

1093
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,838
Ronnie, let yourself down.

1094
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:03,923
<i>Happy birthday, Dr. Illbit</i>

1095
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:09,124
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1096
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:01,749
Hey, T-Dog. You've got to admit
hiring Drillbit was a good idea.

1097
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,546
- Okay, you're right.
- See?

1098
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,087
The freak's actually worth all the money
we're spending on him, I guess.

1099
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,680
Good morning.

1100
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,516
- Great coffee this morning, Dr. Illbit.
- Enjoy it.

1101
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,428
- You know, I really like it here.
- You're doing a great job, Drillbit.

1102
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,657
I know I am.

1103
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,730
Come here, come here, come here.

1104
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,361
Okay, quick. Pop quiz. You like a girl.

1105
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,132
You're completely shocked
that she likes you.

1106
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,265
<i>Things are already just crazy hot,
just loco.</i>

1107
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,400
But now you'd like to ask her out.

1108
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,674
And you're not sure if
she's just in it for the sex.

1109
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,942
And you haven't been
on a date in forever.

1110
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,574
And you're a little bit afraid,

1111
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,482
and you don't know
what the hell you're doing, anyway.

1112
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,111
Well, I can't really relate to that,

1113
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,747
but what I would do is just
join every club she's in

1114
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,418
and eventually work up
the nerve to talk to her.

1115
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,995
- And how's that working for you?
- Not at all.

1116
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,564
Okay, look. One should do the opposite.

1117
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,292
- Yeah, probably.
- Okay.

1118
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:55,670
Congratulations, you just passed.
Hey, scram. Scram. Crotch blocker.

1119
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

1120
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,634
- Look, you look pretty.
- Thank you.

1121
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,739
You know,
I haven't been on a lot of dates,

1122
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,543
and I really don't know the way
this is supposed to work,

1123
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,140
because we kind of skipped that part.

1124
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:13,621
But would you ever want to get together
after school and maybe hang out?

1125
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,655
I'm sorry.

1126
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:21,621
Rule 35A in the teacher's manual states
that you cannot date other teachers.

1127
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:27,062
Oh, really. Yeah.
Probably a good policy.

1128
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,528
Yeah.

1129
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,432
So it's a good thing you're a doctor.

1130
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,634
So, yes.

1131
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,712
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

1132
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:44,947
The Battle of Sekigahara

1133
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:49,881
when Kanetsugu mocked
Tokunaga's abuses,

1134
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:53,590
which only infuriated Tokunaga

1135
01:03:54,363 --> 01:04:00,962
who then summoned Toyotomi
and united Japan.

1136
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,938
And kept the local feudal lords
from warring.

1137
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,873
Hey. What are you doing in this club?

1138
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,409
I'm Asian.

1139
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,001
He died. Then...

1140
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,512
- No, you aren't.
- Yeah. A little bit.

1141
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,149
Really?

1142
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,911
- You don't even look a little Asian.
- Yeah, I know.

1143
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,756
The West attacked first.

1144
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:26,153
So how come I see you in, like,
so many activities I'm in?

1145
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:31,196
Just... I joined some of the clubs
you were in because

1146
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,200
I wanted to have a chance to talk to you.

1147
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:38,604
Wakisaka, 990 men.
Ankokuji, 1,800 men.

1148
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,109
So you're not Asian.

1149
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,178
No.

1150
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,681
Well, maybe somewhere way back.

1151
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:52,785
Chosokabe, 6,600 men.
This is exciting, don't you think?

1152
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,287
All these men.

1153
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,391
Well, you can't quit now.

1154
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,551
I'm gonna make you come
to all our meetings.

1155
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,754
Membership is way down this year.

1156
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,558
Okay. I can do that.

1157
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:07,660
- Is everything okay at school?
- Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm busy.

1158
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,831
Honey, I know there's a lot of pressure
on kids once they get to high school.

1159
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,568
And there are kids who are gonna
want to be your friend,

1160
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,270
but they'll also want you
to take their drugs.

1161
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,413
I just noticed that you seem
to be out of money a lot lately,

1162
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,847
and I want to make sure
you're not spending your money on that.

1163
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,579
No! I'm not doing drugs, Mom.
I promise.

1164
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,882
Coach says drugs are for losers.

1165
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,119
You sure you're not high?

1166
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,927
No!

1167
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,825
Well, I notice you're really going
at your food.

1168
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,195
- Got the munchies?
- Anyways, we just worry about you.

1169
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,792
I understand that.

1170
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:42,359
Also, I'm missing a silver platter
that was in the living room.

1171
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,336
- Have you seen it?
- I'm taking Home Ec.

1172
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,635
We needed serving trays
for appetizers. Sorry.

1173
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,369
Yeah, well, come to think of it,
I'm missing a watch.

1174
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,308
You didn't take that to Home Ec, too,
did you?

1175
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,472
Oh, yeah.
We're making watch cupcakes, Jim.

1176
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,276
Watch it, wise guy.

1177
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,412
Hey.

1178
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,661
Careful, Wade. You don't sneak up
on somebody like that.

1179
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:06,989
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1180
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:08,996
But I could have jumped up
and killed you in two moves,

1181
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,760
and then, I don't know, I'd feel guilty.

1182
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:14,495
- I talked to Brooke.
- Really? Have a seat.

1183
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,628
- I think she might like me.
- Yeah?

1184
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,570
Yeah. At least a little bit.

1185
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,608
That's all you need.
Get your foot in the door.

1186
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,178
I don't think I would have had
the confidence to have tried without you.

1187
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,610
- I mean...
- Come on.

1188
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,944
It's been great having someone
around who, like, likes me

1189
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,176
and isn't making fun of me
or telling me to join the football team

1190
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,752
like my stepdad.

1191
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,879
Just do your best. Be all you can be.
What's the Army always say?

1192
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,617
"Have it your way. "

1193
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,591
I think that's Burger King.

1194
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,728
Where do you think they got it from?

1195
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,360
Plus, what you did.
The whole black ops bodyguard thing.

1196
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,469
Well, yeah.

1197
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,803
Yeah. I actually wanted to be a doctor.

1198
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,570
Yeah.

1199
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,683
But my old man was an Army colonel,
wouldn't pay for me to go to college.

1200
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:08,715
Yeah. He always said, "Drillbit, you're
not the doctor type. You're stupid. "

1201
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,791
I guess he thought that
because I didn't get good grades

1202
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,863
or like to go to school.

1203
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:21,265
I don't know. Maybe he was right.

1204
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,338
So you became an army of one.

1205
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,063
An army of one.

1206
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,601
Here.

1207
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,308
We made this for you.

1208
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,779
An army of four.

1209
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,486
I don't know if you understand,

1210
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:42,683
but before we met you, we thought
our lives were gonna suck forever.

1211
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,282
At least I did.

1212
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:51,561
Well, you're right. I don't understand
because of how hardened I am.

1213
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,863
Tough thing about what I do
is I can't let my guard down.

1214
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,173
Well, for what it's worth,

1215
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:03,803
I hope after all this is done,
you'll still be my friend.

1216
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:04,913
Bye.

1217
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,816
This is so beautiful.

1218
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,086
I love coming out here.

1219
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:22,688
Actually, I used to live in a small place
near here until it got re-zoned.

1220
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,523
Yeah.

1221
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,726
- That's a shame.
- Nah. Probably just as well.

1222
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,565
Hey, stranger.

1223
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,097
Can you spare some change, stranger?

1224
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,773
Here you go.

1225
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:37,137
- Sucker.
- Yeah.

1226
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,846
Got some money for some food? Hi.

1227
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,048
No time to be cheap.

1228
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,856
- Wow.
- Good evening, sir. Can I get a dollar?

1229
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,592
- Cool. Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

1230
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,720
Hey, can I get another dollar?

1231
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,561
You look familiar.

1232
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,101
You know that you're a better person
than me,

1233
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:08,643
because, I hate to say it,
but I just get irritated.

1234
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:12,475
They irritate the shit out of me.
I felt like...

1235
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:16,711
But then you have to think,
they work for the grace of God, so...

1236
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,084
- That's cute.
- Hey, you want to see something cool?

1237
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,486
Come here.

1238
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,484
- There.
- Thank you.

1239
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,261
So what else do you have in here?

1240
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,655
- Two-buck Chuck.
- You know that wine?

1241
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,495
I love this wine.

1242
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,365
- That's all a teacher can afford.
- Tell me about it.

1243
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:36,933
Get this.

1244
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,071
And here I was all worried that
you were gonna take me

1245
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,667
to some hip dance club or something.

1246
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,079
That's definitely not me.

1247
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,446
But, no, I'm actually more of

1248
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,179
a kind of simple,
just down to earth outdoorsman.

1249
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,785
I like that you don't try too hard.

1250
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:57,914
The truth is,
this is me trying really, really hard.

1251
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,825
That's cute.

1252
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,392
Look, I want to talk to you. I mean...

1253
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,032
There's some things
I want you to know about me.

1254
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,838
I want us to look each other in the eye,
and I want us to get it out on the table,

1255
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,039
and we just, you know,
we listen, and there's no judgment.

1256
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:24,518
God. You're just so great. You're really
just like the perfect guy for me.

1257
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,319
- Really?
- I'm serious.

1258
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:31,757
You're just beautiful,
and you're nice to me, and it's so great.

1259
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:36,421
'Cause I'm really just always attracted
to just such dirtbag guys.

1260
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:37,623
They're out there.

1261
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:41,362
I'm a real loser magnet.
It's, like, on some unconscious level,

1262
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:46,601
I just need to be with a guy who has
absolutely nothing going for him.

1263
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:50,668
You know, just some loser,
some bum lying pig.

1264
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,110
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- You know, just...

1265
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,203
Stop it.

1266
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:57,217
I get it. You made some bad choices,
and who hasn't?

1267
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,285
It's just you were starting
to rant a little bit.

1268
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,913
It's just I'm happy to be
with somebody...

1269
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:02,991
I know.

1270
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,925
You're with a doctor now.

1271
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,130
Yeah. Thank God.

1272
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,594
Let's just kiss.

1273
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,873
Did you do that?

1274
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,944
Kid just jumped out of the bushes
and started jamming. That's weird.

1275
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,781
I got nothing to do with it.

1276
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,805
- That naked guy's my teacher!
- What?

1277
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,474
- Yeah!
- He ain't your teacher!

1278
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:05,815
Every day he's at the off-ramp.
I give him some change.

1279
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,752
What do you mean? Like a bum?

1280
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:11,553
What are you talking about?
He's not a bum! Less fortunate!

1281
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,686
Yeah, or get out of the way.

1282
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:15,957
How're you doing?

1283
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,692
- Hey, how's it going, Drillbit?
- Hey, Drillbit.

1284
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,461
So, listen,
you know the thing we talked about?

1285
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:20,728
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1286
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,063
- Plan's off.
- What?

1287
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,935
- Drillbit! Drillbit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1288
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:26,502
What do you mean the plan's off?

1289
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:29,338
It's not off. I just mean let's...
Let's postpone it.

1290
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,037
'Cause I don't think we need
to get their belongings now.

1291
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,171
These kids,
they kind of look at me like I'm a hero,

1292
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,840
and, I don't know,
let's run with that for a little bit.

1293
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,144
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1294
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,445
You're really getting into this whole
teacher thing here, huh?

1295
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,385
With the sweaters and the loafers.

1296
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,356
- They're wingtips.
- You look like you teach Fagonometry.

1297
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,518
What the hell is this? Who are you?

1298
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:49,393
I got an old saying for you, Drillbit,
"You can't polish a turd. "

1299
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,659
Hey, Don, first of all,
that's not an old saying.

1300
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:52,825
You stole that from me.

1301
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,403
I say it all the time.
Secondly, I'm insulted.

1302
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:58,064
Well, you should be. Drillbit, I know you.

1303
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,570
And the real you
would do this deal, man.

1304
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:04,407
There's a lot of heads that want to feed
off of this, man. Don't let us down.

1305
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,003
No! No, that's just it.

1306
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,140
For the first time,
I'm not letting everybody down.

1307
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,878
- And now you're not making any sense!
- Yeah.

1308
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:15,082
That guy's a fraud!
He's a bum in a Mister Rogers sweater!

1309
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,025
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Okay, check it out, check it out.

1310
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,222
I just saw the new substitute...

1311
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,299
Delta-four-niner,
this is Yu-Gi-Oh-seven.

1312
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,095
On the highway to the danger zone.

1313
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,862
<i>Repeat, on the highway, over.</i>

1314
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,835
Oh, shitballs!

1315
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,133
Yu-Gi-Oh-four-seven,
you are not clear to cross.

1316
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,334
Repeat, you got a bogie northbound.

1317
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,842
- Oh, crap.
- Guys, hold your position.

1318
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:36,967
I'm en route.

1319
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,740
Guys, hold your position!

1320
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,210
Come here, you little rat turds!

1321
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,875
No! Come on!

1322
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,351
Yo, so what'd you do, huh?

1323
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,786
What, did you give the substitute
teacher some spare change

1324
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,881
- so he'd give us a hard time?
- Get them!

1325
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,254
Mister Filkins?

1326
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,952
Excuse me. I need you to get to class.

1327
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,359
And you three,
I want you out of here, too!

1328
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,795
- Go on!
- Hey.

1329
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,900
Get out of my face, you bum!

1330
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,663
Maybe I will
if you stop hassling these kids.

1331
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,169
But until you're ready to do that,

1332
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,502
I'm gonna give you
some detentions to think about it.

1333
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,700
Please, just don't,
don't give me detention.

1334
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,677
Yeah. That's my power,
and I will exercise it.

1335
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,940
And then what? Huh? You gonna make
us shower on the beach

1336
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,515
with you and the rest of the bums?

1337
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,811
- Yeah, we're on to you, buddy.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1338
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:20,753
What a freak. You got some
weird little fantasies there, kid.

1339
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,620
Okay, here's the deal.
Let me make it real simple.

1340
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,590
I'm a faculty...

1341
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,525
Punk-ass!

1342
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,957
- He got me right in the ear!
- Run! Run!

1343
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,729
- Yeah! Run! Save yourself!
- Run!

1344
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,837
Medic!

1345
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,395
Medic!

1346
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:40,742
I got hit right in the nose!

1347
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,935
Followed up by a shot to the ear!

1348
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:46,145
Oh, man. Okay.

1349
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,149
Oh, that doesn't work at all.

1350
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,490
- This whole time he's a bum!
- Hey! Hey, you guys, hold it! Wait up!

1351
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,458
- Guys, let me explain!
- Explain what, huh?

1352
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,756
Filkins is just gonna come after us
harder than ever!

1353
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:02,922
What was that about showering
on the beach?

1354
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:03,998
You guys, hold it.

1355
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,157
Why would you shower on the beach?

1356
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,256
Why don't we all just shower
on the beach?

1357
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:07,460
It's part of my morning fitness regimen!

1358
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,594
I jog on the beach five miles,
then I swim ten miles.

1359
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:11,969
That's what I do to stay in shape.
Then I shower.

1360
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,735
So, why didn't you defend yourself?

1361
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,276
'Cause I got sucker punched!
Look at this!

1362
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,613
Then I got hit in the ear,

1363
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:23,048
which you probably can't even see,
'cause it's so deep in the ear canal.

1364
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,118
I didn't really get hurt,

1365
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:27,279
but I just kind of went down
to give you guys a chance to get away.

1366
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:28,913
We paid you to beat him up!

1367
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,152
How am I gonna beat him up
with all these kids around?

1368
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:35,230
Okay, then the principal comes
and maybe some cops.

1369
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,389
They'll find out I'm not a real teacher.

1370
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,933
What good am I
if I'm sitting there in jail?

1371
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,799
Look, I took a bullet for you guys today.

1372
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,666
You guys got off scot-free!

1373
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,502
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

1374
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:48,337
- Did you get hurt?
- No.

1375
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,608
I'm like one of those guys
jumping in front of the President.

1376
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,477
And, look, I'm not expecting a thank you.
That's my job.

1377
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,244
But maybe give me a bonus
or something.

1378
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:59,320
Sly used to throw in a car
every now and then.

1379
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,889
I'm so sorry, Drillbit.

1380
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,353
What am I gonna do with you guys?

1381
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,495
You want some cereal?

1382
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:15,195
- You got any Cap'n Crunch?
- Yeah.

1383
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,494
Let's go.

1384
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:21,632
- Drillbit!
- What are you doing?

1385
01:16:21,742 --> 01:16:23,175
- What the hell?
- No, don't, stop. Come on.

1386
01:16:23,277 --> 01:16:24,767
- Put that stuff down!
- Hey, no way, man!

1387
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:26,368
- Drillbit, why you yelling?
- Drillbit, back off, man!

1388
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,914
- You know these guys?
- No, I don't know these people!

1389
01:16:29,016 --> 01:16:30,176
We're almost done here, all right?

1390
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:32,479
- I am freaking out!
- My parents are gonna kill me!

1391
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:33,985
- What the hell's going on?
- Everything's fine!

1392
01:16:34,088 --> 01:16:35,316
- Screw this, man! I'm out of here!
- Wait a second!

1393
01:16:35,422 --> 01:16:36,514
- Why are you all yelling?
- Don?

1394
01:16:36,624 --> 01:16:38,854
- Not like this! What are you doing?
- Take it easy!

1395
01:16:38,959 --> 01:16:41,052
- Just take it easy, man.
- This isn't the plan.

1396
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:43,186
- Relax.
- All the shit's gone in your house.

1397
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:44,559
You came to me as a man,
I came to you as a man.

1398
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:46,155
All the shit is gone in my house!

1399
01:16:46,266 --> 01:16:47,699
- Are you...
- Don't you touch me!

1400
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,860
Don't make me Billy Jack your ass.

1401
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,897
Watch out!

1402
01:17:03,517 --> 01:17:05,678
That's how you Billy Jack
somebody's ass.

1403
01:17:05,786 --> 01:17:06,912
Come on, Bernie, let's go!

1404
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:08,852
Let's go!
Go on, get out of the way, man!

1405
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:10,548
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1406
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:12,956
You'd better run! I saw your faces!

1407
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,426
I got a photogenic memory!

1408
01:17:15,596 --> 01:17:17,826
Get out of my house, you asshole!

1409
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:20,627
What? There's another one?
I'll kill the asshole!

1410
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:23,794
No! You, asshole! Get out of my house,
now! Look at what you've done!

1411
01:17:23,904 --> 01:17:25,633
I didn't do anything!

1412
01:17:25,806 --> 01:17:27,774
I'm trying to help you guys! Look at me!

1413
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,706
Wade, I think one of them peed
in your kitchen.

1414
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,903
- Great!
- Should I call the police?

1415
01:17:32,046 --> 01:17:34,139
No, don't call the police! Just stop.

1416
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:36,113
Drillbit, just tell us the truth.

1417
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:39,549
You can't handle the truth! I can't...
What do you want to hear?

1418
01:17:39,653 --> 01:17:41,621
That I was raised in an orphanage?

1419
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:44,520
That I... That no one wanted me?
You don't want to hear that!

1420
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,593
'Cause that's a lie, too!

1421
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:52,363
Fine. Maybe I wasn't completely straight
with you guys about who I am.

1422
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:54,457
So you lied about being in the military?

1423
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:58,004
No! That's true. I was trained
by the United States Army.

1424
01:17:58,105 --> 01:18:00,972
Then why could a teenager beat you up
with so little effort?

1425
01:18:01,075 --> 01:18:04,602
Because I don't like violence.
I wasn't cut out to be a soldier.

1426
01:18:04,912 --> 01:18:07,380
- Boo-hoo.
- I like the parts with the repelling

1427
01:18:07,481 --> 01:18:10,917
and the crawling through the mud
and the swinging on the monkey bars

1428
01:18:11,018 --> 01:18:14,613
and the helping the wounded,
but I don't like confrontation.

1429
01:18:14,722 --> 01:18:18,249
Even this, with you three ganging up
on me, is not... I don't...

1430
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:20,919
- It's really... I'm sorry.
- Shit!

1431
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:24,631
You were in the military, huh?
Tell me where you served.

1432
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:28,996
My company was in the Middle East,
and I was there for like half a day.

1433
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:33,836
I saw some camels and heard some,

1434
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:37,342
I think, were some explosions,
I don't know.

1435
01:18:37,845 --> 01:18:41,941
And it was...
It was so hot over there. It was...

1436
01:18:42,816 --> 01:18:46,149
I just climbed in the wheel well of a
cargo plane, and I flew back to the U.S.

1437
01:18:46,253 --> 01:18:48,653
I went AWOL. It was...

1438
01:18:48,756 --> 01:18:50,849
Is your name even Drillbit?

1439
01:18:51,191 --> 01:18:52,351
Is my...

1440
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:55,486
What? How can you ask me that?

1441
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:56,922
Is it?

1442
01:18:58,098 --> 01:19:02,194
No, it's... It's Alamo Taylor.

1443
01:19:05,806 --> 01:19:07,671
No. That's a lie, too.

1444
01:19:08,942 --> 01:19:12,207
There I go, trying to impress
a bunch of kids again.

1445
01:19:13,914 --> 01:19:15,905
When are you gonna grow up?

1446
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:18,348
My real name is Bob Taylor.

1447
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:20,912
Not Robert, just Bob.

1448
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:25,350
There, you satisfied?
And I didn't kill anyone with a drill bit.

1449
01:19:25,459 --> 01:19:27,222
Although when I was in high school,

1450
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:29,818
I did puncture my pinky with a drill bit.

1451
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:33,066
And everyone started calling me Drillbit,
making fun of me.

1452
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,998
- Okay? And you can see the scar...
- No, get away.

1453
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:36,763
...if you look closely right there.
Can you see?

1454
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:40,601
Look, Ryan, look, you can see it.
It's real. Look.

1455
01:19:40,707 --> 01:19:41,799
Can you see it in the light?

1456
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:46,710
So you were just using us to take
our money and everything in my house?

1457
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:56,687
That's kind of an oversimplification.

1458
01:19:58,258 --> 01:20:00,123
I thought you cared about us.

1459
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:03,093
I do. I just...

1460
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:06,594
I thought you were my friend.

1461
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:10,531
Get out, Drillbit,
and don't ever come back.

1462
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:17,271
Leave!

1463
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:20,676
I'm sorry.

1464
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:29,889
Hello?

1465
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,218
<i>Hey. Yeah, look, I know...</i>

1466
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:33,020
<i>I'm sorry, I know
I was supposed to meet you,</i>

1467
01:20:33,126 --> 01:20:35,822
<i>but I'm just having a real terrible day.</i>

1468
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:37,430
Where are you?

1469
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:42,001
Remember you said you had
that real self-destructive pattern

1470
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:47,130
of always going out with guys
that were just real losers, just dirtbags?

1471
01:20:47,241 --> 01:20:49,209
<i>Total zeros.</i>

1472
01:20:49,309 --> 01:20:51,038
- Yes.
- Well.

1473
01:20:51,144 --> 01:20:53,806
You might not be
out of the woods yet with that.

1474
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:59,213
No, you said you were a doctor.
You're a doctor. You're not a doctor?

1475
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:00,786
No, I'm not a doctor.

1476
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:04,415
I'm a homeless U.S. Army deserter.
I was...

1477
01:21:04,524 --> 01:21:07,516
I'm not a teacher, but I'm at the school.
I'm trying to protect these kids.

1478
01:21:07,628 --> 01:21:10,392
What? What did you say
about homeless?

1479
01:21:11,265 --> 01:21:15,531
Like, metaphorically speaking
or in a box?

1480
01:21:18,705 --> 01:21:20,798
You got to let it out.

1481
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:25,100
You got to just let it out. Just...

1482
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:32,082
That's not it.

1483
01:21:32,252 --> 01:21:35,915
<i>Drillbit? I mean, Bob. It's us, the guys.</i>

1484
01:21:36,523 --> 01:21:39,583
<i>- Pick up, Bob.
- Yeah, pick up, Drillbit.</i>

1485
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,449
Boys?

1486
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:44,029
<i>We just called to say
we're calling the cops on you,</i>

1487
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:47,862
<i>and we hope you spend the rest
of your pathetic life in prison!</i>

1488
01:21:47,968 --> 01:21:51,665
<i>Now I see why people call you Drillbit.
Because you screw people!</i>

1489
01:21:51,805 --> 01:21:54,672
<i>You're a jackass and a dirtbag.</i>

1490
01:21:55,142 --> 01:21:57,372
<i>And I want my bar mitzvah money back.</i>

1491
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:00,742
<i>Oh, yeah,
and I'd like my walkie-talkie back. Over.</i>

1492
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:09,249
I tell you what,
I'll give you 1,500 for everything.

1493
01:22:09,356 --> 01:22:10,653
1,500? Come on, man.

1494
01:22:10,757 --> 01:22:12,816
This stuff holds
a lot of sentimental value.

1495
01:22:12,926 --> 01:22:15,554
- To who?
- To the people I stole it from.

1496
01:22:15,662 --> 01:22:17,027
I don't care about them. 1,500.

1497
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:19,598
All right. Deal. What do I do?
Just back this thing up?

1498
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,827
- Yeah, back it right up.
- All right.

1499
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,737
How're you doing, Don?

1500
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:33,470
You got a real stupid laugh,
you know that, Don?

1501
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:36,579
How about you go ahead
and hop on out of that van here,

1502
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:38,412
so I can kick your ass again?

1503
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:41,248
Sorry, but this haul's getting
returned to sender.

1504
01:22:41,355 --> 01:22:42,947
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it is, Don.

1505
01:22:43,056 --> 01:22:44,387
And I'll tell you another thing
that's gonna happen.

1506
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:46,152
This left foot is gonna go
on the right side

1507
01:22:46,259 --> 01:22:47,658
- of your face!
- Oh, give me a break, Drillbit.

1508
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:51,424
I know you and the Drillbit I know
isn't capable of really doing it!

1509
01:22:55,802 --> 01:22:56,769
Hoo-rah!

1510
01:22:58,271 --> 01:23:01,263
I'm giving you one more chance
to save this friendship!

1511
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:07,305
Damn it! You ready for this, Don?

1512
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:11,412
- No!
- Yeah!

1513
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:19,190
Polish that turd, Don!

1514
01:23:22,896 --> 01:23:24,454
I'm dead.

1515
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:26,589
- You're dead.
- I'm sad.

1516
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,065
Wade, what's wrong?
Is everything okay?

1517
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:34,436
Yeah, but you're not gonna
wanna go home.

1518
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:38,136
- Oh, no, no, no. The cable go out?
- If it is, you're dead.

1519
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:40,446
Of course it was your fault!

1520
01:23:40,547 --> 01:23:42,071
You were home!
You should have stopped them!

1521
01:23:42,182 --> 01:23:44,946
Bear with me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1522
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:46,246
Oh, God.

1523
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:48,644
Please don't scream.

1524
01:23:50,424 --> 01:23:51,891
What the hell?
I thought we were robbed!

1525
01:23:51,992 --> 01:23:53,289
We were!

1526
01:23:53,393 --> 01:23:55,953
We didn't get robbed!
We got rearranged!

1527
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,555
You and your weirdo friends
have a marijuana party?

1528
01:23:58,665 --> 01:24:00,155
- No!
- Oh, honey.

1529
01:24:00,267 --> 01:24:02,633
- Punish him, Dad.
- Yeah, don't let him get away with this.

1530
01:24:02,736 --> 01:24:05,534
- Are you smoking pot?
- No. I'm really confused.

1531
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:08,335
No, no, Wade.
Drillbit must have done it.

1532
01:24:08,942 --> 01:24:10,204
Who's Drillbit?

1533
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:12,507
You tell me what's going on now, Wade.

1534
01:24:13,013 --> 01:24:15,345
I just... I think it's weird, you know,

1535
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:19,112
that this is what I get for trying to make
them feel like a part of the group.

1536
01:24:19,219 --> 01:24:23,918
I mean, I saw it like a school tradition.
It's hazing, yeah, but

1537
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:26,117
just to, you know, make them
feel like they belonged.

1538
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:29,957
Sort of like a fun initiation.

1539
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:32,088
I mean, didn't you all have that
when you were kids?

1540
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:36,260
Yeah. I remember my first few days.
Got tied to the flagpole,

1541
01:24:36,369 --> 01:24:39,099
egged a few times.
At the end of it, it's all laughs.

1542
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:41,766
Yeah, Wade, boys, you really
shouldn't have panicked like that.

1543
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:43,433
Yeah, this boy's not dangerous,

1544
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:46,205
not compared to a dirty,
homeless ex-soldier.

1545
01:24:46,313 --> 01:24:49,840
The more I think about it,
that guy, he could've really hurt me.

1546
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:54,182
All right. I'm... I'm sorry, but your boys
brought a fugitive onto school property

1547
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:56,346
threatening the safety of my students.

1548
01:24:56,456 --> 01:24:58,617
Now, I don't... I don't wanna point
any fingers here,

1549
01:24:58,725 --> 01:25:01,421
but I think we all know who's to blame.

1550
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:04,695
You put my life in danger, guys.

1551
01:25:05,132 --> 01:25:08,260
It's worse than any hazing
that anybody could do.

1552
01:25:08,368 --> 01:25:10,233
I'm just lucky I was able
to defend myself.

1553
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:11,804
Who knows what might have happened?

1554
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:14,669
This guy's a veteran!
How many people might he have killed?

1555
01:25:14,774 --> 01:25:16,605
<i>Did anybody see "To Catch a Predator"
on Dateline?</i>

1556
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,302
- I watched that!
- I saw that, yeah.

1557
01:25:18,411 --> 01:25:20,504
It's where they set the booby trap
for the pedophiles.

1558
01:25:20,614 --> 01:25:22,377
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- A grandfather, a priest...

1559
01:25:22,482 --> 01:25:24,416
I mean, could you imagine it?
You think you're on a date,

1560
01:25:24,518 --> 01:25:26,076
and then all of a sudden,
police are everywhere.

1561
01:25:26,186 --> 01:25:27,744
- Yeah.
- My God, this guy knows where we live.

1562
01:25:27,854 --> 01:25:28,821
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1563
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:33,291
I think you'll be glad to know I gave
security camera footage of this Drillbit

1564
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:36,123
to the police and they said
they'd be watching for him.

1565
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:38,390
No, what the hell's the matter
with you guys?

1566
01:25:38,498 --> 01:25:40,932
Are you mentally defective
or something?

1567
01:25:41,034 --> 01:25:43,161
You got to understand,
Drillbit was around because

1568
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,135
this psychopath over here
was gonna murder us!

1569
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:47,536
I mean, Filkins is the real criminal!

1570
01:25:47,641 --> 01:25:48,938
Yes! He has a samurai sword

1571
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:50,703
- he has used on his other victims!
- All right...

1572
01:25:55,749 --> 01:25:56,841
Sit down!

1573
01:25:58,518 --> 01:26:00,076
Sit down!

1574
01:26:00,654 --> 01:26:01,951
Thank you very much.

1575
01:26:02,055 --> 01:26:03,249
Now, Terry.

1576
01:26:04,157 --> 01:26:06,455
Is there any truth to this?

1577
01:26:07,327 --> 01:26:09,318
Oh, yeah. All of it.

1578
01:26:10,764 --> 01:26:14,962
I'm really a samurai warrior from
the 14th century sent to kill them.

1579
01:26:19,105 --> 01:26:20,538
He's cute.

1580
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,507
Okay, I hope I speak for everyone here

1581
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:27,011
in saying that I feel
this issue is resolved.

1582
01:26:27,113 --> 01:26:28,102
- Thank you. Okay, okay.
- All right?

1583
01:26:28,215 --> 01:26:29,807
Very good.
Thank you for coming in, folks.

1584
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,816
- Thank you.
- All right, yeah.

1585
01:26:31,918 --> 01:26:33,977
- Hey, wasn't that fun?
- Hell, yeah.

1586
01:26:34,087 --> 01:26:35,452
- Oh, my goodness!
- Great.

1587
01:26:35,555 --> 01:26:36,522
- You feel better now, honey?
- Terry, honey.

1588
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:38,056
I did not know you were all alone.

1589
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:40,251
We want to have you over to the house
for dinner, okay?

1590
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,796
- That would be wonderful!
- Wade could use more friends.

1591
01:26:50,737 --> 01:26:52,466
Give me one, please.

1592
01:26:56,243 --> 01:26:59,701
You're kind of a born loser. It's funny.

1593
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:01,903
It's not funny.

1594
01:27:02,182 --> 01:27:03,774
It's funny to me.

1595
01:27:04,184 --> 01:27:06,982
Come on, don't jinx me. Don't jinx me.

1596
01:27:08,855 --> 01:27:11,881
500! Yes! Yes! I did it!

1597
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:13,391
- I got it, man!
- Dude!

1598
01:27:13,493 --> 01:27:14,755
Look at that! Yes!

1599
01:27:14,861 --> 01:27:16,055
You got a ticket to Canada!

1600
01:27:16,162 --> 01:27:18,392
You better believe it! Come on, man!

1601
01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:20,728
Finally! Finally, I get one!

1602
01:27:20,867 --> 01:27:24,234
Come here, you!
This candy's on me! Put it down!

1603
01:27:24,537 --> 01:27:28,166
You got it! Well, maybe just get
one of them. Here. Here you go!

1604
01:27:41,288 --> 01:27:43,415
Okay, keep your eyes peeled.

1605
01:27:46,493 --> 01:27:49,291
- Do you see Filkins?
- No, but I see Brooke.

1606
01:27:49,763 --> 01:27:52,357
Gonna go for it. I'm gonna ask her out.

1607
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,394
- Really?
- Yeah.

1608
01:27:54,801 --> 01:27:57,565
- You waited all this time. Why now?
- Why not?

1609
01:27:58,004 --> 01:28:00,438
My life sucks so badly,
even if she says no,

1610
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,599
it's not like I'll have very far to fall.

1611
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:09,075
I don't know.

1612
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,078
- Hi.
- Hi.

1613
01:28:13,186 --> 01:28:15,586
Look, I don't know how to do this.

1614
01:28:16,222 --> 01:28:19,419
In fact, I've been wanting to do this
for a while. I just didn't know

1615
01:28:19,526 --> 01:28:21,118
when would be a good time. I don't...

1616
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:25,425
I didn't know if it would ever be
a good time. I mean, if I'd ever think...

1617
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:30,395
It's okay, Brooke.

1618
01:28:32,739 --> 01:28:35,970
Yo, bro, I swear to God
those ain't my sodas,

1619
01:28:36,076 --> 01:28:38,977
but if you wanted to, say, hire me
or something, like a bodyguard,

1620
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:43,175
I think maybe I could dedicate my life
to finding the real culprit.

1621
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:48,586
Wade, come on.
I'm okay with this, so let's just go.

1622
01:28:48,688 --> 01:28:50,588
What'd you say, ho?

1623
01:28:50,957 --> 01:28:52,515
Okay, you know what?
What is your problem?

1624
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,616
Why don't you just leave them alone?

1625
01:28:54,728 --> 01:28:57,526
What are you gonna do, bro?
What are you gonna do?

1626
01:28:59,432 --> 01:29:03,300
You aren't gonna do anything,
because you don't have any balls.

1627
01:29:04,504 --> 01:29:06,836
- Leave him alone!
- It's just not in you.

1628
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:14,275
You see? Look at that.

1629
01:29:15,248 --> 01:29:16,545
Sackless!

1630
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:24,916
Why do you even waste my time?
You're pathetic.

1631
01:29:30,497 --> 01:29:32,226
You all right, Wade?

1632
01:29:32,632 --> 01:29:34,623
- Don't worry about that guy.
- He's just insecure inside.

1633
01:29:34,734 --> 01:29:37,100
- Get up. Let's get out of here.
- Wade?

1634
01:29:37,203 --> 01:29:38,693
Where are you going?

1635
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:41,239
- T-Dog! Stop him!
- Fight! Fight!

1636
01:29:44,043 --> 01:29:45,032
Come on, Wade!

1637
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:47,511
I'll kick the crap out of you right now.
You know why?

1638
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:50,640
Half because
everyone is sick of your garbage

1639
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,275
and half because
of what you said to Brooke!

1640
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:56,885
Do you think I'm dumb?

1641
01:29:57,824 --> 01:29:59,951
Trying to trick me
into getting myself in trouble?

1642
01:30:00,059 --> 01:30:03,051
Fine. Then we'll beat your face in
somewhere else.

1643
01:30:03,163 --> 01:30:05,154
- Anywhere. Go ahead. You name it.
- Okay, good.

1644
01:30:05,265 --> 01:30:09,827
Everybody! Everybody! I'm gonna kick
their asses tonight at my house!

1645
01:30:10,236 --> 01:30:13,330
Everybody should come!
It's gonna be hilarious!

1646
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,403
Ultimate Geek Fighting!

1647
01:30:15,742 --> 01:30:20,076
Once you step on my property,
you're freaking trespassing, brother,

1648
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,943
and I can do anything I want.

1649
01:30:22,048 --> 01:30:23,879
You're nothing but a pathetic wimp,

1650
01:30:23,983 --> 01:30:27,111
and everyone's gonna know
by the end of tonight, brother!

1651
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,915
And I will see you there!

1652
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:38,025
What have I just done?

1653
01:30:38,364 --> 01:30:40,229
That was awesome, man.

1654
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:44,027
- Me and Emmit are gonna back you up.
- Oh, now it's "me and Emmit. "

1655
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:46,833
You've never been nice to me, Ryan,
and I've only been kind to you.

1656
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,170
And I've tried so hard
to make this friendship work,

1657
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:52,642
but I am not going to die
for someone who won't die for me!

1658
01:30:52,745 --> 01:30:56,374
"Survival technique. "
I renounce violence.

1659
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,977
I have a future!

1660
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:01,814
What do we do next?

1661
01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:05,282
Guess we'd better learn how to fight.

1662
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:08,885
- Jump left, jump left.
- Come on, Blue.

1663
01:31:08,995 --> 01:31:10,326
- That's what I'm talking about!
- No, no, no, no.

1664
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:11,988
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Come on!

1665
01:31:12,098 --> 01:31:13,292
Come on! Yes!

1666
01:31:13,433 --> 01:31:15,697
This PowerBar's really working.

1667
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:17,360
I feel stronger.

1668
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:19,569
I feel fatter.

1669
01:31:19,672 --> 01:31:21,469
<i>Well, what do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?</i>

1670
01:31:21,574 --> 01:31:23,804
<i>Come on. Do me this one favor.</i>

1671
01:31:26,012 --> 01:31:27,604
That was perfect!

1672
01:31:29,082 --> 01:31:32,142
All right. We need to learn
how to take a punch.

1673
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:34,544
You ready? Let me go first.

1674
01:31:35,388 --> 01:31:36,980
- All right?
- Okay.

1675
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:52,135
Block out the pain.

1676
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:54,832
Remember what that douche bag
Drillbit taught us?

1677
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:57,341
- Mind over pain!
- Okay.

1678
01:31:57,443 --> 01:32:00,241
All right. Hit me in the chest.

1679
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:03,949
Jeez!

1680
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:07,616
- Your knuckles are all bone!
- All right.

1681
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,620
We get to call how hard
the other guy hits.

1682
01:32:09,722 --> 01:32:13,317
All right. Ten being the hardest,
how hard do you want it?

1683
01:32:13,426 --> 01:32:16,054
Five. In the back. In the back.

1684
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:21,827
Oh, God!

1685
01:32:21,935 --> 01:32:25,598
Wonder what it feels like getting hit
in the middle of the forehead.

1686
01:32:28,374 --> 01:32:29,341
Jeez!

1687
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:32,973
- All right, new rules!
- Okay.

1688
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:34,341
I'm not gonna tell you
where I'm gonna hit you.

1689
01:32:34,447 --> 01:32:35,539
- No, I don't like that rule.
- No, it's good.

1690
01:32:35,648 --> 01:32:37,513
- No, it's not good.
- It's good. It simulates a real fight.

1691
01:32:37,617 --> 01:32:39,710
- Trust me.
- All right, fine.

1692
01:32:44,023 --> 01:32:45,320
I can't see this coming.

1693
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:47,086
There's no way Wade can hurt me.

1694
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:50,687
Not balls!

1695
01:32:51,798 --> 01:32:53,356
You hit me in the nuts!

1696
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:58,496
<i>Dear Mom, if you're reading this,</i>

1697
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:01,739
<i>it's very possible that I'm dead.</i>

1698
01:33:04,944 --> 01:33:09,005
<i>If I don't survive, you should definitely
sue Emmit's family.</i>

1699
01:33:09,382 --> 01:33:13,011
<i>P.S. Sorry I let your silver platter
get stolen.</i>

1700
01:33:13,219 --> 01:33:15,551
<i>My raps and rhymes will become
more valuable now.</i>

1701
01:33:15,655 --> 01:33:17,555
<i>You're free to sell them
to Ghostface Killah.</i>

1702
01:33:22,729 --> 01:33:25,254
Remember the plan.
Strike first and strike hard.

1703
01:33:25,365 --> 01:33:28,027
You go for the head. I'll go for the nuts.

1704
01:34:10,376 --> 01:34:13,243
It actually looks like a pretty cool party.

1705
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:17,480
Oh! Hey, guys.

1706
01:34:17,617 --> 01:34:22,350
So, how does it feel to know
that death is just a few moments away?

1707
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:25,457
- Where's Filkins?
- In the kitchen.

1708
01:34:28,394 --> 01:34:30,089
In case we don't make it,

1709
01:34:32,198 --> 01:34:34,564
- I don't want to have any regrets.
- Yeah.

1710
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:37,360
Face!

1711
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:43,101
I've already got the first hit
out of the way.

1712
01:34:43,209 --> 01:34:44,471
Let's get some.

1713
01:35:00,626 --> 01:35:02,787
Hey! Hey, hey. Everybody, everybody!

1714
01:35:03,129 --> 01:35:04,687
These kids actually came!

1715
01:35:04,797 --> 01:35:07,925
These are the Siamese queers
I've been telling you about!

1716
01:35:08,701 --> 01:35:11,363
They showed up!
They really are that dumb!

1717
01:35:11,738 --> 01:35:13,205
I hate when he calls me that.

1718
01:35:13,306 --> 01:35:16,002
So we're gonna have a good time!
Because they...

1719
01:35:24,684 --> 01:35:25,742
It worked.

1720
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,111
- It's over!
- That was easy.

1721
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:31,381
- We did it, we did it!
- We did.

1722
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:35,621
Everybody, from ninth grade
to twelfth grade,

1723
01:35:35,862 --> 01:35:38,695
I promise you,
his reign of tyranny is over!

1724
01:35:39,365 --> 01:35:42,698
I proclaim it!
He will never bother us again!

1725
01:35:44,737 --> 01:35:46,204
And he's getting up!

1726
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,430
You're dead.

1727
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:51,203
And I'm in big trouble!

1728
01:36:05,258 --> 01:36:08,750
Catch me off guard?
You broke my stairs.

1729
01:36:09,395 --> 01:36:11,454
My father loved those stairs!

1730
01:36:16,269 --> 01:36:17,668
You blocking out the pain?

1731
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:20,034
I thought I was for a second,
but I'm totally not.

1732
01:36:20,139 --> 01:36:21,766
You want to play?

1733
01:36:22,608 --> 01:36:23,700
Let's play.

1734
01:36:40,226 --> 01:36:43,354
Get up, get up, get up! Come on, Ryan.

1735
01:36:44,497 --> 01:36:48,365
You're like, super-hot.
I'm never gonna leave you.

1736
01:36:48,467 --> 01:36:51,197
- Ronnie! You're missing out.
- Okay.

1737
01:36:52,471 --> 01:36:53,768
Hey, boys!

1738
01:36:58,010 --> 01:37:00,308
Yo, Jay, give me some murder music.

1739
01:37:01,314 --> 01:37:04,147
This just gets better and better.

1740
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:12,789
All right!

1741
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:16,728
Hey, yo, yo. Back off.

1742
01:37:16,863 --> 01:37:18,990
I want to fight both these bitches.

1743
01:37:19,232 --> 01:37:23,225
They're yours, Filk!
They're yours, baby! Here we go.

1744
01:37:23,336 --> 01:37:25,201
- You're the bitch!
- Huh?

1745
01:37:30,509 --> 01:37:31,942
That's right!

1746
01:37:33,512 --> 01:37:34,604
What the...

1747
01:37:36,716 --> 01:37:39,082
- Emmit's got game!
- Oh, yeah!

1748
01:37:42,154 --> 01:37:44,247
- Good one, Ron!
- Come on!

1749
01:37:46,025 --> 01:37:47,959
Bear hug!

1750
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,288
- Come on!
- Oh!

1751
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:03,172
I have reach! I have reach!

1752
01:38:05,177 --> 01:38:08,613
Come on, Wade!
You're like Rocky! Get back out there!

1753
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:14,114
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- You're not gonna hurt me anymore?

1754
01:38:14,387 --> 01:38:17,515
I won't hurt you! You should let go!
I can't breathe, Ryan, can't breathe!

1755
01:38:17,623 --> 01:38:21,081
I'll let you go.
Not gonna hurt me anymore, are...

1756
01:38:22,662 --> 01:38:25,495
- I have reach!
- No! Wade!

1757
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,865
Hey! Hey, there. Hey...

1758
01:38:31,704 --> 01:38:33,103
- Didn't hurt!
- Really?

1759
01:38:33,205 --> 01:38:34,297
Yeah.

1760
01:38:34,507 --> 01:38:36,202
Okay, that did.

1761
01:38:38,811 --> 01:38:40,369
Let that kid go.

1762
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:48,447
Private Drillbit Taylor reporting for duty!

1763
01:38:48,988 --> 01:38:50,922
- Hoo-rah.
- You came back?

1764
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:54,059
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you even doing here?

1765
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,853
What, you need more money
from these geeks?

1766
01:38:56,963 --> 01:38:59,864
No. But this fight is over!

1767
01:39:00,533 --> 01:39:02,763
<i>You hear me? Abierto!</i>

1768
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:06,038
Done.

1769
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:10,709
It's over, people! Pack it up! Go home!

1770
01:39:10,977 --> 01:39:16,643
Look. You're a young man. You got...
You got a crazy look in your eye.

1771
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:20,143
And it's really freaking me out right now.

1772
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:25,684
Nice punch.

1773
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:30,026
I try to be reasonable,
but I got to tell you,

1774
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:35,564
these boys hired me as their bodyguard
and I will protect them!

1775
01:39:40,106 --> 01:39:41,596
Want to hear something crazy?

1776
01:39:41,707 --> 01:39:44,175
Deep inside you,
I know there's a good kid.

1777
01:39:46,879 --> 01:39:50,371
God damn it,
I'm sick of getting hit by this kid.

1778
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:52,210
Come on, Drillbit. Kick his ass.

1779
01:39:52,318 --> 01:39:56,220
- I can't! He's a minor!
- No, he's not. He's 18.

1780
01:39:57,223 --> 01:39:59,123
You're 18?

1781
01:40:05,197 --> 01:40:06,892
That's it.

1782
01:40:16,475 --> 01:40:17,442
Drillbit!

1783
01:40:19,145 --> 01:40:20,407
How old are you?

1784
01:40:20,513 --> 01:40:23,277
Okay! All right, I'm 17. I'm a minor.

1785
01:40:23,382 --> 01:40:24,474
- My mom drives me to school.
- Come on!

1786
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:25,845
I swear to God!

1787
01:40:26,352 --> 01:40:27,649
That was awesome.

1788
01:40:27,753 --> 01:40:30,244
Man, Drillbit, you're badass.

1789
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:33,051
I don't think I could do that again.

1790
01:40:33,325 --> 01:40:35,122
It's weird. I guess it's like

1791
01:40:35,227 --> 01:40:38,219
when a mother
lifts an automobile off a child.

1792
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:39,991
- Yeah.
- You just get that burst of strength.

1793
01:40:40,099 --> 01:40:41,657
That's the only way I can explain it.

1794
01:40:41,767 --> 01:40:44,668
Adrenaline. That's the word for it.

1795
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:48,001
My hands are...
My hands are still shaking.

1796
01:40:48,607 --> 01:40:51,508
- Thanks for coming back.
- You kidding me? I had to do it.

1797
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:53,544
I'm not gonna go AWOL on you boys.

1798
01:40:53,646 --> 01:40:55,443
I made that mistake one...

1799
01:40:55,681 --> 01:40:59,447
<i>Crap on a shit sandwich!
I'm out of here, boys! Adiós!</i>

1800
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:01,547
Bye, Drillbit!

1801
01:41:01,787 --> 01:41:02,845
Hey, fags!

1802
01:41:04,957 --> 01:41:06,652
This ain't over!

1803
01:41:17,636 --> 01:41:19,501
- He feels no pain.
- Whoa.

1804
01:41:23,342 --> 01:41:24,741
Was that my pinky?

1805
01:41:28,547 --> 01:41:31,015
- Are you okay?
- My finger!

1806
01:41:31,117 --> 01:41:32,084
You okay?

1807
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:33,879
- I'm so sorry.
- Why did I catch a sword?

1808
01:41:33,986 --> 01:41:35,453
- I lost it. No, no.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

1809
01:41:35,554 --> 01:41:38,990
- I lost it.
- Let me see it. Let me see it.

1810
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,922
No, it's okay. I'm blocking the pain.

1811
01:41:41,026 --> 01:41:43,426
I can't block this pain.
Get some ice for me.

1812
01:41:43,529 --> 01:41:44,962
It's not bad. Here, help me find it

1813
01:41:45,064 --> 01:41:46,292
- before the ants get it.
- Where'd you last see it?

1814
01:41:46,398 --> 01:41:48,298
- Look in the grass.
- My dad, yo, just don't tell my dad!

1815
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,560
Help me, guys!
Find it before a rat gets it!

1816
01:41:49,668 --> 01:41:50,896
See it? Look over there.

1817
01:41:51,003 --> 01:41:52,197
- Is that it?
- Where?

1818
01:41:52,304 --> 01:41:54,101
Hey, guys, I found it!

1819
01:41:56,242 --> 01:41:57,504
No!

1820
01:41:58,444 --> 01:41:59,570
We found it.

1821
01:42:01,313 --> 01:42:02,405
Get me some ice.

1822
01:42:02,515 --> 01:42:03,513
- Ice!
- Ice!

1823
01:42:03,616 --> 01:42:04,674
Margarita all right?

1824
01:42:04,783 --> 01:42:06,512
Oh, my God.

1825
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:07,677
Bro!

1826
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:09,219
Come on, buddy.
We got to get you to a hospital.

1827
01:42:09,321 --> 01:42:11,653
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

1828
01:42:11,757 --> 01:42:13,486
It's gonna be okay.

1829
01:42:13,592 --> 01:42:16,891
Congratulations, boys.
You just caught the great Bob Taylor.

1830
01:42:16,996 --> 01:42:19,123
Fantastic. No alcohol in the car, sir.

1831
01:42:19,231 --> 01:42:21,893
Oh, yeah.
Well, let me get the finger out.

1832
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,264
Hoo-rah.

1833
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:31,071
- Yo, dudes, that was awesome!
- Thanks, man.

1834
01:42:31,177 --> 01:42:33,236
Man, you have no idea how long kids
have been waiting to do that.

1835
01:42:33,345 --> 01:42:34,835
- Thanks.
- Dude, this is gonna be blogged,

1836
01:42:34,947 --> 01:42:35,914
for sure!

1837
01:42:36,015 --> 01:42:38,711
I am so glad
I did not go to my sister's birthday party!

1838
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:40,641
Hey.

1839
01:42:40,753 --> 01:42:42,277
He was amazing.

1840
01:42:42,922 --> 01:42:44,685
You know,
Terry's just always been crazy.

1841
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:46,849
You know, he's threatened me
with his sword all the time.

1842
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:48,756
I'm just tired of being scared, you know?

1843
01:42:48,861 --> 01:42:51,352
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1844
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:58,100
When the adrenaline rush passes,
I'm gonna be in a lot more pain.

1845
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:02,672
I don't want you to think I'm the kind of
guy who tries to impress girls

1846
01:43:02,775 --> 01:43:05,801
with violence,
but that was kind of for you.

1847
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:10,107
That was very brave of you.

1848
01:43:20,259 --> 01:43:23,456
You know, Emmit,
I can't believe I'm saying this...

1849
01:43:24,964 --> 01:43:29,060
You, my friend, are one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

1850
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:31,193
You have no idea how scared I was.

1851
01:43:31,303 --> 01:43:34,568
All right. Now, let's go get
something to eat. I'm starving.

1852
01:43:38,444 --> 01:43:41,607
<i>Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.</i>

1853
01:43:41,714 --> 01:43:44,114
<i>Thanks for sending the Cap'n Crunch.</i>

1854
01:43:44,283 --> 01:43:46,274
<i>Suddenly, I'm very popular in here.</i>

1855
01:43:46,385 --> 01:43:50,947
Hey, Bob. Give me some of that Cap'n
Crunch or I'll stab you in the shower.

1856
01:43:53,058 --> 01:43:54,252
Just kidding.

1857
01:43:56,762 --> 01:43:59,390
<i>I was glad to read
in your last correspondence</i>

1858
01:43:59,498 --> 01:44:02,934
<i>that Filkins was shipped off
back to Hong Kong</i>

1859
01:44:03,035 --> 01:44:06,664
<i>to be with his parents for breaking
so many underage drinking laws.</i>

1860
01:44:07,206 --> 01:44:10,642
<i>Now maybe high school can be
what you want it to be</i>

1861
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:12,643
<i>- instead of sucking rat nads.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1862
01:44:13,812 --> 01:44:14,904
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1863
01:44:15,581 --> 01:44:18,948
<i>As for me, every time I look
at where my pinky used to be,</i>

1864
01:44:19,184 --> 01:44:22,153
<i>I think of you boys
and our battles together.</i>

1865
01:44:22,588 --> 01:44:23,953
It's kind of cool.

1866
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:26,483
<i>Luckily, they have
a work release program,</i>

1867
01:44:26,592 --> 01:44:28,890
<i>and they say I should
be able to land a job,</i>

1868
01:44:28,994 --> 01:44:30,825
<i>which excites me a great deal.</i>

1869
01:44:30,929 --> 01:44:33,227
<i>And speaking of exciting me
a great deal,</i>

1870
01:44:33,332 --> 01:44:35,630
<i>Miss Zachey and I
have been in contact.</i>

1871
01:44:35,768 --> 01:44:39,602
<i>I don't know why women dig
guys in prison, but they really do.</i>

1872
01:44:39,705 --> 01:44:43,607
<i>On top of that, all I can say is,
I miss you guys</i>

1873
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:45,472
<i>and will see you when I get out.</i>

1874
01:44:45,577 --> 01:44:49,411
<i>Which, thanks to the currently lenient
nature of the United States Army</i>

1875
01:44:49,515 --> 01:44:52,143
<i>deserting laws is in two days from now,</i>

1876
01:44:52,284 --> 01:44:55,515
<i>officially satisfying
my three-week sentence.</i>

1877
01:44:55,954 --> 01:44:58,149
<i>- Your brother, Bob Taylor.
- See you, Drillbit.</i>

1878
01:44:58,257 --> 01:45:01,055
<i>- AKA Drillbit.
- Later, bro.</i>

1879
01:45:01,293 --> 01:45:04,353
<i>AKA, Alamo Taylor.</i>

1880
01:45:04,897 --> 01:45:07,263
<i>I still like the sound of that.</i>

1881
01:45:10,135 --> 01:45:11,932
There you are!

1882
01:45:13,072 --> 01:45:14,562
- Drillbit!
- Come on.

1883
01:45:14,673 --> 01:45:15,970
- Oh, my God.
- There he is.

1884
01:45:16,075 --> 01:45:17,872
Come on, get in here!
Come here! Fall in!

1885
01:45:17,976 --> 01:45:20,274
- He's a free man!
- Give me a hug!

1886
01:45:20,412 --> 01:45:22,243
Give me a hug. Yeah.

1887
01:45:22,581 --> 01:45:25,015
Well, that's gonna keep me smiling
all day, huh?

1888
01:45:25,117 --> 01:45:26,607
Yeah, that's my buddy, Drillbit.

1889
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,277
He's a cool guy.
We're in a fight right now.

1890
01:45:28,387 --> 01:45:29,848
This has been the longest
three weeks of my life.

1891
01:45:29,955 --> 01:45:31,320
I missed you, too.

1892
01:45:32,024 --> 01:45:33,821
- Feels good.
- You gonna shake the jail?

1893
01:45:33,926 --> 01:45:35,826
- It wasn't that bad.
- Come on, let's go.

1894
01:45:35,928 --> 01:45:38,624
You know, the guy in the next cell taught
me some Spanish.

1895
01:45:38,731 --> 01:45:41,996
<i>Did you know abierto means "open"?</i>

1896
01:49:35,267 --> 01:49:37,633
Help! I'm bleeding!

1897
01:49:38,904 --> 01:49:41,930
Come here, soldier.
Let me take a look at that.

1898
01:49:42,407 --> 01:49:44,341
Come here. Jump up there.

1899
01:49:44,443 --> 01:49:49,278
You got a little bloody nose.
Tilt your head back, 45-degree angle.

1900
01:49:50,282 --> 01:49:52,807
- What happened?
- Somebody punched me.

1901
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:59,814
Tell me his name. Names.
It'll never happen again.
