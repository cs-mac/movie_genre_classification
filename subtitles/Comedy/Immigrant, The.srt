1
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:16,079
In expectation of what
you're going through

2
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,415
in a few moments you will
be directed upstairs to

3
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:23,085
complete registration for
entry into the United States.

4
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:32,303
We're almost there.

5
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:40,895
The doctors are looking.

6
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:43,772
Try to hold it in.

7
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,446
You're just nervous.

8
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,323
Try to close you ears
and say a prayer,

9
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,408
to the Mother of God.

10
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,075
I will.

11
00:01:57,204 --> 00:02:02,291
We'll find Auntie Edyta soon, and
we'll be safe. We'll be together.

12
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:09,173
We'll make our own families,
have lots of children.

13
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:21,018
Step forward, please.

14
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:23,479
Step forward.

15
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:32,113
Something is wrong?

16
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,448
You speak English?

17
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:38,161
Yes. She's my sister.
Is something wrong?

18
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,206
I'm very sorry, but she
may have lung disease.

19
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:44,042
No. No, no, no. She's
healthy. I am nurse.

20
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:47,837
She has to be examined further.
She could be contagious.

21
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,297
- No. She's healthy.
- Ewa? What are they saying?

22
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,757
Come with us.

23
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:53,718
Where are you taking her?

24
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,596
She will be held in our
infirmary here for six months.

25
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,473
If she doesn't improve
in that time,

26
00:02:58,474 --> 00:02:59,891
she has to be deported.

27
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,977
- No, no.
- Ewa, it's all right. Go without me.

28
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:02,477
Back in line.

29
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,313
She doesn't go back.
We never go back.

30
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:10,693
Magda! I promise, I'll get you out!

31
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:53,694
Welcome to the United
States of America. Next?

32
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:57,281
- Your name, please?
- Ewa Cybulska.

33
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:59,743
Where are you from?

34
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,745
Katowice. In Silesia.

35
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:04,789
- Poland?
- Yes.

36
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,291
Married or single?

37
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm not married.

38
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:08,084
Mhmm.

39
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,378
They took my sister.
I can not bring here.

40
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,590
We are not dealing with your sister
right now, ma'am. Understood?

41
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,926
What was your occupation in Poland?

42
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:21,639
I was a nurse, for
an English diplomat.

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,392
Have you ever committed
a any kind of crime?

44
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,814
No. Please, where is the infirmary?

45
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:33,401
Well, it says here on the manifest
that you had a problem on the ship.

46
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:37,821
That you may be a woman
of low morals. Is that true?

47
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:42,534
No, that is not true.

48
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,662
- It's not true?
- No.

49
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,501
Do you have any money?

50
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:55,048
No. But my aunt and my uncle, they
live here, and they're waiting for us.

51
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,467
Here at this address?

52
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,176
Yes.

53
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,181
Well, apparently they didn't show,
and this address doesn't exist.

54
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,307
It's not valid.

55
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,560
What is not valid?

56
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:09,436
It doesn't exist.

57
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,900
Now, we do not allow unescorted
women into this country.

58
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:18,029
Especially, if there's a
question of low morals.

59
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,073
Due to your situation
I'm going to have to

60
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:22,826
designate you as liable to
become a public charge.

61
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:25,286
- You'll be held for a hearing.
- No.

62
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,288
And most likely, deportation.

63
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:31,625
I'm sorry. Next! Next! Next!

64
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,942
Good morning, I'm Bruno Weiss
from the Travelers Aid Society.

65
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:58,193
Do you speak English?

66
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:00,988
No?

67
00:06:01,157 --> 00:06:03,074
I speak English.

68
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,117
- You speak English?
- Yes.

69
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:05,952
- Do you speak it well?
- Oh, yes.

70
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:08,579
- What's your name?
- Ewa Cybulska.

71
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,790
A pleasure to meet you.
Bruno Weiss.

72
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,126
What about her?

73
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,838
Liable to become, "public charge."
She arrived with her sister

74
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,258
who was quarantined
for lung disease.

75
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:25,387
- Best of luck to you.
- Sir. Can you help me?

76
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:29,225
Ma'am, you are in
the exclusion line.

77
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:29,976
Yes.

78
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:32,937
- Did they explain to you what that meant?
- Yes.

79
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:34,189
They're sending you back.

80
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,192
No, no. I can work.

81
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:40,904
You know this man, you talk to him.

82
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:44,949
You have already been processed.
Their decision has been rendered.

83
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,660
- There is very little I can do.
- Please. Please?

84
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:54,708
- Please. Please?
- One moment.

85
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:00,214
Please.

86
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:32,705
The last ferry to the city
leaves in ten minutes.

87
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,499
This gentleman will
escort you outside.

88
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,959
I cannot be seen leaving with you.

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,086
But I will see you out there.
Do you understand?

90
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,628
Yes.

91
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:43,006
Well, good luck to you.

92
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,806
Step this way please, ma'am.

93
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:05,238
Last call for the
ferry to New York.

94
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,949
Let's go, let's go.
You're a very lucky lady.

95
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,035
Good afternoon Mister Weiss.
You just made it.

96
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:13,036
Howard, thank you.

97
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,917
There's room in the front.

98
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,069
Upon docking in Battery Park,

99
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,215
if you have questions about further
destinations go directly to the large office.

100
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,385
Right here.

101
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:36,143
What's the matter?

102
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,440
I leave my sister here.

103
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:45,610
You do not worry. She will get
the best medical care available.

104
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:48,447
Do you have a place to stay?

105
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
No.

106
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:55,662
Do you know somewhere?

107
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,207
Yeah, I know a place.

108
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,127
If you would like, I can
take you there. Yes?

109
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,295
Yes.

110
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,771
You want me to take your satchel?

111
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:21,522
Come on.

112
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:24,524
Hey! Watch out!

113
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:30,906
I speak Yiddish. People
here don't mess with me.

114
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:34,285
Come on.

115
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,996
Right here, you can
get comfortable.

116
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,041
Come on.

117
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,255
Hi, Mister Bruno.

118
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,508
Hi, Sonja. Where's your mother?

119
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:51,843
Right there, she is sleeping.

120
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:57,183
Sonja, this is Ewa. Ewa, Sonja.

121
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,683
Hi.

122
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:11,864
Juante and Sonja.
It is comfortable.

123
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:14,575
There's a toilet in the middle
of hall, with plumbing.

124
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:17,077
You can sew right back here.

125
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,455
I don't know if you can
sew, but it's a job.

126
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,792
I have some papers here for you.

127
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:38,975
Please Miss, in order to receive aid.
I'll need you to fill out these forms.

128
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:43,312
Name, date of birth, country of origin,
etcetera. It's fairly self explanatory.

129
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:48,024
If you need my help,
I'll just be in here. Excuse me.

130
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:50,945
My little angel.

131
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,612
Hi.

132
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,993
Have you been practicing?

133
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:57,910
Yes.

134
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:00,829
That's good.

135
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,418
Do you need some help?

136
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,630
Maybe I come back
tomorrow, for sewing.

137
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,384
I thought you said you
had nowhere to stay.

138
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,889
Young lady, it's
dangerous out there.

139
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,057
As long as you earn your keep,
you're welcome to stay here.

140
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,768
Right there if you like.

141
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,022
I don't mean to be rude,

142
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:28,566
but I have some business
to take care of.

143
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,194
When your mother wakes up,
will you tell her I'm at the theater?

144
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:33,069
- Yes.
- Thank you.

145
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,160
I'm sure you're very tired.

146
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:42,747
I can help you feel comfortable
if you decide to stay.

147
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:44,748
Good night.

148
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:04,309
He likes you. I can tell.

149
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:07,563
Is he your father?

150
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:10,607
No. We live across the hall.

151
00:12:55,487 --> 00:13:00,657
Good morning. You slept
over thirteen hours.

152
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:05,787
I received a telegram this morning.
It's about your sister.

153
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,751
Can you read English?

154
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:12,419
Yes.

155
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:16,590
Tuberculous is a very bad disease.

156
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:19,884
Of course you'll have to
pay for her care somehow.

157
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:24,765
I can get her off the island.
Whether she's cured or not.

158
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:27,058
I know people.

159
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:30,855
It will be difficult and
costly, but it can be done.

160
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,065
I gave them this
address, of course.

161
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:36,192
So your sister will be
able to send you letters.

162
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:38,946
You could use a wash.

163
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:42,240
There is a bath house across
the street. It's easy to find.

164
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:49,290
Come, come doves! Up, up, up!

165
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,292
Good morning, my Bruno!

166
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:54,920
Good morning! It's raining today.
Let's hope it rains money!

167
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:55,421
Okay!

168
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:59,257
- Come on, let's go!
- We have lots of money to make.

169
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:09,143
I'm sorry. You're in
a difficult situation.

170
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,935
I need to work.

171
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:14,315
I can take you to my place
of business. It's a theater.

172
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:17,026
We could always use a
seamstress down there.

173
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:20,737
- But you need a bath.
- Yes.

174
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,198
All right.

175
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,659
Belva!

176
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,496
Good morning.

177
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,538
What are you doing?

178
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,790
- What?
- Good morning, Bruno.

179
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,417
You have to hurry, we have
rehearsals at eleven. Let's move.

180
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,126
I'm going.

181
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:03,321
It's from Bruno.

182
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,832
Here.

183
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:18,294
Like this.

184
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,007
Here.

185
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,218
Eat it all.

186
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:24,885
Thank you.

187
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:29,180
Get a little meat on your
bones, for New York winter.

188
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,892
You come by yourself?

189
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,270
No, with my sister.

190
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,439
She's still on the island.

191
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,442
You could get her off with money.

192
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:42,111
Bruno helped me get my
brother out of there.

193
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:46,656
He can fly off the handle every now and
then. But he's a real good employer.

194
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:51,120
But it will take a lot of money
to get her out of there.

195
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,455
Or a lot of fucking.

196
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:58,501
Of course, you could always wait for
some "White Knight" to come along.

197
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:00,713
Or your could steal.

198
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:04,132
As long as you don't mind being
beaten to death when they catch you.

199
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,930
Maybe you work with
us at Bandit's Roost.

200
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:13,349
Yes? Is Bruno's place.

201
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:17,520
You want a bath? Is warm.

202
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:21,232
Okay. I help you.

203
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:25,069
Five... six... seven... eight...

204
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,039
Bruno!

205
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:46,383
- I'm going in the back.
- Hi, girlies!

206
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:49,553
Welcome. Glad to see you here.

207
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:51,388
You look lovely.

208
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,976
Anyway, this is it, and the bar.

209
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:58,728
Come, I like you to meet the owner.

210
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,108
Rosie?

211
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:03,901
Yeah?

212
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:06,403
Hello. This is Ewa. Come in.

213
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:09,532
She has just arrived. She's
looking for some employment.

214
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,533
Perhaps a seamstress.

215
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:16,413
Hi. She's real beauty.

216
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:19,250
She should be dancing, not sewing.

217
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,335
Excuse us a minute.

218
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,545
Thank you.

219
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:26,215
Rosie, please leave her to me.

220
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:28,926
I have a feeling about her.
She could be special.

221
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:34,806
Okay. I want to talk with you.
Times are changing.

222
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,309
We got to compete with
the moving pictures.

223
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,146
If we want to keep
serving the liquor

224
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:46,234
we got to clean up the girls.
They can't show so much.

225
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,946
Can we talk about this later?
I'll see you at dinner?

226
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:52,031
Yes, of course.

227
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:55,035
See you at the Ox Tail.

228
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:57,161
Thank you.

229
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:19,601
Hey Bruno, say something.

230
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,774
Ladies...

231
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,322
I know some of you
have said, "Hello."

232
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:37,745
But I'd like to formally introduce
and welcome our new friend, Ewa.

233
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:42,958
Escaped the Great War back in Europe.
You are a very brave girl.

234
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:48,589
And I am a very lucky man...
to be surrounded by my family,

235
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,840
our little doves.

236
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:54,470
Rosie, words do not suffice.

237
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:59,390
Again, such a beautiful
spread. Thank you.

238
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,685
Let's all enjoy.

239
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:07,857
Hello, Rosie. How is it all going?

240
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:12,112
Hello. Bruno. These two nice men...

241
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:16,033
they're very good friend
of police commissioner.

242
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:19,286
Oh... How do you do, Bruno Weiss.

243
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,288
A pleasure to meet you.
And you sir.

244
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:26,585
And I'm pretty sure they would like to
see our pageant with the girls. Yes?

245
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:29,838
Pageant, as long as it's decent.

246
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,132
You know, some places
they ain't decent.

247
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,927
Even though they may be
serving, say, liquor.

248
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:37,388
And with prohibition, we
can't have no problems.

249
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:38,222
We'll shut you down.

250
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:42,351
Yes. We do it right.
Please, sit down.

251
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:47,022
And you know, we have a lot of
new shows for the New Year.

252
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:50,859
Oh, a lot of singing and magic.

253
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,279
Magic. Is that your
department, magic?

254
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,155
It can be.

255
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:59,785
Not thinking about bringing
Orlando back, are you?

256
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:05,249
No. Tomorrow I go to New Jersey.
And choose a lot of acts.

257
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,668
Well, you know I have your
best interest in mind.

258
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,170
Okay!

259
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:16,801
We got to have a prize
for our pageant. Yes?

260
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:19,595
Please put in the money.

261
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,185
Our guest will choose
who is the winner.

262
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:29,480
The best girl gets all the money.

263
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:31,734
I don't have any.

264
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:36,779
Then you can't join.
Sorry, those are the rules.

265
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,242
Belva, first.

266
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:47,206
She is so good. And all
in the right places.

267
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:52,336
There is Ilda.

268
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:55,966
She put on a few pounds
since last summer.

269
00:20:55,967 --> 00:21:01,054
But I believe everybody
agrees, it's for the best.

270
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,477
Beautiful Tessla...

271
00:21:18,948 --> 00:21:21,450
Good night, my darlings.

272
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,535
Good night, Bruno!

273
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:24,620
Good night, Bruno!

274
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:27,163
Thank you, Good night.

275
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:36,882
Oh, here we go.

276
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,842
You picked me, all me.

277
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:42,930
Look at this. Dollars! Geeps.

278
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:44,306
You did very well, darling.

279
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:47,725
Thank you, I thought I did better.

280
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,480
I want it.

281
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,573
We are just having a drink.

282
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,750
You don't care to join us?

283
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:14,418
No, thank you.

284
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:25,681
I used to dance on the
streets as a kid for money.

285
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:30,476
We would fasten tin to our shoes.

286
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:34,355
The things you do to survive.

287
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,070
Who is that?

288
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:44,282
My sister, my mother and my father.

289
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,370
She's beautiful.

290
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:50,371
Her name is Magda.

291
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,710
Where are your parents now?

292
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,379
They are dead.

293
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:02,508
Do you mind me asking
what happened?

294
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:06,012
They were killed by soldiers.

295
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:11,851
They cut their head off
and they make us watch.

296
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,110
No, don't touch me. Don't touch me.

297
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:26,949
Shame on you.

298
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:28,910
Shame!

299
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:33,707
I don't need to force
myself on you!

300
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,335
You are a stranger to me.

301
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,503
And you come into my home,

302
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:41,882
I feed you, I take care of you!

303
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:45,009
And you steal from us?

304
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:47,471
You think I didn't see?

305
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:50,432
From the same people
who tried to help you?

306
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:53,434
I should beat you to death!

307
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:55,979
You are not being smart.

308
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,734
You could work fifty years sewing
and not make half of what you need!

309
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:04,111
Belva! Belva, come in here!

310
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:09,159
Ewa has something she'd
like to say to you.

311
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,578
Something she would
like to give to you.

312
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,792
I stole money from you.

313
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:20,503
All right then. What do you say?

314
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,257
Yes, thank you.

315
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:25,592
You see? We forgive each other.

316
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:28,762
It's all right. We understand.

317
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:32,390
You're desperate.
We've all been desperate.

318
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,018
But I can help you.

319
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:39,481
I want you at the theater
tomorrow morning

320
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:41,900
to rehearse. Do you understand?

321
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:44,860
The other ladies will show you how.

322
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:47,698
Yes.

323
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:52,285
You will see that my
concern is for you.

324
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,590
Ladies, and gentlemen...
I, Bruno Weiss,

325
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,927
welcome you to...
Bandit's Roost!

326
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:12,222
Come, take a trip with
me and my doves...

327
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:15,267
as we take you round the globe

328
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:20,397
without leaving the comfort
of your chair. Behold!

329
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,609
All the women of the world...
laid out before you,

330
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,653
for your viewing pleasure.

331
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:31,700
Each one a mistress of the art
of love in her own domain.

332
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:35,661
Straight from Zigfeld's Theater.

333
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:38,790
Meet the Lady of Spain!

334
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:45,671
Sample her spicy paella,
Seniores! Muy caliente!

335
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:48,675
There is Little Egypt!

336
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:54,222
All the mysteries of the great pyramid
will be reveled before your very eyes

337
00:25:54,223 --> 00:25:58,601
by this modern day Cleopatra!

338
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:06,985
Or is it Miss Japan that
catches your fancy?

339
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:12,324
This Geisha girl has come from the
orient to tantalize the senses...

340
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:16,827
and sooth the white man's soul.

341
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:26,963
Find out how this Cossack of love
brought Napoleon to his knees

342
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:32,176
and made the Kremlin
quake with desire!

343
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:38,350
And there's Gypsy. Oh Gypsy,

344
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:44,981
that turns boys into men!
And men back to boys.

345
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:50,153
Well gentlemen, we
have toured the world.

346
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:55,951
And now they're all yours,
right back here in America.

347
00:26:55,952 --> 00:26:59,621
Lady Liberty!
Opens her arms to you.

348
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:05,668
And welcomes you to
her bosom of America.

349
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:12,925
That's a real beauty up there!

350
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,517
And now...

351
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:23,061
And now... Get her ready.

352
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:27,649
And now... Thank you,
thank you, thank you so.

353
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,821
And stay right there, gentleman.
The big show is yet to come.

354
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:41,220
But first Please enjoy the dancing
talents of Henry the Hoofer!

355
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,173
Ewa, so you've got
the big show coming.

356
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:53,758
Drink this. It is absinthe,
it makes it easier.

357
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,552
Back on in two minutes ladies!

358
00:27:55,553 --> 00:27:57,595
Just a little.

359
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:09,149
It looks like she drink
too much bar juice.

360
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,234
Well, she's a dumb Dora.
So what do you expect?

361
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:12,652
Of course she's going to
drink all the bar juice.

362
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,742
- I feel bad for her.
- Why do you feel bad.

363
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:16,865
Bruno can't take his
eyes off of her.

364
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,743
Next thing you know, he will be
treating her like a princess.

365
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:22,745
What a production!

366
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,707
Young lady, you were mesmerizing.

367
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:32,087
What? Are you drunk?

368
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:38,762
Mister Weiss? Good evening.
My name is Oskar Straub.

369
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:41,681
Hello. Mister Straub,

370
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:43,975
the garment maker from
uptown, how do you do.

371
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:46,520
I was very impressed
with your show.

372
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:50,856
Thank you. I'm just obliged
for your high regard.

373
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,568
I have a problem.

374
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:58,907
Leo! This is my son, Leo.

375
00:28:58,908 --> 00:28:59,616
Hello.

376
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:06,497
He needs care. He's not manly.

377
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,834
I see. We can definitely
be of service.

378
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,878
Is there anything in
particular you like.

379
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:13,463
We can also provide your
son with a male companion.

380
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:14,922
No, no.

381
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,309
She's new.

382
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,311
She hasn't even shown herself.

383
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:32,941
I hate to disappoint.
She's strictly a dancer.

384
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:36,986
Half now, half later.

385
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:40,240
Please, we must be discreet.

386
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,866
I'll speak to you in a moment, yes?

387
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:59,050
Why don't you go home now.

388
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:02,220
You don't have to
do the second show.

389
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:04,972
Hello?

390
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,911
Hello, ma'am.

391
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,459
Ewa, this is Leo.

392
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,044
A nice young man.

393
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:38,714
Come, sit down

394
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:42,009
and you both get to know
each other a little.

395
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:45,220
I'll just be outside.

396
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:50,351
I'm not...

397
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:56,398
My father wants me to do this.

398
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:07,660
No, no...

399
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,081
No...

400
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:20,005
She doesn't want to do it.

401
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:24,803
Young man, she's pure.

402
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,638
Do you understand?

403
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,640
We'll be a moment.

404
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:48,701
I don't want you to do this either.

405
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:52,830
But it's not my decision.

406
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:56,083
The truth is...

407
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,295
we both know you are
going to see this boy.

408
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:03,675
Because for you...

409
00:32:03,676 --> 00:32:08,220
your sister's well being is
more important than your own.

410
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:11,557
I've learned that about you.

411
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:16,937
The boy is very gentle...

412
00:32:17,356 --> 00:32:19,648
he doesn't know anything.

413
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:25,821
No one will ever know.

414
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,949
So tell me now.

415
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,745
If you do not wish to see this boy,

416
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:34,330
I'll send him away.

417
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:37,124
But tell me now.

418
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,739
I'll be just outside.

419
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,389
Here you are, sir.

420
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,518
And by the way, we do have
spirits available this evening.

421
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,353
Good, I'll have a whiskey.

422
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:39,521
Yes sir.

423
00:33:39,522 --> 00:33:42,689
You need to eat,
you'll feel better.

424
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:47,111
Come on, Ewa. Come on.
Eat something.

425
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,321
Do you want to try a little bit?

426
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:52,408
Please, we don't want
you to get sick.

427
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,118
How long I do this?

428
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,039
I don't know.

429
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:03,878
I don't know. How much it's
going to cost to get her out.

430
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:07,423
But you helped your sister today.

431
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:10,969
Now, a client like Mister Straub,
he opens a lot of doors.

432
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,930
I will not give the
cops their usual cut.

433
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,309
Now that's a big big risk for me.

434
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:24,648
Because I'm here to help you.
Not like your stupid uncle.

435
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,782
You know my uncle?

436
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:35,869
No, I don't know your uncle.
I know of your uncle.

437
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,873
When I got you off the island,
when I paid to get you out.

438
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:42,333
McNally showed me the files,

439
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,127
I know about your
uncle and your aunt.

440
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,670
They didn't do anything for you.

441
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:49,090
Here...

442
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:52,759
Here's your cut, for your sister.

443
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:55,971
What? You don't like money?
If you don't want it, I'll keep it.

444
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,974
- I like money.
- Good.

445
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:03,478
I don't like you.

446
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:07,274
I hate you.

447
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,944
And I hate myself.

448
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:25,751
I'm sorry, Ewa. Don't hate me.

449
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:35,427
I want you. Why do
you say no to me?

450
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:39,598
I want you to love me.

451
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:57,824
Ewa, Ewa, Bruno loves you.

452
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:28,397
Excuse me, do you
know this address?

453
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:36,614
Excuse me, Do you
know this address?

454
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,157
Does it exist?

455
00:36:38,158 --> 00:36:41,368
Greenpoint, Brooklyn,
over the bridge.

456
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:46,665
Hello, Chippie.

457
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:50,043
Hey, Chippie, come on back here.

458
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Who is there?

459
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,567
Wojtek! Ewa!

460
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:20,324
They said you weren't here,

461
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:23,244
but I found you, Auntie!

462
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:25,370
Thank God.

463
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,542
Come inside. We looked for you

464
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:32,712
for so long... it's a miracle.

465
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:34,213
Edyta, who is it?

466
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:39,009
Wojtek! Wojtek, Ewa is here!

467
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:43,263
Ewa found us!

468
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:52,857
We haven't met since the wedding.

469
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:55,817
But I remember you, uncle.

470
00:37:57,738 --> 00:38:00,448
You should get her something
to eat and drink.

471
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,075
Yes, of course.

472
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:04,826
Come, I will make you some tea.

473
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:16,755
They said you weren't on the boat.

474
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:24,262
Your uncle went to Ellis Island,
and they said you never came.

475
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:26,807
No, we did.

476
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,811
They said you weren't there.

477
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:34,731
They said your address
wasn't valid.

478
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:39,862
But I knew it wasn't true, that
you would never forget about us.

479
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:43,324
Of course we would never
forget about you!

480
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,951
Never.

481
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,621
Where's Magda?

482
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:55,418
They made her stay at
the hospital. She's sick.

483
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:58,506
But she sent me a letter.

484
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:02,259
With your help we can get her out.

485
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:10,851
Magda... Magda was very brave.

486
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:21,695
I wouldn't have made
it without her.

487
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:27,325
I'm very tired...

488
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,495
But I'm well.

489
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:44,177
Tomorrow we'll go to church

490
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:47,596
and give thanks.

491
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,183
Let her rest.

492
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:54,895
Of course. Yes.

493
00:39:56,899 --> 00:40:00,275
Darling, you're safe now.

494
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:05,322
You'll be very happy in
this country. You'll see.

495
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:08,200
We've done very well here.

496
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:15,625
You'll meet a good man...
and get married.

497
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:20,170
Sleep now. You'll feel better.

498
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:36,771
Don't lose faith, my love.

499
00:40:36,772 --> 00:40:43,026
The nightingale always sings
sweetest at the darkest hour.

500
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,033
Sleep.

501
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:38,206
Magda.

502
00:41:56,393 --> 00:41:59,352
I was dreaming...

503
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:02,355
We are going to have to ask
you come with us, please.

504
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:05,151
I don't understand.

505
00:42:05,152 --> 00:42:08,904
You don't have proof of residence.
You're here illegally.

506
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:12,741
I'm sorry. I'm going
to have to deport you.

507
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:15,160
Why?

508
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:19,623
I have a good name
here, a business.

509
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,459
I won't be shamed.

510
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,337
I didn't do anything.

511
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:28,132
The men at Ellis Island, they
told me what you did on the ship!

512
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:30,634
- You're a disgrace.
- No.

513
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:31,844
A whore!

514
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:34,555
Just be thankful I let you
sleep here last night!

515
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:36,015
- No! It's a lie!
- Let's go.

516
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:38,142
Auntie Edyta! It's not true!

517
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:40,353
Auntie Edyta! They lie!

518
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:41,604
That's enough!

519
00:42:41,605 --> 00:42:43,898
- You don't talk to her!
- What about Magda?

520
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:47,902
I pray for her. She's
sick, you poisoned her!

521
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:50,154
- Where you take her?
- Shut up!

522
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:52,281
Tell me where they are taking her!

523
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:55,116
This is my house!

524
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,705
Your stay here in Ellis
Island will not be long.

525
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:06,795
Your deportation hearing is tomorrow.
They don't work on Sunday.

526
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,381
I see here you're from Poland.

527
00:43:09,466 --> 00:43:14,177
You are already registered by
Officer McNally. We'll notify him.

528
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:15,596
Where is the hospital?

529
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:19,349
It's on the south side of the island.
You can't see it from here.

530
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:22,728
My sister is there. Can I see her?

531
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:26,773
There's no visitations. I'm sorry.

532
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,278
But there's a show tonight for the
detainees in the Registry Room.

533
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:34,448
If she's well enough, you
might see her there.

534
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:38,452
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

535
00:43:38,453 --> 00:43:41,371
Well, here's your bunk.

536
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:47,252
And listen, if you look healthy
for the Board, it helps.

537
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,263
You're Polish?

538
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:59,890
We're from Lodz.

539
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:03,310
It's terrible, the way
they treat us here.

540
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:06,187
Like we are nothing.

541
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:09,482
I am not nothing.

542
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:08,500
Mary Mother of God,

543
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:13,713
in the hour of my great need

544
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:18,009
help me...

545
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:23,014
and help me find Magda tonight.

546
00:45:40,534 --> 00:45:42,743
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you!

547
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:46,288
Now, before you are entertained
by the one and only Caruso,

548
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:50,667
the worlds finest tenor, we have one
more of our local acts to thrill you.

549
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:54,755
Behold, a touch of magic!

550
00:45:54,756 --> 00:45:59,134
From a prestidigitator who will amaze
you with his gravity-defying daring-do!

551
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:01,178
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you,

552
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:04,222
Orlando the Magician!

553
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,689
Thank you, Good evening.
Good evening.

554
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,649
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

555
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:19,572
The Levitation,

556
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:24,326
perhaps the most miraculous
feat you'll ever witness.

557
00:46:24,327 --> 00:46:30,373
Even the Great Houdini himself, has
never defied gravity in such a manner.

558
00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:36,922
But tonight I will attempt to
rise, before your very eyes.

559
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:42,093
Now there are those that
query the possibility.

560
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:47,433
But I understand that.
I've heard it all before.

561
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:49,934
But I have to ask those people,

562
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:56,525
how is it that you found yourself
here? At this very moment,

563
00:46:56,526 --> 00:46:58,944
in America?

564
00:46:58,945 --> 00:47:02,615
By boat most likely, yes.
It would be a long swim.

565
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:07,620
But isn't it also because you
believed it could happen?

566
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:10,164
Well, Ladies and gentlemen...

567
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,415
I believe.

568
00:47:34,814 --> 00:47:38,775
Thank you...

569
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:46,157
Thank you. Now, excuse me sir.

570
00:47:48,662 --> 00:47:52,665
Now Ladies and gentlemen,
we ask you to be very quiet.

571
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:53,666
For the next trick,

572
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:58,587
even the slightest break of
concentration could prove to be fatal.

573
00:47:58,588 --> 00:48:01,757
Now I assure you this is an
authentic straight jacket.

574
00:48:01,758 --> 00:48:03,300
- Yes.
- Magda?

575
00:48:03,301 --> 00:48:05,302
- Used on the criminally insane.
- Magda.

576
00:48:05,303 --> 00:48:07,388
- My mother thinks I belong in it.
- Magda.

577
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:08,597
I'm not sure I feel that.

578
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:10,557
- But I'm already strapped into this coffin.
- Magda.

579
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:11,642
What?

580
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:18,314
I want you to secure it, and lock it...
after I'm inside, of course.

581
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:21,776
And then I want you to
shoot your weapon at me.

582
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:23,821
On my signal!

583
00:48:23,822 --> 00:48:27,532
Ready! Aim!

584
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:30,034
Fire!

585
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:34,873
On no! Ladies and Gentlemen,

586
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:40,336
Orlando the Magician has been
shot dead! This is tragic!

587
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:49,554
Where, oh where is Orlando?

588
00:48:51,808 --> 00:48:53,850
You missed.

589
00:48:56,938 --> 00:48:58,522
Happy New Year.

590
00:48:58,523 --> 00:49:01,983
Enjoy the show...

591
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:12,535
God, you're beautiful.

592
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:18,083
Happy New Year!...

593
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:21,795
Now, before I go I just want to
say, don't give up the faith.

594
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:25,549
Don't give up the hope. The
American dream is waiting for you.

595
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:32,430
Now, without further ado I
give you The Great Caruso!

596
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:59,225
It's all right.

597
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:01,602
Have you eaten?

598
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:03,855
Did she get a meal?

599
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:06,941
Yeah, she didn't have much
of an appetite though.

600
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:11,863
I heard about what
happened with your uncle.

601
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,451
And now they send you back home.

602
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:20,330
I don't know where is home.

603
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:22,290
What do you mean?

604
00:51:25,086 --> 00:51:28,255
Here, at least my sister is near.

605
00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:31,173
You're so stubborn.

606
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:37,680
You are going to be deported.
Do you understand that?

607
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:43,311
I wish there was something
more I could do for you.

608
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:57,034
Listen to me. Why don't we go

609
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:58,410
and tomorrow I will take you

610
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:02,080
- to get your sister.
- I want more money.

611
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:03,831
What?

612
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:08,169
I want more money.

613
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,840
I'm not opposed to that.

614
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:20,848
I will give you... fifty cents cents
of every dollar we make. Half.

615
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:23,018
Is that agreeable?

616
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:25,436
I don't trust you.

617
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:29,066
Ewa, come on. I wouldn't come out
here for anyone else but you.

618
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:31,817
No, I don't trust you.

619
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:35,237
But if you don't give me my money,

620
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:39,868
then I will tell the police that
you hid money from them.

621
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,412
- You're going to tell the police, yeah?
- Yes.

622
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:49,251
I'd rather you get the cut
than the cops anyway.

623
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,173
All right. So get your things.

624
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,550
Let's go.

625
00:52:57,178 --> 00:52:59,178
Come on.

626
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:24,412
You are so beautiful.

627
00:53:24,998 --> 00:53:27,915
Thank you for this.

628
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,378
You should wear a lot of clothing.

629
00:53:33,548 --> 00:53:36,757
February is cold winter.

630
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:42,597
If you catch a cold,
I won't see you.

631
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,765
Yeah.

632
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:48,269
I will stay warm, I promise.

633
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:53,524
I gave the a... the money to Bruno.

634
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,281
This is just a little extra...
for your sister.

635
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:00,449
Thank you.

636
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,867
I hope she gets better soon.

637
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:08,080
Goodbye.

638
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,047
Good morning.

639
00:54:57,048 --> 00:55:01,133
Good morning. Do you have
my money, for last night?

640
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:06,765
Well, some of the ladies and I are going
up to Rhinebeck again this weekend.

641
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:09,434
I'd like it if you'd
join us this time.

642
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:11,769
You might have fun.

643
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,106
Thank you for the money.

644
00:55:14,107 --> 00:55:16,065
Well, you think about it.

645
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:27,159
Bruno!

646
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:32,207
You bring Orlando back?

647
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:33,416
So what?

648
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,002
- You lied to me?
- He needs the work.

649
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,671
You remember what
happened last time.

650
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:39,188
When he's on...

651
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:42,008
- he brings in the customers so good.
- Bullshit.

652
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,718
The girls bring in the customers.

653
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,264
- I bring in the customers.
- Shut your mouth down and listen to me.

654
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:51,809
You forget who is the boss here.

655
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:53,436
Yes, ma'am.

656
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,521
He stays.

657
00:55:55,815 --> 00:55:57,565
Let's go.

658
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:02,195
Bruno!

659
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:04,029
Emil.

660
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,784
Hey. Well, well, well.

661
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:12,080
- It's nice to see family. How are you?
- Doing all right.

662
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:15,667
Yeah. I guess you heard the
took me back at Ellis Island.

663
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:17,294
Congratulations.

664
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:19,462
I'm doing really good
over there, too.

665
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:24,049
And I can't tell you how excited I am
to be working with you again tonight.

666
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:26,760
It's gonna to be
just like old times.

667
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,181
Well. That's what
I'm worried about.

668
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:30,724
No, no, no. I won't let you down.

669
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:34,311
Well, that means no more
gambling, and no more drinking.

670
00:56:34,312 --> 00:56:36,813
Absolutely. I'm just glad
for this opportunity.

671
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:38,898
And I just wanna to thank you.

672
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:41,443
- All right.
- Thank you, sir.

673
00:56:41,444 --> 00:56:43,777
I sincerely hope so.

674
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:46,907
Hey, hi.

675
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:51,703
This is my show. So, as
long as you're on time,

676
00:56:51,704 --> 00:56:54,122
professional. I don't foresee
us having a problem.

677
00:56:54,123 --> 00:56:55,916
Of course, of course.

678
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:57,667
I know her.

679
00:56:57,668 --> 00:57:01,837
- Hey, don't I know you from Ellis Island?
- Good luck tonight.

680
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:13,808
Thank you, thank you.
And to the band, thank you.

681
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:15,727
Our mini orchestra.

682
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:18,980
Now in honor of my return
to the Bandit's Roost,

683
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:21,608
I will perform my most
famous mystification.

684
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:23,818
Which I have done
for Crown Princes,

685
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:27,113
and heads of state,
all over the world.

686
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:31,534
This will be an act of mind reading.
I will know your dreams.

687
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:35,120
Look, we already
sold all the liquor.

688
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:40,209
Yeah, I can tell from the crowd.
But it doesn't mean they like him.

689
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:43,838
Before I get started, I need
to find a suitable subject

690
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,006
from the audience.

691
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:49,051
Who will it be?

692
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:53,139
Well, as much as I find
all you men appealing.

693
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,725
I think I've found a more
suitable subject back here.

694
00:57:57,603 --> 00:58:00,854
- Please come with me.
- No, no, no.

695
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,950
The "Mind Reading."

696
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:17,663
So, what is your name young lady?

697
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:18,832
Ewa.

698
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,625
That's Lady Liberty.

699
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:23,168
She goes dog fashion
for two dollars.

700
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:28,049
You can sit on my
torch, Lady Liberty.

701
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:32,345
Ewa. And were are you from, Ewa?

702
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:34,722
From Katowice.

703
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:39,643
So, what do you want
here, in America?

704
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:42,355
I want to be happy.

705
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:43,189
To be happy.

706
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,734
I made you happy last
night, you cheap whore!

707
00:58:49,447 --> 00:58:51,864
She's Bruno's best!

708
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:56,953
Don't listen to anything they
say, okay? They're just drunk.

709
00:58:56,954 --> 00:59:01,123
Hey Bruno! I'll give you
a dollar for the bitch.

710
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:03,710
Get down here you whore!

711
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,421
I'll fuck you, and then
I'll cut your tits off!

712
00:59:06,422 --> 00:59:11,300
Sir, you shut your mouth! Or I'll
punch another hole in your face!

713
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:17,098
Okay, we'll get you off.

714
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:20,435
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be right
back for my greatest illusion,

715
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:23,021
"The Hindu Coffin"
in a few moments.

716
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:27,775
But first the sensual stylings
of Bruno and his doves.

717
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:37,702
Are you all right?

718
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,288
Bruno, I apologize. I'm sorry.

719
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:42,040
You embarrass her? To get at me?

720
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:45,251
- What are you taking about?
- You know exactly what you did!

721
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,003
Stay away from my girls!

722
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:49,671
Hey, at least I warmed
them up for you.

723
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:55,053
And that was Emil the
magician, forgive me,

724
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:57,555
"Orlando the Magician."

725
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:00,934
I didn't know he was supposed
to make himself disappear.

726
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:03,060
Ewa.

727
01:00:04,397 --> 01:00:06,397
Hey, are you all right?

728
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:09,234
You disgrace me.

729
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:10,402
What's that?

730
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:11,694
You make fun of me.

731
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:15,824
No, no. I wasn't making fun
of you. It was just the act.

732
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:18,660
Miss Egypt! All the mysteries

733
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:23,164
of the great pyramids will be
revealed before your very eyes!

734
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:28,460
All right, all right! This
modern day Cleopatra.

735
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:34,551
Lady Liberty!

736
01:00:34,552 --> 01:00:38,930
Lady Liberty welcomes
you with open arms.

737
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,349
Where the fuck is Lady Liberty?

738
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,601
Destroying our pace again,
because that's always a...

739
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:45,602
Don't touch her!

740
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:50,065
What is your problem?

741
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:56,865
Bruno, what's wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

742
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:58,949
Keep away from her!

743
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:01,161
Oh my God!

744
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:04,288
- It's Bruno, he's gone mad!
- Stop it! Stop it!

745
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,832
I told you!

746
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,668
Where do you think
you are going, bitch?

747
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:21,722
What have you done?

748
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:24,601
- Me? What are you talking about?
- I talk to you!

749
01:01:24,602 --> 01:01:26,728
You don't know what
you're talking about.

750
01:01:26,729 --> 01:01:28,646
- Fuck you, Rosie!
- Next time I fire you!

751
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,316
You fire me? I quit! I quit!

752
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:33,443
- Go! Go! Go! Leave us!
- You don't know what you're doing.

753
01:01:33,444 --> 01:01:36,154
- Yes I do! We don't need her!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

754
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:41,366
- I can't take it any more. He's crazy!
- Yeah! When I think of you Rosie.

755
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,704
You lost us this place?

756
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:47,790
- We'll find someplace else.
- This is how we make money.

757
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,834
What are you guys doing?
Let's move! Move!

758
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:51,961
Where are we going? It's winter!

759
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:54,464
I don't know, we'll go uptown

760
01:01:54,465 --> 01:01:56,966
I need that money!
You lose your temper.

761
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:59,427
You fight this man. For what?
You're so stupid!

762
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:01,846
I'm stupid? Did you see
what happened out there?

763
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:02,889
He insulted you!

764
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,058
And I'm the one trying
to protect you from him!

765
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:07,810
All right, enough. How are we
going to fit this in the trunk?

766
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:10,772
Are you thinking? I got
to think of everything?

767
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:14,317
I come up with the routines.
I'm moving everything! Let's go.

768
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:17,028
Out, out, out, out.
Before the cops come!

769
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:18,488
Where do we go?

770
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:20,155
Out!

771
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:30,333
After last night, even this think
should be more hospitable.

772
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:33,962
Are you kidding? What is this?

773
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:36,130
See through there? It's is
the men's boarding houses.

774
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,924
It's nothing but men, everywhere.

775
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:41,176
And I got a new material
to match the costumes.

776
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:46,056
These men, have nothing.

777
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:49,185
It's just temporary,
I'll find us a place.

778
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:51,478
Good morning, gentlemen.

779
01:02:52,398 --> 01:02:54,774
All right, sit here.

780
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:56,401
When I point to you, blankets off,

781
01:02:56,402 --> 01:02:59,361
get up, walk around.
You know what to do. Okay?

782
01:03:00,114 --> 01:03:03,324
Gentlemen, today is your lucky day.

783
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,993
May I direct your attention

784
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:09,163
to the daughters of the finest
families in New York society.

785
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:12,584
I give you the Astor family's
wayward little girl.

786
01:03:12,585 --> 01:03:15,587
Her father told her
to go get a job.

787
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:18,006
Or will it be the child
of Mister Frick?

788
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:19,966
She was brought here
directly by her chauffeur,

789
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,092
in the lap of luxury.

790
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:25,763
J.P. Morgan's prized...

791
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:31,143
progeny... she grew up with servants
and now she will serve you.

792
01:03:33,606 --> 01:03:36,816
Walk around, go up, show yourself.

793
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:40,652
Please speak directly to me.
Do not touch the ladies.

794
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:48,660
Ma'am, I'd like you to show me around
the neighborhood, if you would.

795
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:51,163
You talk to him.

796
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:03,383
How old are you?

797
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,677
I'm fifteen.

798
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:06,846
You have no sickness?

799
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,722
No ma'am.

800
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:13,185
Let me see.

801
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,776
What are you doing?

802
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,947
You don't bring... you
don't bring any friends.

803
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,784
Is she here? Did you
give him all the money?

804
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:30,203
- Yes sir.
- You sure? You didn't keep any for yourself?

805
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:31,663
No, I paid him all the money.

806
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:35,916
Okay, here. Take it,
get out of here.

807
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:46,927
Hello, ma'am.

808
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,929
Hello.

809
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:52,182
I hope you didn't mind that I came.

810
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:56,062
If you're worried, there's a
bunch of cops downstairs.

811
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,939
They're getting a shoe shine.

812
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,566
So if you like you can scream,
they'll come right up.

813
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,985
Take me away.

814
01:05:05,114 --> 01:05:07,823
What do you want from me?

815
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:11,159
Well, I wanted to see you.

816
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:16,581
And I wanted to apologize for
bringing you on stage last night.

817
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,669
Those guys were animals.

818
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:29,762
- I know you judge me.
- Judge you?

819
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:34,349
No, I don't judge anybody.

820
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:40,480
And believe me, I have my
own problems a mile long.

821
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:45,819
Well, I should be going.

822
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:51,575
You work at Ellis Island.

823
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:55,121
Well, yeah. Sometimes.

824
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:57,790
Are you important there?

825
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:00,208
Me? No.

826
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:03,713
Bruno though, he's the
one with the pull.

827
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:05,213
Oh.

828
01:06:05,466 --> 01:06:09,301
He got me the job there.
A long time ago.

829
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:14,055
It's so strange.

830
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:19,479
It's a lot smaller than I
remembered; this place.

831
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,980
You've been here before?

832
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,400
Yeah.

833
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,027
He's my cousin.

834
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:27,945
If you can believe it.

835
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:31,300
Our families came over
here on a boat together.

836
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,284
We grew up here.

837
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,497
Bruno and me used to be close.

838
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:39,998
But then he changed.

839
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:43,336
I'm curious.

840
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:46,630
How is it that you ended up
working with him, anyway?

841
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,675
He brought me here.

842
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:53,721
They wanted to send me back. But..

843
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:57,057
He made it so I could stay.

844
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:05,148
My family here, they
don't want me. So.

845
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:09,986
Wow... I'm sorry about your family.

846
01:07:12,282 --> 01:07:17,537
Listen. I've seen a lot of
girls in your situation.

847
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:22,123
And let me tell you, it does
not matter what you do.

848
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,003
My mother used to always tell me,

849
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:30,382
"God's eye is on every sparrow."

850
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:34,262
You got a right to be happy, Ewa.

851
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,555
At least that's what I think.

852
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,519
It's cold out here, Bruno.

853
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:46,731
I don't believe it. That
fucking kid skinned me.

854
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:48,733
Wait here!

855
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:06,877
Eagerness to...

856
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,797
Oh, hey Bruno.

857
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,092
Emil?

858
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:15,302
I'm glad you're here.

859
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:25,479
Did you know about this?

860
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,522
No.

861
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:30,650
He paid the money.

862
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:33,528
I don't want his money.

863
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:36,740
Since when don't you
want money, Bruno?

864
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:42,500
Ewa, will you please
excuse us for a moment.

865
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:45,458
Close the door.

866
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:47,543
We're just going to
have a conversation.

867
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:49,712
Between gentlemen.

868
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,922
Yes.

869
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:59,220
All right, let's
talk like gentlemen.

870
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:19,742
You do not take her. Ever.

871
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:24,497
Oh, let me guess.
You're falling for her.

872
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:29,918
Well first, selling her on the street is
probably the wrong sentiment to send.

873
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,380
Bruno?

874
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:34,674
What? What are you doing?

875
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:37,258
Put that away.

876
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:46,017
Help! Help!

877
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,728
Stop!

878
01:09:54,903 --> 01:10:00,107
Help! Help!

879
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:06,288
Hey!

880
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:07,415
- Get the knife!
- He came into my home

881
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,000
and he attacked me!

882
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:10,501
- Take him in!
- Up against the wall!

883
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:11,794
Piece of shit!

884
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,254
Shut your mouth!

885
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,256
You're lucky your kike teeth
ain't all over the floor.

886
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:16,549
- Yes sir.
- Let's go.

887
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,510
- Are you satisfied?
- You too! Come on!

888
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:25,890
All right, all right. Let me
get my coat, and my scarf.

889
01:10:27,894 --> 01:10:30,437
- Here we go again, Bruno.
- Shut your mouth!

890
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:56,504
- Hello.
- Hello.

891
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:06,389
They're going to keep
him till tomorrow.

892
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:11,061
They let the pretty boy go
because Bruno had the knife.

893
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:17,233
Let's hope he don't get killed.

894
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,155
Bruno takes care of himself.

895
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:23,199
He will be well.

896
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,742
What if he's not?

897
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:30,330
I need him to take care of us.

898
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:33,333
I don't need him.

899
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:38,254
You don't need him?

900
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:43,177
Yes?

901
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:46,930
You know all the men in New York?

902
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:50,767
You know the ones with money
from the ones that beat you?

903
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:56,940
All I know is, we never
had no problems before.

904
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,819
And then you show up.

905
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,154
It was because of you
they were fighting.

906
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,865
And now we are out of work.

907
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:07,576
And we might have to
take it out of your cut.

908
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:10,412
You don't take my money.

909
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:12,206
Ever.

910
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:16,836
You make your money the
same way I make my money,

911
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:18,629
and you're not better than me.

912
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,881
At least I don't kiss
the feet of the man who

913
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:23,883
makes me feel like
a piece of trash.

914
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:59,002
Hello.

915
01:13:01,339 --> 01:13:03,006
Hi.

916
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:07,928
Is this yours?

917
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:10,305
Oh, yeah.

918
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:16,187
I... I thought I left this behind.

919
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:19,607
It's a... sort of
my good luck charm.

920
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,608
Sort of.

921
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:25,196
Time to pack it up,
Orlando. Come on.

922
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:28,448
Isn't it getting late?

923
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,576
Should you be walking here alone?

924
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:33,119
It's not the first time.

925
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,541
So...

926
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:41,628
- You're leaving?
- Yes, I am leaving.

927
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:45,506
I'm going on a tour across America.

928
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:48,009
Which is exciting.

929
01:13:49,095 --> 01:13:51,889
Speaking of which, actually,

930
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:56,184
I wanna to show you
something. Come here.

931
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:58,853
Here it is.

932
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:02,149
This...

933
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,817
That's where I'm going.

934
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:07,570
That is California.

935
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:10,031
It's out west.

936
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,576
The sun is always shining there.

937
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:15,663
It's beautiful.

938
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,872
Yes it is.

939
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:23,920
Hey, you should come with us.

940
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:27,173
If you want.

941
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:32,178
What do you think?
You could be my assistant.

942
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:34,014
We'll put you in a nice outfit.

943
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:35,349
And you can watch me

944
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:39,102
make a fool of myself every night.

945
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,690
No. No, I can't.

946
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:46,192
My sister is here on Ellis Island.

947
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:50,614
- Your sister?
- Yes. She's sick.

948
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:54,617
I send money for her care.

949
01:14:55,745 --> 01:14:57,829
I see.

950
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:01,125
You want to see a picture of her?

951
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:02,792
Yeah, sure.

952
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,962
That's her.

953
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:11,175
- I always keep her with me.
- Yeah...

954
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:17,807
She deserves to be happy.

955
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,186
- Yes, she does.
- Yes.

956
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:28,901
Well, you be careful. Okay?

957
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:34,366
You know, I've known
Bruno my whole life.

958
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:38,953
And I think he may
be in love with you.

959
01:15:39,914 --> 01:15:42,333
Which is making him a
little mad upstairs.

960
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,543
If you know what I mean.

961
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:48,629
I don't think Bruno loves anyone.

962
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:51,341
But I need him.

963
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:55,261
He's the only one who can help me.

964
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:59,807
You know what?

965
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,604
I want you to have this.

966
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:09,025
It will bring you luck.

967
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,652
And it looks good on you, too.

968
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:15,490
Thank you very much.

969
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:18,409
Goodbye.

970
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,630
Come back for more, huh?

971
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:16,677
Didn't the girls tell you to
stay away from this place?

972
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:19,429
With all the cops around.

973
01:17:19,472 --> 01:17:21,764
Come on.

974
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:26,603
It means a lot to me that
you're here. I appreciate it.

975
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:28,522
We need more firewood, Bruno.

976
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:32,109
- Huh?
- We need wood, for the stove, it's cold.

977
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:36,404
All right, I won't let you
get cold. Come here.

978
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,450
After you.

979
01:17:42,787 --> 01:17:47,457
Do me a favor, would you grab
a rag and oil in the corner.

980
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:05,975
Thank you.

981
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:08,145
Don't be frightened.

982
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:10,813
It's for our protection.

983
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,358
I'm tired of being kicked around.

984
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:15,068
I'm sick of it.

985
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:17,654
Family protects.

986
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:20,073
Emil comes around...

987
01:18:20,074 --> 01:18:22,116
Orlando...

988
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:25,870
He's gone. He won't come back.

989
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:29,081
He always comes back.

990
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:32,961
I'm telling you, you gotta
stay away from him.

991
01:18:32,962 --> 01:18:36,548
- He's harmless.
- Ewa, you don't know.

992
01:18:36,549 --> 01:18:39,092
I had a girl once.

993
01:18:39,093 --> 01:18:43,596
Clean. Elegant. I liked her.

994
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:47,141
I didn't want her
to know what I did.

995
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,895
I didn't bring her
around to the theater.

996
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:54,941
But he brought her down
there, Because he knew.

997
01:18:55,902 --> 01:18:59,530
And she broke it off with me,
and she ran off with him.

998
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:03,074
My own cousin... and
that's how he treats me.

999
01:19:03,701 --> 01:19:07,245
All right, excuse me.

1000
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:10,122
Go on!

1001
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:18,214
Ewa.

1002
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,926
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Maybe we can go to Matinee.

1003
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:21,885
Just me and you.

1004
01:19:21,886 --> 01:19:24,763
- Tomorrow I go to church.
- What?

1005
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:28,474
Tomorrow I go to church.
It's Candlemas.

1006
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:34,021
That's fine. Just stay
away from Orlando.

1007
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:10,642
Let us pray.

1008
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:13,436
Lord God, forgive me

1009
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:16,607
Mary Mother of God,

1010
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:23,571
Protect the souls of my
mother and my father.

1011
01:20:24,073 --> 01:20:26,450
Mary Mother of God,

1012
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:31,829
Please protect my sister.

1013
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,042
In the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

1014
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:38,794
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1015
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:03,319
Amen.

1016
01:21:30,765 --> 01:21:34,309
My child in English please,
I'm Polish only by descent.

1017
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:35,727
Yes.

1018
01:21:35,728 --> 01:21:39,897
My last confession
was a long time ago.

1019
01:21:40,483 --> 01:21:44,611
I have many, many sins.

1020
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,654
Go on.

1021
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:49,156
I lie.

1022
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:54,578
I steal food.

1023
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:58,457
I tried to steal money.

1024
01:21:58,876 --> 01:22:02,169
How did you come to this, child?

1025
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,551
On the ship here,

1026
01:22:09,345 --> 01:22:12,430
there is no food

1027
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:15,099
and no room.

1028
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:19,395
It is very dirty.

1029
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:25,151
We are all together, like animals.

1030
01:22:26,487 --> 01:22:30,156
And these men, they
forced themselves on me.

1031
01:22:30,908 --> 01:22:36,454
And for this, they say I
am a woman of low morals.

1032
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:41,793
My sister, she's sick.

1033
01:22:41,794 --> 01:22:45,254
And this man comes

1034
01:22:45,673 --> 01:22:50,760
and he promises to help
me with my sister.

1035
01:22:50,928 --> 01:22:53,220
So...

1036
01:22:55,266 --> 01:22:58,601
I use my body

1037
01:22:58,978 --> 01:23:00,978
for money.

1038
01:23:03,232 --> 01:23:08,944
I...I let him use me.

1039
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:17,787
And I stay with him.

1040
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:20,498
And I'm ashamed.

1041
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:24,336
God punishes you for
your sins, my child.

1042
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:27,004
I know. I know.

1043
01:23:28,299 --> 01:23:33,260
I know I do not go to heaven.

1044
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:39,017
My child, does the shepherd
not rejoice even more

1045
01:23:39,018 --> 01:23:42,145
when the lost lamb
returns to the fold?

1046
01:23:42,146 --> 01:23:45,481
All souls can be saved.

1047
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:49,777
You must continue to have
faith in your own salvation.

1048
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:54,156
But you must find a way
to leave that man.

1049
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:06,043
So maybe I go to Hell.

1050
01:24:40,496 --> 01:24:42,371
Hi.

1051
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:45,750
Is Bruno here?

1052
01:24:45,751 --> 01:24:47,168
No.

1053
01:24:47,169 --> 01:24:48,086
Hi.

1054
01:24:48,087 --> 01:24:50,088
What are you doing here?

1055
01:24:50,089 --> 01:24:52,715
I thought you had left.

1056
01:24:57,096 --> 01:24:59,013
Well, I'm back.

1057
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,683
What happened?

1058
01:25:01,684 --> 01:25:03,143
Good things.

1059
01:25:03,144 --> 01:25:05,228
So I was on tour,

1060
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:08,648
and made as far as New Jersey.

1061
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:11,401
I got into a disagreement
with the promoters

1062
01:25:11,402 --> 01:25:16,030
and couldn't come to terms.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

1063
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:18,950
I wanted to see you.

1064
01:25:18,951 --> 01:25:23,078
And I had to see you. To share
the most magnificent news.

1065
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:29,044
You should go.
Bruno is at his lawyer.

1066
01:25:29,045 --> 01:25:32,672
- But he will come back very soon.
- Don't worry, don't worry about Bruno.

1067
01:25:32,673 --> 01:25:34,840
Yes, you should go.

1068
01:25:35,134 --> 01:25:37,593
He has a gun.

1069
01:25:38,763 --> 01:25:41,263
- A gun?
- Yes.

1070
01:25:41,807 --> 01:25:44,601
Ewa, we have to get rid of it.

1071
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:47,103
He's not thinking straight.

1072
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:49,480
Where is it?

1073
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:54,318
Under the night table.

1074
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:12,670
This breeds nothing but sorrow.

1075
01:26:15,841 --> 01:26:20,178
All right, so listen.
I fell on some luck.

1076
01:26:20,179 --> 01:26:24,057
I won playing cards on the
train, and again last night.

1077
01:26:24,058 --> 01:26:27,434
So I have some money
coming to me, a lot of it.

1078
01:26:29,605 --> 01:26:31,648
I'm gonna help you get your sister.

1079
01:26:31,649 --> 01:26:35,150
And maybe we can all go out west?

1080
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:37,988
Yes.

1081
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:40,406
That's very kind.

1082
01:26:43,244 --> 01:26:45,744
You don't believe me.

1083
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:51,584
We can talk tomorrow.

1084
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:54,962
- Where will you be?
- I'll come find you.

1085
01:27:17,945 --> 01:27:21,363
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

1086
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:27,704
Tell them to bring it up all
the way next time to my place.

1087
01:27:27,705 --> 01:27:29,831
They're getting lazy.

1088
01:27:29,832 --> 01:27:31,957
Go. Go.

1089
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:42,718
- Hello.
- Hello.

1090
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,345
I was thinking about you.

1091
01:27:45,723 --> 01:27:50,392
Ewa, I know I've given you
every reason to distrust me.

1092
01:27:50,686 --> 01:27:53,645
And I have regrets.

1093
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,983
But I'm going to go tomorrow
morning to Ellis Island

1094
01:27:56,984 --> 01:28:00,236
and get you a visitors
pass to see your sister.

1095
01:28:00,237 --> 01:28:04,324
My contacts there tell me
she's recovering quite well.

1096
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:09,703
And maybe you can see her
with greater frequency.

1097
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,124
Bruno.

1098
01:28:17,713 --> 01:28:20,339
I'm sorry, Ewa.

1099
01:28:20,883 --> 01:28:25,970
I couldn't leave. Not without
teaching him a little lesson.

1100
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:29,557
Ewa... You are with him?

1101
01:28:29,558 --> 01:28:34,020
He said he can help me with
my sister. He has money.

1102
01:28:34,021 --> 01:28:36,980
He couldn't possibly
have that much money.

1103
01:28:37,608 --> 01:28:40,151
What are you thinking?
I'm the one with the connections.

1104
01:28:40,152 --> 01:28:44,154
Yeah, well things
have changed, Bruno.

1105
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:48,284
Ewa. You have known
him for a few days.

1106
01:28:48,285 --> 01:28:52,664
Do you think he is going to help you?
He is going to give you money?

1107
01:28:52,665 --> 01:28:54,499
Ewa...

1108
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,542
No.

1109
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:56,876
- Don't please. Don't do this.
- It's okay.

1110
01:28:56,877 --> 01:28:58,378
- It's okay.
- No, put it down.

1111
01:28:58,379 --> 01:28:59,420
He needs to hear this.

1112
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:02,131
- You don't have to. Please.
- Bruno.

1113
01:29:02,591 --> 01:29:06,969
I want you to tell Ewa
that she's free to go now.

1114
01:29:07,179 --> 01:29:09,556
You have never been a prisoner.

1115
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:12,767
You understand? Listen to me.
That's all you have to say to her.

1116
01:29:12,768 --> 01:29:14,601
Come on.

1117
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:19,732
It's okay. Come on, you can say it.

1118
01:29:19,733 --> 01:29:22,152
Come on. Tell her she's free to go.

1119
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:24,903
Tell her she's free to go.

1120
01:29:25,322 --> 01:29:28,408
That's all you have to say.
And we'll both be gone.

1121
01:29:28,409 --> 01:29:30,160
I thought I was helping you.

1122
01:29:30,161 --> 01:29:31,911
Just say, "Ewa,

1123
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:34,956
you're free to go." And you'll
never see my face again.

1124
01:29:34,957 --> 01:29:36,748
I'll vanish.

1125
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:39,419
- One, two...
- I was hoping...

1126
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,670
Aah! It's empty.

1127
01:30:03,652 --> 01:30:05,694
What did you do?

1128
01:30:08,365 --> 01:30:10,199
Why?

1129
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:11,826
What did you do?

1130
01:30:11,827 --> 01:30:14,078
He was going to kill me.

1131
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:16,705
Ewa, it's a trick.

1132
01:30:16,957 --> 01:30:19,667
- It is a trick. Do you understand?
- What did you do?

1133
01:30:19,668 --> 01:30:21,794
Emil, get up!

1134
01:30:21,795 --> 01:30:25,714
How horrible. How horrible.

1135
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,718
Emil.

1136
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,261
Oh God.

1137
01:30:32,681 --> 01:30:34,681
Stay back.

1138
01:30:34,892 --> 01:30:38,436
No, no. Don't move him.

1139
01:30:38,437 --> 01:30:40,730
Emil...

1140
01:30:40,731 --> 01:30:43,358
- I'm sorry.
- Stay back.

1141
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,444
This is my fault. This is my fault.

1142
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:51,366
I told him about the gun.

1143
01:30:51,367 --> 01:30:54,994
- I told him where it was.
- No. No. It was an accident.

1144
01:30:54,995 --> 01:30:58,998
Listen to me. If you get mixed up
in this, you'll never get out.

1145
01:30:58,999 --> 01:31:00,708
You'll never get free.
You understand?

1146
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:03,002
So I take care of this.
You go in the back.

1147
01:31:03,003 --> 01:31:06,255
You go back, you hide. Don't
answer the door for anybody.

1148
01:31:33,075 --> 01:31:38,370
Ewa, what are you doing?
Go back. Go back inside.

1149
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:44,376
Go back.

1150
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:11,528
Please, don't put him
with the trash. No.

1151
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:14,824
We have to act like nothing's wrong.
Like nothing happened.

1152
01:32:14,825 --> 01:32:18,285
Okay? All right?

1153
01:32:25,502 --> 01:32:27,377
Gentlemen.

1154
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:33,259
These are the daughters of the
most famous New York society.

1155
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:37,180
I give you the Astor family's
wayward little girl.

1156
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:40,391
Her father told her to get a job.

1157
01:32:40,392 --> 01:32:44,187
Or will it be the
daughter of Mister Frick?

1158
01:32:44,188 --> 01:32:46,814
He told her too, to get a job.

1159
01:32:46,815 --> 01:32:51,110
Now may I please present
heiress to Vanderbilt fortune.

1160
01:32:51,111 --> 01:32:54,364
Driven by her own chauffeur.

1161
01:32:54,365 --> 01:32:56,657
She arrived in the lap of luxury.

1162
01:32:56,658 --> 01:32:58,799
What's the matter, honey?
You don't feel well?

1163
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,496
- Ewa. Can you stand up?
- No.

1164
01:33:01,497 --> 01:33:02,830
- All right, you... up, up.
- I'm not ready.

1165
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:03,873
They are ready.

1166
01:33:03,874 --> 01:33:07,585
J.P. Morgan's prized progeny.

1167
01:33:07,586 --> 01:33:09,700
What is it?

1168
01:33:11,632 --> 01:33:14,925
Freeze! Police! Stop right there!

1169
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:17,219
There she is!

1170
01:33:17,846 --> 01:33:21,306
Stop that fucking whore. Come on!

1171
01:33:21,392 --> 01:33:23,350
Get that polack bitch!

1172
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,800
Come on.

1173
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,100
Come on.

1174
01:33:47,668 --> 01:33:50,877
Open, you fucking thing! Open!

1175
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,804
- I'm too slow. Leave me behind.
- No.

1176
01:34:05,727 --> 01:34:07,394
Split up!

1177
01:34:23,579 --> 01:34:26,955
- I can't.
- No, keep running!

1178
01:34:30,502 --> 01:34:32,837
Run! Run! Run!

1179
01:34:32,838 --> 01:34:34,838
You! Halt!

1180
01:34:37,885 --> 01:34:39,676
Whoa!

1181
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:44,265
Hold on. We ain't after
you, we're after her.

1182
01:34:44,266 --> 01:34:47,018
That crazy Polack bitch
killed him. Didn't she?

1183
01:34:47,019 --> 01:34:49,103
- What are you talking about?
- You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1184
01:34:49,104 --> 01:34:51,397
- No, I don't know what you're talking about.
- We have a witness.

1185
01:34:51,398 --> 01:34:51,939
Witness?

1186
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:55,817
One of your own whores is
talking you dumb kike.

1187
01:34:55,819 --> 01:34:57,944
Where is she, huh?

1188
01:35:03,952 --> 01:35:08,497
Where is she? You
tell us where she is!

1189
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:11,124
Where is she?

1190
01:35:15,464 --> 01:35:17,548
You're not going to talk, are you?

1191
01:35:17,549 --> 01:35:19,425
You got any money?

1192
01:35:19,426 --> 01:35:21,469
Let's see what he's got on him.

1193
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:24,513
His kind don't keep it in
the bank. That's for sure.

1194
01:35:25,891 --> 01:35:27,975
Oh, that looks interesting.

1195
01:35:27,976 --> 01:35:31,437
Looks like a grand. At least
you made it worth our while.

1196
01:35:31,438 --> 01:35:33,689
You bring her to us tomorrow
on a silver platter

1197
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:36,067
or it's your hide we're coming for.

1198
01:35:36,068 --> 01:35:39,611
Come on, let's get out of here.
He knows where to find us.

1199
01:36:14,565 --> 01:36:17,817
You have to leave.
They're looking for you.

1200
01:36:17,818 --> 01:36:21,820
Drink. It is opium, it's for pain.

1201
01:36:23,949 --> 01:36:25,949
Thank you.

1202
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:30,371
You must leave.

1203
01:36:30,372 --> 01:36:31,956
I know.

1204
01:36:31,957 --> 01:36:33,540
Go.

1205
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:38,003
I won't leave without my sister.

1206
01:36:40,799 --> 01:36:44,175
Bruno. Please.

1207
01:36:46,638 --> 01:36:49,347
If you have money...

1208
01:36:50,809 --> 01:36:55,520
I had the money for your sister.

1209
01:36:57,566 --> 01:37:00,900
But I didn't want you to leave me.

1210
01:37:01,695 --> 01:37:05,905
But now the cops took it.
They stole it from me.

1211
01:37:07,909 --> 01:37:11,369
So I can't help you.

1212
01:37:12,247 --> 01:37:16,041
And now I don't know
what you can do.

1213
01:37:16,043 --> 01:37:19,127
Maybe I can get some.

1214
01:37:19,838 --> 01:37:22,923
But God will have to help me.

1215
01:37:22,924 --> 01:37:28,470
It's too much. You forget.

1216
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:33,559
I will get it.

1217
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,102
Stop. Stop.

1218
01:37:36,605 --> 01:37:41,817
If you can, meet me in the
Ox Tail, and then pack.

1219
01:37:41,818 --> 01:37:44,319
I'll wait for you.

1220
01:37:44,905 --> 01:37:47,239
Be careful.

1221
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,449
Be careful.

1222
01:38:25,404 --> 01:38:28,280
Wojtek is at home. He's sleeping.

1223
01:38:28,281 --> 01:38:32,326
Auntie, please. I have to talk
to you. I need your help.

1224
01:38:32,327 --> 01:38:35,995
Please, Auntie. I beg you.

1225
01:38:55,225 --> 01:38:58,226
This is so very difficult
for me to say.

1226
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:06,192
Last Sunday I went to church.

1227
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:09,529
For the first time in a long time.

1228
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:14,743
I prayed to Mary.

1229
01:39:18,665 --> 01:39:22,292
I have gone through so many trials.

1230
01:39:23,795 --> 01:39:27,380
Has it become a sin for me
to try so hard to survive?

1231
01:39:35,432 --> 01:39:37,849
Auntie...

1232
01:39:42,314 --> 01:39:44,023
Is it a sin to want to survive,

1233
01:39:44,024 --> 01:39:47,484
when I have done many bad things?

1234
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:58,203
Your uncle is a proud man.

1235
01:39:59,247 --> 01:40:02,165
I cannot change that.

1236
01:40:03,668 --> 01:40:05,668
I know.

1237
01:40:07,881 --> 01:40:11,008
I know uncle has rejected me.

1238
01:40:11,009 --> 01:40:14,511
But I ask you... Auntie...

1239
01:40:15,263 --> 01:40:20,266
to believe that I can be saved.

1240
01:40:24,064 --> 01:40:25,397
God has sent me

1241
01:40:25,398 --> 01:40:28,983
to someone so very lost,

1242
01:40:29,569 --> 01:40:36,032
someone who made my life a sin.

1243
01:40:36,034 --> 01:40:37,992
And now,

1244
01:40:40,121 --> 01:40:43,498
This person suffers for me.

1245
01:40:45,502 --> 01:40:49,254
So I am learning the
power of forgiveness.

1246
01:40:52,259 --> 01:40:54,384
Auntie...

1247
01:40:55,136 --> 01:40:57,900
I need money...

1248
01:40:58,598 --> 01:41:00,950
for Magda.

1249
01:41:01,768 --> 01:41:04,300
It is a lot of money.

1250
01:41:06,481 --> 01:41:11,442
But we will never come back again.

1251
01:41:13,738 --> 01:41:17,198
Auntie, will you help me?

1252
01:41:20,036 --> 01:41:22,912
Can you not forgive me?

1253
01:42:58,343 --> 01:43:01,512
You know Bruno, I stuck my neck
out very far for you here.

1254
01:43:01,513 --> 01:43:03,263
Did a lot of favors.

1255
01:43:03,264 --> 01:43:06,475
So you know, from now on, you
and me, we got to be strangers.

1256
01:43:06,476 --> 01:43:11,021
I mean it. I see you around town,
I'm walking the other way.

1257
01:43:11,022 --> 01:43:13,691
Let's go. Come on,
before they see us.

1258
01:43:13,692 --> 01:43:15,608
Quickly.

1259
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:33,168
You stay here.

1260
01:43:33,169 --> 01:43:37,296
I'm going to go sign your sister out.
It may take a couple of minuets.

1261
01:43:58,069 --> 01:44:01,654
I better keep drinking this opium.

1262
01:44:06,703 --> 01:44:09,829
It feels like my jaw is broken.

1263
01:44:10,165 --> 01:44:12,665
It's not hanging straight.

1264
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,335
The tickets.

1265
01:44:15,336 --> 01:44:19,131
You can get on a boat and
go across to Jersey.

1266
01:44:19,132 --> 01:44:20,424
And get on a train.

1267
01:44:20,425 --> 01:44:22,949
It goes through Pittsburgh,
and goes to California,

1268
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:26,221
And go out there and
you'll start a new life.

1269
01:44:26,222 --> 01:44:28,222
You understand?

1270
01:44:45,992 --> 01:44:47,910
You don't come?

1271
01:44:47,911 --> 01:44:50,495
No, I don't come.

1272
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:54,416
If I go, they'll be looking
for us the rest of our lives,

1273
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:57,085
you and your sister
will never get settled.

1274
01:44:58,088 --> 01:45:00,880
You'll wind up dead or in jail.

1275
01:45:01,216 --> 01:45:03,591
But what do you do here?

1276
01:45:04,761 --> 01:45:07,011
They blame you.

1277
01:45:07,806 --> 01:45:11,057
They say you kill him by yourself.

1278
01:45:11,559 --> 01:45:14,352
Well, I did. Didn't I?

1279
01:45:16,397 --> 01:45:21,025
Yes, I did. And I will confess.

1280
01:45:22,529 --> 01:45:26,781
You get everything you need
and you go with that train.

1281
01:45:27,325 --> 01:45:30,577
And you get your sister back.

1282
01:45:30,578 --> 01:45:34,831
- You did it. You saved her.
- Yes.

1283
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:39,752
I thank you.

1284
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,715
Thank me?

1285
01:45:45,593 --> 01:45:47,593
For what?

1286
01:45:48,513 --> 01:45:51,180
I picked you.

1287
01:45:51,516 --> 01:45:53,267
I found out that you
were on that boat.

1288
01:45:53,268 --> 01:45:56,144
And I knew you were perfect for me.

1289
01:45:57,438 --> 01:46:02,024
When you first got here, I told that
guy to pull you out of the line.

1290
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:05,695
I paid him.

1291
01:46:06,656 --> 01:46:10,200
I fixed it so your uncle left
and you didn't have anybody.

1292
01:46:10,201 --> 01:46:12,369
And yeah, I fell in
love with you, Ewa.

1293
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:16,915
And it couldn't stop me from using
you like I did all the others.

1294
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:21,295
And you hate me. I don't
blame for hating you me.

1295
01:46:21,296 --> 01:46:23,130
Until now I never
killed nobody before.

1296
01:46:23,131 --> 01:46:25,340
But it don't make a difference.

1297
01:46:25,341 --> 01:46:26,884
Because if you could lick my heart

1298
01:46:26,885 --> 01:46:30,219
you'd taste nothing but poison.

1299
01:46:31,055 --> 01:46:33,557
See, you think there is
goodness in everybody.

1300
01:46:33,558 --> 01:46:36,894
But there isn't.

1301
01:46:36,895 --> 01:46:41,815
So you go. And you forget about me.

1302
01:46:41,816 --> 01:46:43,984
And you forget about this place.

1303
01:46:43,985 --> 01:46:47,154
And you forget about those
things that I made you do!

1304
01:46:47,155 --> 01:46:48,864
Because I took everything from you!

1305
01:46:48,865 --> 01:46:50,908
And I gave nothing!

1306
01:46:50,909 --> 01:46:52,491
Nothing.

1307
01:46:53,578 --> 01:46:56,621
Because I'm nothing.

1308
01:47:27,403 --> 01:47:29,445
Go.

1309
01:47:30,782 --> 01:47:33,866
You are not nothing.
