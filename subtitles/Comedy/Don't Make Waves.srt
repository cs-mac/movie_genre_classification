2
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,601
Is this where Daeguk's CEO lives?

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,870
- Who are you? - Who am I?

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,970
I'm Oh Jeong Hoon's future mother-in-law.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,470
My niece is going to marry him.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,841
What?

7
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,841
Why look so shocked?

8
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:22,341
You didn't know he was engaged?

9
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,181
Get out. Get out of my house.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,880
Don't you yell at me.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,790
Your daughter stole a man.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,121
What? She stole?

13
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,291
Yes. They were engaged...

14
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,860
and you stole him away with money.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,901
What? With money?

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,301
My niece dated and supported Jeong Hoon...

17
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:47,541
for four years while he studied for the bar.

18
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,041
Now that he passed the bar,

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,670
you waved money before him to pinch him.

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,880
Do you think I'll let you do that?

21
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,911
My goodness, no!

22
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,280
What are you doing?

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,820
Get out. Get out!

24
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:05,020
If you don't get out right now, I'll call the police!

25
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,750
What? The police?

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,690
Do you think that scares me?

27
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,360
Call them. Call the police.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,591
I will turn this thieving household upside-down.

29
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:16,030
What? "Thieving"?

30
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:18,371
Who are you calling a thief?

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,810
Hey, I've been through more than you think.

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,181
Do you think I won't be able to deal with the likes of you?

33
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,651
- Let go! - How dare you?

34
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:31,810
- Let go! - Who are you?

35
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,220
What do you think you are?

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,321
That woman is all brawn and no brains.

37
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,761
She's no CEO's wife. She's a thug.

38
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:45,330
I'll leave for now,

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,030
but do you think I'll let you steal Jeong Hoon?

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,330
As if!

41
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:50,871
My goodness.

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,250
What's all this? What's this mess?

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,780
Mom, what happened?

44
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:09,120
Do you know what just happened because of you?

45
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,150
What happened?

46
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,951
Why is this room a mess?

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,860
Jeong Hoon promised to marry someone else.

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,661
Her aunt just came and did this.

49
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,101
You didn't know about that, did you?

50
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,441
He conned all of us.

51
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,441
He didn't con us.

52
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,770
He ended it with her.

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,881
What?

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,911
Then you knew he had been dating someone else?

55
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,580
How could you still think of marrying him?

56
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,650
She supported him for years!

57
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,821
Where are you going?

58
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,661
This is just unbelievable.

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,800
I was worried about you and...

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
wanted to see you.

61
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:00,601
I didn't know you worked with my aunt.

62
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:03,201
She isn't at work?

63
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,571
If she left home,

64
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,071
she'll show up later.

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,911
It's hard, isn't it?

66
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:16,120
I can tell just by looking at your face.

67
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:20,221
Do you know why Jeong Hoon...

68
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,490
suddenly changed?

69
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,390
What did he tell you?

70
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,761
He's seeing someone.

71
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,031
That won't be true.

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,571
I think he lied to make me give up.

73
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,210
There has to be another reason.

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,340
Don't you know what it is?

75
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,281
Not really.

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,210
Can you talk to your brother?

77
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,221
I really don't know why he's acting like this.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,321
Sure, I will.

79
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Go back inside.

80
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,990
You should rest.

81
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,631
Okay.

82
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,330
Bye.

83
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,610
Floor manager?

84
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:13,071
You're looking for me?

85
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:15,710
You hadn't come to work,

86
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,111
so Mr. Jo sent me.

87
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,850
I can't work today.

88
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,780
Tell the boss that I'm ill in bed.

89
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,350
Then...

90
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,421
- let's have a chat. - About what?

91
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,431
What did you just say?

92
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,261
You're Jeong Hoon's brother?

93
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,660
I met Soon Young at your home...

94
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,730
and just found out you're her aunt.

95
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,671
This is a mess.

96
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,011
You're Jeong Hoon's brother, so let me ask you something.

97
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,840
When did he...

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,850
get together with Daeguk's CEO's daughter?

99
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,710
Are they discussing marriage?

100
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,621
Don't think of lying.

101
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:57,350
Mal Soon the seamstress knows.

102
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,720
That means she visited the family.

103
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,921
Jeong Hoon was originally her tutor.

104
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,090
He changed and...

105
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,830
I feel sorry and angry for Soon Young.

106
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,530
Do you know where I just was?

107
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,730
I went to Daeguk's CEO's home and tore up the living room.

108
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,801
What?

109
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,941
Give your brother a message.

110
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,671
I won't let him desert Soon Young...

111
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:22,580
and marry into that family. I just won't.

112
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,150
Soon Young doesn't seem to know yet.

113
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,020
We'll never be in-laws.

114
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,150
Your brother ruined that.

115
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,960
I don't think you should tell Soon Young for now.

116
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,160
She's still in a state of shock.

117
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:39,290
This news will just make it worse.

118
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:41,761
I'm so angry.

119
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,910
Don't just sit and mope.

120
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,011
It's a horrible sight.

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,280
You missed work?

122
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,051
Jeong Tae was just...

123
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,480
We met.

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,580
He's Jeong Hoon's brother.

125
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,821
I found out just now when he came to find you.

126
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:08,460
Where did you go instead of to work?

127
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,220
I went to see Jeong Hoon...

128
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,890
Did you go to his home again?

129
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,590
No, to Daeguk...

130
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,330
It's best you don't know.

131
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,470
What do you mean?

132
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,371
Don't ask. You don't need to know.

133
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:26,270
Jeong Hoon.

134
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,080
It's not yet over with her?

135
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,650
What do you mean?

136
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,451
That woman's aunt caused a scene at my house.

137
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,090
You promised you'd end it and you should have.

138
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,761
How could you let them come to my house?

139
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,330
Did you lie to me?

140
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,131
She supported you for years.

141
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:50,970
How close were you that...

142
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,431
the aunt would say that about you two?

143
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:56,770
Why won't you say anything?

144
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,210
It's over between us.

145
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,111
What more must I say?

146
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm sorry that the aunt trashed your house,

147
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,381
but I find it very unpleasant that you don't believe me.

148
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,321
I don't want to marry you...

149
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,691
if I have to keep lying.

150
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,390
You're out of line.

151
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,790
You're angry with me?

152
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,261
I feel unpleasant.

153
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,400
However much I like you,

154
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:26,171
if you're so indecisive that you can't end it with a woman,

155
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,741
I'll have to...

156
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,311
reconsider marrying you.

157
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,020
What? Jeong Hoon had a fiancee?

158
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:46,821
Yes.

159
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,160
Her aunt was here today...

160
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,491
and caused a scene.

161
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,361
Honey.

162
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,801
They dated for four years and acted as if they were married.

163
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,270
You didn't know about this, sir?

164
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:04,171
Why won't you say anything?

165
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,780
Mi Jin knew that he had been seeing someone.

166
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,410
Did you know as well?

167
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,111
He said he'd end it with her.

168
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,881
He promised me.

169
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,051
What?

170
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,150
How could you think of letting him...

171
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,051
marry Mi Jin after that?

172
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:22,621
Do you know what the woman's aunt said?

173
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,590
She called us thieves!

174
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,900
What?

175
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,131
We used our money to take another woman's man...

176
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,630
and she called that stealing.

177
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,541
She supported Jeong Hoon...

178
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,311
for four years while he studied for the bar.

179
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,610
Why would he leave her to marry Mi Jin?

180
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,580
It's because of this, our money.

181
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,220
Mi Jin's home.

182
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,321
Where were you all day?

183
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,720
- Come and sit down. - I'm tired.

184
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,921
Can I go upstairs, Dad?

185
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,531
Did you meet Jeong Hoon?

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,391
Yes.

187
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,500
- What did he say? - He ended it with her.

188
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,470
The woman's aunt came here to cause a fuss...

189
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,571
and it's over?

190
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,340
Jeong Hoon broke it off and she...

191
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,311
came here because she was angry!

192
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,311
I will never accept him!

193
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,781
I can't let Mi Jin marry someone who has...

194
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:21,551
an ulterior motive to marrying her.

195
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:28,321
Sir, do you think you can trust Jeong Hoon?

196
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,220
You keep quiet.

197
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,830
You're back from work?

198
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,301
Is Jeong Hoon in?

199
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,901
Yes. Why?

200
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,671
Jeong Tae's home?

201
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,911
Yes, but he went into Jeong Hoon's room.

202
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,210
Did he?

203
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,411
Are you still getting married?

204
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,181
Yes.

205
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,451
If you want to try to change my mind, get out.

206
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,021
Today, Soon Young...

207
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,061
You two broke up.

208
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,791
Is it Ms. Uhm now?

209
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,130
Anyway, her aunt went to Daeguk Construction's...

210
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,301
CEO's house today.

211
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:14,641
What did you say?

212
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,141
Soon Young's aunt went to Mi Jin's home?

213
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,811
How do you know that?

214
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,051
Soon Young's aunt works where I do.

215
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,681
She missed work so I went to get her and...

216
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,321
found out who she was.

217
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,821
You can guess what happened, can't you?

218
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:35,561
I'm telling you because she...

219
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:36,821
told me to, not because I'm worried.

220
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:39,931
I told you, so I did my part.

221
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:49,541
They didn't know about Soon Young.

222
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,370
They'll be in shock.

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,311
Jeong Hoon.

224
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,681
It's not too late to...

225
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,651
We won't break up because of Soon Young.

226
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:12,130
(Storage)

227
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,401
The storage room is always dirty.

228
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:21,301
Bok Shil.

229
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:27,210
Sorry for letting you down.

230
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,951
But I can't give up on becoming a singer.

231
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:38,021
I swear there was an egg in here.

232
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,720
Where did it go?

233
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,291
It's not like...

234
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,830
eggs have legs with which to run off on.

235
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,191
My goodness.

236
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,031
Gosh.

237
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:51,500
What's wrong with your face?

238
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,100
- What's that? - Raw egg to make me pretty.

239
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,441
I need to make sure...

240
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,911
I don't get betrayed.

241
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,610
What do you mean?

242
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,080
Why do you think Jeong Hoon left his girlfriend for someone else?

243
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,781
Kyung Ho's CEO's daughter is pretty,

244
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:07,321
that's why.

245
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:10,120
Do you think it's because she's pretty?

246
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,750
He fell in love with her money.

247
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,391
What's wrong with your face, Choon Ja?

248
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:16,990
You look like a yellow ghost.

249
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:18,891
- A yellow ghost? - A yellow ghost?

250
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,161
You look scary.

251
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,130
Kyung Ho, have breakfast.

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,330
I'm not hungry. See you.

253
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,340
Why aren't you hungry?

254
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,701
Do you feel unwell?

255
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:31,041
No. I'll grab something if I feel hungry.

256
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,071
See you.

257
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,441
Is something on his mind?

258
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,250
Why would he leave without breakfast?

259
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,921
Open the door.

260
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,080
Give me that.

261
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,090
The missing egg from the kitchen...

262
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:47,191
went on your face?

263
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,391
Yes.

264
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,590
Don't make me talk, my skin's too taut.

265
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,830
You silly thing.

266
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:56,330
You're pretty enough that you don't have to do that.

267
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,571
Wash your face.

268
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:59,470
I'll bring in the breakfast table.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,801
You don't even have...

270
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,571
a boy who cares about you.

271
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,641
I do. Jeong Tae...

272
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:14,521
Jeong Hoon.

273
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,691
Are you here to see me?

274
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,821
Yes. My CEO's nephew...

275
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:21,460
wants to see you.

276
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Me?

277
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,360
That's his number.

278
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,960
Do you know him?

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,161
Sort of.

280
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,271
Okay, thanks.

281
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,411
Bok Shil.

282
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,710
Shall we meet after work?

283
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,951
Okay. I'll come to your company later.

284
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,151
Okay.

285
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,191
(Cha Sang Pil, CEO)

286
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:59,291
(Lucky Entertainment)

287
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,000
Can you lift your legs?

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,201
Leave it and go.

289
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,771
I'm not done mopping.

290
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:06,870
Get out.

291
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,171
Why yell at me?

292
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,370
Can I speak to Mr. Han Kyung Ho?

293
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,681
It's Cha Sang Pil.

294
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,750
Did you tell Oh Jeong Hoon that I want to see him?

295
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:25,490
Wait.

296
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,021
Is our company working on something...

297
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:30,391
in cooperation with Daeguk Construction?

298
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,431
Why?

299
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,391
Mr. Cha was on the phone.

300
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,531
There's nothing right now.

301
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,271
Why would you want to know?

302
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,330
What?

303
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:40,941
It's nothing.

304
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:45,811
Okay.

305
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,811
Mr. Han.

306
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,811
Are you working on something with Lucky Entertainment behind my back?

307
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:53,850
Pardon?

308
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,781
You left me out last time to work with...

309
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:58,490
Mr. Cha on something in Vietnam.

310
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,460
Will you stab me in the back again?

311
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,431
Not at all. It was about a personal matter.

312
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm stressed as it is because the complex is being delayed.

313
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,370
You should pay more attention to that project.

314
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,240
Why is he blaming Mr. Han...

315
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,811
for the delay?

316
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,610
He's afraid the CEO...

317
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,441
will ask to see him then yell.

318
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,651
He should check the site out himself, then.

319
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,181
He's always handing his tasks over to Mr. Han.

320
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:33,321
- Are you going out? - Yes.

321
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,391
Jeong Hoon.

322
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:37,061
Are you going out because...

323
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,960
Soon Young's aunt went to their house?

324
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,600
Goodbye.

325
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:43,701
What did you say?

326
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,100
Soon Young's aunt went where?

327
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,470
She went to Mi Jin's home.

328
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
What?

329
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,470
Who told you about that?

330
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,911
Jeong Tae works with Soon Young's aunt.

331
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:00,181
He went to her house and found out.

332
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,750
That means...

333
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,090
she must know what happened.

334
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:08,090
She'll have caused a huge mess at the house.

335
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,130
What are you doing here?

336
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,730
Why don't you reconsider marrying Mi Jin to Jeong Hoon?

337
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,100
It bothers me that he...

338
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,901
dated someone for four years.

339
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:24,311
I already know about that.

340
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:26,141
Jeong Hoon didn't lie to me.

341
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:28,610
Even so, I think he wants to marry...

342
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,041
for a shady reason.

343
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,750
It's not your place to comment.

344
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:35,151
Come in.

345
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,620
You said you'd deal with the other woman...

346
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,090
and you haven't yet?

347
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,801
- I apologize. - Why are you...

348
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,130
Sang Pil, leave.

349
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:54,370
Go on, I said leave.

350
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,350
Is this the best you can do?

351
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,851
How could you let her trash our house?

352
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,050
I'm sorry for the trouble.

353
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,220
I'll make sure this never happens again.

354
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,921
You haven't sorted it out yet?

355
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:16,820
I ended it completely.

356
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:18,831
You needn't worry.

357
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,760
I knew you had a girlfriend at the time,

358
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:24,631
but I gave permission because you said you'd break it off.

359
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,500
However much I like you,

360
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:30,740
I can't accept someone who breaks my daughter's heart.

361
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,171
That won't happen. Don't worry, sir.

362
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,710
Then...

363
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:39,081
I'll give you one more shot.

364
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,980
Don't cause any more trouble and end it properly.

365
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:43,750
If not, I can't trust you.

366
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,091
And the marriage with Mi Jin is off. Okay?

367
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,591
Yes. Believe me.

368
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,161
(Daeguk Construction)

369
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,201
Let's talk.

370
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,540
Did Mr. Han Kyung Ho tell you that...

371
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:08,341
I wished to see you?

372
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,081
Yes, he did.

373
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,810
But what for?

374
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:15,780
Mi Jin's like a sister to me.

375
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:18,451
I can't pretend that I'm not concerned about her future.

376
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:20,421
Get to the point.

377
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,060
I will, then.

378
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,831
To be frank, I don't think your motive of marrying Mi Jin...

379
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,201
is purely genuine.

380
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:33,570
You studied for years and passed the bar,

381
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,500
then suddenly gave that up to marry Mi Jin...

382
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:40,010
and join Daeguk and I don't understand that.

383
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:45,250
Not to mention the girlfriend you had.

384
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,921
Mr. Hwang already knows about that,

385
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,520
and I never deceived anyone.

386
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,490
So you're blameless?

387
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,490
What do you want to say?

388
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,560
This marriage.

389
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,530
Is it about Mi Jin...

390
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,000
or...

391
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,201
Daeguk Construction?

392
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,401
Before I answer, I'd like to ask you a question.

393
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:11,240
You said our engagement bothers you.

394
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,040
Is it about Mi Jin or...

395
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,010
Daeguk Construction?

396
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:19,750
You can't answer.

397
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:21,951
Of course it's about Mi Jin.

398
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:26,421
What answer did you expect?

399
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,460
Here's my answer.

400
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,331
I'm marrying Mi Jin because I want to,

401
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,631
and I'll join Daeguk...

402
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,161
to help my father-in-law.

403
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,000
Will that do?

404
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,671
If that's all you want to know,

405
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,141
I'd like to leave.

406
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,921
Grandma, I'm off.

407
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,820
- Are you going to work? - Yes.

408
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,191
Let's go somewhere on the way.

409
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,921
- Where? - You know where Soon Young lives.

410
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:06,361
I want to meet her, so lead the way.

411
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,260
Why would you see her?

412
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,530
Just lead the way.

413
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,800
Grandma.

414
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,671
- Where is she going? - You don't need to know.

415
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:18,671
Jeong Tae, there aren't that many pretty girls at your cabaret.

416
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:19,671
What?

417
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:21,810
I checked the place out yesterday.

418
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,310
They all dress so sexy,

419
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:25,881
but I was way prettier.

420
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,250
Don't you agree?

421
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,951
- Good for you. - What is?

422
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,921
You have no sense of reality. Life must me so easy.

423
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,260
Don't you dare get distracted by things like this.

424
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Okay?

425
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,361
Will you please stop?

426
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,631
Grandma.

427
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,101
I know about reality.

428
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:46,570
I know exactly.

429
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,911
Why do you want to see Soon Young?

430
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,210
What will you say?

431
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:57,250
Where does she live?

432
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,451
- Is this it? - Yes.

433
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,820
Call her.

434
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,181
When we met yesterday,

435
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:05,391
she was half-dead with grief.

436
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:07,320
I felt so sorry for her.

437
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,391
You won't be mean to her, will you?

438
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,560
You grew to like her too.

439
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,470
Will you stop talking nonsense and call her?

440
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:19,230
I trust you.

441
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,770
Is anyone home?

442
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,540
It's Jeong Tae.

443
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:30,681
Soon Young, are you in?

444
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,220
Soon Young.

445
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,091
Ma'am.

446
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,790
- Hello. - Let's talk.

447
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,490
Come in.

448
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,701
- You can go. - Grandma.

449
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,970
What is she going to say?

450
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,681
You look terrible.

451
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,010
Soon Young.

452
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,081
Yes, Grandma.

453
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:10,381
I came...

454
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:14,020
to ask you to do something for me.

455
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,191
Can't you...

456
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,431
give up on Jeong Hoon?

457
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:24,970
Grandma.

458
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,401
At first,

459
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,500
I disapproved of you.

460
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:33,240
But the more I got to know you, I realized how sweet...

461
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,081
and gentle you were.

462
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,181
That's why I thought...

463
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,780
you'd make a great wife for my grandson.

464
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,020
There's nothing I can do because...

465
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:46,891
Jeong Hoon's so adamant.

466
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:52,331
I accepted you because...

467
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:57,131
Jeong Hoon said he couldn't live without you.

468
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,201
Now he has...

469
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
completely changed his mind.

470
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:10,441
Ok Boon is very distraught over all this,

471
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,280
and what's worse,

472
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,851
it's causing a rift between the kids and I can't stand that.

473
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:20,720
So...

474
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:24,661
I came to ask you for a favor.

475
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,560
For Jeong Hoon's sake,

476
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,861
can you not let him go?

477
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,841
I'm so sorry that...

478
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,770
this is...

479
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,280
all I can say to you.

480
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:48,951
As you know,

481
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:53,750
I owe Jeong Hoon a lot.

482
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,161
That's why now...

483
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:00,260
I want him to live in comfort.

484
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,201
That's why I'm being so nasty to you.

485
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,441
Can you do this for me?

486
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,320
Madam Gu, what happened yesterday?

487
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,990
Why didn't you come to work?

488
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,351
Didn't the floor manager say?

489
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:26,851
I was sick.

490
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm sure you were.

491
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,131
Everything went wrong at the last minute.

492
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,060
Why did Jeong Hoon change his mind?

493
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,431
He passed the bar and wouldn't want for anything more.

494
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,931
Why would he go for a CEO's daughter?

495
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:43,240
I thought about it and I'm positive that...

496
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,770
the CEO's daughter chased him.

497
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:49,181
That's why she came to see him a few times.

498
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,681
- She did? - She did.

499
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:55,121
Any tree falls if you chop at it enough.

500
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:58,050
A rich young lady followed him around,

501
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,351
and Jeong Hoon fell for her.

502
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,560
What did I say?

503
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,661
The rich young lady and her tutor.

504
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:06,730
It's a perfect way to get the girl.

505
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,201
It's always about money.

506
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,500
If your niece had been rich,

507
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,201
Jeong Hoon wouldn't have left her.

508
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,371
You're right.

509
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,841
Why aren't you getting ready for work?

510
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,581
Why did you miss work yesterday?

511
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,911
I told you that she was very sick.

512
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,651
What do you have?

513
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:31,220
Money? Anything?

514
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,020
You just have your body.

515
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,161
How can you serve our customers if you're so sickly?

516
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,591
I'm already annoyed...

517
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:40,161
and now you belittle me because I'm poor?

518
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,101
Why are you yelling at me?

519
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,931
- Get ready for work! - Yes, sir.

520
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,070
I hate my life.

521
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,510
Jeong Tae, will you really not work at the demolition site?

522
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,351
I told you I don't do what I said I won't do.

523
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:02,681
Come on, boss.

524
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:05,121
Let's just get the boys and take it down.

525
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:06,621
Leave it to me.

526
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,391
I'll flatten the rest of the houses just like that.

527
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:12,191
What if someone gets hurt?

528
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,131
This is just insane.

529
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,171
Oh Se Ra.

530
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:21,800
Let's talk.

531
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,770
Talk.

532
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,871
I missed a few days of practice because of exams...

533
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,641
and you practiced instead?

534
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:30,240
What's wrong with that? Can't I sing too?

535
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:31,851
You just clean the office.

536
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:34,651
What are you to take up my practice slot?

537
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,320
If you want to keep it,

538
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,250
come every day instead of slacking off.

539
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,250
What?

540
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,490
- Hey. - Hye Rin, that was too much.

541
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,591
Not at all.

542
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,431
Mr. Cha, you tell me.

543
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:48,800
Am I like her?

544
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,770
How dare she take up my practice time?

545
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,171
She's just a cleaner.

546
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:55,341
How long will you two go on fighting like this?

547
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:58,770
Do I have to get involved with this too?

548
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,681
You can clean this up.

549
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,480
I did what I have to do. Can I go now?

550
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:16,691
You finished early?

551
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:18,361
Yes.

552
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,230
Why didn't you order anything?

553
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,861
Do you want coffee?

554
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,030
We can order later.

555
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:26,970
Kyung Ho.

556
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:29,841
I didn't tell you I joined Lucky Entertainment...

557
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:31,441
I'll go first, Bok Shil.

558
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,941
You lied to me.

559
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,151
Okay.

560
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,611
I don't want you to sing,

561
00:27:39,611 --> 00:27:41,921
so you couldn't tell me. I get that.

562
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:45,720
But now that I know,

563
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,691
I don't want you to go on working there.

564
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,960
- Leave. - Kyung Ho.

565
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:53,091
The CEO makes you clean.

566
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:55,000
You went to sing.

567
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,361
Does that make sense?

568
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,201
So quit.

569
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,371
I'll contact the company that offered the clerk job.

570
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,111
No.

571
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:06,371
I'll become a singer and succeed.

572
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:07,480
Bok Shil.

573
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,480
If you're going to object to my being a singer,

574
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,980
then stop minding my business.

575
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,091
You asked to see me, so I thought about it.

576
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,891
I can't give up on my dream.

577
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,391
You give up.

578
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,530
Stop liking me.

579
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,000
How can you say that so easily?

580
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,671
It wasn't easy.

581
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,671
I thought and agonized over it.

582
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,540
I haven't worked at Lucky Entertainment for too long.

583
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,941
Even if you see me, pretend we're strangers.

584
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,710
I'll feel uncomfortable if the CEO were to know.

585
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:46,611
I have to go.

586
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,351
Bok Shil.

587
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:58,161
What? Jeong Hoon's grandma was here?

588
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,060
And? What did she say?

589
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,230
She asked me to...

590
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,431
let Jeong Hoon go.

591
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,701
What?

592
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,841
Now the old woman's trying to get rid of you too?

593
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,881
She asked me to do her a favor.

594
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:17,510
Jeong Hoon's mother is very upset,

595
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:21,081
and she can't stand watching Jeong Hoon argue with his siblings.

596
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,921
She held my hand and pleaded.

597
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,591
It's all about the money.

598
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,530
What did you say? Did you just sit and cry?

599
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:34,560
There was nothing...

600
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,901
I could say after that.

601
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,030
You should've spoken your mind.

602
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,641
Why didn't you?

603
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,181
What? You met Soon Young?

604
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:50,951
Yes.

605
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,480
I asked her to give up on Jeong Hoon,

606
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,780
so that's that.

607
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,891
How could you go all the way there...

608
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,020
and ask her to do that?

609
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:02,060
Should we just sit and watch, then?

610
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,591
Do you think Jeong Hoon will change his mind?

611
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,431
Don't you know your own son?

612
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,701
Why wouldn't I know my son?

613
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:13,030
He didn't leave Soon Young because he fell out of love...

614
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,841
and he isn't marrying Mi Jin because he loves her.

615
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,111
He's lashing out because he thinks his father...

616
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,010
ruined his life.

617
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,651
That's why we must stop him.

618
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,280
He didn't make these decisions with a clear mind.

619
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,921
We must stop him.

620
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:31,921
Yes, like you said,

621
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:34,421
because of his dad, his acceptance to...

622
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:37,290
the judicial institute was cancelled...

623
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,960
and he can't work anywhere.

624
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,331
Should he just give up like that?

625
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:47,270
He'll have to work as a manual laborer.

626
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,000
Can you deal with that?

627
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,070
If they will offer him a good career,

628
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,510
we must grab hold of whoever we can.

629
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,980
That way,

630
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,250
Jeong Hoon will get a life of his own.

631
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:02,121
Don't you try to stop me.

632
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,861
Did you talk to Jeong Hoon?

633
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,631
Yes, he came to my office.

634
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:12,691
What did he say?

635
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,901
He said he'd end it properly,

636
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:17,631
so I gave him another chance.

637
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,431
Why won't he call me then?

638
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,810
I told him that I'd have to think about marrying him.

639
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,581
You said that?

640
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,010
He said it was over,

641
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,510
but the woman's aunt caused a fuss and I got angry.

642
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:33,881
What do you really want?

643
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,351
Did you really decide to reconsider marriage?

644
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,560
No, Dad. I blurted that out in anger.

645
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,861
If he were to come and ask for forgiveness,

646
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,260
I'd forgive him for everything.

647
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,790
Why hasn't he called?

648
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,770
He's not that easy to manipulate.

649
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:53,300
He knows you were angry...

650
00:31:53,631 --> 00:31:55,641
and is waiting for you to calm down.

651
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,841
That's why I feel worse.

652
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:00,681
It's like I always give in to him.

653
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,990
Why won't my heart slow down even after I take a pill?

654
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,131
You, come here.

655
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:22,631
What for?

656
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,931
You can't marry him.

657
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
I'll do whatever it takes...

658
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,810
to break you two up.

659
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,310
Will you stop it?

660
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,510
I'm upset too.

661
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:37,381
Why should you get upset over him?

662
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:39,210
When you can just give up?

663
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:42,320
It's my marriage. I'll deal with it!

664
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,490
Mi Jin!

665
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,391
Sang Pil, what is she talking about?

666
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,631
What will she deal with?

667
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:57,131
She's not over him yet, is he?

668
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:00,871
I think you should talk to her.

669
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:04,111
Jeong Hoon wants to marry Mi Jin for a reason...

670
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,810
and that bothers me.

671
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,540
Right? You think so too?

672
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,581
I will cancel this engagement.

673
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:20,720
What's this stink?

674
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:25,760
This is the house.

675
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:30,931
- Wait here. - Yes, ma'am.

676
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:39,141
Who are you?

677
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,081
Does Oh Jeong Hoon live here?

678
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,310
Yes, he does.

679
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,220
Are you his mother?

680
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:49,951
Yes.

681
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,520
I'm Mi Jin's mother.

682
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,260
What?

683
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,691
This is unbelievable.

684
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:01,861
Do you know why I came all the way here?

685
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm here to call off the engagement between our kids.

686
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:32,931
(Through the Waves)

687
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,631
Do you know how shameless you both are?

688
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,530
You should be more aggressive.

689
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,401
Just because your son is smart,

690
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:40,541
you sell him over.

691
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,771
How can you say that?

692
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,240
- Let's go and eat. - What?

693
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,611
What should we do now?

694
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,081
You won't understand or accept me.

695
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:48,680
That's what's happening.

696
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,941
I like you as...

697
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,711
you are now, not as a singer.

698
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,851
What'll you do about Soon Young?

699
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,421
Doing this won't change anything.

700
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:56,921
I won't do that kind of job.

701
00:34:56,921 --> 00:34:58,820
Just make sure that nothing goes wrong.

702
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,851
Get out the way!
