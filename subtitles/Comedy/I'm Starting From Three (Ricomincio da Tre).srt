1
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:47,959
Gaetanoooo,Gaeetano, Gaetaaa!

2
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:56,279
Gaetanoo, Gaetaanoo, Gaetaaa!

3
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:00,440
Gaetanoo, Gaetano, Gaetaaaa...!

4
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,077
Not even the most desperate
of the saint would shout like that!

5
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,044
What do you want?

6
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,845
Nothing! Just calling you.

7
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,121
Just calling!

8
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:11,562
Damn! At this time...!
Gaeta', Gaetano...

9
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:13,842
People are sick,
everybody’s at home ...

10
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:16,526
..Gaità.., damn!
I would smash your face!

11
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,279
Every night the same story!

12
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:19,362
Why you are you looking at me?!

13
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:22,007
What were you doing?
Watching TV?

14
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,476
Yes, I was watching TV.
May I?!

15
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,518
I was watching the news!

16
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:29,724
Even the journalist,
stopped reading.

17
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:33,004
He said:
''Sorry! Can you tell me

18
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,402
who’s the asshole shouting
like that...

19
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,837
I can’t work! I can’t'' 
Everybody knows you!

20
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,804
I just wanted to know 
what where you doing!?

21
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,400
They’re going to the movies. Are you going too?

22
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,404
Are you going to the movies?
- I don’t know, Raffaele!

23
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,318
You don’t know?
- No, I don’t!

24
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,198
What do you mean, you don’t know?
Either you know or you don’t!

25
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,197
If you know, but if you don’t...
- Are you going to?

26
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,676
I don’t know!
- Are you going or not!!?

27
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,440
Damn! I don’t know!
I can’t explain!

28
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,199
Now I will...
- Are you going or not?

29
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:58,158
Damn!
I can’t stand him!

30
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,277
Are you going or not?
- I don’t know, got it?

31
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:04,758
No, I don’t want to go!
Got it? No! Hands in your pocket!

32
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,401
Why are you not going?
- I am not because you...

33
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,524
..because I don’t like you!...Raffaele
- You can’t say that!.

34
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,245
I don’t like you...
- No! You can’t say that!

35
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:13,641
I don’t like you..
- No, you can’t say that...

36
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,481
Damn, it’s because, you talk too much.
You never let people speak!!!

37
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,444
- Then I talk too much...

38
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,559
but still you like me!
- No, you are a very unpleasant talker!

39
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,484
Alright! You’re always right!

40
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,877
So, are we going or not?
- He’s not going to the movies!

41
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,527
Damn!
- What can you do! A real war...!

42
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:32,518
Then, I awoke

43
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:35,121
all sweating. Like this!

44
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,960
Fortunately it was a dream...
- What was it?! A war!

45
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,241
A dreaming war!
- Right!

46
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:42,842
Damn! Don’t tell me about dreaming
wars, please!

47
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:45,805
That’s fantastic!
I dream about it every night!

48
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:49,800
As soon as I fall asleep, it’s a war.
Every night it’s a war!

49
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:52,043
I mean, as soon as I fall asleep,
war is declared!

50
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,317
Damn!
Fantastic!

51
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,678
But I never killed anybody!

52
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,280
I mean...considering all the wars
I went through!

53
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:02,643
I am 26 and as soon I fall asleep! I was 
in the Punic wars, the independency wars

54
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,036
first world war, second...
All the wars...

55
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,526
and I never killed anybody!

56
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:11,322
Never! It never happens...I mean
I grab a rifle, a gun.

57
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:14,843
I want to shoot.
Damn...!

58
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:17,361
the enemy’s there, I say,
damn...

59
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,677
I’ll show you...I shoot...!

60
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,565
The bullet stays inside:
either the gun get stuck,

61
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,956
or it melts or it shoots
like  a plastic ball...!

62
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,565
I can never shoot!

63
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:29,559
Sometimes you feel
the shot going...

64
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,444
I say: Now I kill him,
damn...

65
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,121
I see his back and say:
''You can’t see me''

66
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,040
I shoot! I hear the shot… you know
.. coming out...

67
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,163
But! It falls on the ground!

68
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,681
I mean...it comes out, boom!
It falls...

69
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,837
And naturally, as soon as he sees me:
there he is...

70
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:47,721
he shots me four, five... 
he gets angry: ''You wanted to kill me...

71
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:49,081
but how do you dare.''
...Got it?..

72
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,556
And I don’t have even a knife!
Nothing, nothing!..

73
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:56,078
Listen. I think it’s because
I am sleepless.

74
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:00,524
I am sleepless and every night
I fall asleep around 3,30 am or

75
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,526
3 am. You know what happens?
All the people that fall asleep

76
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:08,276
around 10.30pm, 11 or 12,
and dream about wars,

77
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:13,122
I mean, it’s true! I mean
They can choose the best weapons...

78
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,601
and say:
''This is good, this is not!

79
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:18,201
They take the guns: 
this is good and this is not!

80
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:22,360
So! I arrive at 2-3 am, 
and I find only the scruffs

81
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:25,638
and I can take only those pieces...

82
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:29,481
What are you talking about!
- Guys, I am going to the movies..

83
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,956
Are you coming or not? Let’s go!

84
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:35,039
..ok..
- Wait a moment!

85
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,082
Listen, come with us..
- No, no..

86
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,361
come on...
- No, I don’t want to!

87
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,961
You do, you do, you do..
- Are you starting again!

88
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,526
Raffaele, shut up! I don’t want to go!

89
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,440
Ok, you don't!
- Go away! Damn!

90
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,837
You’re terrible!
- Ok, I’ll stay here, or you’ll be alone...

91
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,845
Absolutely not! You go. Alone...
is this a desert, maybe!?

92
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:57,799
I get bored.. to the movies...
I... I am leaving tomorrow.

93
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,562
Tomorrow I'll go to Florence
to aunt Antonia..

94
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:04,400
Again Florence, again aunt Antonia,
but then you don’t go anywhere!

95
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:07,837
I am saying I’ll go, right?
And then...

96
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,963
I am going, Raffaele,
I can’t stand it anymore!

97
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:13,835
I mean...the past is past.
I am starting from three...

98
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:15,804
From zero...
- What?

99
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,843
Starting from zero!

100
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,885
Absolutely not, starting from three.
Only three things I managed 

101
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,878
in my life, why 
should I lose them

102
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,037
and start from zero..?! From three!

103
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,243
I am leaving! I can’t stand it anymore!

104
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,960
Gaetano, who leaves, knows what he’s leaving,
but not what he’s looking for!

105
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,280
What are you saying?

106
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:44,925
Who leaves...? - knows what he’s leaving,
but not what he’s looking for!

107
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,560
Shit…nice! 

108
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,723
That’s your own words?

109
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,162
You look stupid, but...!

110
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,839
Be careful... you hurt me!

111
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,485
Good evening!

112
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,286
Good evening...
- Go home, mum is alone!

113
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,279
I must go to the church
and talk to con don Gino.

114
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:10,445
Damn! He’s going to the church
and ask a miracle

115
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:11,846
to grow his hand!

116
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,566
He’s going crazy! He’s convinced..

117
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,684
he says: ''I am a good person,
hones, a good worker...

118
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,486
it’s not possible
I get punished like this!

119
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,478
And he waits for a miracle
that will grow his hand!

120
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,479
So what, he’s waiting the miracle!
Why bothering?

121
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:28,240
You are more stupid than he is,
Raffaele!

122
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:30,124
The miracle that grows his hand!!!

123
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,720
His hand growing!
- Eh, eh!

124
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,719
All the miracles that I know of,
are about people..

125
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,162
for example, that can’t see
and then you can see...

126
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,805
but you already have eyes!

127
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:41,526
You don’t walk and then you can,
but you already have legs!

128
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,404
But have you ever seen a person
that doesn’t have something,

129
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:44,397
and then he has it!?

130
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:47,285
This is why the miracle is so difficult
and he’s concentrating,

131
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,278
because the miracle is difficult,
is much more difficult!

132
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,996
What is a difficult miracle...Why?
Difficult miracle and easy miracle,

133
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,759
..the one of 100 points
 and the one 50 points!

134
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:59,557
Damn! A miracle, is a miracle!
All the miracles are the same!

135
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,365
Why then people,
when there’s a miracle,

136
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,678
and see something crazy they say:
''Miracleeeee, Miracleee!''

137
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,917
Everybody: '''Miracleee,
miracleee!

138
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:09,521
Have you ever seen somebody saying:
 '' U! Miracle.'',

139
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,762
because is a 50 points miracle!
- No, no!

140
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,640
There is the:''Miiracleeee!!''
and the'' miracle''!

141
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,046
What are you talking about!
- Alright alright!

142
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,437
As far as I know, there is only:
''Miracleeeee! Miracleee!!''

143
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,518
Everybody: ''Miracleee! ...''
- No, no…you can’t say...

144
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,717
''Miracleee!
and the ''miracle''.

145
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:27,680
But if I know that everybody shouted:
''Miracleeee''..

146
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,645
There is the ''Miracleeee!''
or the ''miracle''.

147
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:36,279
The ''Miracleee!''
or the ''miracle''! ..Got it!

148
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,835
Nothing happened tonight!

149
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,446
No miracles! Never mind!

150
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:46,602
Don’t think I want
to put some pressure on you!

151
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:49,918
I am here! I wait!

152
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,279
There’re other people before me!
That’s fair!

153
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:59,124
I just wanted to say...when you
decide to grow it...

154
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:03,962
better if it happens at night!

155
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:08,518
I prefer that...just not to get scared!

156
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,804
So in the morning..
everything is already fixed!

157
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:16,165
I was hoping
it would grow tonight

158
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:19,523
considering we are moving,

159
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:24,362
move furniture, chairs,
and so on.. I could help!

160
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:28,076
I could give a hand...!
Anyway, it doesn’t matter...

161
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:29,966
It’s up to you!

162
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,957
By the way, my new address:

163
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:37,596
Via Cavallo di bronzo, 31.

164
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,917
Take care there’re two nr 31

165
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:45,764
not the first one....as if you would
go on the highway...,

166
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:49,840
and instead of turning left
you turn right…fine..

167
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,122
you know about that!

168
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:55,358
It’s your job! 
You’ll find me...

169
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,717
(Toc, toc) Who’s there!
- Me!

170
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,685
Damn...Are you always locked
inside the restroom?

171
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,235
You can go now!
- Hurray!

172
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,040
You spend your life
locked inside this restroom!

173
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,676
It’s always locked!
- It’s Pasqualino. He has to go to the court..!

174
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,485
I hope he goes to jail!

175
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,285
Hey, don’t joke about that!

176
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:25,645
Mum, either he’s locked in the restroom, or
he’s locked in jail, that’s the same!

177
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:27,365
aah,ah!
- he’s locked anyway!

178
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:31,360
Eeeeh, damn...

179
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:54,275
Come---

180
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:56,478
Come...

181
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:00,124
Come...

182
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,965
come...

183
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,806
come...

184
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,395
come...

185
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,558
come...come...

186
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,444
Are you really calling it!

187
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,961
Are you talking to that?
- Rosaa, shut up!

188
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:28,959
It was really moving!
It made a movement...

189
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,005
it’s a matter of concentrating!
If you distract me...that’s over!

190
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:34,362
Come on! I just asked you something!

191
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:36,438
I thought you could call it
only with your mind!

192
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,040
I can call it also with my voice!

193
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,846
Maybe if it hears something,
I can convince it better!

194
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,600
Rosàa, can you imagine:
if I can move it

195
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,359
I find a solution to all my problems!

196
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,483
The TV people find me...

197
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,001
and say: ''Move that..''
and I move it!

198
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:52,078
Or: ''Move that''. 
And I move it.

199
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,885
I solve all my problems, Rosà!

200
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:58,199
Let’s say…I stay here:
come…come...come...

201
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,926
and Pasqualino gets out the restroom.
 Finally!

202
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,317
Anyway…if he should come out,
remember me!

203
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:14,683
Why you want to leave!?

204
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,883
We have a new house!

205
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,719
Why do you want to emigrate?

206
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:21,241
Mum, I don’t want to emigrate!

207
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,716
I want to travel, to know!

208
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,957
It’s not true that 
I am unhappy here...

209
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,756
Now that you found a good job!

210
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,725
A good job!
Every morning at five

211
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,964
inside that train..
start squeezing oranges...

212
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,685
Mum, I can’t stand it anymore!

213
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:41,157
Ah, Pasqualino…yesterday night
a girl called you!

214
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,324
Who was she?
- I didn’t understand!

215
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:48,923
She told her name two or three times.
But...I didn’t understand!

216
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,038
You should write it down!

217
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:54,403
He already said he didn’t understand,
what should she write:

218
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:55,920
''I didn’t understand!''

219
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:59,044
Gaetano, as for the money that you make,
that’s useful to us!

220
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,924
I mean, I don’t care about the money!

221
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,396
No no, I do!

222
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:08,395
Listen...I have two choices:
either I leave...

223
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,162
Or?
- Or? Or I leave!

224
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,839
Which is the other choice?

225
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,042
Which other choice?

226
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,685
You said there were
TWO choices!?

227
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:19,161
I said there were two choices?

228
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:22,637
Yes! - No, I said:
'' There’ s one ..'' I remember!

229
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,560
One choice! I always had
just one choice

230
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,558
and now you’re talking
about a second choice!?

231
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,365
That’s impossible
really…always one choice!

232
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:18,317
Where’re you coming from?

233
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,396
Naples.

234
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:21,715
Immigrant!

235
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:22,956
No!

236
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,640
No! I mean... I have
a job in Naples...

237
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:30,515
A normal life ...
like everybody! I worked..

238
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,996
No, I left...to travel...

239
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:38,002
to know things..
- That’s good, for young people!

240
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:41,841
You don’t like something,
you just stop and change your life.

241
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:44,839
That would be too late for me!

242
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,155
Too late!

243
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,080
I sacrificed all my life!

244
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,840
My family, my job. All my life!

245
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:55,476
And know there’s nothing left
but stop it!

246
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:59,120
If it would be a mortal
a mortal sin...

247
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:02,995
to commit suicide!
I would have done it long time ago.

248
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:08,440
There could be a way
to let things appear natural..

249
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,916
And I found it!

250
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,885
A car accident!
So many people die like this!

251
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,117
You run because you’re late...
then your car crashes.

252
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,199
Don’t run,,,
- Do you think they would notice?

253
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:24,965
They would notice...always
they would notice.... that...

254
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:30,565
go…slowly! Even I do..
sometimes…things that

255
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,000
things that  I think
.. if they would notice..!.

256
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,964
They always look at me…slowly!

257
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,242
I mean, how can it be!?
They always look at me!

258
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:42,684
You do something...! But, after you do it,
they were looking at you!

259
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,646
Everybody...because they
like to know.. slowly!

260
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,319
And then they notice!

261
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,477
It would be a sin!
- A mortal sin!

262
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,606
If you can call it a sin:
 ''A venial sin?''.

263
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,565
Ok...maybe you could...
don’t run!

264
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:00,719
No! It’s mortal! The hell...
- The hell!

265
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:02,445
The hell!
- Another one!

266
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:06,600
After all what I went through,
another hell! No..no no!

267
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,484
I need a piece of paradise!

268
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,966
Instead I find the hell!

269
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,366
I need to rest.

270
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,237
Now I am feeling sick!

271
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:16,636
I am very sick,
I can’t go on like this!

272
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,479
I am sick...
- Slowly...Don’t run...

273
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:22,879
There’s only one place where they know
what to do, when I am so sick..

274
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,197
could you drive me there?
- ..What?

275
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:28,006
Could you bring me there?
- There..I...

276
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,284
There..
- No…I’ve arrived...now!

277
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,881
No!
- Let me go...I don’t know anything!

278
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,639
I’ll tell you!

279
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,877
Can you bring me?
- Ok!...

280
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:40,845
Can you drive?
- Yes, slow down...!

281
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:41,916
Can you drive?
- Yes..!

282
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,198
What?
- What?

283
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:31,120
I can’t help it.
I can’t help it, doctor!

284
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,640
The usual thoughts..
- Come...

285
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:36,800
Same thoughts..
Something that...

286
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:39,606
Listen, I try explain:

287
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,645
it’s like an idea hunts me...
- Ok, I go.

288
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,525
An idea...so! 
You understand…an idea!

289
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,566
- Come in.
Better to leave him alone.

290
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:53,481
Are you a relative?
- No...Just hitchhiking

291
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,199
and suddenly he started to say...

292
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,766
Yes, don’t worry, we’ll take care!

293
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,405
I don’t really care!

294
00:17:58,487 --> 00:17:59,397
Wait here!

295
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:06,723
Listen..! I said I don’t know him..
Why should I wait!!

296
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,116
Damn!!!!

297
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,606
'Morning..

298
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,563
Bho!

299
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,320
Bo! MA! ma!

300
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:47,916
NO! Pride and dignity!

301
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,002
Dignity and pride!

302
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:54,236
NO!

303
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:58,639
Pride..
- and dignity

304
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:07,123
Dignity--! I...I
don’t care about dignity!

305
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:11,997
liiiih! Ehe! I don’t care!

306
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:15,557
If somebody would ask me:
''Do you want to change personality?''

307
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,000
''Become somebody else?''

308
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:18,600
You know my answer?

309
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:25,320
''Yes!!! Sure!''
What is my answer

310
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:28,319
''Yes, sure!''!
- Good!

311
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:32,366
Good! I am not hypocrite.

312
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,439
You know, if you ask somebody

313
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:38,519
on the street:
''Do you want to become Gianni Agnelli?''

314
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:41,599
''To become - as for beauty
- Alain Delon?'' For example...

315
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,803
Just ask him. You’ll see
what they answer!

316
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,162
You know the answer? ''NO!''

317
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,477
SUUURRRE!

318
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,559
But if you ask me...
ask me!

319
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:55,686
''Do you want to become Gianni Agnelli or Alain Delon''
- Ask me.

320
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,965
...or Alain Delon?
- Just ask me:

321
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:02,322
''Do you want to become Gianni
Agnelli or Alain Delon?''

322
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:05,365
See what I will answer!

323
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:10,123
If you ask me now...
- ''Do you want to become Gianni Agnelli or Alain Delon?''

324
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,686
Let’s pretend you asked it to me!

325
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,884
No...I did ask! I really asked:
 ''Do you want to become...''

326
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,839
Anyway, you are confused.
You should ask me...

327
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,885
You really didn’t!
I will say that...

328
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,356
''Do you want to become 
Gianni Agnelli or Alain Delon?''

329
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,483
See what I answer!
You know what I answer?

330
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,080
You know what I answer? ''YYYESS!''

331
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,158
''Sure!''

332
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:35,243
Sure! They have everything!

333
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:39,843
They have women...they are rich..
they are nice...

334
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:43,681
and healthy, and 
keys to their houses...

335
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:47,806
and pianos and safety boxes
and cakes and drinks

336
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,919
and champagne boxes
and burying boxes!

337
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:55,159
and I have a shit! Look
what a difference...yes or not!

338
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,841
Yes or not...?
- He’s crazy!

339
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,918
That guy is weird!

340
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:06,044
In America they’re not so weird!!

341
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:07,446
I’ve been to America...

342
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,802
Really weird!
- Are you scared?

343
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:13,675
Yes. At some point
I went in and he looked like that,-

344
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:16,156
above! I turned around
and nobody was there!

345
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:19,324
I mean, that blocked me,

346
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:26,836
his look.. you understand!
Ok! Bye, I go... bye!!

347
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:31,682
Gaetano, when do you want to leave?

348
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:35,476
I don’t know yet, auntie.

349
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,558
Just feel at home here! Ok?

350
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,638
No compliments, Gaetà!
- Yes, yes!

351
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:42,525
Don’t you want to know each other?

352
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,245
You stay there, without talking...

353
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,919
Frank, did you talk to Gaetano?

354
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,885
I told you, Frank is American

355
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:52,482
and he’s a preacher,
but not like our priests,

356
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:56,480
a sort of!
But, you see, he’s normal.

357
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,877
He says we must
love each other;

358
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:02,083
it’s nice that such a young person
says that!

359
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:05,398
Because...nowadays , there’s crime,
people are mean...

360
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:10,117
only with the Word
we can understand each other better,

361
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,482
he always says: the Word!

362
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,319
The Word.. solves everything!

363
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:16,967
Yes, but which Word?

364
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:21,962
The Word that...which Word Frank?

365
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:24,561
The Word as dialogue!

366
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:29,437
Right. As dialogue!
People should talk...

367
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,677
discuss! People don’t talk much!

368
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,557
Lack of communication!
Isolation! Not really!

369
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:40,879
Saint Francesco talked to
birds, to wolves, to dogs, to horses.

370
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,879
Damn it! He could talk to animals

371
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:46,840
and we Christians can’t even talk to
other Christians!

372
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:49,122
That’s not true, Frankie!

373
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:52,644
Religions are all the same!
Obligations, stuff..!

374
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,400
No, no..no! Our religion
is different...

375
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:59,958
You just follow  and I just ask you...
to talk..

376
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,403
to open...! I mean..
to talk to people! Got it?

377
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,318
What do you want to open, Frank!
- Why?

378
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:10,242
I am closed!
I can’t...

379
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:12,158
What can’t you do?

380
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,636
Stop..stop.. wait...
- What?

381
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,206
Damn..!
- What?

382
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:20,081
Shut up, She looks like..
the one I met where

383
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,635
I took that suicide!
- Don’t you want to meet her?

384
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:24,797
Yes, I do, but...
- I take care...Hallo!!!

385
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,684
Wait, shut up! Wait!

386
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:30,396
I want to meet her but without
noticing!

387
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:32,364
Not soon like that..!
- How do you want to do?

388
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,199
Wait! Just shut up a moment!

389
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:38,599
You know what I do? ..
I run around the building

390
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:42,481
I mean, all around the building
and meet her on the other side,

391
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,046
then I can say:
''Hi, how’re you?''

392
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,480
Good idea, right?

393
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,363
Your bag!

394
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:48,356
Damn!

395
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,722
Damn!... That’s too heavy!

396
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:17,677
Hi, what are you doing here?
What?

397
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,120
What’s going on?
Did you run?

398
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,324
No..
- I am exhausted, I’ve been walking for hours...

399
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,238
you don’t even know
my name!

400
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:25,840
And I don’t know yours!

401
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,918
I am, now you know. And you?

402
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:30,202
A...et.a!
- What?

403
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:33,006
Gaetano!
- Ah, now I know!

404
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,601
Is he a friend of yours?

405
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:45,563
No…I don’t know him…just
somebody.. I don’t really know him.

406
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,160
I don’t know!
- Stay with me!

407
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:48,475
Go away!

408
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,481
- No...no, just one, thanks!

409
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,357
Well…that’s nice here..!

410
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:23,445
- Nice...

411
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:28,726
What can i say!? I mean...!
How’s the suicide?

412
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:35,121
Fine! Suicide?! Do you think
people suicide so easily?

413
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:36,799
What do you mean, easily?

414
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:39,720
Easily! No!

415
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:44,119
-...there’s somebody in Naples, it’s a true story..
- Why don’t you take off your coat?.

416
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,003
..Coat!

417
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:55,721
Can I put it here?

418
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:58,640
It’s clean!

419
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:04,677
Somebody in Naples, he pretended...,
he was married, got it?

420
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:13,436
and his wife..- how many people like that!?
You meet them and think.. what can it be! -

421
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:16,837
His wife left it - right?-

422
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:19,122
because she said that he didn’t
love her enough..

423
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:23,763
guess it! She left. When she left,
he committed suicide!

424
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:29,080
He poisoned himself! Then his wife
thought it was a love sacrifice...

425
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,727
and she came back to him

426
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,719
and her lover committed suicide!

427
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,446
But people don’t commit suicide...
- What did she do?

428
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:40,997
Nothing...she stayed
with her husband...

429
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:44,636
She chose the easiest way!
- No, no. She chose the worse!

430
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:48,402
Her husband was really mad! Look...
- Come on!!!!

431
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,125
That’s not true, you invented it!

432
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:54,723
No really...!..Really
... it really happened!

433
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:59,198
Nice! I mean that’s bad
because there’s a suicide

434
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:04,239
but, as a story,
is unbelievable!

435
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:07,484
For example, I am writing a book

436
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,957
and I’m always afraid to write things
too much afar from reality

437
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,959
then, you listen to true stories

438
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:16,038
beyond any imagination!

439
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,604
Yes... no…because it looks as if
.. can you ever imagine

440
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:27,758
the lover...the husband..! I mean...that’s it!!

441
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:36,926
A story... I like this place, really 
nice! Nice...I like all this...

442
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,840
like...

443
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,236
Like what?

444
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:49,159
It’s really nice...
- Why did you leave Naples?

445
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:56,365
You know...eventually... who leaves

446
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:59,678
knows what he’s leaving,
but doesn’t know what he’s looking for!

447
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,600
What? You talk with other
people’s words?

448
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:05,918
Why, do you know Lello?

449
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:06,956
Who’s Lello?

450
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:13,925
Lello Sodano! The short one,
with his face... a little...

451
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,441
.., what did I say?!
- It’s from Montaigne.

452
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,325
Ah, Montaigne, the sentence..!.

453
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:24,162
No, nothing..!
- Who’s Lello?.

454
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:28,445
Nothing.. My mistake,
I said... it’s from Montaigne!

455
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:35,476
Gaetano! It’s seven o’clock!.

456
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:39,082
Everything is inside this bag!
The bread with sausages

457
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:42,438
and a bottle of mineral water.
There is also a cake!

458
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:46,202
I am going out. 
Are you falling asleep again?!

459
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:49,836
Better if I open the window.
Or you miss the bus!

460
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,917
I don’t care about 
The Abbey of Casamari!

461
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:03,044
That’s an excuse
to stay together...

462
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:07,279
this is how I started to open myself,
to talk to people...

463
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,679
Hi, Frank!
- Hi!

464
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:15,760
this is how I started to open myself,
to talk to people,

465
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:19,681
thanks to this meetings.

466
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,917
What are you saying?

467
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:26,163
I am still asleep, Frank!

468
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:30,525
I am really...
- Why didn’t you invite Marta?

469
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:33,437
Where, here?
- Why not?

470
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:35,404
Frank! I don’t know her...

471
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,762
The first time I go out with a woman

472
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:42,318
where do we go?!!! On a bus trip
to the Abbey!

473
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,285
Here is full of old people!
Not even ...

474
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,642
That’s not true! There are some young people!

475
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:51,606
This way, careful.. careful.

476
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:55,316
That’s nice to talk! Saint Francesco
talked to birds!

477
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:58,319
Frank, please! Again with the story
Saint Francesco

478
00:29:58,407 --> 00:29:59,681
talking to birds!

479
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,962
I can’t stand it anymore

480
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,480
and listen to the same story...

481
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,922
what was Saint Francesco doing?
Was he always talking to birds!?

482
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,760
Was he continuously in the ears
of those poor animals that.

483
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:12,198
just wanted to be in peace, but
they had to listen at Saint Francesco

484
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,356
in their ears all the time!

485
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:17,645
Come on! I think those birds
were really fed up of Saint Francesco!

486
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:20,639
As soon as they saw him, they said:
''Saint Francesco is arriving!''

487
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:26,242
When they saw him..'/'Saint
Francesco''!!!! tweet tweet tweet!

488
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,841
They all ran away the trees...

489
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,839
I think that it was
Saint Francesco’s fault 

490
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:33,559
if the bird’s migration started!

491
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,126
They couldn’t stand him anymore!

492
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:37,841
Come on! Let’s go...
- No Frank..

493
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:40,487
I am not going...
- Why not?! Come on..

494
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:44,003
Nooo I am..! I am still asleep!
- Don’t do this...!

495
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:45,998
No, Frank, listen to me...
- This is a great experience!?

496
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:47,440
No, first of all, I am asleep!

497
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:48,840
I would fall asleep on the bus!

498
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,440
Second thing...I don’t want to!

499
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:51,323
Take this!

500
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:54,126
You share with the others, ok?

501
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:59,122
There’s some bread with sausages,
mineral water and a cake...!

502
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,606
The cake is good!

503
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,759
Tell him to give you a piece of cake!
He’s American!

504
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,122
He takes everything for himself!

505
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:08,038
See you!

506
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,797
G..mornin.
- Good morning...

507
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:42,243
Well.. isn’t my aunt living here?

508
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,318
When?

509
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:47,399
No…Up to
this morning.... she was...

510
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:50,081
I remember because she gave me
the cake...

511
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,522
Is Mrs Tortora your aunt?

512
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:54,325
Yes, Mrs Tortora!

513
00:31:54,407 --> 00:32:00,403
Professor Fabio Capecchi
Please! Your aunt will be back soon.

514
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:09,316
You come here, in your aunt’s house
but you find me!

515
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:16,360
Who is this man going around the house
dressed like that?

516
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:19,280
Who could I be?

517
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:24,200
Bbbut! I mean...not...a thief!

518
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,436
Come on!

519
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:31,443
No, I said no..!
A thief wouldn’t be dressed...

520
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:36,402
Young man! The situation
is very clear...

521
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:43,199
Yes...
- But you shouldn’t judge from the appearance!

522
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:47,565
As for me: I am a well known
professor of arts...

523
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:51,196
as for your aunt: she is a very
deserving person!

524
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:54,597
Yes?! Yes, yes, I know!. 
You might think

525
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:57,360
that it’s not good that your aunt
has a partner,

526
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:59,722
a lover! Whatever!

527
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:04,756
In truth your aunt is still
a married woman..

528
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:07,281
and we are not so young!

529
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:12,122
Not so young!..
Is it a shame?!

530
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:17,042
But...! Did you read Cooper?

531
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:20,244
Do you know what he says?

532
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:25,196
Cooper…said many things....
Cooperrr!?...

533
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,323
Maybe he said...that..

534
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:30,405
The birth of love is a subversion

535
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:32,364
of any kind of social order

536
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:34,005
on our life!

537
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,998
Cooper said this!

538
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,723
And this is what happened to us!

539
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:50,478
Gaetano! Didn’t you go...
You met him!?

540
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,842
Aunt...
- No no no no, please, don’t think bad!

541
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:54,076
I love you!
- Aunt, I am not thinking anything..

542
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,397
No, no! I must explain
everything...

543
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,443
There’s nothing...
- No, no no! Come with me!

544
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:01,803
I must explain
I...no you don’t think bad...

545
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:07,116
Her husband... her husband!!

546
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:08,481
What should I do?!

547
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:12,082
What should I do?! I waited,
Gaetano, I waited!

548
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,839
I suffered too much solitude!

549
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,645
Too much solitude, too much!!!

550
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:21,882
Be quiet! Aunt, don’t worry...
Be quiet...

551
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:25,243
Fabio is such a good person!

552
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:30,606
You meet him, didn’t you?
- He’s...really a nice person!

553
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:35,442
He’s so nice... You shouldn’t 
go away, Gaetano!...

554
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:36,721
Don’t leave me.. because of Fabio...

555
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,923
You must stay with me, you understand!

556
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:41,077
Aunt, don’t shout, please!

557
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:45,365
It’s full of people...I am not
going because of Fabio...

558
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:48,678
I am going because it’s fair
that you live together...

559
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:51,201
you see...! The professor...
live your life!

560
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,437
Aunt, don’t shout, please!

561
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:58,476
Aunt!
- Thanks! Thanks for understanding!

562
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:02,162
You are a modern man!
Not like your father...

563
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:06,160
he chased always
all my boyfriends!

564
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:07,805
When he saw me with somebody:

565
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,924
'' You stay away from
my sister!

566
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,281
Go away!

567
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,881
If I see you again with her,
I’ll smash your face, you understand me!!!

568
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,320
Don’t shout, auntie, please!

569
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,875
And my mother...my sister in law
and all the other ones!..

570
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:22,004
'' See? She has another boyfriend,
she’s a bitch!

571
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,477
What!? At her age!
Shame on her?!''

572
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,035
Why? Does love ever
gets old?

573
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,446
Why?!! Am I old, Gaetano???

574
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:33,196
No, auntie! I am not saying that...
You can...

575
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:37,678
.. even  Cooper said that..
stop it, please!..

576
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:40,123
AUNTIE!

577
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,643
I mean... calm down...

578
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:58,961
I am happy, Gaetano!

579
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:00,400
I don’t care at all!

580
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:03,718
Yes....this is good!

581
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:05,557
A U N T I E!

582
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,085
Thanks!

583
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:09,236
Thank you very much!

584
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:15,566
And he quotes Cooperr..
who’s Cooper!

585
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:20,118
My aunt really made me ashamed
in that cafe, you should see...

586
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:24,166
now. nothing! I need time
to fix things...

587
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:28,035
think if I should leave...or..
- Ok..ok

588
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:31,244
Anyway…these  are the keys.

589
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:39,120
This is the door...and this is the gate.
Can you make a copy?

590
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:44,076
And if you stay longtime, 
you have nowhere to go...

591
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,486
no problem, ok?!.

592
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,285
No, I have nowhere to go!.

593
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:50,484
I just know my aunt
and you! This is fine,

594
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,478
I would stop longtime

595
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:56,606
but…I don’t want to bother you,
..I don’t want to be a problem!

596
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:58,723
No, no problem!

597
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,877
If you feel fine!

598
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,844
If you could open yourself...

599
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:05,043
and talk to people...

600
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:08,278
you can come with me
to some houses...

601
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,198
and bring the word!

602
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:12,846
I don’t think I stay longtime!

603
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,243
Come on!

604
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:24,876
I don’t know what to say...
I am going... but I don’t know...

605
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,083
Come on…let’s go!
- But you talk!

606
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:30,802
I am not saying anything! You do..
- Ok, Ok...don’t worry...

607
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:31,637
I am not worried!

608
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:36,006
I don’t understand! What’s the use of
selling door to door

609
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,317
Jesus Christ as if he is
an encyclopedia!

610
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,557
I don’t understand!
What if they chase us away!!

611
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:42,797
That can happen!
- Ah! Therefore...!..

612
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:46,396
Don’t worry! They are my friends.
I’ve been here before...

613
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:48,443
they like us. Let’s go!

614
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:51,041
Damn, damn...

615
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:58,918
Robertino, somebody’s here!?...

616
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,962
Come on, Frank!...

617
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:05,762
Hello! This is Gaetano.

618
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,599
Are you happy to see Frank?

619
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,521
Is Gaetano American?

620
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:16,076
He is from Naples.
- Immigrant!

621
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,045
No..I am not..I had a job,
in Naples,

622
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,719
I mean...I worked ..and

623
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:23,446
I left just to travel, to know!

624
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:26,201
Then I met Frank and here I am!

625
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:29,757
Well! I’ll get you a nice
cup of warm tea!

626
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:34,477
Frankie, would you like to help me?
- No, no. Let’s go

627
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,358
No! Robertino, you stay here!

628
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:39,721
You stay with Gaetano.

629
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,126
uum time.. ..stay ..with Franky???

630
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,517
.... what?

631
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:11,321
Have you longtime...with Frankie?!

632
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:14,081
You..no.. sorry, I can’t understand you.

633
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:20,163
Have you met Frankie since long?

634
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:22,522
He said: ''Have you met Frankie 
since long!''

635
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:28,000
Ah! I understood: ''Is he dead
the guy living with Frankie''

636
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:30,004
He’s talking...!

637
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,486
Here’s the tea!

638
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:34,198
And Frank...

639
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,561
Look Frank, all negative!

640
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:44,959
Ah, very good!
I am really happy!

641
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,958
They found some glucose
in my blood!

642
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:48,765
No wonder..! When you’re getting old..

643
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,917
Come on, old lady...

644
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:52,918
I am not that young, do you know?

645
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:57,159
But I am happy because nowadays young people
are never happy.

646
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:59,715
They want everything
and they want it now.

647
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:01,843
Who’s the father of rush?!

648
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,724
Who creates rush?

649
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:04,796
The devil!

650
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,366
Right. The devil!

651
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:10,360
The loss of young people started with...
- With the hippies...

652
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:14,122
The hippies!
- The mini...

653
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,356
The mini...

654
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:17,000
The gramophone...

655
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:20,999
Not the gramophone...
- In some part also the gramophone!

656
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,357
Yes, and because of all that

657
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:24,880
people are reached the point where..

658
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,003
they have sex on the street!

659
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:30,045
But…having sex is not 
a bad thing!

660
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,324
The problem arises when you don’t
make it moderately!

661
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:36,877
I do too…also Gaetano..
we make love!

662
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,685
Just moderately..

663
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:41,520
Just moderately…we know,
there is a limit!

664
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,280
Ok! With limitation is ok!

665
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:49,441
But are young people able
to create limitations?

666
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:52,200
I think so.
- I don’t!

667
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:54,721
I trust young people, Mrs lda!

668
00:40:58,087 --> 00:41:01,921
Listen...how do you understand
when there is a limit?

669
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,438
I mean...the limit of..

670
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:15,446
Well...first of all... you start
from human resistance...got it?

671
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:18,121
I mean...first of all…never
more than five...

672
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:22,166
never more than five.. when you
make that... love...

673
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,284
never more than five...I mean..

674
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:27,358
I mean…are you graduated?

675
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,005
Yes.
- Never more than four...

676
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:33,365
Never more than four...but..
you must measure the intensity..

677
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:35,756
I mean...you don’t do just four...

678
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:39,157
because...with the intensity
they...can become five...

679
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:43,883
no...if they are four, you must consider that
in one time you shouldn’t make two!

680
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,720
Is it correct? For example
it happens that you make it once

681
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,798
and you do it so intensely

682
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,401
that two come out of that!

683
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:52,886
So, what happens...?

684
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:57,597
If that time, you made two out of one,
you just wasted one, got it?

685
00:41:57,687 --> 00:42:00,326
I mean, you lost it...then,
in that case, never more than three!

686
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:02,477
Because.. it is very difficult!

687
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,400
Maybe a little bit...
it depends on the person!

688
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:06,283
I mean, if you do it,

689
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:10,400
and you do with good feelings,
and give yourself a limit,

690
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,923
- right?
- then you realize if in one time you made it twice!

691
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:17,357
Evident! You realize because of
the way you did it..- right?!-

692
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,039
Is it clear?
- Yes!

693
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:20,640
Good, Roberto!

694
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:32,121
There’s rule! Roberto! You must
go out, save yourself, Roberto!

695
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:35,404
They closed you inside 
this museum, listen to me

696
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,559
Roberto, listen to me!
You must get out!

697
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:41,525
You must run away...
on the road... touch the women,

698
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:42,562
go to a pub, do whatever you feel,

699
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:43,523
just do it...
- But mummy...

700
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,165
Mummy will drive you crazy!

701
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:46,805
She will drive you crazy, Robertooo!

702
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:50,004
Get out...do something...complexes..

703
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:53,966
Good for you! No complexes! You have
an orchestra in your mind, Roberto!

704
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:56,237
Roberto, do something...
- Mummyyy...

705
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:59,763
Wait..! No mummy...! I am doing
this for your sake. I don’t care

706
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:02,122
if you go crazy or not...
I really don’t care!

707
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:05,279
Mummyyy! - Robè..
Mummyyy! - Robéee

708
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:06,277
Robeeertooo!
- MUMMMYYY!

709
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,323
Fuck yourself and your mummy!

710
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:21,121
Come here...damn! Come...

711
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:23,767
Why don’t you come over here!?

712
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:25,883
You’re just an object!

713
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:28,162
You can’t say: ''If I move,
I’ll change''..!

714
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:30,807
No! You’re an object here or there!!

715
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:33,560
Come on! Move on and come here.
Why can’t you do that?

716
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:36,764
You would solve all the problems
all my life!.

717
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,803
Come on, come here!.

718
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:39,797
Come!

719
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:02,359
No way...there was…a step...!

720
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:06,725
Listen Gaetano, I am pleased
that you care for me...

721
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:09,116
I am pleased that you are
pleased to stay with me,

722
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:12,882
but I would like if everything
would me more spontaneous and normal!

723
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:15,925
I mean, you shouldn’t behave like 
you are going to conquer me...

724
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:18,965
Nooo! What did I do..?

725
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,043
I mean...is something wrong?
- No.

726
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:24,358
Eh! I am...
- No, you did nothing wrong!

727
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,484
...maybe you did something!

728
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:30,161
Gaetano, you like me...
- No.

729
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:32,158
Well, then I got it wrong!

730
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:34,317
I mean, I like you, but

731
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:36,921
without...I mean...

732
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:39,317
I like you...like this...

733
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:43,286
..like...a sister...!..

734
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:45,924
Well, then!

735
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,197
Hi Frank!

736
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,077
Hi Frank! Excuse me Frank,
where’s the key?

737
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,601
I don’t know!

738
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:26,445
Strange. It has always been there!

739
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:29,644
I don’t know.
- I got your ''I don’t know!!.

740
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,721
I can’t do that...
I get a block...when I am...

741
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:37,605
even in public restrooms,
I can never...

742
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:40,838
I am always afraid if somebody
come is and I get a block!.

743
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:43,395
But it’s only you and me,

744
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,318
I know that you are inside.

745
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:48,524
That’s true!

746
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,686
Excuse me Frank, what time is it?

747
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:02,597
I don’t know!

748
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,721
Frank, I know, it’s about
what happened today!

749
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:09,037
Sure!

750
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:11,641
Sure. It wasn’t a question..
I got it!

751
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,276
Sure...
- Maybe I insisted too much to bring you with me..

752
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:17,278
and I committed a mistake!

753
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:19,164
I surely did a mistake!

754
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:23,445
But you had no right 
to have fun of those nice people!

755
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:26,997
Mrs Ida is pissed off
because of that!

756
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:27,917
Yes.. Mrs lda!

757
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:30,681
Frank, you saw the way she treats him?!!

758
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:34,521
So what, do you think you helped him?

759
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:37,041
And what if you were in his place?!

760
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,517
Ah! If it was for my father,
I would surely be like!

761
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:44,043
Sure! But fortunately 
I realized it. And I am safe!

762
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:47,802
Right, because the sons need to 
get safe from their fathers!

763
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:51,763
Right! But...for my father,
you can’t understand..!

764
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:53,326
I mean...for my father
I’ve always been stupid!

765
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:56,717
Whatever I did,
he didn’t like it!

766
00:46:56,807 --> 00:47:00,163
Whatever I did, there was always
somebody that did it better,

767
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:01,919
somebody’s son was always better 
than me!

768
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:04,077
I remember…there was a child..

769
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,078
that lived just nearby...

770
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,158
his name was Angelo!

771
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:09,680
I will never forget him, Angelo!

772
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,883
He ruined my life,
that child!

773
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,077
How old was he?
seven or eight.

774
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:18,160
Damn!
He knew by heart the multiplication table!

775
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:20,477
He knew all the capitals of the world!

776
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:24,003
He could do summation, substraction,
multiplication, division

777
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:25,759
and he even played piano.

778
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:27,565
Disgusting!!!

779
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:29,763
That was not a child!
He was a monster!

780
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:32,805
I mean, thinking of all the people
that live in Naples

781
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:35,117
just a monster like that
lived near my house!

782
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:38,404
And the parents! If you have
a monster child...

783
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,125
bring him to other monsters!

784
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:42,767
Don’t bring him to me
just to poison my life!

785
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,122
And what when you grew up?

786
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,323
When I grew up, you can see..

787
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,438
I can’t pee in public restrooms...

788
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:52,081
I can’t face situations...

789
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,044
I am always in awe...

790
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:56,800
How is it going with Marta?

791
00:47:57,607 --> 00:48:00,917
Bo', sometimes it makes noises...

792
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,441
She’s not a TV!

793
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:04,880
No! How is the relationship going?

794
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:08,357
Just going! I can’t tell!

795
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,520
Ok, ok. Good night!

796
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,675
(ring)

797
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:29,407
Hello, yes, who’s speaking?
Here he is...

798
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:33,321
It’s for you...
- For me?

799
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:38,282
Hello, who is it?

800
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:44,044
Where are you? Don’t be silly
Lello, you are in Naples!

801
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:48,484
I can hear you far away!

802
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:51,604
We agreed that if you come
to Florence you would have told me.

803
00:48:51,687 --> 00:48:54,759
Come on, you are in Naples!
Don’t be silly!

804
00:48:54,847 --> 00:49:00,205
Listen, don’t let me get out..
...and then is a lie!

805
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:04,758
No, 5 minutes..10,
5..10 minutes, I am close!

806
00:49:04,927 --> 00:49:07,521
Then I picked up the telephone
and started slowly to dial!

807
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:11,122
5, 5, 9.. all the ones
and I hear :''...Hello, Hello''.

808
00:49:11,207 --> 00:49:14,165
I thought: ''Does Gaetano
speaks English?'' But...

809
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:19,558
Listen.. where can I sleep
tonight?

810
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:25,563
Raffaele...I don’t know!
We agreed you would call me!

811
00:49:25,647 --> 00:49:27,285
You should have called and I 
would have told you

812
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,561
that I was not at my aunt’s,

813
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:30,603
and what happened...
I would explain everything!

814
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:32,484
I called you
10 days ago?!

815
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:34,683
Ten days ago!

816
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:37,765
It looks as if you say,
I called you yesterday!

817
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:40,520
But even though you would call me
one day in advance

818
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,804
and  I tell you:
''It’s ok. Come!''

819
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:46,447
Then, for example,
they rob me!

820
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,916
Just think! Is it my fault
if you come and I am not there?

821
00:49:49,007 --> 00:49:52,317
Then what, if everything is fine
and I am arriving,

822
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,159
should I get down the train
every station

823
00:49:54,247 --> 00:49:57,364
and say: ''Hello, is all ok?
I am arriving,

824
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:59,244
has Gaetano been robbed?''

825
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:03,366
- Ok! - In any case, I am the one
 that doesn’t have a bed to sleep!

826
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:05,079
Is it my fault?
- Is it my fault?!

827
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:07,123
Is it my fault?
- No, it’ my fault!

828
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,402
I should have get down the train
and call!

829
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:11,284
Ok, Raffaele,
let’s go!

830
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,676
And I need to find an hotel,
a pension...

831
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:15,200
Who know how much it costs!

832
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:18,002
It was a stupid idea to come here!

833
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:19,918
Raffaele, don’t worry!
I know a pension.

834
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:21,918
We can ask how much it costs.

835
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:23,406
Yes, yes..ok!

836
00:50:31,007 --> 00:50:33,316
Raffaele, listen...

837
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,637
what about that thing....

838
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:39,117
...who leaves knows what he’s running from
but doesn’t know what he’s looking for!!!

839
00:50:39,207 --> 00:50:40,925
Is it yours, right?!

840
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:44,886
You embarrassed me so much, you did!

841
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:53,963
Raffaele, my god, let’s go there!

842
00:50:54,047 --> 00:50:56,641
Listen! It’s really far!

843
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:59,480
Not at all! Now we take this way
..seven..800metres

844
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,637
and there we are..
- Where is the bus stop?

845
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:03,638
Which bus stop?
- The bus stop to the pension.

846
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,161
Raffaele, this is not Naples!
Just around the corner!

847
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:07,162
7, 800 meters and we are there.

848
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:11,043
No, where are you going!
My legs are weak!

849
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,401
I can’t walk anymore!

850
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,921
Raffaele! It’s really close!
- No noo no!

851
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:16,679
No noo no...
- There is a bike!

852
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,399
You can’t bike!

853
00:51:18,487 --> 00:51:19,476
Take the bike and go!

854
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:20,841
You take me with the bike!

855
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:22,758
Silly! I prefer to walk!

856
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,166
You and the bike!
- Take! Hold a second...

857
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,442
No.. Raffale, please
I can’t do it!

858
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:29,121
You are not nice...
- I can’t even bike alone...

859
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:31,482
I’ll be light, I’ll be light!

860
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:35,162
Wait a moment, I’ll be light!

861
00:51:35,247 --> 00:51:38,125
I’ll be light!
- I can’t bike that well!

862
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,926
Both of us!
- Go, go...go.. I am light!

863
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:48,083
No! That way! This way! Be light!
- How can I be light!?

864
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,078
Why do you say then:
''I’ll be light!''

865
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:55,480
Go, go...
- You just walk! Be light!

866
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:57,523
Liar!

867
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:07,717
Did you find?
- Eh...found!?

868
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,163
7000 liras! A room.
7000 liras!

869
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:17,635
Be patient! Just tell me...
how much would you pay the pension?

870
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:20,799
Apart that I wouldn’t spend
anything...

871
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:25,199
-My god, again!
-Because when a friend calls you

872
00:52:25,287 --> 00:52:29,280
and say: ''Come to Florence, don’t worry,
I take care!''

873
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:33,883
Then you realize than 7000 liras
are a lot of money!

874
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:36,003
Raffaele, I just can’t
understand!

875
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:39,682
Any pension we go
you start talking about money!

876
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:41,723
So what, is it forbidden?

877
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:44,446
Surely not! 
It’s the fourth time you do that!

878
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:48,321
Surely yes! If any pension we go
is expensive, I do that!

879
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:50,398
You’re so difficult!

880
00:52:50,487 --> 00:52:52,318
That room is too big,
that room is too small!

881
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:55,763
That costs 7000lira, that one costs
12000!...It goes on and on!

882
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:58,645
I understand! I am too difficult!

883
00:52:58,727 --> 00:53:05,280
Drive me to another pension!

884
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:08,359
Drive me to another pension!
As if I were a taxi driver!

885
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:11,405
Light!
- I can’t stand my legs anymore!

886
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:15,241
I’ll get light!

887
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:23,115
Listen...why don’t we go to that pension
close by...

888
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:26,882
Are you in a hurry?
Do you have an appointment?

889
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,925
No, just to  know! But
Do you have an appointment!?

890
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,042
Eh! Just to know, Raffaele!?

891
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:33,482
It’s the fourth time you ask me:
'' Do you have an appointment?''!

892
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,966
Yes, but you are not answering!

893
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:37,083
You and your secrets!

894
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:41,160
My secrets! I have an appointment,
got it?

895
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:44,802
With whom?
- Damn! ‘‘Just to know’’, eh?

896
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:46,798
But since you are going to tell me, just do that!

897
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:48,718
I am not going to tell you, Raffaele!

898
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:51,446
You’ve been buzzing in my ears:
'' Where are you going, where?''

899
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:53,677
And I am the one that keeps secrets!

900
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:55,564
Are you going to tell me or not?

901
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:58,480
With a woman,... is it fine?

902
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:05,040
A woman?! A woman?!'

903
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:07,721
'A woman?!'
A woman!

904
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:13,962
A normal woman, I mean....normal!

905
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:15,480
Are you happy?

906
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:19,276
Yes but, what if I can’t find a pension??

907
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:22,160
You call me at Frank’s 
and see what we can do, is it ok?

908
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:27,196
Please Raffaele, I have to go...
- Wait...leave me the bike!

909
00:54:27,287 --> 00:54:30,723
Raffaele, you can’t bike!
- Maybe somebody will drive me to!

910
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:32,684
I can get light, you know,
don’t worry!

911
00:54:32,767 --> 00:54:35,156
What do you mean...somebody!
Ok, keep the bike!

912
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:51,315
I feel a bit anxious!

913
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:53,796
Oh god!

914
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:01,879
Gaetaaa
- Oooh!

915
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,999
Gaetaaa, somebody called 
from the hospital...

916
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:08,477
your friend Lello
had an accident!

917
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:11,206
What? An accident?

918
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:14,882
I didn’t quite understand..
nothing serious, though.

919
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:18,642
An accident with the bike!
- He’s such an idiot!

920
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:20,837
Should I go to the hospital?
- I don’t know...

921
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:23,760
Damn... my appointment
what should I do know!?

922
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,798
Doctor, a visit for Mr Sodano.

923
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:36,756
He wants to talk to you.

924
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:39,486
Are you Mr Sodano’s friend?

925
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:44,357
Yes.
- It is just  a little shock!

926
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:48,156
Deriving from fear more than the fall..

927
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:51,000
it is usually always like that!

928
00:55:51,087 --> 00:55:54,397
We’ve visited him carefully

929
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:58,606
because he looks very plethoric!

930
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:04,842
- Plethoric...?!
..He’s a nice guy!

931
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:08,283
I can assure you!

932
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:10,676
I mean a nice guy, he is so..

933
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,406
He’s so young!
So, sometimes....

934
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:16,843
you know…he thinks that...
he starts being plethoric!

935
00:56:16,927 --> 00:56:17,882
Are you from Naples?
- Yes!

936
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:20,879
Immigrant?
- Yes!

937
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:54,920
Lello...Lello...LELLO!
- Eee!

938
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:58,397
I am Remigio!

939
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:06,485
There you are..
I was looking for you...

940
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:09,400
I came in, calling at any bed!

941
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:10,636
Yes, I saw you!

942
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,287
Well, why didn’t you call me!
I bothered those people!

943
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:16,040
What happened!

944
00:57:16,127 --> 00:57:17,879
I fell from the bike!

945
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,357
You stupid!
- My head is turning and turning..!

946
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:23,324
That’s nothing...
- Right.. nothing..!

947
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,999
I talked to the doctor!

948
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:27,203
He said: ''A little shock!

949
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:30,120
A shock is a shock!

950
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:33,882
Yes but, if it’s only a shock...
then you are fine!

951
00:57:34,047 --> 00:57:37,164
I thought: It may be big,
or small, got it?

952
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:40,523
Ok but he really specified:
''It’s a little shock!''

953
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,882
How much is little! It’s nothing!

954
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:45,276
Yes, but I can’t even raise
my head!

955
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:49,155
Don’t worry! Listen...it’s late.
Everybody is asleep.

956
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:51,203
I go away.
See you tomorrow.

957
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:58,045
Ok, ok. Can you give me some water?
I’ve something in my throat...

958
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:02,996
Here it is!
- Thanks!

959
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:10,759
Ok?
- Yes!

960
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:14,960
I am going.
Don’ worry, ok?

961
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:18,642
He said it:' It’s nothing...''
- He doesn’t know!

962
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:22,515
He knows! He’s a specialist!
He speaks German!

963
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:26,919
German?!!
- He’s German. He speaks German.

964
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:30,477
He says: ''DO NOT WORRRRY!'',
with all those German ‘‘rrrr’’!

965
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:33,798
I think he is...!
You know, those people...

966
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:37,482
Talking about the doctor...
what do you think about him?

967
00:58:37,607 --> 00:58:45,195
Why you ask me?- - He’s fine,
but I think he’s too much...

968
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:50,407
He was nice to me!
- Was he? Alright then!

969
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:55,766
Why you ask?
- Nothing! I just think he’s too much...

970
00:58:55,847 --> 00:59:00,523
Too much...always with that ‘rrr’...
really German...you know!

971
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:01,517
Did he take something out of his pocket?

972
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:04,405
Nooo! That’s his finger!
His stiff finger, like that!

973
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:07,763
As long as it is just the finger, so what?!
- I know, but he always keeps it...

974
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:14,406
that piece of finger
so German! ..That finger...

975
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:17,923
Don’t scare me!
I am going to stay all night here!!

976
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:21,397
No, it’s just his finger!
- Don’t say anything then!

977
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:25,446
I insist...to be true...he always keep it...
but he wasn’t threatening...

978
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:29,884
it’s just a finger... German or Italian!
- That’s the same!

979
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:32,959
I am going then, ok?

980
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:35,720
Ehe!
- See you tomorrow.
I still have that appointment.

981
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:40,278
I ran here!
- Be patient, give me some more water,

982
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:43,165
please! It’s not going away...

983
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:53,361
Did it?
- I think so.

984
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:57,486
Listen, the important thing is...
...I was a little scared...

985
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:02,083
But this German guy told me..

986
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:05,477
I mean...he has that finger..
but he’s really comforting!

987
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,764
Ok? In any case
tonight you have a bed!

988
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:11,998
You saved 7000 liras!

989
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:16,399
My head is still turning!
- Be quiet, don’t worry!

990
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:20,878
See you tomorrow!?
- Yes!..Fine...some more water, please!

991
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:22,844
More water...
- What do you have?

992
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:24,918
A thing in my throat is not going away!

993
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:34,641
Did it?
- I think so!

994
01:00:35,687 --> 01:00:40,283
I ran here..Frank told me.
He said to go.....

995
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:44,121
You’re right...
- Don’t worry..It’s a little shock

996
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,675
He’s German, but his finger..

997
01:00:46,767 --> 01:00:50,362
Everything will be fine, ok?
- Don’ worry...

998
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,403
Be good! Don’t scare me!

999
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:58,039
I am going...the bottle is here...
in case you need!

1000
01:00:58,127 --> 01:01:00,766
Bye!

1001
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:03,640
Do you want some champagne?

1002
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:09,522
We celebrate!

1003
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,517
Did you want to cheer?

1004
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:29,365
No..I just wanted...!

1005
01:01:29,447 --> 01:01:31,358
You want to cheer!
Confess it!

1006
01:01:31,447 --> 01:01:36,726
No.. I always do that before...
nothing!.. Sorry, I wanted to cheer...

1007
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:39,680
Where are you going? 
- I need the restroom!

1008
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:44,966
Listen Gaetano, your shyness


1009
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:48,005
I think, is something
you hide behind..

1010
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:53,997
you are always too worried
about yourself,

1011
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:55,600
about what you do, what you say...

1012
01:01:55,687 --> 01:01:58,645
you think that everybody’s always
looking at you!

1013
01:01:58,727 --> 01:02:03,926
To spy you, to control you! And this
blocks you.

1014
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:06,680
This is being arrogant, not being shy!

1015
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:09,076
How can you think that people
has nothing else to do

1016
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:11,158
other than taking care of you!

1017
01:02:11,247 --> 01:02:13,920
This is the way I am, I am weird!

1018
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:16,316
No..no.
- Don’t you need to pee!

1019
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:21,839
I mean..! When there’s somebody
around I can’t...

1020
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:23,997
Why don’t you say that?!

1021
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:26,362
I am closing the door!

1022
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:31,406
But talk to me. Talk!

1023
01:02:31,487 --> 01:02:32,920
TALK!

1024
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,840
When?..Now?

1025
01:03:37,487 --> 01:03:38,681
What time is it?

1026
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:41,201
It’s two!

1027
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:43,721
Damn! It’s late!

1028
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:46,367
For what?
- For what?

1029
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,438
Late for what..to sleep?

1030
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,637
No...no..no!

1031
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,605
Are you sleepy?

1032
01:03:53,647 --> 01:04:00,598
No, it’s late because...I mean..
two a.m. has always been late to me!

1033
01:04:00,687 --> 01:04:05,886
I remember...when I was home
some friends, with somebody..

1034
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:10,006
at some point we said:
''What time is it?''

1035
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:14,717
''It’s two am!''.. Wow! It’s late!
I mean.. at two am is always late!

1036
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:16,479
Do you want to sleep here?

1037
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:21,595
If not...it’s late...

1038
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:25,162
Which side do you sleep?

1039
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:28,199
It’s the same to me!

1040
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:29,276
Then you sleep here.

1041
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:31,756
Can I sleep here?

1042
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:36,398
Sure.
- I am closer to the door, you know! I am more..

1043
01:04:36,487 --> 01:04:38,284
I go to the restroom!

1044
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:09,316
Snifff!

1045
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:47,397
Snifff!

1046
01:06:47,447 --> 01:06:48,960
(water flush)

1047
01:08:04,007 --> 01:08:05,963
It’s because you don’t trust yourself!

1048
01:08:15,527 --> 01:08:19,486
Come on silly, I know you’re not asleep!

1049
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:43,161
But, before, I was sleeping, I swear!

1050
01:08:43,247 --> 01:08:49,038
Hey, we need more wine!

1051
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:03,803
Raffaee, Raffaeee! Eeee Raffaeee..

1052
01:09:03,887 --> 01:09:06,037
Eee!
- Come here a moment!

1053
01:09:06,127 --> 01:09:08,322
I am eating!

1054
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:12,241
The bottle is falling!

1055
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:13,680
Thanks, Gianna!

1056
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:26,641
Why don’t you come down!
I am eating!

1057
01:09:30,807 --> 01:09:34,766
Finally you have some wine too!

1058
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:43,686
Are you from Naples?
- Yes, but I am not an immigrant.

1059
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:47,476
No, no. Just pointing out as if
Naples people can’t travel!

1060
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:48,801
As if they just immigrate!

1061
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:51,606
Can’t you just travel!

1062
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,997
Naples people travel, that’s normal!

1063
01:09:58,047 --> 01:10:00,481
Gaetano, I was thinking...

1064
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:03,957
I could sleep at Frank’s...

1065
01:10:04,047 --> 01:10:06,481
What do you mean you sleep 
at Frank’s!

1066
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:07,397
I sleep at Frank’s!

1067
01:10:07,487 --> 01:10:10,638
Listen: at Frank’s you 
have a bed, right?

1068
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:12,797
I have a bed at Frank’s...

1069
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:15,447
So, since you have a bed,
we could do this:

1070
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:18,803
I lay on the top, you lay
on the feet side, and we fit well!

1071
01:10:18,887 --> 01:10:22,482
Frank’s bed is so small:

1072
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:23,886
you on the top side
and me on the feet side!

1073
01:10:23,967 --> 01:10:26,322
That’s easy! 
I can get very small!

1074
01:10:26,407 --> 01:10:30,400
The same way you get light on the bike!

1075
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:33,160
What do you mean, didn’t I 
get light?

1076
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:39,243
Raffaele, please, sit down!
We talk about it later...go away.

1077
01:10:39,327 --> 01:10:43,684
But I am spending a lot of money,
you understand!?

1078
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:47,476
What money! Sit down!

1079
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:50,559
We talk later! Damn!

1080
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:58,039
I can’t understand...if you have
a tractor in the countryside that doesn’t work!

1081
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:02,995
I think that’s impossible..
hey, Gaetano...

1082
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:06,397
Do you still do the same thing?

1083
01:11:06,487 --> 01:11:08,318
Do you still insist!

1084
01:11:08,447 --> 01:11:12,235
But, if you can move it,
what’s the purpose?

1085
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,636
What’s the purpose?

1086
01:11:14,727 --> 01:11:18,322
I fix everything! Tv people
start coming,

1087
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:21,843
the reporters! Everybody says:
 ''You are the one that...

1088
01:11:21,927 --> 01:11:24,839
can move objects?
Move that.'' You pay..

1089
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,806
Ya, right! As if they would pay you!
- Why not!

1090
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:33,324
That would be a great thing..
the scientists would come here!

1091
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:37,798
All the important people say:
''We want to study your case..

1092
01:11:37,887 --> 01:11:41,277
You can move objects.
Move this...!'' You pay!

1093
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:43,961
It will become a job,

1094
01:11:44,047 --> 01:11:48,404
because, I think, it might
involve the government,

1095
01:11:48,487 --> 01:11:52,446
I mean the Government should create a job
like this, about having powers,

1096
01:11:52,527 --> 01:11:55,405
moving objects,
read the mind,

1097
01:11:55,487 --> 01:11:58,877
all this strange things! It should give it
to all the southern people,!

1098
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:03,483
Everybody moving objects, having powers...

1099
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:08,800
as the jobs created for the industry...!
Why don’t they give us those powers!

1100
01:12:08,887 --> 01:12:12,402
But the Government will never do that..
it would keep those powers for itself!

1101
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:16,275
Ok, but give us some industry!
Just something, to make money!

1102
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:19,484
Nowadays industry is powerless,
what can you do?!!

1103
01:12:19,527 --> 01:12:24,965
Nothing! Just being satisfied! 
Just to say: ''I had the industry,

1104
01:12:25,047 --> 01:12:26,958
I had something too!

1105
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:29,038
Just to be contented!

1106
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:31,687
Come here, damned you!

1107
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:33,120
Why don’t you come here!

1108
01:12:52,287 --> 01:12:59,682
Marta, if I would look like that...

1109
01:12:59,767 --> 01:13:01,166
would you love me anyway?

1110
01:13:01,247 --> 01:13:02,726
Yes.

1111
01:13:02,807 --> 01:13:04,445
And you, if I would look like that?

1112
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:06,279
Like what?

1113
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:07,163
Like that!

1114
01:13:07,407 --> 01:13:08,681
You look like that!

1115
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,564
You are ugly!

1116
01:13:14,487 --> 01:13:18,844
If we make a baby.. you like that
and me like that! He would be a monster!

1117
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:22,442
No, no..no. If we make a baby
he should be beautiful!

1118
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:26,281
Ok. I like the idea.
How do we make he?

1119
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:29,643
The eyes. Your eyes or my eyes?

1120
01:13:29,727 --> 01:13:31,001
Mine!

1121
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:32,725
Yes, they are nicer..!

1122
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:36,083
The nose?
- The nose...

1123
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:38,004
My nose. Yours is too big!

1124
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:39,361
Yes, I have this thing...!

1125
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:42,280
My son that...
- Wait, be serious...

1126
01:13:42,447 --> 01:13:45,917
The mouth...
- The mouth can be...

1127
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:48,601
No, no no, it’mine!
- Then I am shit!

1128
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:50,723
Nothing I have is good!
Only the ears!

1129
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:53,116
Your mouth is too narrow!

1130
01:13:53,207 --> 01:13:55,084
My mother says that people
with narrow mouth are mean!

1131
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,680
That is nonsense!

1132
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:57,882
I heard it many times

1133
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,276
this thing of the narrow mouth!
I know somebody with such a huge mouth.

1134
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:04,758
He killed father, mother, grandma!
If they wouldn’t stop him, it would’ve been a massacre!

1135
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:06,326
A huge mouth...!

1136
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:07,965
You now what’s really important?

1137
01:14:08,047 --> 01:14:09,526
Really, if we make a baby)

1138
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:10,437
(ring)

1139
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:14,322
..One moment.!

1140
01:14:16,527 --> 01:14:18,438
Who’s that?
- Hi, I am Lello!

1141
01:14:18,527 --> 01:14:19,960
Hi. Are you coming up?

1142
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:22,561
Can I talk to Gaetano?
- Do you want to come up?

1143
01:14:22,647 --> 01:14:25,957
Yes, I’ll do that. Can I talk to Gaetano.
- Ok, wait..

1144
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:32,486
It’s Lello.
- Is he coming up?

1145
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:33,920
No. He wants to talk to you:

1146
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:36,646
Better if you go to the restroom,
Lello has a narrow mouth!

1147
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:43,000
Lello...Lello...

1148
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:47,564
Lello...Lello...

1149
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,600
Lello...

1150
01:14:49,687 --> 01:14:51,086
Gaetano...

1151
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,282
He’s behind the door!

1152
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:55,040
What are you doing?''...

1153
01:14:55,127 --> 01:14:57,846
I was downstairs, I thought:
''I will go up..''

1154
01:14:57,927 --> 01:15:00,043
- You always do strange things!

1155
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:02,083
I should come up and I did it!

1156
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:04,317
Either you just say I wait,
or you say I come up!

1157
01:15:04,407 --> 01:15:05,726
You can’t do both things
at same time:

1158
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:09,117
first you ask to talk on the phone..
then you decide to come up!

1159
01:15:13,127 --> 01:15:15,402
That’s nice here!

1160
01:15:18,887 --> 01:15:20,002
You found a good place!

1161
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:38,684
Ash-tray, record, telephone.
Hello.. hello hello...

1162
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:42,442
Raffaele shut up,
can’t you see it’s fake!

1163
01:15:42,527 --> 01:15:45,200
It’s not connected. Hello!

1164
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:48,199
What’s the point of having
a disconnected telephone!

1165
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:52,121
It’s a decoration!

1166
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:54,084
Doesn’t it work?
- No, it doesn’t, it’s a decoration!

1167
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:57,045
And the radio? Does it work?
- No. It doesn’t work too!

1168
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:59,760
No, please Raffaele don’t touch
anything! It’s breakable!

1169
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:04,483
It doesn’t work and it does...
It’s a decoration!

1170
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:12,162
They’re just decorative things.
Why should you touch everything!

1171
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:20,878
Why don’t you put something
in these bottles!?

1172
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:22,844
They’re all empty!!
- All empty!

1173
01:16:22,927 --> 01:16:25,441
Some water would fit it!
- No, don’t touch anything!

1174
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:28,160
She’s in the restroom...
she’ll see you touch everything!

1175
01:16:28,247 --> 01:16:33,275
It’s decoration...
she come out and you are...

1176
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:36,285
Damn!
- I do nothing, I’m just looking!

1177
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:38,756
You’re early this morning!
- So what?

1178
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:42,806
It’s nine and and you’re already here!
- I had a walk...

1179
01:16:42,887 --> 01:16:45,685
You had a walk?! Just think!
And where did you end up to? Just here!

1180
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,520
Just on our door!
- No. I came un purpose!

1181
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:51,440
On purpose! I thought
you were passing by!

1182
01:16:51,527 --> 01:16:54,803
On purpose! Instead,
I was sleeping,

1183
01:16:54,887 --> 01:16:57,879
Sleeping? At nine...!
- Damn, what’s your problem!

1184
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:00,561
Your hands are everywhere.
- That’s not true...

1185
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:03,559
Don’t touch, please.
If she comes out...please!

1186
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:06,639
It’s not my fault if I am so early!!

1187
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:09,002
The lady knocked on my door
at 6.30: 

1188
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,726
''Did you decide? 
Are you keeping the room or not?''

1189
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:15,806
I said: ''No, no! I am leaving also my bag!''

1190
01:17:15,887 --> 01:17:18,526
I thought: ''Maybe I’ll find
a place...

1191
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:20,558
or you could find it''

1192
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:22,285
I would save 7000 liras..
- Me, find a place for you!?

1193
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:26,918
7000 liras! I am in Florence
... just as her guest...

1194
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:28,884
and should find a place for you!

1195
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:31,197
If you can’t find it, who can?
- I am a guest, I can’t!

1196
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:33,801
Damn! That’s true! I thought
it was a decoration!

1197
01:17:33,887 --> 01:17:37,277
And this too?!
- I come here, who know how..!

1198
01:17:37,367 --> 01:17:39,517
Your problem is that you’re
a difficult guy, Raffaele!

1199
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:43,282
You are difficult! Otherwise
Marta could have a place...I mean

1200
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:44,646
A bed where she works!

1201
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:45,603
Is there the chance of a bed?

1202
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:49,441
I mean..where does she work? 
She said there’s a bed available...

1203
01:17:49,527 --> 01:17:51,916
Something like..
- Don’t worry then! Alright.

1204
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:53,725
To me whatever is fine!
Don’t worry!

1205
01:17:53,807 --> 01:17:56,321
Where does Marta works?

1206
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:59,638
A place nearby, she works...

1207
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:02,002
What’s her job?

1208
01:18:02,087 --> 01:18:04,476
I told you, a place nearby!

1209
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:07,286
A place where you can sleep..
Really close!

1210
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:10,165
Ok, I got it. But what is it,
an industry?!

1211
01:18:10,247 --> 01:18:12,078
No, no, no...
- Is it an office?...

1212
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:13,646
Not really, its a place...
- Industrial?...

1213
01:18:13,727 --> 01:18:16,036
It’s place where she goes, I mean

1214
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:18,516
it’s her real job..

1215
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:23,476
like... I mean..
as if she were...

1216
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:27,401
I mean! She goes there...
- Right...,

1217
01:18:27,527 --> 01:18:28,642
Does she work there?!
- Yes.

1218
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:30,843
It’s really close!

1219
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:33,435
And then?
- Raffaele, why you’re so close?

1220
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:36,087
There’s so much space,
and you walk just behind me?

1221
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:39,682
You’re stuck to me,
I don’t feel at ease!

1222
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:42,281
Take it off your hands!
Put it somewhere...

1223
01:18:42,327 --> 01:18:45,125
Put it there. You’re walking around
with that thing in your arms!

1224
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:48,597
You are inside the house.
Can you see thieves?

1225
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,803
Nobody will touch it, put it there!

1226
01:18:50,887 --> 01:18:52,957
I just don’t want to forget it,
you understand?!!

1227
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:55,515
Ok, you are so difficult! I knew!

1228
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:59,077
I told you it’s a place nearby!

1229
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,318
You keep on saying: ''nearby!'',
but what’s her job?

1230
01:19:02,407 --> 01:19:04,841
I am just telling you!
You pretend you don’t understand!

1231
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:05,996
I don’t understand? You didn’t say!

1232
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:10,524
I am telling you she goes there
and she is a kind of nurse...

1233
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:12,996
Ah! Then it’s an hospital?

1234
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:19,606
It might be!

1235
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,166
It might be?! Is it or not?

1236
01:19:21,247 --> 01:19:26,685
This place..where normal people go

1237
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:29,235
first of all normal! Normal people!

1238
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:32,478
Normal. Normal people!

1239
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:36,526
Just keep it in your mind for the future,
when you will understand...

1240
01:19:36,607 --> 01:19:40,282
Normal people...go there
and then...

1241
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:44,042
Nothing..you get it?
all normal people that sometimes...

1242
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,836
But:..normal!

1243
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:50,680
You don’t think. if one of them
talks to you...just ignore him!

1244
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:51,404
Normal people
- ...normal people?!

1245
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53,284
Sometimes...!

1246
01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:55,562
I mean..like you! Are you normal?

1247
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,399
But it happens...to people sometimes!!

1248
01:19:57,487 --> 01:19:59,239
What is it? Gaetano, what is it?

1249
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,477
Normal but...you understand!?

1250
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:04,445
That is not...
- What do they do?

1251
01:20:04,527 --> 01:20:07,166
Sometimes, Raffaele, you got it!
- What?! Do they dance! What?

1252
01:20:07,247 --> 01:20:09,681
Dance! Normal people,
that sometimes...!

1253
01:20:09,767 --> 01:20:12,884
you got it!!!
- What is it, an asylum?

1254
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:16,039
Not really... Go away!
And for 7000 liras

1255
01:20:16,127 --> 01:20:18,687
I should go and sleep
with ‘‘normal’’ people!!

1256
01:20:18,887 --> 01:20:22,323
''Michele has been cheated,
forgotten.

1257
01:20:22,407 --> 01:20:25,126
Michele couldn’t understand
and forced me to lie,

1258
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:27,801
Michele was to me
somebody far away.

1259
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:30,526
He was somebody that I love 
and I was loved from

1260
01:20:30,607 --> 01:20:33,121
but he wanted to possess me
with the blindness of a child.

1261
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:35,767
(RING!)
- Stay there...

1262
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:37,838
You go on, I’ll open the door!

1263
01:20:43,327 --> 01:20:45,761
hi..sorry..nothing, hi!

1264
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:48,963
Hi!

1265
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:51,481
Then?
- Finished.

1266
01:20:51,687 --> 01:20:54,155
Who’s this?
- I sit there...

1267
01:20:54,247 --> 01:20:56,886
(friends chatting)

1268
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:07,087
Not in front of TV!.

1269
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,044
No, wait..what are you doing?!

1270
01:21:09,127 --> 01:21:12,722
Do you think God is going to appear?

1271
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:14,843
God!..That is second channel!

1272
01:21:15,487 --> 01:21:17,398
Ok, let us go on, ok?!

1273
01:21:17,487 --> 01:21:20,559
Do you feel? Or shall we continue
tomorrow at your place?

1274
01:21:20,647 --> 01:21:23,366
No, no. Go on.
We finish the chapter.

1275
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:27,406
Well…''he wanted to possess me
with the blindness of a child.

1276
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:31,036
I would have been part of his jealousy,

1277
01:21:31,127 --> 01:21:32,526
of his damned evidence that,

1278
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:34,040
as he said, are true.

1279
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:36,846
Better be a liar and pretend 
he wouldn’t know,

1280
01:21:36,927 --> 01:21:39,885
he wouldn’t understand. I was making love.

1281
01:21:41,447 --> 01:21:42,926
This is what I was thinking,

1282
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:45,123
while Vanni wasted his sweetness
on my body,

1283
01:21:45,207 --> 01:21:47,038
embittered by my mind flying away!

1284
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:50,637
Vanni was young,
he was younger than me

1285
01:21:50,727 --> 01:21:53,241
with a tenderness not yet hardened
by life failures!

1286
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:56,603
I wanted so much to make love to him

1287
01:21:56,687 --> 01:21:59,155
as he was so sweet and childish.

1288
01:21:59,327 --> 01:22:01,841
Maybe I was looking for a son,
and not for a lover!''

1289
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:04,879
So! What do you think?

1290
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,606
I think this part is too much..
- No, no. I like it..

1291
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:10,406
go on...
- No, it’s nice! I like it too!

1292
01:22:10,527 --> 01:22:14,486
I like it because, I mean,
it’s all invented!

1293
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:17,798
This fantasy that people can

1294
01:22:17,887 --> 01:22:21,357
invent...from nothing..!
I mean... it’s not true, is it?

1295
01:22:21,487 --> 01:22:24,001
Because...you know.. it’s not true?!

1296
01:22:24,087 --> 01:22:27,079
But still there is imagination,
got it?...

1297
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:30,239
I like this power of fantasy!

1298
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:34,559
Well!: ''We looked for
a place to make love,

1299
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:38,401
always lost to get together on a bench,
at the bus stop,

1300
01:22:38,527 --> 01:22:41,564
and now that we found it,
I was thinking to something else.

1301
01:22:41,647 --> 01:22:43,842
Maybe Vanni noticed it

1302
01:22:43,927 --> 01:22:46,316
and slowly, without asking,

1303
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:47,442
he laid next to me.

1304
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:49,643
I don’t know why,

1305
01:22:49,727 --> 01:22:52,878
but then I hugged him tight,
so tight!''..

1306
01:22:52,967 --> 01:22:56,960
In my opinion, writers are liars!

1307
01:22:57,047 --> 01:22:59,880
You say it’s all fantasy
but it’s really not!

1308
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:05,519
It’s all true! What about Dante!

1309
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:08,360
Didn’t he know Beatrice!?

1310
01:23:08,487 --> 01:23:13,117
And Leopardi? He really knew Silvia!

1311
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,755
So! It’s all true!

1312
01:23:15,847 --> 01:23:18,680
Leopardi knew Silvia!
Shut up! That’s nonsense!

1313
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:25,724
So, you think that poets, writers...
I mean..we don’t care about what you say!

1314
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:28,275
I mean..do you all guys really care?

1315
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:31,723
You always interrupt!

1316
01:23:31,807 --> 01:23:35,402
Harmony, atmosphere!
You’ve always something to say!

1317
01:23:35,527 --> 01:23:39,918
That’s just fantasy! why people 
start writing, then?

1318
01:23:40,007 --> 01:23:42,567
In my opinion,
to tell things that happen to them!

1319
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:46,720
Again! You insist...damn!

1320
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:50,561
He was right, that guy, 
to say that you are stupid!

1321
01:23:50,647 --> 01:23:52,842
What? Who said I am stupid?

1322
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:56,442
That guy..Marco!

1323
01:23:56,527 --> 01:23:57,880
Marco, did you say I am stupid?

1324
01:23:57,967 --> 01:23:59,320
Not at all!

1325
01:23:59,407 --> 01:24:02,922
What? Didn’t you say that Lello is stupid!?

1326
01:24:03,007 --> 01:24:03,803
Come on!

1327
01:24:03,887 --> 01:24:08,881
I heard...not that
Lello is stupid!

1328
01:24:08,967 --> 01:24:11,003
I said something like...

1329
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:14,966
I heard': ''I met so many stupid guys,
but none compared to Lello!!''

1330
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:18,039
Anyway, that movie was terrible!

1331
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:20,766
It really scared me!

1332
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:26,200
But, if they’d torture you,
like in the movie,

1333
01:24:26,287 --> 01:24:30,724
would you talk?
- Yes! I wouldn’t need to be tortured!

1334
01:24:30,807 --> 01:24:34,163
It would be enough if they tell me,
for example,

1335
01:24:34,247 --> 01:24:38,081
''If you don’t talk
- maybe - we torture you''

1336
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:42,604
I would immediately talk, write,
or make a drawing if they can’t understand!

1337
01:24:42,927 --> 01:24:44,963
So you’re worse than Judas?!

1338
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:48,198
Not at all! But I can’t 
really stand

1339
01:24:48,287 --> 01:24:50,517
physical pain!
It’s something...

1340
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:54,680
what has Judas got to do with it!
Everybody says: ''Judas traitor!''

1341
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,759
You should first know what happened.

1342
01:24:57,847 --> 01:25:00,520
Maybe Judas had a reason
to do what he did?!

1343
01:25:00,607 --> 01:25:02,677
Right?
- No. That was for money!

1344
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:05,406
For money! Isn’t that’s a good a reason!

1345
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:08,684
If he was rich all that mess
wouldn’t have happened.

1346
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:12,237
That story...the murder,
the betrayal, forget it!

1347
01:25:12,327 --> 01:25:15,444
Because I.. If I don’t know people,
I don’t like to judge!

1348
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:20,442
So! Just think...if you need
30 coins

1349
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:22,961
how much could it be,
maybe two, three hundred thousand liras,

1350
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:26,676
four hundred..maybe!
That might have fixed his problems!

1351
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:28,519
Maybe he went home

1352
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:31,997
and his wife: ''Judas
you must get a job!

1353
01:25:32,087 --> 01:25:35,204
The landlord! The electricity,
the water, the telephone...!''

1354
01:25:35,287 --> 01:25:39,405
At some point ''We need money,
we need money!''

1355
01:25:39,487 --> 01:25:43,275
He got those 30 coins and thought:
''I’ll fix my problems!''

1356
01:25:43,367 --> 01:25:43,958
That’s just an example!

1357
01:25:48,887 --> 01:25:51,082
Ok! Why don’t you tell this to Marta?

1358
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:56,446
She might write a novel! 
When she’s back, I am going to tell her...

1359
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:10,881
Are you sleeping?

1360
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:13,117
No

1361
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:18,765
I knew!
- I knew you would say: ''I knew!''

1362
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:22,078
What if I was really sleeping?

1363
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:25,565
My eyes were closed,
my breath was regular...!

1364
01:26:27,327 --> 01:26:29,204
Yes! Too much regular!

1365
01:26:29,287 --> 01:26:31,926
My sleep is regular!

1366
01:26:32,007 --> 01:26:34,077
If you sleep regular,
the breath is regular too!

1367
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,557
Is the book finished or not?

1368
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:40,366
No! I am completely stuck!

1369
01:26:40,447 --> 01:26:43,678
Three wasted days at Silvia’s!

1370
01:26:43,767 --> 01:26:45,837
The book is still at the same point.

1371
01:26:45,927 --> 01:26:48,725
I am afraid I don’t like it anymore!

1372
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:51,116
Maybe it makes me sick!

1373
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:55,166
And what did you do?

1374
01:26:55,247 --> 01:26:59,286
Nothing. I took Lello to the station.

1375
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:04,043
Did he left?
Left? He sped up!

1376
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:06,118
He ran to Naples!

1377
01:27:06,207 --> 01:27:10,041
The pension increased from 7000 liras
to 8000...

1378
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:13,164
He was on the edge of committing suicide!
You should have seen him!

1379
01:27:13,247 --> 01:27:15,715
He really ran to Naples!

1380
01:27:17,207 --> 01:27:20,802
Then, yesterday, I slept at Jann’s .

1381
01:27:20,887 --> 01:27:24,436
Ah! You had some fun!

1382
01:27:24,527 --> 01:27:31,444
Not exactly! We went to dinner,
first we went to the movies,

1383
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:37,238
then we went to dinner, then
we went home, we talked,

1384
01:27:37,327 --> 01:27:43,084
just this. We watched TV.
Then, nothing...

1385
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:46,239
Goodnight..Goodnight!

1386
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,397
And we feel asleep!

1387
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:49,715
What did you talk about?

1388
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:56,360
Nothing..I mean.. we talked all the time
about you.

1389
01:27:56,447 --> 01:27:58,961
About me!
- Yes! About you!

1390
01:28:06,487 --> 01:28:10,605
Well, if you just talked!!!

1391
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:13,724
And about me!

1392
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:15,718
Then I am happy!!!

1393
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:19,277
Maybe, considering all what we said
about being jealous,

1394
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:22,518
I shouldn’t, but I am happy!

1395
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:28,045
You know, when you told me
that you slept at Jann’s,

1396
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:35,124
I felt something like...

1397
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:38,040
jealousy,

1398
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:40,402
and that worried me!

1399
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:45,720
I thought: ''Now he will tell me
they had sex'',

1400
01:28:45,807 --> 01:28:48,765
and what will I do!?

1401
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:52,317
I can’t think what
my reaction might be,

1402
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:59,402
and this bothers me!

1403
01:29:02,687 --> 01:29:06,805
And you?
- Me what?

1404
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:10,163
Did you...

1405
01:29:11,247 --> 01:29:13,556
did it ever happened to you...

1406
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,803
...since we are together..

1407
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:28,435
that ..for example..
did you have sex with somebody else?!

1408
01:29:31,807 --> 01:29:33,081
Yes!

1409
01:29:37,527 --> 01:29:38,642
You have nothing to say?

1410
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:43,996
Nothing! What should I say!

1411
01:29:45,727 --> 01:29:48,241
Are you jealous?
- No!

1412
01:29:48,327 --> 01:29:56,007
Really not! We talked a lot about
being jealous!

1413
01:30:02,007 --> 01:30:03,804
I am going to the toilet!

1414
01:30:16,887 --> 01:30:24,475
What’s up?! You must...

1415
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:32,361
What’s up? I mean...! ''Did you
have sex...?'' ''Yes!''!

1416
01:30:32,447 --> 01:30:37,362
What I can stand is...!!

1417
01:30:37,447 --> 01:30:44,285
This thing...inside..! Boom, it burst inside
 of me! The way she said ''Yes''!

1418
01:30:44,487 --> 01:30:48,526
''Did you had sex with somebody?''
- ''Yes''! Boom...!

1419
01:30:48,607 --> 01:30:50,837
It will go away!...

1420
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:57,002
People are free!! What are you going to do?
You started a relationship

1421
01:30:57,167 --> 01:31:03,402
and ..chains!
.. chains!

1422
01:31:03,487 --> 01:31:09,323
..She meets somebody and she has sex!
I meet somebody and have sex!

1423
01:31:09,487 --> 01:31:14,242
Then, if she asks to me:
''Did you have sex...?'' ''Yes''!

1424
01:31:14,327 --> 01:31:20,084
So boom, it will burst inside of her too!

1425
01:31:20,167 --> 01:31:25,321
I mean...she’s free! I will meet somebody,
if I ever meet somebody else...!

1426
01:31:25,407 --> 01:31:28,205
If, I meet somebody else!

1427
01:31:28,287 --> 01:31:31,404
If, I meet somebody else!

1428
01:31:34,127 --> 01:31:38,166
I meet somebody and..''Did you have
sex?''..''Yes!'' ...Boom!

1429
01:31:38,247 --> 01:31:41,364
So disgusting!!!

1430
01:31:41,407 --> 01:31:46,162
Just tell me: ''I don’t know...''
''Yes''...Boom!

1431
01:31:46,247 --> 01:31:53,085
I will not show my feelings, I am going there:
 ''Goodnight'', ''Goodnight!''

1432
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:57,718
I won’t say nothing, ok?!

1433
01:31:57,807 --> 01:32:02,005
Just as nothing happened!

1434
01:32:10,087 --> 01:32:14,319
Marta, what’s the name of who invented
penicillin?

1435
01:32:14,407 --> 01:32:18,480
Fleming!
- Fleming! Damn it!

1436
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:22,446
I was in the toilet thinking ''
...What’s his name?

1437
01:32:22,527 --> 01:32:24,802
What’s his name!''
I can’t remember!

1438
01:32:24,887 --> 01:32:31,360
That’s bad because I had the ''f''...
and couldn’t remember Fleming. Fleming!

1439
01:32:31,527 --> 01:32:34,883
That’s bad when you can’t remember names!
Night!

1440
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:42,436
Goodnight! Fleming, Fleming! Damn...FF
...goodnight!

1441
01:32:51,207 --> 01:32:52,322
It’s strange!

1442
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:57,597
I am almost sad that you are not jealous!

1443
01:32:57,687 --> 01:33:00,360
I am so stupid!

1444
01:33:01,567 --> 01:33:07,642
How can it be possible that you
don’t care at all?

1445
01:33:07,727 --> 01:33:10,446
If I were you I would die
out of curiosity!

1446
01:33:10,527 --> 01:33:13,485
Aren’t you really curious?

1447
01:33:17,727 --> 01:33:19,558
Yes. Sure!

1448
01:33:19,647 --> 01:33:23,083
I am curious...but now
I am really tired!

1449
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:27,479
I have an headache! 
Thinking about that Fleming!!!!

1450
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:31,276
FFF...I got an headache!
We’ll talk about it!

1451
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:35,406
Tomorrow is better!
Goodnight!

1452
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,205
Goodnight!

1453
01:33:49,927 --> 01:33:51,246
What’s up, Gaetano?

1454
01:33:51,327 --> 01:33:53,716
Nothing!
- You are angry!

1455
01:33:57,767 --> 01:34:00,964
Why should I be angry!
That’s normal!

1456
01:34:01,047 --> 01:34:05,643
Don’t go!
- And what about the wedding?!

1457
01:34:05,727 --> 01:34:07,080
My father cares about it!

1458
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:09,158
A week. You said you would leave
on Thursday!

1459
01:34:09,207 --> 01:34:13,166
I called this morning and he said
they are already preparing..

1460
01:34:13,207 --> 01:34:16,040
it’s better to go...
- Gaetano, if that’s because of

1461
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,920
what happened last night, let’s talk!
Nobody says you can’t be jealous!

1462
01:34:19,047 --> 01:34:23,040
I am jealous too, just...

1463
01:34:23,127 --> 01:34:26,642
take it easy!
- ..Take it easy!

1464
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:30,356
Yes...but for women is easier!
Take it easy...!

1465
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:34,759
This the way women are.
You always act like this!

1466
01:34:34,847 --> 01:34:39,602
Right! It’s your way!
To us poor men, they always taught

1467
01:34:39,687 --> 01:34:43,805
about the honor...!
And beware the honor and the cuckoos!

1468
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:48,517
All these things. 
So...how can you ignore them!

1469
01:34:48,607 --> 01:34:53,203
For women it is easier!

1470
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:54,766
Then you didn’t understand anything!

1471
01:34:54,847 --> 01:34:56,838
Since we are together,
I’ve been talking to walls!

1472
01:34:56,927 --> 01:35:00,237
Not at all!
That’s my problem!

1473
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:04,036
I am trying to explain
that I can’t get free of some ideas...

1474
01:35:04,127 --> 01:35:09,247
I think, women are more..
- The women? Women what?

1475
01:35:09,327 --> 01:35:13,161
Calm down! I just said:
''Women are more..''

1476
01:35:13,287 --> 01:35:16,404
and you already get angry!

1477
01:35:16,527 --> 01:35:20,202
What if I said: ''Women are less!''
Would you eat me?

1478
01:35:20,287 --> 01:35:23,120
I am trying to explain!

1479
01:35:23,207 --> 01:35:25,880
Don’t be silly!

1480
01:35:25,967 --> 01:35:28,003
Don’t create problems!

1481
01:35:28,047 --> 01:35:31,084
Come on! We don’t need to fall
into these tricks!

1482
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:32,885
We don’t care about what other people do!

1483
01:35:32,967 --> 01:35:34,400
When there’s love, there’s everything!

1484
01:35:34,487 --> 01:35:36,557
No, that’s health!

1485
01:36:28,647 --> 01:36:30,638
Friends, let’s make a gift
to the newly-weds!

1486
01:36:42,207 --> 01:36:44,641
Nice party!

1487
01:36:44,727 --> 01:36:47,161
What a nice restaurant!
How many people!

1488
01:36:47,247 --> 01:36:49,283
The tenant’s daughter got married here too!

1489
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:51,801
This is why they are so rich!

1490
01:36:51,887 --> 01:36:53,639
Nice party, Gaetano!?

1491
01:36:53,727 --> 01:36:58,562
Yes, very nice!
- Things are going well!

1492
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:03,038
We know!... We know what happens!

1493
01:37:03,127 --> 01:37:08,042
Gaetano, did I tell you! 
The sinners on earth will be punished!

1494
01:37:08,127 --> 01:37:12,882
In Heaven there’s somebody 
who will take care of that!

1495
01:37:12,967 --> 01:37:16,198
Somebody specially appointed!

1496
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:19,000
Isn’t that true, don Gino? 

1497
01:37:19,047 --> 01:37:21,277
And I am sure that the poor man
has many other things to do,

1498
01:37:21,367 --> 01:37:25,326
punish this, punish that,
and sometimes he makes mistakes!

1499
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:30,925
Then he goes up and says:
''I am sorry, my mistake!

1500
01:37:31,007 --> 01:37:34,682
I was punishing somebody,
don Ugo was coming by,

1501
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:37,520
what should I do?'' And they:

1502
01:37:37,607 --> 01:37:42,965
'' Don’t worry, 
we’ll take care!''

1503
01:37:43,047 --> 01:37:46,119
and just in that moment,
the miracle pops out. Got it?!

1504
01:37:46,207 --> 01:37:48,038
Yes, yes!
- If I would have stayed
in my old house,

1505
01:37:48,127 --> 01:37:49,276
I would have got a miracle too!

1506
01:37:49,367 --> 01:37:51,927
How do you know you can’t still get
the miracle in the old house!

1507
01:37:51,967 --> 01:37:54,561
This is why we are losing time, got it?!

1508
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:57,923
Ehi, Ugo!
- I’m coming! Sorry don Gino, coming..

1509
01:37:58,007 --> 01:38:01,920
I know!! You think we’ll 
drive him crazy!

1510
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:07,161
Nooo! He will heal! 
He’ll get back his hand! I know!

1511
01:38:07,207 --> 01:38:10,836
Gaetano, I tried to explain to him
there’s no punisher..

1512
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:14,442
he thinks it’s an accident,
but it’s not even a punishment,

1513
01:38:14,527 --> 01:38:16,279
it’s a gift!

1514
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:19,200
Don Gino, is it ever possible,

1515
01:38:19,287 --> 01:38:21,437
that you always exaggerate!

1516
01:38:21,527 --> 01:38:24,564
First you call it miracle!
Now it’s a gift!

1517
01:38:24,647 --> 01:38:26,444
This is the way it is, my son!

1518
01:38:26,527 --> 01:38:30,156
They award the ones who feel
closer!

1519
01:38:30,247 --> 01:38:31,236
The ones they love!

1520
01:38:31,327 --> 01:38:34,956
And so the death should be accepted

1521
01:38:35,047 --> 01:38:39,279
as a divine gift! We should offer to god
all these small sufferance...

1522
01:38:39,367 --> 01:38:44,202
and be thankful to have been chosen
for this gift!

1523
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:49,202
Just explain to me, don Gino, 
is my father going to hell

1524
01:38:49,287 --> 01:38:51,039
if he won’t accept the gift!

1525
01:38:51,127 --> 01:38:53,595
young people don’t believe to anybody,
nowadays!

1526
01:38:53,647 --> 01:38:56,081
I should pray also for you!

1527
01:38:56,167 --> 01:38:58,761
No! Don’t bother, don Gino, please!

1528
01:38:58,847 --> 01:39:02,601
I might receive a gift too! Don’t bother!

1529
01:39:23,647 --> 01:39:25,683
No, wait, why?

1530
01:39:25,767 --> 01:39:30,921
Gaetano, I think I am pregnant!

1531
01:39:36,247 --> 01:39:42,083
What!.. Pregnant?..
- Wait…there’s something else...

1532
01:39:43,447 --> 01:39:49,602
I am not really sure it’s yours!

1533
01:39:55,127 --> 01:39:58,358
I am not looking for a father,
or an husband!

1534
01:39:58,487 --> 01:40:01,604
I just want this baby with you,

1535
01:40:01,687 --> 01:40:05,839
or I’ll grow him up by myself!

1536
01:40:10,687 --> 01:40:12,166
Who is he?

1537
01:40:12,247 --> 01:40:14,522
Gaetano, I don’t care for him at all!

1538
01:40:14,607 --> 01:40:16,916
I love you!

1539
01:40:20,527 --> 01:40:23,439
Is it the kid of...your novel?

1540
01:40:23,527 --> 01:40:28,999
The one who wasted his sweetness...
- Yes!

1541
01:40:29,087 --> 01:40:34,036
Damn..! What I am going to say to Lello!

1542
01:40:34,127 --> 01:40:38,359
Damn! He told me!
And he didn’t even know her!

1543
01:40:38,447 --> 01:40:40,722
I am so stupid!

1544
01:40:40,807 --> 01:40:44,641
How old is he?
- I am not going to tell you!

1545
01:40:44,727 --> 01:40:48,481
Why? Is he 8 years old?!!

1546
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:51,525
Seven, six...! How many?
- Seventeen!

1547
01:40:51,607 --> 01:41:00,163
Seventeen! Ok, maybe..
at 17 a boy  already can...

1548
01:41:00,247 --> 01:41:06,925
Is he already a man at 17?
I don’t remember...

1549
01:41:07,007 --> 01:41:10,238
And what does he think?

1550
01:41:10,327 --> 01:41:12,397
He doesn’t know!

1551
01:41:12,487 --> 01:41:17,720
Right, he might have a son

1552
01:41:17,807 --> 01:41:19,843
and he just goes on with his life, no problem,

1553
01:41:19,927 --> 01:41:21,201
all the problems to me!

1554
01:41:21,287 --> 01:41:25,280
What!
- Damn, it’s blood!

1555
01:41:25,367 --> 01:41:27,597
Let me see!
- Damn!

1556
01:41:31,447 --> 01:41:33,403
Are you sure...
- About what?

1557
01:41:37,167 --> 01:41:39,044
That you want this baby with me!

1558
01:41:41,047 --> 01:41:43,686
It’s because I love you..
that I wish everything..

1559
01:41:43,767 --> 01:41:46,361
so! anybody...
would say:.

1560
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:50,076
''Listen, I have a son
with him, but...

1561
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:54,046
I want to stay with you,
because I love you, I like you!

1562
01:41:54,127 --> 01:41:58,325
I would like to have
 a baby with you!!!''

1563
01:41:58,407 --> 01:42:03,481
It doesn’t matter who’s son is that! 
As long as you want it..!

1564
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:07,958
I can’t do that...

1565
01:42:08,047 --> 01:42:11,596
Alright! It’s a different
culture...

1566
01:42:11,687 --> 01:42:14,997
I can’t say: ''It doesn’t matter!''

1567
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:17,965
How can I be sure this is my son?

1568
01:42:18,047 --> 01:42:19,321
Just wait until he grows up.

1569
01:42:19,407 --> 01:42:21,875
If he looks like an ass-hole,
then it’s yours!

1570
01:42:41,407 --> 01:42:44,479
Let’s say this baby..

1571
01:42:44,567 --> 01:42:49,482
Let’s say this baby..

1572
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:51,478
How would we call him?

1573
01:42:51,567 --> 01:42:58,040
Well...I don’t know yet!

1574
01:42:58,127 --> 01:43:01,244
Massimiliano!

1575
01:43:01,327 --> 01:43:03,045
No..no..no! Please!

1576
01:43:03,127 --> 01:43:06,915
Not Massimiliano...
we can call him..

1577
01:43:08,287 --> 01:43:12,838
if we decide this baby will be mine...

1578
01:43:12,927 --> 01:43:17,079
I thought about ''Ugo''..

1579
01:43:17,167 --> 01:43:18,759
Like your father?

1580
01:43:18,847 --> 01:43:23,523
Yes, but I don’t care about it at all!

1581
01:43:23,607 --> 01:43:26,280
That’s just because with that name
he’ll be a polite guy.

1582
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,039
What’s wrong with Massimiliano?

1583
01:43:28,127 --> 01:43:29,640
Massimiliano is naughty!

1584
01:43:29,727 --> 01:43:32,605
I know about that! 
That’s a naughty name!

1585
01:43:32,687 --> 01:43:35,520
If.. Massimiliano for example,

1586
01:43:35,607 --> 01:43:37,916
Massimiliano his near his mum,

1587
01:43:38,007 --> 01:43:39,679
and then feels like moving away,

1588
01:43:39,767 --> 01:43:42,327
the mum takes longtime to call him back:
''Ma..ssi...mi...li..aa..no!''

1589
01:43:42,407 --> 01:43:44,762
he’s already running away!

1590
01:43:44,847 --> 01:43:47,520
He won’t obey, that’s too long!

1591
01:43:47,607 --> 01:43:50,367
But if you call him: ''Ugo!'',
he’s near his mummy

1592
01:43:50,368 --> 01:43:52,801
but he won’t have the chance to move...

1593
01:43:52,887 --> 01:43:56,562
As soon as he does it :''Ugo'',
and he’s back right away!

1594
01:43:56,647 --> 01:44:00,606
Because he catches his name!
Maybe, if you really want,

1595
01:44:00,687 --> 01:44:03,724
we can call him
''Ciro''! That’s longer...

1596
01:44:03,807 --> 01:44:05,445
so he won’t grow up too restrained!

1597
01:44:05,527 --> 01:44:09,156
So: ''Ciro''..and he can take
a little breath!!! That’s it.
