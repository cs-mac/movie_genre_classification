1
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,921
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:31,161
Welcome to Bull Mountain...

3
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,841
a slice of heaven...

4
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:36,361
nestled in the cleavage
of Alaska's high country.

5
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,881
It all started when a young
buck named Herbert Muntz...

6
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,321
saw the promise of a new life...

7
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,881
and staked his claim to it
the old-fashioned way...

8
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,121
he stole it from the Eskimos.

9
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,201
'Round these parts,
he became known as "Papa."

10
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:54,121
Each year,
Papa would say thank you...

11
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:55,601
by droppin' his britches...

12
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:58,481
and blazing down
that mountain bare-assed...

13
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:02,081
in one of his famous
"moon-shine" runs.

14
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,441
Papa loved to ski...

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,800
and Papa loved to drink...

16
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,201
but most of all,
Papa loved to ski and drink...

17
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,881
at the same time.

18
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:17,521
Last year,
he died with his boots on...

19
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:21,521
Bull Mountain,
don't go changin'!

20
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:24,601
And not much else.

21
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,921
Nowadays, Papa's boy
runs the mountain.

22
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,521
But us locals still carry on
the free-wheelin' spirit...

23
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,001
of Papa's life.

24
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,761
You could say that this
mountain's a lot like a woman.

25
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,361
Just when you think you
know every inch of her...

26
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,561
and you're about
to dip your skis...

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,440
into some soft, deep powder...

28
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,441
You got two broke legs,
cracked ribs...

29
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,321
then you pay
your twenty bucks...

30
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,881
just to let her punch your
lift ticket all over again.

31
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,160
News flash.

32
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,961
Muntz is selling the mountain.

33
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,761
The entire mountain'?

34
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,681
Why would he want
to get rid of this place?

35
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,241
I like this place
exactly the way it is.

36
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,401
Maybe the buyer can supply...

37
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,521
the mountain
with what it really needs...

38
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,081
hot friggin' chicks.

39
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:36,241
Guys, you know, more girls?

40
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,641
Let's give Lance a chance,
all right?

41
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:39,521
I gotta refuel the tanks.

42
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,641
Jenny, what's going on?

43
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,841
Jenny!

44
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,920
What's up, guys?

45
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,281
What, are you drinking
without me?

46
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:51,561
Hey, Lance.

47
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,561
Hey, girlfriend.
What you drinkin'?

48
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:58,721
Whatever the lady would like,
just put it on my tab.

49
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:02,001
I will have a beer, then.

50
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,241
And five shots of Goldschlager,
please.

51
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,921
Rick, you are an idiot
not to go for Jenny...

52
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,561
and don't give me
this broken heart rigamarole.

53
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,841
Are you sniffing me?

54
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:20,761
There you go.

55
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,721
Thank you.

56
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,241
Man. If I was her...

57
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,681
I'd be gettin' with every dude
on this mountain.

58
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,601
Hey, boys.

59
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,241
You're killin' me!

60
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,161
Cheers, everybody!

61
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:41,640
People.

62
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,641
And Pig Pen,
my poor excuse for a brother.

63
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:46,921
Our boy Rick here...

64
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:49,361
has been bitching
and moaning all week long...

65
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,521
I have not.

66
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,961
And I think it's time
that we do something...

67
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,241
to cheer him up.
Don't you agree?

68
00:05:55,281 --> 00:06:00,321
Perhaps tonight is the night
that we crown this year's...

69
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,321
King of the Mountain.

70
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,521
Did somebody just say...

71
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,561
King of the Mountain?

72
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,841
I know you want
to defend your title.

73
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,841
If I must.

74
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,681
Good evening.

75
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:24,241
You all know the rules
of King of the Mountain.

76
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,481
Rule number one...

77
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,481
you do not talk about
King of the Mountain.

78
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,400
Rule number two...
there are no rules.

79
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,361
What about rule number one?

80
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,241
That's more of a guideline
than a rule.

81
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,441
Do not interrupt!

82
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:43,081
And now, the three-peat champion
of King of the Mountain...

83
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,561
Rick Rambis. Richard?

84
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,040
OK. Here's how it works.

85
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,681
Everyone must have a beer.

86
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,881
It's a race to the bottom.

87
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,761
The first one
to the statue of Papa Muntz...

88
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,921
with the most beer
in your glass... Pig Pen...

89
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,001
shall be proclaimed this year's
King of the Mountain.

90
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,361
And, as an added bonus...

91
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,601
you also win the contents
of Eric's stolen wallet...

92
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:07,961
which are, Luke?

93
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,441
Two bucks...

94
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:11,001
a condom...

95
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,400
expiration date 1997...

96
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,400
and a picture
of his grandma... no!

97
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,361
That's Nancy Reagan.

98
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,280
But most importantly...

99
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,641
pushing, shoving,
and cheating are encouraged.

100
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,881
Try not to wipe out
like you did last year...

101
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,841
and the year before,
and both years before that.

102
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,040
Thanks, Luke,
I really appreciate that.

103
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,401
No problem.

104
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,561
Pig Pen, if you would.

105
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,161
Strap 'em in.

106
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:37,481
On your marks, get set...

107
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,321
Everybody ready?

108
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,161
Go!

109
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:46,361
- Suckers!
- Cheater!

110
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,201
Not tonight, Pig Pen!

111
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,561
Go grand, Anthony!

112
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,921
Don't wipe out.

113
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,961
Here I come, baby!

114
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,921
Damn!

115
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,481
Coming through.

116
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,601
Get away from my head!

117
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,041
Stop!

118
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,121
Hey, no fair!

119
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:09,281
Nice!

120
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,481
Shit!

121
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:27,441
Ride 'em, cowboy!

122
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,601
Go!

123
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,041
Let's move it!

124
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,561
Don't let him pass!

125
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,281
We got him, Jenny!

126
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,761
Go!

127
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,041
Come on! We're gonna beat him!

128
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,281
Where did he come from?

129
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,201
His mug's empty.

130
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,361
The beer!

131
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,761
Beer? I got beer! I got it!

132
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,801
Come on!

133
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:36,001
If you haven't kissed up
to the king, let me know.

134
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,801
Goin' to drink, everybody!

135
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,121
Actually, I have to turn in.

136
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,921
I have to give Mr. Mays
a snowboard lesson.

137
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,881
I got fag practice in
the morning, so I understand.

138
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,481
Walk me home, Your Highness.

139
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,881
Guys, stop!

140
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:12,041
If you're planning
on coming up...

141
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,481
with some lame-ass excuse
to get into my house...

142
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,841
just so we can "hook up"...

143
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,761
I might let you.

144
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,961
Not that you're being...

145
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:21,401
particularly charming
or anything.

146
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:24,561
I guess it's the moonlight
and a bottle of Goldschlager...

147
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,641
that just brings out
the romance in a girl.

148
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:29,641
Can I ask you something?

149
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:34,001
You broke up with your boyfriend
this summer, right?

150
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,600
Are we about to have
another conversation...

151
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,801
about how you're still
on the rebound?

152
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,321
I guess not.

153
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,920
Look, Rick, I feel for you,
'cause I've been through it...

154
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,081
but it's time to move on.

155
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:50,201
The general rule of thumb
is one week of mourning...

156
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,721
for every six months
you were together...

157
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,721
so you were together,
what, two weeks?

158
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,881
Three weeks.

159
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:58,641
OK. Three weeks.
So, then that means...

160
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:02,681
I get it. You're right.
It's stupid.

161
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,441
Yes, it is.

162
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:07,561
So, you still want to hook up?

163
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,761
You gotta try a lot harder
than that, Rick.

164
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:15,641
So, you still want to hook up?

165
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,521
How's that?

166
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:18,841
Good night.

167
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,641
Good night.

168
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,201
- See you tomorrow.
- Later.

169
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:25,561
Hey, listen.

170
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,401
You better enjoy your reign as
King now, because next year...

171
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:30,201
I'm Queen of the Mountain, baby.

172
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,681
We'll see about that.

173
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,881
Passed out again.

174
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,801
Fire!

175
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:38,801
Well, boys,
what's it gonna be tonight?

176
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,641
We gonna shave his eyebrows?

177
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:43,481
Passe. Done that, took pictures.

178
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm gonna need a bucket,
a paint brush...

179
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,481
and ten pounds of salt.

180
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,280
Lance, get his pants.

181
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,481
Where are you taking him?
Come on!

182
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,641
Try to hold up his fat ass.

183
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:59,081
Look at him.

184
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,521
Shoo!

185
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,761
Get!

186
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,721
Good boy... I mean, girl.

187
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,441
Good girl.

188
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:01,481
My ass is numb!

189
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,081
Look alive, Eric.

190
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,281
John Majors!

191
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,801
Ted Muntz. It's so good
to finally meet you in person.

192
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,921
Welcome to Bull Mountain.

193
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,121
The Eskimos around here
have a saying...

194
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:35,961
Slow down there, Nanook.

195
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,641
You're gonna give yourself
an aneurysm.

196
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:43,961
Will you smell that, boys?

197
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,961
Smells like money.

198
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,641
This place has got
some serious potential.

199
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,921
I can see it now, huh?
Can't you see it?

200
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:55,601
Condominiums, eateries,
shopping, wine bars, cigar bars.

201
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:56,961
What the hell... bar bars!

202
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,560
Yeah, we can totally sell
this whole rustic bit.

203
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:05,120
This is a diamond in the rough.
That's good.

204
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,601
Write that down
for the brochure.

205
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,441
No, wait. Better yet...

206
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,881
"Black diamond in the rough."

207
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,921
You know? Sort of a ski thing.

208
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,081
I'm Eric Montclair.

209
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,120
Well, who asked you?

210
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,441
Just kidding, Short Stack.

211
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,281
So it's some mountain, huh?

212
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,721
Yeah,
but the name "Bull Mountain"...

213
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:26,600
it's a little too...

214
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,401
shitty.

215
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,041
You want to rename the mountain?

216
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,041
Yeah. Something good.

217
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm gonna have
to polish this turd...

218
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,161
if I want to sell
my investors on it.

219
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,161
I mean, your hotel
looks like a Motel 6...

220
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:40,281
ate a yard sale
and barfed it out.

221
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:42,641
Muntz, there's some
really pissed off Eskimos...

222
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,161
outside right now, man. They
say they want their land back.

223
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,081
Very funny, Rambis.

224
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:48,321
Mr. Majors,
this is Rick Rambis...

225
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,121
one of our low
to mid-level employees.

226
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:52,041
You must be the big hotshot
who's gonna buy the mountain.

227
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,920
John Majors of Major Resorts.

228
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:57,521
Rick Rambis of Rick Rambis.

229
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,721
You any good
on that board there, son'?

230
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,401
I'm all right.

231
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:02,720
You wouldn't mind
playing tour guide...

232
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,201
to an old fart like me,
would you?

233
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:07,561
Actually, Rick's got a pretty
heavy workload tomorrow...

234
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:10,040
but I would be delighted to
show you around the mountain.

235
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,040
No offense, Short Stack,
but you give me the creeps.

236
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,921
I think Rick here'll
do just fine.

237
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:15,201
You don't mind, do you Rick?

238
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,361
No problem.

239
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:18,401
Good.
First thing in the morning.

240
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,641
I'll take a Geritol
so I can keep up.

241
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,481
Chop chop with them bags there.

242
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,121
So, what does this mean,
selling the mountain?

243
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,601
I don't know.
Maybe this guy will be cool.

244
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,481
Maybe he'll help us build
a lift up to Hangman's Peak.

245
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,761
Can you get an STD
from a polar bear?

246
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,521
What is your brother doing?

247
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,241
What do we got, Whitey?

248
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,921
Solid Gold Dancers
trapped on Beaver Mountain.

249
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,641
Somebody help us!

250
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:52,841
Looks pretty hairy, sir.

251
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,561
Just the way I like it!

252
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,121
Lock 'em and load 'em, boys!

253
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,761
I'm goin' in!

254
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,681
What are we gonna do?

255
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,641
Please, the whole cabin
is freezing!

256
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,881
We're saved!

257
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:09,481
Good morning, ladies.
The name's Pen.

258
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,560
A suit.

259
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,961
I need everybody to be calm
and take your tops off.

260
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,481
And tie them together.

261
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:25,801
Now! Move! I don't have
time to discuss this!

262
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:30,841
Wicked!

263
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,281
You. Grab me around my waist.

264
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,641
Lower. Nice.

265
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,161
You, get the door!

266
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,841
The door's stuck!

267
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:42,001
Just jiggle it!

268
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,161
It's gonna be OK, ladies.
Jiggle more!

269
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,200
You have to jiggle the handle.

270
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:55,161
Jiggle it.

271
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,841
Open the door, Pig Pen!

272
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,161
Come on, man.

273
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,241
Jiggle it.

274
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:03,801
Open the door!

275
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,161
I'm coming!

276
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:12,361
He's had a crush on that bench
for a long time.

277
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,561
Did you enjoy your nap?

278
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:34,641
So, Rick, did you
hit it last night or what?

279
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:37,681
No, man, we just talked.

280
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,681
God. You know, maybe...

281
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,720
we should clarify something.

282
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:45,281
When you won the race
last night...

283
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,401
that made you
King of the Mountain.

284
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:50,201
Not King of
the No-ball Pussy Losers.

285
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,961
They already have
their own king...

286
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,121
my brother.

287
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,241
What?

288
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:57,521
Are you still hung up on Anna?

289
00:19:57,561 --> 00:20:00,401
Here's what I don't get,
all right, is...

290
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:02,081
you met this chick...

291
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:04,881
and you got
freaky-deaky with her...

292
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,241
and then, poof!
She disappears.

293
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:09,241
How's there a problem with that?

294
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,961
Pig Pen, when I want advice...

295
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,921
about a good
"Planet of the Apes" film...

296
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,961
or maybe how to get the resin...

297
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:17,401
out of my bong,
I'll come to you, OK?

298
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:20,361
But I am not gonna take
romantic advice from somebody...

299
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,681
who cannot spell
romantic or advice.

300
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,081
Or bong.

301
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:27,721
Listen, man, I just want
to hear the story, that's all.

302
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,961
I mean,
you've never even told me it...

303
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,281
not even once.

304
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,561
If I tell you, will you
promise to shut up about it?

305
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:43,401
I met her at the most beautiful
romantic place on earth...

306
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,401
Cancun, Mexico.

307
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:48,081
There was this little cantina
called Pedro O'Horny's.

308
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,081
Me and Luke, see,
we had just shown up...

309
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:51,281
and then I saw her.

310
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:57,321
From the moment
we caught eyes...

311
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,601
I knew she wasn't like
the other girls there.

312
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:02,561
She was French.

313
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,601
She had her top on.

314
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:05,961
Plus, she wasn't puking.

315
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:11,961
Drink!

316
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,001
We spent every day together
for three weeks.

317
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,641
It was like heaven...

318
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,481
but you couldn't
drink the water.

319
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:27,841
And then, one day,
she asked me...

320
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,241
to go on one of them
tandem bike rides...

321
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:33,281
but she never showed up.

322
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,681
I never saw Anna again.

323
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:40,921
Who'?

324
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:42,321
God!

325
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:43,841
Chicken!

326
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,441
Guys, a little sensitivity here!

327
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:51,121
God! Can't you see
this is a dejected man?

328
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:54,361
Well, Rick, get your
dejected head out of your ass.

329
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,361
Papa Muntz wanted you
to run this mountain.

330
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,561
Carpe the Diem!

331
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:03,401
Seize the... carp!

332
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,921
What?

333
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:13,161
Make sure you bundle up because
it's freezing out there, OK?

334
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,081
Hey, Toby.

335
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,161
Let me check your boot.

336
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,441
You're good now.

337
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:20,441
- Thanks, Jenny.
- You're welcome.

338
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:23,001
Hey, Jenny, you think
you could tie up my boots?

339
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,361
Stewart, I think you
can do up your own boots.

340
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:28,281
I kind of like
the way you do it.

341
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:30,601
OK. How about I do up one,
and you do the other.

342
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,401
Cool.

343
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:34,841
The rabbit and the loops...

344
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,240
I can do it
without the song, you know.

345
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:39,841
I kind of like the song,
Stewart.

346
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:42,681
- What's up, Rick?
- What's up, dude?

347
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,921
Get out of here.
You're welcome.

348
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:47,001
You're pretty good
with these kids, Jenny.

349
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:51,241
I seem to have a thing
for immature boys.

350
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,561
Ouch!

351
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,761
At least Stewart has his act
together enough to ask me out.

352
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:57,441
I think we're
checking out a movie...

353
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:59,201
right after his nap time.

354
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,201
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

355
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:04,121
Would you...

356
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:05,600
Would I...

357
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,921
Would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

358
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,441
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:14,761
It sounded like you were
asking me out on a date.

360
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,961
We could meet at the inn.

361
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,441
Say, 8:00?

362
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,761
Right now I have
to go seize the carp.

363
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:22,441
- Wish me luck.
- I'll see you there.

364
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,361
Morning, Mr. Majors.

365
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,081
Please.

366
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:32,201
My daddy was Mr. Majors.
Actually, he was Mr. Mankowicz.

367
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:33,401
Just call me "John."

368
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:36,441
OK, John. Well,
where do you want to start?

369
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:38,321
Most people can't do
the whole mountain in one day.

370
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:40,001
Well, I ain't most people.

371
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,281
You try
and keep up there, hotshot.

372
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:02,201
You ever been on one
of those lesbian chat rooms?

373
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,201
- Are they good?
- I don't know.

374
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,161
You see that up there?

375
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:09,601
That's Hangman's Peak.

376
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:10,841
Damn. You ski that?

377
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:14,041
Yeah. It's a hustle,
but, as you can tell...

378
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:15,721
it's almost impossible to hike.

379
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:17,001
I think that if we put
a lift to the top...

380
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,561
it would be the most
popular snowboard park...

381
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:20,121
in the entire country.

382
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,561
You know, Rick, what I'll do...
I'll think on that.

383
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:24,681
'Cause I like your style...

384
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:26,281
and I might need a little help.

385
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,521
Yeah? What for?

386
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:29,841
Well, my investors,
they're coming...

387
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:33,641
to check this place out,
and, well, they spook easily.

388
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,161
If this deal's
gonna go through...

389
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:37,841
this whole town's
gonna have to play ball.

390
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:39,801
I don't think Muntz
has the pull around here...

391
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:42,240
to do that, but...

392
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:43,561
you do.

393
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:46,241
Can you hear me?

394
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:51,561
OK. As most of you have heard,
by next week...

395
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:54,121
Bull Mountain
will have new management.

396
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,721
I'm selling it...

397
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,081
for lots and lots
of American dollars...

398
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:02,401
to your future boss
Mr. John Majors.

399
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,921
Thank you.

400
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:09,081
Thank you and good morning.

401
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:11,681
I can't tell you
how happy and excited...

402
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,201
I am to be here today.

403
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:16,201
Now, I know we're all
gonna be homies...

404
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,481
but I do believe
in the golden rule...

405
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:22,321
and that is, he who has
the gold card makes the rules.

406
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,881
Pipe down, retard.

407
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:28,081
And to publicize
my purchase of the mountain...

408
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:29,361
I've invited my board members...

409
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,521
that's the board of directors
and my investors...

410
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:33,521
here for
the anniversary festival.

411
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:36,041
As my employees,
you're expected to behave...

412
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,881
in a manner consistent
with a world-class resort.

413
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,121
Any questions you might have...

414
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:43,201
will be answered
in your new rule book...

415
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,841
which numbnuts here
is gonna pass out.

416
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,961
I think that's you.

417
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:52,481
And I have a super-duper
surprise for all of you...

418
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:54,001
a brand-new, streamlined...

419
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,961
top of the line,
high-performance uniform!

420
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:59,321
Don't sweat having
to pay for 'em.

421
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:01,321
We'll just deduct the cost
from your first paycheck.

422
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,841
Welcome to
the Major Resort family!

423
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:06,521
There's no business
like snow business!

424
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,641
I told you. You look great.

425
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,120
It doesn't really allow my dice
to roll down there...

426
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,481
and by dice, I mean testicles.

427
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,321
Speaking of testicles,
let me get a beer.

428
00:26:15,361 --> 00:26:16,761
The suits
are not that bad, guys.

429
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:20,361
Rick, these scuba outfits
make us look ridiculous.

430
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:22,361
Who does this Majors asshole
think he is?

431
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,800
I'm not gonna wear
this unitard... period.

432
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:27,161
Guys, I love Bull Mountain
as much as anyone else...

433
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,681
but a little change,
it's not gonna hurt this place.

434
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,921
I don't know, Rick. Why would we
even want this place to change?

435
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:35,321
We don't want it
to turn into Aspen.

436
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,441
But have you seen
the women from Aspen?

437
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:38,761
I... no.

438
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,161
Other than
the occasional girl...

439
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:41,441
who comes here
on the weekend trip...

440
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:43,481
this place is a sausage factory.

441
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:44,681
<i>There are gonna be some homes...</i>

442
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,801
some slammin' bods
with pants so tight...

443
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:49,201
it looks like
they were painted on.

444
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,041
Babe, I love chicks.

445
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:54,120
Chicks love me,
so it's all good.

446
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:55,241
Calm down, Lance.

447
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,081
Look, Muntz is gonna
sell this mountain...

448
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,401
and somebody's
gonna buy it anyway.

449
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,321
Do you have $100 million?
I don't. You?

450
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:03,321
No. We're not models.

451
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:05,840
Guys, look.

452
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,681
All I'm saying is
that if we play ball...

453
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,161
the mountain will still be ours.

454
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:12,640
You foolish boys.

455
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,881
This is how it all starts.

456
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:16,560
I've seen it all before.

457
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,401
I was there.

458
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:22,401
Yeah.
It was called the eighties.

459
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,641
Ford was president,
Nixon was in the White House...

460
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:29,201
and FDR was runnin'
this country into the ground.

461
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:32,121
I was bummin'
in a hole-in-the-wall town...

462
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:34,841
in what is now called Utah.

463
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,081
Some fella
from Colorado shows up...

464
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:40,161
starts makin'
so-called improvements, right?

465
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,601
Well, 'fore we knew
what hit us...

466
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,921
the streets
are runnin' with latte.

467
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,481
It got so bad that
a fellow that liked to...

468
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:50,161
you know,
smoke a little grass...

469
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,641
or drink a little ripple,
crow like a rooster...

470
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:55,841
maybe challenge the mayor's son
to a gentleman's duel...

471
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,841
was uncouth, against God.

472
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:01,241
More like
bad real estate values.

473
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:02,841
Stumpy had to go!

474
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,360
Richard,
be careful what you wish for.

475
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,721
You got it, Stump.

476
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:10,041
- I will.
- All right?

477
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,881
God!

478
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm good.

479
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,441
Better put somethin' on that.

480
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:22,041
Welcome to our local cantina.
I like to stop in and have a...

481
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:24,801
Stumpy's right. You can't
let them do that to this place.

482
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,361
Women or no women,
we gotta stand on it...

483
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,641
and I need to stop talking
for a second.

484
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,400
Hey, Rick, come on over here.

485
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:47,681
No. You know what?
You guys are right.

486
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:48,881
This guy's really bad
for business.

487
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:50,921
I'm gonna go let him know.

488
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,160
Rick, this is
my stepdaughter Inga.

489
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,601
Hello there.

490
00:28:57,641 --> 00:28:59,881
Rick, I'd like you and retard
to show me the kitchen.

491
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,520
Sweetheart,
I got a little work to do.

492
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:03,081
Buy yourself a drink at the bar.

493
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,721
I won't be long.

494
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:07,841
Nice place.
When's his lease up?

495
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:09,840
Whenever I say it is.

496
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:11,161
Good.

497
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,321
Hey, boys,
look good in those uniforms.

498
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:36,361
- Boys, watch confidence at work.
- Be strong.

499
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:40,081
God, here she comes.

500
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,601
What my friend's
trying to say is...

501
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:50,121
welcome to the El Matador...

502
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:52,561
which is Spanish
for the matador.

503
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,521
Want a drinkie-poo?

504
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:56,561
I was wondering
if you can make...

505
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,801
a kind of drink.
It's called...

506
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,601
what is the word
in English for this?

507
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,001
Horny maker.

508
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,561
One fuzzy navel for the lady.

509
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:12,241
So you're, like,
Major's daughter?

510
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,881
Schtepdaughter.

511
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,681
I'm supposed to my
schtrepsister be meeting here.

512
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:21,441
One more fuzzy navel
for the lady.

513
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,721
My schtepsister.

514
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,881
It's Anna.

515
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,401
Oh, my God!

516
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,001
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

517
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,161
It's been a long time.

518
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,281
- What are you doing here?
- I was having a beer.

519
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:48,841
- In Alaska?
- I like cold beer.

520
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,681
Does that mean... is Rick around?

521
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:52,881
No. You didn't hear'?

522
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:58,761
Rick perished
in a dogsled accident.

523
00:30:58,801 --> 00:30:59,961
Four dogsled pileup.

524
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,201
And it's awful.
The dogs survived, though.

525
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:05,561
You used to be
a much better liar.

526
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:10,761
Anna, I don't know why you're
here, but leave him alone, OK?

527
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:15,641
Play it once
for old time's sake.

528
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:17,801
- Play what once?
- Well, the song.

529
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,041
- Song!
- Please, play it.

530
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:25,641
OK. Well, I think
I could play it once.

531
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,481
- Oh, that's not it?
- No, that's not it.

532
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,081
Very nice, though. Please.

533
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:39,241
I don't know if I know...

534
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,161
You know what song
I'm talking about. Please.

535
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:44,160
All right.

536
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:46,201
Please play it. Come on.

537
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,561
He's gonna kill me.

538
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:52,841
Thank you.

539
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,681
Luke, I thought I told you
to never play that...

540
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:02,081
Song.

541
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:04,041
Hey, Anna, you made it!

542
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:05,481
Come here, kid.
Give me a hug.

543
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:10,121
Sweetheart, this is Muntz.

544
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,641
- And this bright young man is...
- We've met.

545
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:18,641
Majors is your father?

546
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:21,841
Yes. He likes to think
he's Napoleon...

547
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,761
working his way across Europe.

548
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:26,641
His first wife was English,
my mother was French...

549
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,041
and lnga's mother was Swiss.

550
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:30,000
And I just hired
a Russian girl trainer.

551
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:32,241
Look out.

552
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:33,561
Hey, girls, it's bedtime.

553
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,201
We got a long day ahead of us
tomorrow. Come on, Inga.

554
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:38,521
Retard, walk me out.

555
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:44,041
I didn't know you were here,
Rick. I'm really sorry.

556
00:32:46,961 --> 00:32:49,801
I really have to go, but...

557
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:00,241
Of all the bars in all
the ski towns in Alaska...

558
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,721
Why'd she have
to come to this one?

559
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:06,721
Thanks.

560
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:11,281
There you go, Jenny. Enjoy it.

561
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,481
I don't think he's coming,
Jenny.

562
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:51,481
We'll put him in Rick's car.

563
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:53,081
Got him, Lance?

564
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:54,481
I got him, OK?

565
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:57,561
This is gonna be rightly stupid.

566
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,961
Get him in.

567
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,761
I got it.

568
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,761
- Come on!
- You sure this is a good idea?

569
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:10,081
It might give him
a heart attack.

570
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:12,120
As the inheritor
of his estate...

571
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,681
I take full legal
responsibility.

572
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,001
Come on! Get out of the way!

573
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,321
OK, come on.

574
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:21,321
One, two, three!

575
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:37,921
OK, they're packed.
Let's skedaddle.

576
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,121
Spin him!

577
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:49,320
One... two... three...

578
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,561
Oh, my God!

579
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:54,121
Oh, God! Please!

580
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,841
' Got it!

581
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:58,081
We're stopping!

582
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:00,481
Lord.

583
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:02,201
Oh, my God!

584
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:04,201
What's wrong with you?

585
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,761
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

586
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,361
All right!
Beautiful!

587
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:26,761
This is what you're gonna do
to Bull Mountain?

588
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:29,681
No. Snownook.

589
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,801
That's the name
my people say tests the best.

590
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:40,921
Did I ever tell you
how I invented snowboarding?

591
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,601
That's a hot tub, Pig Pen.

592
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,081
Wicked!

593
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:53,081
Hey, there.

594
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:01,961
I don't want credit for it,
but they keep givin' it to me.

595
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,201
She's gonna kill me.

596
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,161
Hey, retard.

597
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:18,481
There's gonna be a lot more
changes goin' on here.

598
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:21,241
Come on, boys!
You're workin' on my time now.

599
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:29,921
Wait!

600
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,961
Hold up! I can explain it!
I can explain everything.

601
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:37,521
Relax. I stopped by the bar
last night, and Pig Pen told me.

602
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:40,561
Look, I'm really sorry
about that.

603
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:42,801
I will make it up to you
any way that I can.

604
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:44,281
You don't have to leave.

605
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:46,961
Don't flatter yourself.

606
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,081
I'm doing my laundry.

607
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:54,201
So that means
you're not mad at me?

608
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:56,441
Yeah, I am.

609
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:57,920
I'll get over it, though.

610
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:00,921
Look, I really am sorry.

611
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:06,041
Look, I don't do
this pining thing well...

612
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:09,241
so why don't you figure out
what the hell it is you want...

613
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:10,721
and let me know?

614
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,401
Welcome, girlfriend.

615
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,601
Buy you a beer?

616
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,601
I'm good.

617
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:04,161
Look, I'd like to apologize
if you'll let me.

618
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,161
There's things about me
you don't know, Rick.

619
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,161
Now, there's something
I have to tell you, though.

620
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:12,001
You know what?
Hold that thought.

621
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,681
I don't even care anymore.

622
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:17,481
Cheers.

623
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,960
Hey, you're dribbling!
Watch the shoes!

624
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,241
Sorry.

625
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:11,321
<i>I'm hot!</i>

626
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:13,321
- Want to see my piece?
- What?

627
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:15,321
See, I just started training
for the biathalon.

628
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:16,641
Where's Inga going?

629
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:20,601
Don't you worry, little brother.
I got your back on this one.

630
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:24,001
I'm gonna do her.

631
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,321
But how does that help me?

632
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:31,241
Well, what do you know?
Just the two of us!

633
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,041
I got trained.

634
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:53,681
Inga, I love you!

635
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:56,601
Oh, my God!

636
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:59,360
Are you hurt'?

637
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:01,201
Yeah, I think so.

638
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:03,081
Anthony, is that you?

639
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:06,681
Can you go get some ice
from the bar?

640
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:09,160
This is Alaska. You're sittin'
on ice, little leprechaun.

641
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:11,201
Yes. Go, Anthony.

642
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:13,961
I will wait here with him.

643
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,721
Damn him!

644
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:17,441
Tell Inga where it hurts.

645
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:19,121
Everywhere.

646
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,401
"Duck."

647
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:44,641
Come in.

648
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,561
Make yourself at home. Just
don't hit me anymore in my nuts.

649
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,001
Sorry. Oh, my God.

650
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:52,281
This is good?

651
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,161
Yes, this is very good.

652
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:56,801
Tell me, where did
you get these scars?

653
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,641
Let's see.

654
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,481
Skateboard...

655
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:02,681
truck accident...

656
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:04,521
and a fire hydrant.

657
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:08,680
I bet each one has
its own exciting story, no?

658
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:10,161
No, not really.

659
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:12,201
I skateboarded off a truck
into a fire hydrant.

660
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:15,521
I never met
an American boy before.

661
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:18,961
Are you all so wild?

662
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:22,401
Yeah.
We have a saying around here.

663
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:25,281
No brains, no headache.

664
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:29,801
We have a saying
in Switzerland, too.

665
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,321
No swimsuit...

666
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:36,441
no tan lines.

667
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:42,000
We have another saying
around here.

668
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:43,961
- What's that?
- I don't know.

669
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:47,921
I didn't mean to leave you
like that in Mexico.

670
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:51,241
I'm sorry. I just...
Believe me, I had to.

671
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:54,641
Why? Some other guy
come sweep you off your feet'?

672
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:56,081
You were the other guy.

673
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:58,321
- I don't understand.
- I'm engaged.

674
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:00,161
I was engaged when I met you.

675
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,321
And I love him, Rick.
I really do.

676
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:06,121
And when I met you...
I don't know, I just...

677
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:08,961
I fell in love with you, too,
I guess.

678
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:10,561
I didn't know what to do.

679
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,200
Hey, it's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

680
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:18,041
I had ten other engaged chicks
fall for me that week, too...

681
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,040
so I barely even... which one
were you, the brunette?

682
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,960
Please, I wanted
to say good-bye to you...

683
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:23,121
and tell you everything...

684
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,561
but when the time came
to do it...

685
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,801
I didn't think I'd be able to,
so I left.

686
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:31,801
And I really did fall for you.

687
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:34,201
That's why I left.

688
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:43,441
There, I said what I had
to say, so I'm going now.

689
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,241
Wait.

690
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:49,881
Look, I'm sorry, too, OK?

691
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,001
For being a prick.

692
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:55,561
It's just that I was
a little... bummed out.

693
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:57,441
I deserved it. It's OK.

694
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:59,681
You did.

695
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:02,441
You want some coffee
or something?

696
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:04,521
That would be really nice.

697
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:12,241
This making out is a lot of fun.

698
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:17,441
But I'm ready... how do you say...
to schlafenzeit.

699
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:21,041
Yeah. Schlafenzeit.
Anything you say.

700
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:30,601
No. What are you doing?

701
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:34,601
Schlafenzeit. Sleepy time.
I'm going to bed now.

702
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,961
I'm sleepy.

703
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:41,041
No, stay. We'll cuddle.

704
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:46,721
Good night.

705
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:20,120
So... your fiance...

706
00:46:20,121 --> 00:46:23,041
Barry. He's in medical school.

707
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,081
He's flying up
in a couple of days to see me.

708
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:28,561
That's gonna be a little tricky
unless he's a pilot, too.

709
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,961
He's a pilot, too?
He's a doctor and a pilot?

710
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:35,761
I think I want to have sex
with this guy.

711
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:41,521
I have to go now.

712
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:44,321
Let me show you out.

713
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:53,481
I just... I want you to know
that I am happy for you.

714
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:59,321
And... this Barry guy is lucky.

715
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,321
Thank you.

716
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,721
Good night.

717
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,721
<i>Go.</i>

718
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,801
Oh, my God.

719
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,281
You need help don't you?

720
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,921
Just a sec.

721
00:47:57,921 --> 00:47:59,801
How's the hot tub, Luke?

722
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:01,921
You know,
the Eskimo have nine words...

723
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:05,161
for a hell mooch
stuck in a hot tub.

724
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:08,161
Hell, they only got
eight words for snow.

725
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,921
There we go.

726
00:48:22,321 --> 00:48:24,241
Yeah, physics, really.

727
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:27,081
Expansion and contraction.

728
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:30,001
All right.

729
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,521
Right here.

730
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:33,001
One.

731
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,201
Two.

732
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:36,361
Three!

733
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,281
Was it worth it?

734
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,241
Rough night?

735
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:53,281
I've had worse.

736
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:56,321
Thanks.

737
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:04,761
Anna's getting married.

738
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:08,601
To some rich asswipe
doctor dude named Barry.

739
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:10,560
He's coming in
day after tomorrow.

740
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:11,841
- Ouch!
- Thanks, man.

741
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:14,841
No. I got molested
by a hot tub last night.

742
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:16,041
It's a long story.

743
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:19,161
You know what I really hate
about this chick...

744
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:22,521
is that I think... I know
that I'm in love with her.

745
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,601
And... it sucks.

746
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:27,241
- Have you told her this?
- No, not really.

747
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:31,081
Well, listen, you've got
to do it before it's too late.

748
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:35,201
Before she becomes
Mrs. Doctor Asswipe.

749
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:37,441
Otherwise, you're gonna
regret it your whole life.

750
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:40,161
"No regrets." That's my motto.

751
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:43,561
That and "Everybody
Wang Chung Tonight."

752
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:46,041
You know what? You're right.

753
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,401
You're absolutely right.

754
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:52,961
I'm not gonna let Anna
get away again.

755
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:56,041
When this Barry guy gets here,
I'm gonna have to face him.

756
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:58,080
And I'm gonna look at him
and tell him...

757
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:59,641
like a sensible mature adult...

758
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:03,001
"Finders keepers,
losers weepers, pal."

759
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:08,521
I'll have to work on that one.

760
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:10,921
And if he doesn't like it...

761
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:12,721
we'll kick his ass.

762
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:15,121
Definitely.

763
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:18,001
Attention, all guests...

764
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:21,961
Where's Jenny?
I don't want to go!

765
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,201
You're going back in line.

766
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:26,801
Hey, fellas.
Great day, isn't it?

767
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:29,601
Man, who the hell are you?

768
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:31,641
I'm the new Team Snownook
patrol leader.

769
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:34,201
"Keepin' it real
while keepin' it safe."

770
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,881
You on the roof,
knock off the grab-ass.

771
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:39,441
What the hell is going on here?

772
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:41,041
Don't you eyeball me!

773
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:45,121
Hey, Luke, why don't you
mind your own beeswax...

774
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:49,681
before my fist makes
an appointment with your ass?

775
00:50:49,721 --> 00:50:52,361
Eric, you ever notice
that you're always...

776
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:54,121
talking about putting something
up my ass?

777
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:56,521
And that time,
it wasn't even a threat.

778
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:59,681
Technically, that was flirting.

779
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:06,081
Wait a second.

780
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:07,601
Where are you going
with the bull?

781
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,120
Talk to the horn!

782
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:13,961
Where are you taking the bull?

783
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,281
Listen, I've had it with these
jackass employees of yours.

784
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:17,761
This morning, there was a boy...

785
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:19,521
with his little Elvis
stuck in my hot tub.

786
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:21,121
Now, how in the hell
does that happen?

787
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,321
Well, the jets
can feel quite nice...

788
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:25,441
Stop talking.
Effective immediately...

789
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:27,601
I'm taking some steps
to clean this place up.

790
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:29,761
Poured out
a perfectly good beer.

791
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:33,841
I love that smell.

792
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:36,921
That's the smell
of you all getting fired.

793
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,281
What, fired?

794
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:41,041
Welcome to your first
random drug test.

795
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:42,961
I'll need you
to fill these cups.

796
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,961
Go make tinkle,
or it's your job.

797
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,761
I don't have to write a test
to tell you that I take drugs.

798
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:52,401
Pig Pen, you go to the bathroom
in the cup!

799
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:57,281
Jeez. He's way too into this.

800
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:08,841
Drink up, half-pint.

801
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,280
I will have your ass!

802
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:29,760
How you doing tonight?

803
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:31,161
Thanks a lot.

804
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:32,361
How you doin', ladies?

805
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,201
Ladies.

806
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:40,521
Private party tonight, guys.

807
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:41,961
We're cool, man.
We're regulars here.

808
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:43,761
Just ask Lance.

809
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:45,801
What part of "private party"
did you miss?

810
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:53,481
Hey, there, Rick.
Nice monkey suit.

811
00:52:53,521 --> 00:52:57,161
I barely even recognize
this place.

812
00:52:57,201 --> 00:52:59,921
- A little face lift.
- Can I get a beer?

813
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:02,400
Hey, Village Person,
why don't you be a macho man...

814
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:04,401
and cut me some limes?

815
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:26,201
Hello, stranger.

816
00:53:26,241 --> 00:53:28,801
You clean up pretty nice,
Rambis.

817
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:31,601
Thank you.
You look amazing.

818
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,321
Thank you.
Would you like to dance?

819
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:36,161
Sure.

820
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:46,881
You're not wearing underwear.

821
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:49,201
You can't with this dress.

822
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,361
Your excuse is better than mine.

823
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:53,481
Sweetheart.

824
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,281
I need to borrow Fred Astaire
here for one hot minute.

825
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,120
Dance with Tito there.
He loves to boogie.

826
00:53:58,121 --> 00:53:59,281
- Hi, John!
- Hi, boys.

827
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:02,241
And then I just sneaked in,
and...

828
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:12,601
What did they do to the bar?

829
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,961
How did you guys get in?

830
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,441
The back door was unlocked.

831
00:54:22,481 --> 00:54:24,721
There's gonna be some
big changes on the mountain...

832
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,601
once I get in the driver's seat.

833
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:30,241
But I wanted you to know
that I want you to stay on...

834
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:32,681
and to run
the day-to-day operations...

835
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:35,161
and be the new manager
of Snownook.

836
00:54:35,201 --> 00:54:36,361
You serious?

837
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,921
Of course I'm serious.
Here's your contract.

838
00:54:38,961 --> 00:54:40,281
Take a gander.

839
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:45,401
- That's a big number.
- Not bad.

840
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:48,121
But as the new manager...

841
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,880
all my friends
get to stay on board, right?

842
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:52,281
You drive a hard bargain,
son, but done deal.

843
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:53,841
Thanks, John.

844
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,361
Don't thank me.
You deserve it.

845
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,201
Welcome to the team, pard.

846
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:00,041
You are good.

847
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:02,161
You're messing with...

848
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:05,441
I'm gonna take Kung Fu
and kick your friggin' ass.

849
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:06,841
We'll have the party
at our place.

850
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:08,681
We don't need their
fancy-shmancy shit...

851
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:10,321
and their blue ropes.

852
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,281
What's up, man?

853
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:19,641
What's going on here?

854
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:20,841
If you ain't on the list...

855
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:22,120
there's nothing
I can do for you, buddy.

856
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:23,681
Ladies, how you doing?

857
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,201
- I'm good.
- Mind if we join you?

858
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:27,001
Not at all. Go on, have fun.

859
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:30,321
I'm likin' that. Come on, man.
Give me a break. What's up?

860
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,321
Are you from around here'?

861
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:36,041
OK, then $40.
All the locals in free. Come on.

862
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:51,641
Let me get some of that.

863
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,681
Cheers!

864
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:08,001
Ladies, you're missing out.

865
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:14,840
Say hello to the new manager...
of the mountain.

866
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:17,760
You straight?

867
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:19,921
Come here!

868
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,441
Hey, everybody!

869
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:24,600
Cut the music off!

870
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:27,041
Pig Pen, put her down!

871
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:29,761
Our friend little Rick Rambis...

872
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:32,681
is the new manager
of the mountain, y'all!

873
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:38,241
And you're all fired!
Every one of you!

874
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,961
Are you saying that
I have to kiss your ass now?

875
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,160
As long as you shave.

876
00:56:43,161 --> 00:56:44,641
- Shave what?
- My ass!

877
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,721
Hey, boss, I'm gonna
call in sick tomorrow, OK?

878
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:55,641
- Hey, congratulations, boss!
- Thank you.

879
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:57,121
Watch your hands, mister.

880
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,121
I could sue you
for sexual harassment now.

881
00:56:59,161 --> 00:57:01,001
I'm gonna get me some.

882
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,201
Look, just because
I'm your boss...

883
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:03,761
doesn't mean things
change between us, OK?

884
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:06,201
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

885
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:13,641
She has a fiance, Rick.

886
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,041
I know.

887
00:57:15,081 --> 00:57:17,961
Look, your personal life
is none of my business...

888
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,241
but I don't want
to make a habit...

889
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:21,241
out of being your
little shoulder to cry on, OK?

890
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:23,481
Look, I know. I was just...

891
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:28,881
Yeah. Go. Get outta here.

892
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:38,761
Can I talk to you?

893
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:48,601
What I have to say isn't really
gonna take that much time.

894
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,441
I've been practicing.

895
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:51,961
Anna, I love you.

896
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,601
Rick, don't.

897
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:56,401
Look,
I'm not gonna lose you again.

898
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:59,721
Not to Barry, not to anybody.

899
00:57:59,761 --> 00:58:01,161
I want to fight for you.

900
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:05,761
And... I think
that you should tell Barry...

901
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:07,481
that things are over
between you two.

902
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:24,361
You're really not making
my life easy, you know that?

903
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:26,601
I'm not an easy guy.

904
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:32,761
There you are! Come inside.
You look so beautiful tonight...

905
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,841
I wanted to see
if you wanted to dance.

906
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:39,681
Come on. Not you.
Him in his white tuxedo.

907
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:19,441
No, you didn't.

908
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:49,081
Beautiful.

909
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:55,161
Why, those dirty
little bastards.

910
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:57,241
I know it sucks...

911
01:00:57,281 --> 01:00:58,801
that they're ruining
the town and everything...

912
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:03,121
but this
is the best vanilla latte...

913
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:06,641
I have ever had
in my entire life.

914
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:11,841
You can actually taste
the vanilla beans that these...

915
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,481
I don't like the coffee.

916
01:01:15,521 --> 01:01:18,961
Rick, check it,
the doctor is in!

917
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:20,961
It's show time, baby, come on!

918
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:24,921
So, you girls like Porsches?

919
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:27,201
Later.

920
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:28,561
Let's kick his ass!

921
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,161
No, let's handle ourselves
like adults.

922
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:31,481
Be mature about this.

923
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,641
Adults kick other adults' asses
all the time.

924
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:43,841
Rick, this is Barry.

925
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:46,041
What's up, Rick? Hey, guys.

926
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:50,041
Just give me a second here.

927
01:01:58,241 --> 01:02:01,961
I'm having second thoughts
about kicking this guy's ass.

928
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:03,841
God.

929
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:07,561
First floor, Alaska.

930
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:10,401
What's up, guys?
It's great to finally meet you.

931
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:12,240
Anna has told me
a lot about you.

932
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:14,881
Who's the jacuzzi Casanova?

933
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:17,321
That's him right there!

934
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,281
They call him that...

935
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:24,281
'cause he had himself up in it,
you know, lovin' it strong.

936
01:02:24,321 --> 01:02:26,921
- Thank you, Stumpy.
- No problem!

937
01:02:26,961 --> 01:02:28,601
Take these twice a day...

938
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:30,921
and you will be back
at the plate in no time.

939
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:32,561
Will these make it bigger?

940
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:34,921
That'd be nice.

941
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:39,721
So, are you, like,
a crippled guy?

942
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:43,561
No. I'm just a really lazy guy.

943
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:46,361
It happened at the X Games
a couple of years ago.

944
01:02:46,401 --> 01:02:48,441
Piled into a fence.
Pretty messy.

945
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:50,241
They show the clip
on ESPN all the time.

946
01:02:50,281 --> 01:02:54,241
In the intro
for "Sports Bloopers"?

947
01:02:54,281 --> 01:02:56,761
- You're that dude?
- I'm that dude.

948
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:59,921
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I wipe out all the time.

949
01:02:59,961 --> 01:03:01,241
Ever since I was a little kid...

950
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,001
I wanted to be either
a doctor or a blooper...

951
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:06,801
so it's basically win-win for me
except now I can't feel my legs.

952
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:09,801
Pig Pen, what are you doing?

953
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:11,321
He doesn't feel that.

954
01:03:11,361 --> 01:03:13,121
So, anyway, what the hell
does a guy gotta do...

955
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:14,761
to get a drink in this town?

956
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:16,801
Actually, I'll catch up
to you guys later.

957
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:19,521
I have to... nice to meet you.

958
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:22,241
Used to be my bar,
but they kind of took it away.

959
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,441
They got wine, if you want wine.

960
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:26,041
What?

961
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:43,441
Staff room, right now,
or so help me, I will get my...

962
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:45,121
You don't even have
to say it, Eric. I know.

963
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:46,801
Come on. Let's move.

964
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:52,801
Got a little surprise
for you boys.

965
01:03:59,081 --> 01:04:02,640
Anthony, Luke, Pierre...

966
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,721
Pierre? Your name's Pierre?

967
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:07,801
Majors is really pissed.

968
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:09,601
He thinks you're all
totally incompetent.

969
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:13,320
He's given me no choice.
You're fired.

970
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:15,481
Effective immediately.
I'm sorry.

971
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:17,681
I really am.
I've nothing against you...

972
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:21,801
but it's either this,
or he won't buy the mountain.

973
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,120
Muntz! How can you do this?

974
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:27,001
I mean,
this is all that we have.

975
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:30,161
What's Pierre gonna do?
He's very stupid.

976
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:31,961
And you're gonna side
with Majors...

977
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,840
who calls you a retard
to your face?

978
01:04:34,841 --> 01:04:38,120
We say stuff like that, too,
but not to your face.

979
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:41,121
And you know why?
We're your friends.

980
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:43,161
You guys brought this
on yourselves.

981
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:45,241
The hot tub, the drug test...

982
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,761
you're disrupting
the whole town.

983
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:55,241
Now... you didn't help me out,
and now I can't help you out.

984
01:04:55,281 --> 01:04:57,081
I'm sorry.

985
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:59,721
Knock, knock.

986
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:04,481
Hey there, Rick.
Welcome to the winning team.

987
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:08,361
Got you a little gift.
I'll see you out there.

988
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:09,841
Hey, thanks a lot.

989
01:05:14,721 --> 01:05:17,361
"Hey there, Rick.
Welcome to the winning team.

990
01:05:17,401 --> 01:05:20,201
"Got you a little gift.
I'll see you out there."

991
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:33,441
Those bastards.

992
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:41,241
We rule.

993
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:46,441
I'm sorry, guys.
My dad can be a jerk, I know...

994
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:48,601
but it's not like you get
to pick your parents.

995
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:02,040
Needed burnin'.

996
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,641
What are we gonna do now?

997
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:07,441
I'm not good at anything else.

998
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,880
Not that I was good at this,
whatever this whole thing was...

999
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:12,961
but at least
it was familiar to me.

1000
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:15,001
I can fly you guys
down to Anchorage if you want.

1001
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,321
You guys can get rides
from there to wherever.

1002
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:19,121
Look, if worse comes to worse...

1003
01:06:19,161 --> 01:06:21,641
we can always get jobs
on an oil rig.

1004
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:25,401
Our uncle works on one in Nome,
and we'd be great at that.

1005
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:27,001
Pig Pen, you're on fire.

1006
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,281
Guys on oil rigs
get laid a lot, right?

1007
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:34,481
On their occasional break...

1008
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:38,041
from their 19-hour work day
in the freezing sleet...

1009
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,681
yeah, they get laid
all the time, Pig Pen.

1010
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:41,441
All right, I'm down.

1011
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:42,921
I'm in.

1012
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:45,521
We should go
and say good-bye to Rick.

1013
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:47,521
He knows that we're leaving...

1014
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:48,920
then he's gonna
throw it all away.

1015
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,681
So... we have to do
the honorable thing...

1016
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:54,160
and steal a few street signs...

1017
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:55,961
and leave town
with our tail between our legs.

1018
01:06:56,001 --> 01:07:00,001
Oh, my God, guys.

1019
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:02,201
What's wrong with you?

1020
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:05,201
I don't know where to start.

1021
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:08,121
Ever since they took
my bar away from me...

1022
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:10,601
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

1023
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:13,561
A lot of drinking
and a lot of thinking.

1024
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:17,480
A lot of thinking
about why I act the way I do.

1025
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:21,401
Why I feel the need to have
countless sexual conquests...

1026
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:23,121
one after the other...

1027
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:26,961
and I think it's due
to the fact that I'm...

1028
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,641
I don't know how to say this.
I'm...

1029
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:32,001
Gay?

1030
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:34,041
What?

1031
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:35,841
Gay?

1032
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:39,841
Come on, guys!

1033
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,361
Mr. October batting
for the other team?

1034
01:07:42,401 --> 01:07:44,681
Lance, everybody knows.
Nobody cares.

1035
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:47,401
It's OK. You know?
I mean...

1036
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:51,761
if you weren't gay,
you'd be a pretty weird guy.

1037
01:07:53,601 --> 01:07:54,761
Really.

1038
01:08:04,921 --> 01:08:06,041
Come on.

1039
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:11,681
I was just gonna say
that I was adopted, but...

1040
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:14,241
since we're having
this conversation...

1041
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:23,801
Hey, Rick, lookin' good.
Money suits you.

1042
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:25,841
Thanks, Mr. Majors.

1043
01:08:25,921 --> 01:08:27,601
Mr. Majors?
What happened to John?

1044
01:08:27,641 --> 01:08:30,321
After all,
you're practically family now.

1045
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:33,161
And not that bogus
Majors Resort "family"...

1046
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:36,041
that I tell the minimum wagers
they're in, either.

1047
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:37,521
Where are all my friends?

1048
01:08:37,561 --> 01:08:40,961
They're gone, Rick.
Business 101.

1049
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:42,561
Listen, I was doing you a favor.

1050
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:45,241
See, those guys
are just dead weight.

1051
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:47,641
Now you can run this place
to your full potential.

1052
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:51,481
You'll make a boatload.
Maybe you'll marry my daughter.

1053
01:08:51,521 --> 01:08:53,761
I got work to do.

1054
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:55,680
Get that statue out of here!

1055
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,441
This thing weighs a ton!

1056
01:08:57,481 --> 01:09:00,481
Who is this guy?

1057
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:02,081
What the...

1058
01:09:04,601 --> 01:09:09,001
Bull Mountain!
Don't go changin'!

1059
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:11,681
Get that sign straight, guys!

1060
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:21,281
I quit!

1061
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:26,681
That's a $300 hat, bitch!

1062
01:09:28,681 --> 01:09:31,641
I can't believe I was so stupid!

1063
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:34,881
Rick! Jeez, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

1064
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,360
Barry is flying the guys
to Anchorage.

1065
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:40,121
- What do you mean?
- They're leaving, Rick. Come on.

1066
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:49,801
I've always wanted
to be a flight attendant.

1067
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:51,001
You showing a movie today?

1068
01:09:51,081 --> 01:09:52,481
It's not "Alive," is it'?

1069
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,121
You guys are just gonna leave?

1070
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:01,841
You can come with us
if you want to.

1071
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:05,881
You're not gonna throw
your life down the tubes...

1072
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:07,401
just 'cause we're incompetent.

1073
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:08,681
You were born
to run this mountain.

1074
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:11,121
This is what you want to do.
You're staying, period.

1075
01:10:11,161 --> 01:10:14,161
I appreciate that,
I really do, but I just quit.

1076
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:17,521
In that case, hop on.

1077
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:20,000
We got plenty of room for you
if we throw out one of the kegs.

1078
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:21,521
You can't leave.

1079
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:24,761
Bull Mountain is not just
our job, it's our home.

1080
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:27,601
Not really. You've seen
what they've done to the place.

1081
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:29,521
We're not the locals anymore...
they are.

1082
01:10:29,561 --> 01:10:31,801
Snownook's not our town, Rick.

1083
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:34,441
Bull Mountain,
that was our town.

1084
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:36,521
Technically,
it belonged to the Eskimos...

1085
01:10:36,561 --> 01:10:37,961
but we stole it fair and square.

1086
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:40,960
They're right, Rick.
Bull Mountain's gone.

1087
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:42,801
They even tore down
the statue of Papa Muntz.

1088
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:44,561
What?

1089
01:10:47,801 --> 01:10:51,121
You guys remember
Papa Muntz's last toast...

1090
01:10:51,161 --> 01:10:52,401
right before he died?

1091
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:54,401
No. Remind me.

1092
01:10:54,441 --> 01:10:57,161
He held up his beer, he looked
at the mountain that he loves...

1093
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,961
and he said,
"Don't go changin'."

1094
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:01,281
His last words were
from a Billy Joel song?

1095
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:02,560
"Don't go changin'."

1096
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:03,681
Bull Mountain is our home...

1097
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:05,321
and I say,
let's do somethin' about it.

1098
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,401
It's our home!

1099
01:11:07,441 --> 01:11:09,761
- Let's do somethin'!
- It is our town!

1100
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:13,241
You got a plan?

1101
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:16,121
I'm in.

1102
01:11:16,161 --> 01:11:17,281
- Me, too.
- Same here.

1103
01:11:17,321 --> 01:11:19,081
Let's do it.

1104
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,001
- Let's do it. Come on.
- Unpack your bags.

1105
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:23,961
I'm down,
but if we're stayin'...

1106
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:27,361
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of!

1107
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:51,681
I've never been
a man of words...

1108
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:55,521
but there's something
that I have to say to you.

1109
01:11:55,561 --> 01:12:00,521
Inga, I've loved you from
the first time that I saw you...

1110
01:12:00,561 --> 01:12:04,561
and I love you more than
any man's ever loved a woman...

1111
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:09,241
that he's never
actually spoken to.

1112
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:12,361
I'm only gonna offer this once.

1113
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:16,161
Inga, will you...

1114
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:18,681
have sex with me?

1115
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:28,521
Nothing would piss off
my schtepfather more.

1116
01:12:29,801 --> 01:12:32,201
Let's do this.

1117
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:35,441
All right, guys,
you know what to do.

1118
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,641
It's time to destroy
this little celebration!

1119
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:55,281
Let's go. Come on, guys.
All right.

1120
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:57,161
Anthony, come on.
What are you doing?

1121
01:12:57,201 --> 01:12:58,361
What?

1122
01:12:58,401 --> 01:13:00,361
It's time to get
back on that board, man.

1123
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:09,041
Welcome, friends and investors.

1124
01:13:09,081 --> 01:13:12,000
We may be 10,000 feet
above sea level...

1125
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:15,241
but this is the ground floor
you're gettin' in on today.

1126
01:13:15,281 --> 01:13:18,241
The ground floor of a dream.

1127
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:20,681
Now, with my signature
and your money...

1128
01:13:20,721 --> 01:13:22,481
we can make this dream
come true.

1129
01:13:22,521 --> 01:13:25,601
Yes, sir. The future is ours.

1130
01:13:25,641 --> 01:13:27,161
Just one beautiful...

1131
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:30,161
state-of-the-art
gondola ride away. Hit it!

1132
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,161
I thought I fired your ass!

1133
01:13:45,281 --> 01:13:47,641
Inga, get your clothes on!

1134
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:51,041
You're just like your mother.

1135
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:55,401
Guys, if this is gonna
be it, let's make it count.

1136
01:13:57,001 --> 01:14:00,681
Stay low, don't hit any kids,
and most of all...

1137
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:02,161
- don't sit down.
- Why not'?

1138
01:14:02,201 --> 01:14:04,241
'Cause we're doin' this
Papa Muntz style, baby.

1139
01:14:04,281 --> 01:14:06,241
Get' em off!

1140
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:09,961
Come on, get 'em off!

1141
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:11,921
Luke, if you would
do the honors, please.

1142
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:15,201
Everybody, pants at half-mast.

1143
01:14:18,201 --> 01:14:19,921
Let's put Papa Muntz
back where he belongs.

1144
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:24,001
All right, then.
One... two... three!

1145
01:14:26,641 --> 01:14:28,441
<i>Four...</i>

1146
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:30,761
five...

1147
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:33,481
Sorry about that, folks.

1148
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:35,921
I assure you everything's
completely under control.

1149
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:39,681
Everything's just fine!

1150
01:14:39,721 --> 01:14:41,281
Duck!

1151
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:45,281
What the hell
is Captain Cripple doing here?

1152
01:14:45,321 --> 01:14:46,601
What?

1153
01:14:50,321 --> 01:14:51,481
Honey...

1154
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,001
Lock her in the Humvee
till he's gone.

1155
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,601
Nineteen.

1156
01:14:54,641 --> 01:14:56,201
Twenty.

1157
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,321
Come on, baby. Twenty-one.

1158
01:14:58,361 --> 01:14:59,481
Don't touch me!

1159
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:01,760
You better learn
some manners, little lady.

1160
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:03,321
Get in!

1161
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:06,681
- So, what's up?
- Guard duty.

1162
01:15:06,721 --> 01:15:07,881
Nice!

1163
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:21,441
Everything is fine!

1164
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:38,401
Hey, man, don't fret!

1165
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:44,561
Afternoon, everybody.

1166
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,641
Rick, you ungrateful jerk!

1167
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:53,561
Get out of my way!

1168
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:00,601
Stop! Thief!

1169
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:01,801
Hey, stop those guys!

1170
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:03,721
Get those guys out of here!
Bunch of losers!

1171
01:16:10,801 --> 01:16:12,321
What the hell's
he doin' up there?

1172
01:16:12,361 --> 01:16:14,561
Wait!

1173
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:24,361
Shit!

1174
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,881
How's that for irony?

1175
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:34,121
Come on!

1176
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:41,521
I'm your father.

1177
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:43,001
OK. Whatever.

1178
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,601
Go! Get out of here!

1179
01:16:49,321 --> 01:16:52,721
All right. At my signal...

1180
01:16:52,761 --> 01:16:54,521
unleash hell.

1181
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:57,561
Wait! Don't leave!

1182
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:59,801
So there's a few bad apples!

1183
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:02,561
So my daughter's a whore!
This is a hell of a deal!

1184
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:09,481
Hey, come on, kids.

1185
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:11,921
Let's... play safe, all right?

1186
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,801
Was that a bottle?

1187
01:17:30,481 --> 01:17:33,001
- Want to go for a ride?
- Where are we going?

1188
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,361
We're getting out of here.

1189
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:38,001
Hang on.

1190
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:43,561
You want me? Here I come!

1191
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:51,761
Papa...

1192
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:56,121
you will be restored
to your rightful place.

1193
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:13,641
Why did you take me
around this way?

1194
01:18:13,681 --> 01:18:15,521
Because you're
getting on that plane.

1195
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:17,641
- I don't understand.
- Come on.

1196
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:20,680
I'm gonna stay here, so your dad
doesn't know where you went.

1197
01:18:20,681 --> 01:18:22,641
Wait! Last night you said...

1198
01:18:22,681 --> 01:18:25,201
Look, last night
we both said a lot of things.

1199
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:27,881
Some of 'em were true,
most of them weren't...

1200
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:30,841
but I thought about it, and it
all adds up to one thing...

1201
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:34,521
you're gettin' on that plane
where you belong... with Barry.

1202
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:38,921
Look, we'll always have
Pedro O'Horny's, right?

1203
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:41,681
We'd lost that
until you came here.

1204
01:18:58,121 --> 01:18:59,281
<i>Go.</i>

1205
01:19:00,121 --> 01:19:02,001
Thank you, Rick.

1206
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:40,441
Think this is funny, retard?

1207
01:19:42,001 --> 01:19:43,961
Damn, what was that?

1208
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:46,961
Is it me, or do you even fight
like a retard?

1209
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:50,041
Do it!
Call me retard one more time!

1210
01:19:50,081 --> 01:19:51,561
- Retard!
- I hate you!

1211
01:19:53,521 --> 01:19:58,201
Oh, you can't get
to heaven on rollerskates

1212
01:19:58,241 --> 01:20:00,481
'Cause you'll roll right past...

1213
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,521
Ride, Papa!

1214
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,681
You big lug!

1215
01:20:17,201 --> 01:20:19,000
This is how you repay me?

1216
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:20,481
What the hell you got
to say for yourself?

1217
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:21,921
I've got one thing
to say to you.

1218
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,521
Get off our mountain, asshole!

1219
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,961
All right, fine.
You win. I'll go.

1220
01:20:29,961 --> 01:20:31,921
But first,
I'm gonna whomp your ass!

1221
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:34,001
Bring it on, big man!

1222
01:20:41,361 --> 01:20:42,641
Papa Muntz!

1223
01:20:45,801 --> 01:20:48,521
Damn! What the hell was that?

1224
01:20:48,561 --> 01:20:49,961
That was my dad!

1225
01:20:50,001 --> 01:20:51,881
Look out! Watch out!

1226
01:20:55,761 --> 01:20:56,961
Stop!

1227
01:20:58,641 --> 01:21:00,081
Help!

1228
01:21:06,681 --> 01:21:08,281
Let me go!

1229
01:21:11,681 --> 01:21:14,161
Help me!

1230
01:21:17,721 --> 01:21:18,841
Stop!

1231
01:21:20,361 --> 01:21:21,681
Where's Anna?

1232
01:21:28,601 --> 01:21:30,601
Where's your boot?

1233
01:21:33,441 --> 01:21:36,041
Let's get a drink. Come on.

1234
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:42,081
Nice work, Lance.

1235
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:43,561
Hey, fellas!

1236
01:21:43,601 --> 01:21:45,161
Check it out!

1237
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:47,041
Isn't that Anthony?

1238
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:57,401
Speech!

1239
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:03,081
Hot sluts with tits.

1240
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:05,521
Lance, you don't have
to do that anymore, buddy.

1241
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:07,201
Oh, sorry.

1242
01:22:07,241 --> 01:22:09,640
Old habits die hard.

1243
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:10,801
I love men!

1244
01:22:10,841 --> 01:22:12,201
Lance, you don't have
to do that, either.

1245
01:22:12,281 --> 01:22:13,401
Who wants me'?

1246
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:18,561
Help! Retard?
Short Stack? Anybody?

1247
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:31,961
Man, you must be proud, huh?

1248
01:22:34,361 --> 01:22:37,201
- So, do you ever miss her'?
- Who?

1249
01:22:37,241 --> 01:22:39,801
That is the right answer.

1250
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:43,601
So...

1251
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:45,521
you want to get a drink
with me later?

1252
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:49,521
You're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that, Ricky.

1253
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,681
You know, things worked out...

1254
01:22:58,721 --> 01:23:02,721
pretty well for our friends
up here on Bull Mountain.

1255
01:23:02,761 --> 01:23:04,041
Rick and Jenny?

1256
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:08,040
Yeah, they got together,
and then some!

1257
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:10,041
Two sweet kids like that...

1258
01:23:10,081 --> 01:23:12,681
they could do mighty well
by one another.

1259
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:16,481
Anybody who ever tells you
that money won't buy you love...

1260
01:23:16,521 --> 01:23:18,921
hell, they ain't ever been
to Reno.

1261
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:20,521
I was at the buffet table.

1262
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:23,441
This gal comes up to me,
and I flash them dimes...

1263
01:23:23,481 --> 01:23:26,041
and we went right up
to her hotel room...

1264
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:27,881
well, it was a car.

1265
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:29,921
This is the good one.

1266
01:23:38,241 --> 01:23:40,361
You're pretty good
on that thing, son.

1267
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:41,801
I'm a genius.

1268
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:51,601
Actually, he was Mr. Mankowicz,
but you can call me...

1269
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:54,881
Set!

1270
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:57,201
Who is under my table?

1271
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,961
Who put a farting machine
under my table?

1272
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:05,041
This uniform
makes my nuts rageous.

1273
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:07,681
This uniform's
really cramping my Hardy Boys.

1274
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:08,881
It's no mystery.

1275
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:11,241
This outfit is suffocating my...

1276
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:13,881
Lance, can I get a drink for...

1277
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:22,801
Cut!

1278
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:36,481
Are we still makin' this movie?

1279
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:38,561
Are we done with this crap?

1280
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:14,401
When this country
went off the gold standard...

1281
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:18,360
Your paper is paper,
nothin' more than paper...
