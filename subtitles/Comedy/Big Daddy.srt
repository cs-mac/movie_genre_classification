1
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,137
-Hello?
-Sonny, it's your dad. You asleep?

2
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:46,263
No. Hey, man. l was exercising.

3
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:48,854
-Bullshit. You were sleeping.
-l wasn't.

4
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:52,336
This kid won't stop lying to me.
You still act like you're six.

5
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,782
Yeah, okay, Dad.
I act like I'm six.

6
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,658
Found a job yet, where
you work more than one day a week?

7
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:01,099
I've been looking.

8
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:02,974
Looking won't pay the rent.

9
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,534
All the money I won
from the cab accident...

10
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:08,094
... is kicking ass
in the stock market, so relax.

11
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,813
-Don't blow it on worthless crap.
-I won't.

12
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,933
You should spend it on your bar exam.

13
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:17,745
You're the lawyer.
I ain't taking a bar exam.

14
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,862
I got too much other shit going on.

15
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:23,181
I don't know what happened to you.

16
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,337
How're things going with
your girlfriend, Vanessa?

17
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:27,734
Things are going fine.

18
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:29,253
Shit!

19
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,455
l gotta go.

20
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:33,219
Shit! You turned off
the alarm clock again.

21
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:37,174
No! l mean, yes, l did,
but l thought you needed more sleep.

22
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,735
l shouldn't have stayed here.
That was a jerk thing to do.

23
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,453
Why are you going to work?
lt's Sunday.

24
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:47,300
l'm not going to work. l'm going to
brunch with potential clients.

25
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:50,981
That's how a party planner
gets business, by making contacts.

26
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:54,342
Meet with me. l'll order in
from Cozy's. We'll have fun.

27
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:58,180
l am sick of Cozy's.
You order in from there all the time.

28
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,938
The delivery guy's your best friend.

29
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:02,255
He happens to be pretty damn nice.

30
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:04,223
This is a rough patch in my life.

31
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,855
Syracuse is 0 and 3.
And l got those medical problems.

32
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:09,094
Medical problems?

33
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:12,815
A cab runs over your foot two years ago.
You're hospitalized one night.

34
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,862
First of all, that cab was huge.

35
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:19,018
And a jury decided that one night
of pain was worth $200,000.

36
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,096
-So there you go.
-Whatever.

37
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,495
Why are you being
so nuts to me lately?

38
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:26,459
You refuse to move on
to the next phase.

39
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,463
l'd like to have a family someday.

40
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:31,265
l need someone l can rely on,
not a playmate.

41
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,662
You need a father figure?
"Stop pulling your sister's hair!"

42
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:38,416
You know what? l'm gonna go to
Syracuse to see my mom.

43
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,258
-l'll be back on Wednesday.
-What are you talking about?

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,144
l had call for delivery, but it was
crank call. You want chocolate cake?

45
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:51,819
Come back later.
l'll lndian wrestle you.

46
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:53,259
You're going down, sucker.

47
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:54,494
We'll see about that.

48
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,781
Okay. Peace, out.

49
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,857
You're going to Syracuse?

50
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:00,857
l need time to think and so do you.

51
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:02,094
Think about what?

52
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:04,859
Your life and why l should
be a part of it.

53
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:05,861
All right.

54
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:09,256
While you're at it,
think about getting a real job.

55
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,382
l got a real job!

56
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,736
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.

57
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:23,019
-Hey, Sonny.
-What's up, buddy boy?

58
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,256
l'm out the door. Hey, pal.

59
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,897
-Where you going?
-Manhattan.

60
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:29,624
You wanna take me with you?

61
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:31,935
All right, l guess.

62
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:33,903
Hold onto your money.
Later on.

63
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:35,578
Okay, take care, Sonny.

64
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:37,180
See you.

65
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,502
Cadillac, l love it.

66
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,264
Surprise!

67
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,143
Just ignore him.

68
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,185
lt's only Sonny. lt's only Sonny.

69
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,700
Yeah, it's only me. lt's only me.

70
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:11,263
-What's going on?
-Corinne's going-away party for Kevin.

71
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:14,224
She didn't tell me.
The roommate has a right to know.

72
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,581
She knew you'd ruin the surprise.

73
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,814
No, l wouldn't.

74
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,340
Hey, surprise.

75
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:22,774
Surprise.

76
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:26,174
What's going on?

77
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,897
We wasted the good surprise on you.

78
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,294
All right.

79
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:41,614
ls this your handiwork?

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,423
l guess.

81
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,457
See you in three hours.

82
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,014
Good to see you stiffs.
What've you been doing?

83
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:51,894
Last three weeks have been crazy.
l've been in Denver, Dallas--

84
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:55,694
l'm sleeping in the office.
We're going to trial on the fraud case.

85
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,778
Honey, it was a great surprise.
l was totally shocked.

86
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:02,256
No, you weren't!
And l worked so hard on this.

87
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:03,779
Need some help?

88
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,220
-Honey, your sister's here.
-Hey, sweetie.

89
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:08,296
l hate Sonny.

90
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:12,094
My client's out $7 million. All we
can sue on is breach of contract.

91
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,576
Maybe you can sue under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

92
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:18,858
l gotta get back to the office.
You're the king.

93
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,504
Mikey, a pleasure.

94
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:22,861
-l'll see you at home.
-All right.

95
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,453
l'll walk you out.

96
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:31,298
l gotta admit, l'm still
weirded out when they kiss.

97
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,979
Why? They're gay.
That's what gay guys do.

98
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:37,774
l know, but they were like
brothers to us back in school.

99
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:41,256
They're still like our brothers.
Our very, very gay brothers.

100
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,257
What are you doing after this?
Going to a Klan meeting?

101
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,894
Remember when Dad had that barbecue
for his friends and it rained...

102
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,261
...so he and Mom went into the
kitchen and made...

103
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:55,463
...1 00 hamburgers with one frying pan?

104
00:05:56,145 --> 00:06:00,741
You're not gonna let a little rain
stop you from making 1 00 hamburgers.

105
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,499
That relationship's lasted longer
than l thought it would.

106
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,897
Look at his eyes. He's bored.
l give it two more weeks.

107
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,420
Hey, excuse me. Everybody!

108
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:26,177
l'm sorry. l wanted to thank you
for coming tonight.

109
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:27,744
l guess l should say--

110
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:31,461
l'm getting it.

111
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:36,017
Tomorrow l'm leaving for China to
represent the firm of Morton and Mandel.

112
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:39,940
Me, the same guy who once shaved
his ass to win a $5 bet.

113
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,024
Prove it!

114
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:45,260
Just kidding.

115
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,861
But l am real glad you're all here
tonight, because...

116
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,858
...l'm gonna do what l never thought
l'd have the guts to do.

117
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,098
You're not proposing, are you?

118
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:58,701
Yeah, pal, l am.

119
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,936
Well, think about it, you know?

120
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:02,538
God, Sonny, shut up!

121
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:09,583
Anyway, will you?

122
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:11,739
Yeah.

123
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,897
Good call on the two weeks.

124
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,777
Sonny, what was that all about?

125
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,176
Congratulations. You and
" Big Boobs" McGee are gonna be happy.

126
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,778
Don't call her that.

127
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:36,018
You wanna tell your children you met
their mother as a waitress at Hooters?

128
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:39,143
Sonny, that was five years ago.
She's a doctor now...

129
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:41,376
...and my fiancée, so from now on...

130
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,138
...Dr. Big Boobs McGee.

131
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:45,580
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, man.

132
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,497
l just...

133
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,863
...got shit going on.

134
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,094
What's the matter?

135
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,575
Vanessa's gonna break up with me...

136
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:56,259
...and l don't know how
to make her wanna stay.

137
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,735
She's getting older.
She wants different things:

138
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:01,863
Career, stable relationship, a family.

139
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,174
That's how they get.

140
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:06,178
l want things to go back
to the way they used to be.

141
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,859
When we were at Syracuse,
and Vanessa worshiped you.

142
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,539
-That was nice.
-Nobody hassled you to get a job.

143
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,503
Tommy and Phil showered separately.

144
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,059
Those were the days.

145
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,344
-What're you doing?
-lf l make this...

146
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,940
...Vanessa will realize
she likes me the way l am.

147
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,459
You're going to the putt.

148
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,816
Remember, the roof breaks
to the right.

149
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,902
Yes! That's what l'm talk--

150
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:30,339
Good God!

151
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,938
That can't be good.

152
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,214
Where's Kevin?

153
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:42,339
He already left. l guess
he forgot to say goodbye to you.

154
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:45,782
-Why are you here?
-l'm cleaning because you're useless.

155
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,539
Then what, you gonna go to
your Hooters reunion?

156
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:52,141
You guys talk about whose ass
hangs out of their shorts the most?

157
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,894
At least l can fit my ass
in my shorts, fatty.

158
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,903
Speaking of fatty, whose is this?

159
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,420
-l don't know.
-l'm eating it then.

160
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:02,860
"We wasted the good surprise on you."

161
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,503
Lady gave me $5 to bring him here.

162
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,258
-What do you mean?
-Later.

163
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,902
Are you selling raffle tickets?

164
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,940
Oh, boy.

165
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,099
-Kevin Gerrity.
-I got something to tell you.

166
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:27,141
What's up?

167
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,340
There's a kid here.

168
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,574
What kind of kid?

169
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,975
lf this note is true, it's your kid.

170
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:33,374
What do you mean?

171
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,056
l'm having a tough time
reading this...

172
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:40,263
...but it says, " Dear Kevin:
This is Julian, your son.

173
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:43,065
l hope you understand why
l didn't tell you until now...

174
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,820
...but he needs your help.
I can't be his mother anymore. "

175
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,737
-This is ridiculous.
-Hang on.

176
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,899
Who's this?

177
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,376
This is my friend.

178
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,744
-ls that Kevin on the phone?
-No, it's my Uncle Remus.

179
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,224
What's your name?

180
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:02,774
ls he all right?

181
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,777
He doesn't like you.
Leave us alone.

182
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,299
You're such a dick.

183
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:09,343
That was your girlfriend.
She was acting " Hooterific."

184
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:11,098
Who sent that note?

185
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,175
"Jan."

186
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,258
Jan....
l don't know any Jan.

187
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,336
-Where's he from?
-Where are you from?

188
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:18,540
Buffalo.

189
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,741
l've never even been to Buffalo.

190
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,543
Maybe it's a mistake.

191
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:25,583
ls this like the time
you said my parents were dead?

192
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,338
l swear, he's right here.

193
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,664
l'm coming home.
l don't know what l'll say--

194
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:31,940
Hang on. lt says...

195
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:36,258
..." lf you won't take responsibility
for him, they found a foster family--"

196
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,497
Yes, Uncle Remus,
l know the catfish are huge.

197
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:40,860
That's terrific.

198
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,144
Here's a number for a guy...

199
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,979
...at City Social Service.
Arthur Brooks. I'll call.

200
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,181
-I'll come home.
-l'll take care of it.

201
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,380
Are you sure?

202
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,660
Yeah, don't worry.

203
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,818
Hooters. Hooters. Hooters!

204
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:56,021
-All right. Thanks a lot.
-Later.

205
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,862
l'm gonna make another phone call.

206
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:03,495
You want to come and sit down, pal?

207
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:10,736
Or you can stand there.
Anything you want. l'll be a minute.

208
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:15,539
Social Services
is closed today, Columbus Day.

209
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,060
We'll be open tomorrow at 8 a.m.

210
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,342
Columbus Day.

211
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,176
Boy, l don't know what to tell you.

212
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:26,655
Everything's gonna get
figured out tomorrow.

213
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:29,214
Can you be a tough little guy
until then?

214
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:31,134
Great.

215
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:35,102
Do l need to get you a bottle
of formula or something?

216
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,654
What do you eat?

217
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,179
Food.

218
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,416
Yeah? l eat food too.

219
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,736
What--? Come on.

220
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,343
You need me to hold your hand?

221
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:51,339
On Mondays, l go to Central Park
and watch rollerbladers fall down.

222
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,621
-You into that?
-l don't know.

223
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,103
Watch. This guy's humming.

224
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:59,337
He's going down, he's going down,
he's going--!

225
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:02,899
How old are you, anyways?

226
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:04,544
Five.

227
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,938
You wear a diaper?

228
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,656
You wipe your own ass then?

229
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,100
You do? Good job. That's cool.

230
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:17,703
Come on, fall down. Fall down. Yes!
Come on, damn it.

231
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,503
You suck. You suck!

232
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,978
Check this out.

233
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,260
My God!

234
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,338
There's a stick there.
Somebody should move it.

235
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:42,543
All right now, what way
would you put that on?

236
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:45,094
This Columbo, he pretends
to be stupid...

237
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,057
...but he's really smart as a tack.

238
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:48,499
Oh, yeah, he is.

239
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:52,533
You put the vane on down there.
Then this boat comes up.

240
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:54,741
l wipe my own ass.

241
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:56,898
Me too.

242
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:02,023
So, Mr. Ass Wiper,
what's this guy's name?

243
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:03,818
Scuba Steve.

244
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,056
Does he ever take his flippers off?

245
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:07,940
What if he goes bowling?

246
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:11,143
They don't make him wear bowling shoes?
He wears flippers?

247
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:12,181
Really?

248
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,461
l had a doll like that at one time.

249
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:17,139
But my cat, he bite his head off.

250
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:18,659
What cat would do that?

251
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:19,894
You calling me a liar?

252
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:21,783
Hey, take it easy.

253
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,134
Anyways...

254
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,103
...Jets are playing tonight.

255
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:29,018
We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone.
Wanna come?

256
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,698
l've got more deliveries.

257
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:33,459
Maybe you can also finish
the turkey on your lip.

258
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:34,854
Right there.

259
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:41,184
Let's crank up the Styx.

260
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:42,983
No music during the game.

261
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,262
-lt's halftime. Relax, Mr. Herlihy.
-Goddamn Jets.

262
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,336
What are you doing in here, cutie?

263
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:50,378
Watching football.

264
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,423
-Who do you want to win?
-The goddamn Jets.

265
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,217
Have fun.

266
00:13:57,305 --> 00:14:01,264
Too bad you don't like girls.
l think you could've had her.

267
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,735
-l'm thirsty.
-You're thirsty?

268
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,623
Are you allowed soda?

269
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:06,661
l don't know.

270
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,782
My mom always said
soda rots your teeth...

271
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,220
...but you'll lose them
anyway, so rot on.

272
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,821
-Can we get two root beers?
-Sure.

273
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:18,943
When l graduated law school, we met
here every Monday to watch football.

274
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,578
Who would meet you?

275
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:23,584
My friends, Vanessa.

276
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:28,144
Vanessa always rooted against the team
l wanted to win just to bust my chops.

277
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:31,821
But everybody's so busy with
their crap lately, no one comes.

278
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,783
Like l'm not busy?

279
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,256
Shut up or l'll smack you
through the wall like last Monday.

280
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:40,577
Last Monday was a fluke.
Bring it on, woman.

281
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:44,895
Anytime.

282
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:48,904
He drinks a lot of soda.

283
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:57,054
l'm telling you, buddy. Vanessa,
she's the one. l can't lose her.

284
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,023
l'm not getting any handsomer.

285
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,735
Every day l get a little bit older
and balder and fatter.

286
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,701
Fatter?

287
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,176
At your age l could eat anything.
Wouldn't gain an ounce.

288
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:10,861
Now, l have a chocolate shake,
my ass jiggles for a week.

289
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:14,814
-Enjoy the metabolism while you got it.
-Metalobism?

290
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:19,581
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning.
You must be wrecked.

291
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:23,421
Anyways, l had fun today.
Did you have fun?

292
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,062
Yeah, you're all right.

293
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,139
Have a good one.

294
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,742
Could l have a night-light?

295
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,977
Night-light? l think l can
help you out. Hang on.

296
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:46,895
Let's see here.

297
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:50,537
There you go, all right?

298
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,058
Are you my dad?

299
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,537
No, l'm not, but...

300
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,777
...that Dad and Mom thing
we'll figure out in the morning.

301
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,543
You just go to sleep.

302
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,420
-Good night.
-Good night.

303
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,623
Go get the can, okay?

304
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:28,821
Go! Go! Go!

305
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,935
l'm thinking about keeping the kid.

306
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,981
Remember when we went to
the pet store...

307
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:43,013
...and you wanted that puppy,
but l reminded you about feeding it...

308
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,142
...cleaning it
and toilet training it?

309
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:48,138
This is kind of like that,
except with a human.

310
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:51,661
l mean, l'm glad you had fun and all,
but this is big.

311
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:55,056
l gotta do something big.
l think Vanessa will respect that.

312
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,503
You think that since women get pregnant
to fix a troubled relationship...

313
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,179
...why can't a guy adopt a kid
to do the same?

314
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:05,895
l didn't think of it like that.
But yes, that's what l'm thinking.

315
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:09,376
Sounds nuts to me, pal.
Do yourself a favour. Sleep on it.

316
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,377
You're right.
Can l use your phone?

317
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:19,024
Arthur Brooks speaking.

318
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:20,903
How you doing?
Kevin Gerrity.

319
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:22,498
Right on, Mr. Gerrity.

320
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:23,939
We were expecting you.

321
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:27,302
Do you still got a foster family
lined up for Julian?

322
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:28,341
Yes, we do.

323
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:31,338
l've decided to
take care of the little guy.

324
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,223
Way to sleep on it, pal.

325
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:36,104
You two want to get married,
l support that.

326
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:40,258
When parents take the responsibility,
there's no bigger high for us.

327
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:41,858
I'm psyched about it too.

328
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,060
So that's it.

329
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:45,182
Yep. Good luck
to you and your son.

330
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:47,539
My son.

331
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,934
Goddamn stick!

332
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,584
That's my boy.

333
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,499
Go back to sleep.

334
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,095
Well, l'm going back to sleep.
Nighty-night.

335
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,138
l wet my bed.

336
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,182
Oh, God.

337
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,854
That's a shitload of piss.

338
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,583
There you go, all right?

339
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,622
No more wetness.

340
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,860
Sleep, all right? Just try to sleep.
Stay asleep.

341
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:33,217
Sit still!

342
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:34,661
Lay!

343
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:43,658
All right! l'm up!

344
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:47,261
lt smells like urine in this joint.
Good job.

345
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,817
What're you doing there, boy?

346
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,259
Making cereal.

347
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:54,258
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
pour me a bowl?

348
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,942
Or don't pour me a bowl. Either way.

349
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,904
l got it. l got it.

350
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,784
We can fix this.

351
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,336
lt's not a big deal.

352
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,098
Look. See?

353
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,415
See how quick it goes away?

354
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,619
Crybaby, come on.

355
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,538
Don't worry about it, boy.

356
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:23,055
Scuba Steve, damn you!

357
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,574
You think that's funny,
me getting hurt?

358
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:34,620
There's a bright side to being up
before 1 1 : McDonald's breakfast.

359
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,584
l haven't been up for that
in 1 0 years. You wanna go?

360
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,702
Tie your shoes, we'll go. Hurry.

361
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,538
lt's like 1 2 blocks from here,
so tie quickly.

362
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,337
Do you need help with that?

363
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,143
l can do it.

364
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,184
Let me do it.

365
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,377
You loop it, you swoop it and you pull.

366
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,583
You loop it, you swoop it, you pull.

367
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,656
Good. Let's go. We're in a hurry.

368
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,943
lt's different for your generation.

369
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,745
You've always had
McDonald's breakfast available.

370
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:12,974
l have?

371
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:16,137
When l was born, all we had were
the burgers and fries.

372
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:19,661
Maybe the fish sandwich. l'm not sure.
l'll get back to you.

373
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,099
What are you doing?

374
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:23,502
Oh, yeah, the hand-holding thing.

375
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,254
My dad took us to McDonald's
the first morning they had breakfast.

376
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:31,861
Everybody was baffled.
"Are these sausages or hamburgers?"

377
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,743
l have to go to the bathroom.

378
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:35,976
We're gonna be there
in a minute.

379
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,624
l gotta go now.

380
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,378
Didn't you pee enough in bed?

381
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,218
We only got nine minutes
to get there.

382
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:46,343
But l gotta go to the bathroom.

383
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,018
All right, let's go.

384
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:50,981
Can my kid use the bathroom
for a minute?

385
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:52,101
Customers only.

386
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,336
He's just a kid.
We'll be in and out.

387
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:55,859
That's not my problem.

388
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,539
lt's not your problem? All right.

389
00:21:58,865 --> 00:21:59,854
Come on.

390
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:05,297
Here you are.
Your waiter will be right with you.

391
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,104
l can't do it.

392
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,620
What do you mean,
you can't do it? Just go.

393
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:13,902
l'm scared. Could you do it too?

394
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:16,894
All right.

395
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,933
Here we go.

396
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:23,058
And we're off.

397
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,499
That's not too difficult, right?

398
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,179
And we're both losing weight.

399
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:33,617
Good job. We're gonna miss
breakfast. Let's go.

400
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:35,338
Put it away.

401
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:41,662
-Thanks, anyways.
-Sure thing. Anytime.

402
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:43,463
Move your ass there, pee-boy.

403
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:46,856
We only got five minutes,
five minutes. Now four.

404
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:49,221
Come on. We're almost there.

405
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,304
Hey, mister. Why are you
sitting on the ground?

406
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,820
This is where l live.

407
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,020
We gotta get going.

408
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:56,061
Why?

409
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,656
ln retrospect, l made some
bad choices after high school.

410
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:01,577
-We gotta get going.
-Why?

411
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,180
This was during the
so-called Disco Era...

412
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,861
...but for me, it was more
the Doing Mushrooms Era.

413
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:10,335
-We're gonna miss breakfast.
-Why?

414
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:11,813
l never thought about that.

415
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,454
l was never Mr. Popularity
in high school...

416
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,094
...and l watched Fantasia a lot.

417
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:18,858
-One day it clicked.
-Hey, yappy.

418
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:21,221
lf you end it,
you get an Egg McMuffin.

419
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,456
How about a Sausage McMuffin
with hash browns?

420
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:24,933
You got a deal.

421
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:28,979
Look, look. He fell asleep.
Let's go.

422
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:30,655
Let's go.

423
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:36,939
Sausage McMuffin.

424
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:38,379
Pardon me, sir.

425
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,819
How you doing?

426
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,464
What can l get for you?

427
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,457
-What do you want?
-Cheerios.

428
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,263
They don't got Cheerios.

429
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:47,061
Lasagna.

430
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:50,103
What's the matter?
We'll take hot cakes and sausage.

431
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,256
Sorry. We stopped serving breakfast.

432
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:54,336
We're four seconds late.

433
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:57,861
You're 30 minutes and four seconds late.
Breakfast stops at 1 0:30.

434
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,100
Horseshit!

435
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:03,580
Don't cry. Sorry.

436
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,577
l was cursing at the lady, not you.

437
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:06,814
Nice parenting.

438
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:09,374
Thanks. Are you my therapist?
Take a walk.

439
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,104
Do you want a Happy Meal?

440
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:12,824
You got a Happy Meal?

441
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:14,942
Will somebody
get the kid a Happy Meal?!

442
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:16,460
Relax.

443
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,984
Where's my Egg McMuffin?

444
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:19,982
Breakfast is over at 1 0:30.

445
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,103
-Really? l thought it was 1 1 .
-l thought that too.

446
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:26,263
Total mind blower.

447
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:28,621
Will you just relax? Here.

448
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,457
What do you want me to do?

449
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:33,703
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight.
You'll like her.

450
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:36,533
You wanna see me get hurt?
That'll cheer you up?

451
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,380
All right.

452
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:45,582
You think that's funny?

453
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,139
Good. No more crying.

454
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:49,340
Are you okay?

455
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:51,496
Next time, kill me.

456
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:07,940
Let's do it, Rangers.

457
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:10,574
--Rangers against
the Tampa Bay Lightning.

458
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,019
And at this stage...

459
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:15,940
... it's as close as you can get
to a must-win game for the Rangers.

460
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,664
Or they'll fall behind--

461
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:18,661
How you doing?

462
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:19,781
How you doing?

463
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:21,301
You like hockey?

464
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:22,540
You like hockey?

465
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,623
This is a big, important game.

466
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:26,344
This is a big, important game.

467
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,655
Cut the crap.

468
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,100
Cut the crap.

469
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:31,984
l'm serious. Don't do that.

470
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:33,817
l'm serious. Don't do that.

471
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,421
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck,
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

472
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:40,064
That's what l thought. Shut up.

473
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:43,140
Don't you take naps?

474
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:44,420
Sometimes.

475
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:45,814
Go take a nap.

476
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:47,942
l'm too hungry to sleep.

477
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,383
You want some food?

478
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:04,936
Having a kid is great...

479
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:09,338
...as long as his eyes are closed
and he's not moving or speaking.

480
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:32,822
He's taken down! Penalty shot!

481
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,977
How you doing? You sleepwalking?

482
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:42,696
Why don't you go back sleepy?
Sleepy.

483
00:26:42,945 --> 00:26:44,424
Keep napping. What's this?

484
00:26:44,745 --> 00:26:45,621
Kangaroo song.

485
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:49,301
That's terrific. And we'll watch this
after the game, okay?

486
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,776
But after my nap,
l always watch the kangaroo song.

487
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:56,734
lt's overtime, and there's
a penalty shot about to take place.

488
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,020
lt happens every 1 0 years--

489
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,222
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!

490
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:05,614
All right!

491
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:08,542
God! You were normal yesterday.

492
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,857
l can't take this.
Are you serious?

493
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:23,504
Come and play

494
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,497
What do you say?

495
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:29,019
Douche-bag kangaroo.

496
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:34,058
Are you all hopped out?

497
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:40,054
l don't know what to do.
Hopefully Vanessa will.

498
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:43,581
l think she's back.
lf she's not back, we'll wait for her.

499
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,224
Get your coat. Clean up.

500
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:49,737
Oh, God. You don't
have to pee, do you?

501
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,296
-Do you swear?
-l swear.

502
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:55,379
How come you're not going?

503
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:59,174
l don't have to go. Only you and
my grandfather go every 30 seconds.

504
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:02,218
Let's hurry it up, all right?
l'm keeping you company.

505
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,903
He'll write your name on the wall.
Mind your business.

506
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:10,461
Let's go. Let's go.

507
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:13,417
Why do l need to meet this lady?

508
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:15,735
-Now it is your problem.
-Thank you.

509
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,816
She's that lady l was
telling you about.

510
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,533
She's gonna be a big part
of your life.

511
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:23,618
l'm scared. What if she's not nice?

512
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:25,014
Look.

513
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:28,901
See these right here?
These are magic sunglasses, okay?

514
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,301
lf you're afraid, put them on
to become invisible.

515
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,297
Really? Nobody can see me?

516
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:34,694
Put them on.

517
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:39,893
Sonny, l'm right here.

518
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:42,101
Oh, the glasses. l couldn't see you.

519
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,894
Keep those on. No one can notice you
until you decide they can.

520
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:46,975
-Okay.
-Let's go.

521
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:52,099
l'm still right here.

522
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:54,415
Okay, all right, the glasses.

523
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,215
Welcome back.

524
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,335
Who's that?

525
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:03,780
Who's who? He's invisible.

526
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:06,335
Can l come in?

527
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:07,821
Sure.

528
00:29:08,465 --> 00:29:10,376
Any invisible people out here...

529
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,536
...feel free to come in, okay?

530
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:17,823
Sonny, l don't really know
what's going on right now.

531
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,818
-We should talk--
-You said l got some thinking to do?

532
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:22,293
So l did it.

533
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,140
Just because l don't have a job
doesn't mean l don't wanna move on.

534
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:28,620
lnstead of saying that,
l figured l'd show you.

535
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:31,060
-Before you say anything--
-Look at that.

536
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:32,738
He took his sunglasses off.

537
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:34,941
He wants you to see him.
He likes you.

538
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:36,534
Julian, come here.

539
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:39,184
Come here, pal.

540
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:40,739
Vanessa...

541
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:43,783
...l want you to meet Julian, my son.

542
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:46,304
Our son. l adopted him.

543
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:49,423
l don't know what to say.

544
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:50,984
Don't say anything.

545
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,778
ls someone in the bathroom?

546
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:58,975
Why is the door shut?

547
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:00,021
l don't know.

548
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:01,414
You don't?

549
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:04,544
l don't know.

550
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:09,179
l can't believe this.

551
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:11,941
Open up.

552
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:16,057
Open the door!

553
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:20,102
-ls everything okay?
-Oh, my God.

554
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:22,456
l'm sorry. l was freaking out there.

555
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:24,218
-l'm Sonny.
-Sid.

556
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:28,219
l had an attack of paranoia. l thought
you were sleeping with my girl.

557
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,864
l am.

558
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:30,981
What's that?

559
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:33,374
l am.

560
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,901
That's what l was trying to tell you
before. l found someone.

561
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:38,942
-This old guy?
-Sid.

562
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,903
He's already achieved so much...

563
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:43,898
...and yet he's still goal-oriented
and still focused.

564
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:45,578
And he has a five-year plan.

565
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,258
What is it? " Don't die"?

566
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:52,144
l can't believe this. We got
a family now. This is what you wanted.

567
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:54,979
You surprising me with a kid
that you adopted...

568
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:57,455
-...wasn't what l wanted.
-l did this for you.

569
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:01,380
You wanted me to be more responsible.
l can't raise this kid alone.

570
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,776
You remind me of my grandson.
You don't think things through.

571
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:07,778
Hey, Old Man River, zip it
or l'll break your hip.

572
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:09,982
-l'd like to see you try it.
-Shut up.

573
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:12,659
How'd you misconstrue
the situation so badly?

574
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,463
l don't know.

575
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,140
Deep down you must've known
this day was coming.

576
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,735
You made the biggest mistake
of your life.

577
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:24,021
l know you'll be missing me
when you got...

578
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:26,460
...that big, white, wrinkly...

579
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:28,104
...body on top of you...

580
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,063
...with his loose skin...

581
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,023
...and old balls.

582
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,823
Gross.

583
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:44,222
Excuse me. How you doing?
l'm Kevin Gerrity.

584
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:47,184
l got an emergency problem.
ls Arthur Brooks around?

585
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,824
l'll go get him for you.

586
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:52,057
Stay where l can see you.
l gotta talk to this guy.

587
00:31:52,305 --> 00:31:53,738
Mr. Gerrity?

588
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:57,142
-Arthur Brooks.
-How are you? l need to speak with you.

589
00:31:57,385 --> 00:31:59,296
l didn't tell you to come here, did l?

590
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,501
l was gonna mail you
the paperwork.

591
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,542
lt's like the opposite of that.

592
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,862
Look, l can't manage this kid.

593
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,858
l ain't a good father.
l made a big mistake.

594
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:09,855
Mistake?

595
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,335
l had a mother lined up for him...

596
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:15,099
...but she's banging
the Pepperidge Farm guy.

597
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:17,461
The kid won't stop
peeing and throwing up.

598
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:20,219
He's like a cocker spaniel.
l just....

599
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:22,695
He'd be better off
with his natural mother.

600
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:26,104
Well, she passed away last night,
Mr. Gerrity.

601
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:30,497
She had cancer. She must have sensed
that her time was running short.

602
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:33,305
She wanted her son to be with
the natural father.

603
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:37,373
Loop.

604
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:39,015
Pull.

605
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,583
lf you don't wanna take care
of him...

606
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:45,215
...we'll take him. But he'll have to
chill in a group home.

607
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,103
Group home? Like an orphanage?

608
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:48,744
We don't call them that.

609
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:54,298
Look, l did it.
Loop, swoop and pull.

610
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:55,455
You did do it.

611
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:57,024
Congratulations, kid.

612
00:32:57,265 --> 00:32:58,778
l showed him that.

613
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:01,334
Why don't you go back over there, okay?

614
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,699
-l'll call the Heatherton Home--
-Let's do this.

615
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:08,176
l'll hang onto the kid
until you find him a new family.

616
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:11,622
l don't know. l gotta watch out
for the kid's best interest.

617
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,015
You said yourself you were a bogus dad.

618
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,256
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.

619
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:19,145
l don't wanna put him in a home
any more than you do.

620
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:22,058
Why don't we pretend you
didn't even come in here?

621
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:25,103
l'll give you a shout
when l line up a family.

622
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:26,494
-That's good.
-Later.

623
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,503
Just don't make me regret this.

624
00:33:29,185 --> 00:33:30,618
Where are we going now?

625
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:34,824
l gotta make a phone call.
Just stay right here, all right?

626
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,579
-This is a collect call from:
-Your baby boy.

627
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:45,464
-To accept charges, say, "Yes. "
-Yeah, l'll accept.

628
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,656
Dad, how's it going?
How's Florida?

629
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:51,136
Not too bad. Your mother got
a sunburn playing tennis.

630
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:54,183
-l got some interesting news.
-Oh, yeah? What?

631
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,063
Kind of adopted a kid.

632
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:57,340
What do you mean?

633
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,383
l'm talking about
you being a grandfather.

634
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,297
Who the hell would give you a kid?

635
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:03,944
Social Services.

636
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:06,335
You idiot. You better give
that kid back.

637
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:08,143
His mother's....

638
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,540
Hang on.

639
00:34:09,785 --> 00:34:11,696
Go play with them pigeons, buddy.

640
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,977
l tried to give him back.
l just can't. All right?

641
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:16,578
l need your help.

642
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:20,261
I'm in a bad way. Vanessa dumped me.
I don't know what I'm doing.

643
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:22,177
You're damn right.

644
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:24,097
The kid is always around.

645
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,415
He never leaves me alone.

646
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,737
You'd think he'd want some privacy.
l'm in deep shit.

647
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,658
Give that kid back before
you ruin both your lives.

648
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,020
l appreciate that.

649
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:36,221
He's better off living in a dumpster.

650
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,057
l'll be a better father than you!

651
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:40,535
lmpossible!
All you care about is yourself!

652
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:44,061
Yeah? No, l care about you
saving money on this call!

653
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:50,499
Let's eat.

654
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,981
The Vanessa thing did not work out.

655
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,535
She lost her damn mind.
That wasn't your fault, though, okay?

656
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,139
l know when you first got here, you
thought you were gonna meet your dad.

657
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,615
But l don't think
that's gonna happen.

658
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:06,701
Why?

659
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:08,174
l don't know.

660
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:11,179
But, buddy, real dads
aren't always that great.

661
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,222
l got one and he's
out of his mind.

662
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:17,140
He tells me what to do. He never lets
me figure stuff out on my own.

663
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:20,457
A lot of dads are like that.
That's why people grow up nuts.

664
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:22,618
Look at this guy.

665
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:26,494
He was probably a nice boy like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.

666
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:28,098
Who won the Jets game?

667
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:29,255
Who cares?

668
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,655
Let it go.
He can't control you anymore.

669
00:35:31,905 --> 00:35:32,894
What do you mean?

670
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,134
You know.

671
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:35,261
You're a loser.

672
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:38,099
You're mad at your dad, not at me!
l forgive you!

673
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:41,065
l am. l am. l hate my father.

674
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,695
l don't want it to be like that.
l don't wanna control you.

675
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:46,464
You even like your name?

676
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:47,901
l guess.

677
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,181
You guess? Shouldn't you like
your name?

678
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,655
lt'll be your name
the rest of your life.

679
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:54,294
What do you want?

680
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:57,784
Frankenstein.

681
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:01,062
l can deal with that.
l'll call you Frankenstein.

682
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,216
Frankenstein, you gonna play
in the puddle?

683
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:06,582
Go ahead. From now on, you do
whatever you wanna do.

684
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:08,975
l'll show you some cool shit
along the way.

685
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:10,783
That's what it's all about.

686
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:14,576
Stay in front of it.
Don't be scared.

687
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:16,622
lt's coming right at you.

688
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,060
Okay. All right.

689
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:20,614
You're picking your head up.
Don't do that.

690
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:23,623
ls this okay?

691
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,583
That's what you wanna wear?

692
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:27,824
That's okay with me then.

693
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:30,420
Good luck walking down the street.

694
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,743
Way to block it. Stay with it.

695
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,021
You're the next Willie Randolph.

696
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:48,378
Chief Jay Strongbow
used to do a sleeper hold.

697
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,774
Put your arm under here.

698
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:54,177
Lift this arm, okay? Slide under
and try to lock wrists.

699
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:55,858
Let me show you. Watch.

700
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:58,539
Throw him into the ropes
and he comes back....

701
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:01,575
Get him. Get him. Lock him up.

702
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:03,144
Lock wrists.

703
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:04,984
You bring him down slow.

704
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:06,779
Apply pressure.

705
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,618
He's going to sleep now.

706
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:12,221
See, he's out.

707
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:24,214
Wake up.

708
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:32,858
You'll be the only kid your age
with a slingshot.

709
00:37:33,265 --> 00:37:36,496
Go have some fun. Shoot a few
beer cans or something.

710
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:41,333
You like that?

711
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:47,458
Sonny, Sonny, come here!

712
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:49,582
What is it? What's the matter?

713
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:56,823
Let me have that.

714
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,623
Go to your room. l think.
Or do whatever you want.

715
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,655
lt's gonna be fun. You nervous?

716
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:06,021
No? You're excited, aren't you?

717
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:08,620
Let's go. Up, up, up.

718
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:11,976
Here comes some candy.

719
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:15,501
How you doing?

720
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:19,214
Happy Halloween!
We got a first-timer.

721
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,899
Do the right thing, buddy.

722
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:27,261
We want some candy!

723
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,979
Hang on right here for a second.
Don't move.

724
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:49,544
Yeah, that's it.

725
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:52,736
Yeah, CDs. You like that?

726
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:56,460
He's not happy. What else you got?

727
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,456
Okay, that's good. Trick-or-treat.

728
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:04,622
Say, " Happy Halloween."

729
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:06,776
Thank you.

730
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,414
Next year, be prepared, moron.

731
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,138
What's with the cummerbund?

732
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,057
l let him wear whatever he wants.

733
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:17,704
Those boots are the best.

734
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:19,697
l think they're Kevin's.

735
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:23,057
l'll have a hot dog with
the mustard and a knish.

736
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,658
Frankenstein, what do you want?

737
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,338
Thirty packets of ketchup.

738
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:28,940
All right. Thirty packets of ketchup.

739
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:31,779
Nice cut, pal.

740
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:34,735
Frankenstein.

741
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:37,380
Do that thing l taught you
the other day.

742
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:46,896
lt took him 20 minutes to learn that.
He's quick. He's smart.

743
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:49,056
-And he loves ketchup.
-He does.

744
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,535
This is a whole new school
of child-raising.

745
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:54,982
You give him options, not orders.
Let him make the decision.

746
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,294
You're a pioneer.

747
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,378
-So you two just chill out all day?
-Basically.

748
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,901
Hung out on the monkey bars.
The kid did eight chin-ups.

749
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:05,500
l can't even do one
with these scrawny arms.

750
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:07,736
They're not scrawny. They're nice.

751
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,695
What do you wanna do tomorrow?

752
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,537
l wanna go to school.

753
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,016
l don't force him, he makes
the right decision. Way to go.

754
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,904
We'll enroll you on Monday.
Enjoy the weekend.

755
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:20,294
Do the thing again.

756
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:30,344
That one touched the ground.

757
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:31,654
That was awesome!

758
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:33,099
Good job.

759
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,697
Help me! Help me!

760
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,694
Please help me.
l don't know where l live.

761
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:45,015
This isn't a big problem.

762
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:47,335
We'll find your parents.

763
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,775
-What's your name?
-Frankenstein.

764
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:51,860
There you are.

765
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:54,141
There you are. Are you okay, buddy?

766
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,822
l turn my head and he disappeared.

767
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:59,738
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Don't do that.

768
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:02,745
Thank you for being sweet
to my little boy.

769
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:04,623
You're welcome, Sonny.

770
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:08,817
l think my sister, Corinne,
is engaged to your roommate.

771
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:11,704
Your sister's Corinne? That sucks.

772
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:14,618
Yeah, l'm up from D.C.
l was at that party...

773
00:41:14,865 --> 00:41:17,254
...where we wasted
the good surprise on you.

774
00:41:17,505 --> 00:41:18,540
Sorry about that.

775
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:20,737
So, what, you have a son now?

776
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:23,783
l'm not his dad.
l'm more of a father-figure type...

777
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:26,698
...until Social Services
can get another family.

778
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,901
At which point,
you'll find a new way...

779
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,864
...to initiate conversations
with girls in the park.

780
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:33,743
Yeah, that's correct.

781
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:38,060
Good job, buddy!

782
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,744
He's peeing on his own.

783
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:41,498
Keep it flowing! That's it!

784
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:43,701
Go! Go!

785
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:46,573
So does Corinne's sister have a name?

786
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:47,980
lt's Layla.

787
00:41:48,225 --> 00:41:50,580
Layla? l like your song.

788
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:52,659
Could you do me a favour?

789
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:54,258
Could you hang out with me?

790
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:57,065
He'll think he's a failure
if he couldn't get me a date.

791
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:58,420
l really can't.

792
00:41:59,545 --> 00:42:01,217
l have a ton of work to do.

793
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:03,501
l see. Hang on a second.

794
00:42:03,745 --> 00:42:04,860
Come here.

795
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:12,704
Layla, if you don't come over
to Sonny's apartment tonight...

796
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:15,584
...there's a good chance
l'll develop a stutter.

797
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:20,097
P-P-P-Please don't do this to me.

798
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,934
-That is so cheap.
-What?

799
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:31,941
So l'm working in a tollbooth now.

800
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:34,494
l originally wanted to be
a male model...

801
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:37,737
...but l'm not very good-looking,
so that didn't work out.

802
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:39,338
l'm sorry to hear that.

803
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,223
l'm all right. l'm recovering.

804
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:44,025
This is my favourite part
of the song right here.

805
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:46,221
If I can't have you

806
00:42:47,345 --> 00:42:50,257
Better keep it down low.
The kid's gonna wake up.

807
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:52,978
Too late.

808
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,136
Okay. Just hang out a little bit.

809
00:42:55,385 --> 00:42:58,058
l'll be right back.
Don't go sneaking out.

810
00:42:59,825 --> 00:43:02,862
-What are you doing?
-You forgot to say good night.

811
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:04,140
What do you mean?

812
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:06,899
l can't go to sleep
until you say good night.

813
00:43:07,145 --> 00:43:09,613
l didn't know that.
l'm sorry. Good night.

814
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:11,658
Go to sleep now, all right?

815
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:13,224
What'd we learn about girls?

816
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,855
lnitiating the conversation
is half the battle.

817
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:19,255
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?

818
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:29,422
l gave him NyQuil.
He should be out for the night.

819
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:33,944
This is Styx. They've been
my favourite band since l was 1 2.

820
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:35,220
You're kidding me.

821
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:38,059
No, l can't help it.
l just love them.

822
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:39,977
My friends make fun of me.

823
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:43,376
My friends make fun of me too.
l've seen them 25 times.

824
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,219
Tommy Shaw, when l was 1 6,
l was at the concert...

825
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:48,615
...and he reached down,
pulled me on stage.

826
00:43:48,985 --> 00:43:51,055
l did the robot voice for " Mr. Roboto."

827
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:52,021
Really?

828
00:43:52,265 --> 00:43:53,903
No, l made that up. l'm sorry.

829
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,897
That would've been cool, right?

830
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:57,897
My cousin's friends
with their drummer...

831
00:43:58,145 --> 00:44:00,454
...so when they come to town,
we go to dinner...

832
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,775
...and they tell us stories
from the road.

833
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:03,741
Really?

834
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:07,136
No, l made that up again too.
l'm sorry.

835
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,935
You're not attracted to, like,
60-year-old guys, are you?

836
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:14,533
Yeah, l don't like them either.

837
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:18,816
l can't sleep.

838
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:23,179
He can't sleep.

839
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:27,304
So the rabbit ran across the street...

840
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:30,503
...because he thought
he saw some carrots.

841
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:32,861
But when he got across the street...

842
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:35,903
...it turned out they weren't carrots,
they were peanuts.

843
00:44:36,145 --> 00:44:37,863
Peanuts?

844
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:41,744
The peanuts belonged to a squirrel...

845
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:45,057
...who had taken them home
from a baseball game.

846
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:48,024
And then the rabbit
thought to himself...

847
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:50,381
..." Carrots, peanuts,
what's the difference?"

848
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:53,778
So he asked the squirrel
if he could have some.

849
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,902
And the squirrel said, "Of course."

850
00:44:56,145 --> 00:45:00,024
And the rabbit was very happy
to make such a nice new friend.

851
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,896
And so was the squirrel.

852
00:45:04,145 --> 00:45:06,739
And the rabbit thought the squirrel
had pretty hair.

853
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:09,774
And nice eyes also.

854
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:13,742
And the squirrel thought the rabbit
was really nice too.

855
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:17,341
And then, the rabbit
worked up his courage...

856
00:45:17,585 --> 00:45:19,735
...and asked the squirrel
if he could have...

857
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:22,545
...just the littlest squirrel kiss.

858
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:27,014
And the squirrel thought
it just wasn't the right time...

859
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:30,223
...in her busy squirrel life
to be kissing any rabbits...

860
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:33,775
...even though this particular rabbit
was very sweet.

861
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,460
And the rabbit got shut down, did he?

862
00:45:38,705 --> 00:45:42,698
That's all right.
But he was still thinking maybe...

863
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:45,664
...Scuba Steve could get
a squirrel kiss...

864
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:47,896
...so somebody's getting some action.

865
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,456
Good night, Scuba Steve.

866
00:45:57,265 --> 00:45:58,778
Good night, Frankenstein.

867
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:01,813
Good night, Sonny.

868
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:03,623
Good night, Layla.

869
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:08,463
Don't get caught with any girls.

870
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:10,741
lt's your first day. Take it slow.

871
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:13,823
l'll meet you after school
at 2:30, right out front.

872
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:15,460
You're not staying?

873
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:18,094
No, l gotta go get you
some more ketchup.

874
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,858
l don't like these kids.

875
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:22,938
l don't either,
but shouldn't we give them a chance?

876
00:46:25,545 --> 00:46:26,739
How's this?

877
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:31,175
Here are the magic sunglasses.

878
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:34,223
You put them on
if you feel scared, okay?

879
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:37,140
l lost you.

880
00:46:37,385 --> 00:46:39,580
l don't know where you are.
l'm sorry.

881
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:42,053
Oh, there you go.

882
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:45,735
You go inside and make some friends.

883
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:48,343
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.

884
00:46:48,585 --> 00:46:51,258
All right. Go inside.
l'm gonna miss you.

885
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,542
Hi, l like your hat.

886
00:46:56,785 --> 00:46:58,264
What's your name?

887
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:12,140
-Might as well--
-Leave a message!

888
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,536
-Might as well--
-Leave a message!

889
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:20,057
Mr. Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks
from Social Services. I got good news.

890
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,375
We may have found
a family for Julian.

891
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,900
Give me a call back
as soon as possible...

892
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,534
...so we can set up a meeting. Bye.

893
00:47:38,145 --> 00:47:39,498
Sierra Club Legal Department.

894
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:41,178
Can l speak to Layla Maloney?

895
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,741
Layla, line four.

896
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:47,739
You're a lawyer?

897
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:49,378
What are you doing?

898
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:52,822
Waiting for Julian so l can have
somebody to play with.

899
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:55,057
-What are you doing?
-l'm swamped.

900
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,296
l gotta do my laundry
on my lunch hour.

901
00:47:57,545 --> 00:48:00,423
l was gonna do my laundry today too.
Where are you going?

902
00:48:00,665 --> 00:48:03,304
There's a place nearby,
Suds, on Bleecker.

903
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:06,264
l know that place.
Maybe l'll see you there then.

904
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:08,735
Maybe. l gotta go.

905
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,218
I bought tickets,
and the show was the night before.

906
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,341
Maybe it was a mistake.

907
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:26,294
That's nice, but you don't know
what's going down on the streets.

908
00:48:26,745 --> 00:48:28,337
lt's hard to know what's going down...

909
00:48:28,585 --> 00:48:31,941
...when you're in an office
seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.

910
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:34,301
You're not gonna tell me
to get a real job.

911
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,536
No. You're a big boy.

912
00:48:36,785 --> 00:48:38,741
lt's cool you only work
one day a week.

913
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:42,293
These are the cutest things
l've ever seen.

914
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,295
l know.

915
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,105
l have them in yellow.
l wear them when l work out.

916
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:50,457
lt's great what you're doing
with Julian while you got him.

917
00:48:50,905 --> 00:48:51,860
Yeah, well, l got him.

918
00:48:52,105 --> 00:48:53,697
l read an article that said...

919
00:48:53,945 --> 00:48:57,062
...the most important influences
in a kid's life are his friends.

920
00:48:57,305 --> 00:48:58,454
They said that?

921
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:02,744
Just hope he's not hanging out with
drug dealers and delinquents in school.

922
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:06,220
l'm kidding.

923
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:08,694
l know. l know.

924
00:49:10,385 --> 00:49:13,183
Man, this Yoo-hoo is good.
You know what else is good?

925
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:14,938
Smoking dope.

926
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:16,784
l ain't going to rat you out.

927
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:18,174
Puffing the cheeba.

928
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:22,054
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J.
You know what l'm talking about?

929
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,024
l have a bellybutton.

930
00:49:24,305 --> 00:49:26,773
You have a bellybutton?
We all have bellybuttons.

931
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:29,937
And we all love Yoo-hoo.
Especially with a little rum.

932
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:30,975
What's rum?

933
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:32,294
You don't know?

934
00:49:32,545 --> 00:49:33,580
Rumpelstiltskin?

935
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:38,139
Rumpelstiltskin's a good man.
So are you guys.

936
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:41,215
Stay clean. Stay focused.

937
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:44,059
Frankenstein,
have fun with your friends.

938
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,377
Why are you scratching so much?

939
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:49,536
l have ecza....

940
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:51,138
Eczema? Gross.

941
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:52,943
How do l make it stop itching?

942
00:49:53,185 --> 00:49:55,494
l don't know. You scratch it.

943
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:57,815
SpaghettiO's. Do you like
SpaghettiO's?

944
00:50:00,785 --> 00:50:02,184
Dented cans are half price.

945
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:05,735
Microsoft went down three points.
We gotta save some money.

946
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:09,258
Here, give it a shot.

947
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:12,098
That's it, boy.

948
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:13,858
Put it in there. Feels good.

949
00:50:14,105 --> 00:50:16,573
Hi, Sonny.
Hi, Sonny's friend.

950
00:50:16,825 --> 00:50:17,974
His name's Frankenstein.

951
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:19,977
Hi, Frankenstein. Remember me?

952
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,785
Help me. l'm lost.
l don't know where l am.

953
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:24,344
You don't gotta do that.

954
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:27,543
You guys wear the same size
T-shirt. That's cool.

955
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:29,855
l heard you did laundry
with my sister.

956
00:50:30,105 --> 00:50:31,333
She said we did laundry?

957
00:50:31,585 --> 00:50:34,304
Where l'm from, it's called
doing the hibbity-dibbity.

958
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:37,253
l got eczema.

959
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,820
Well, then you shouldn't scratch it.

960
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:42,625
Don't tell him what to do.
He can scratch.

961
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:44,503
-Scratch.
-ls that better?

962
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:46,463
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

963
00:50:46,945 --> 00:50:49,539
You know about kids?
l thought you were a foot doctor.

964
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:53,744
lt's not doctor stuff. lt's common
sense. Scratching spreads rashes.

965
00:50:53,985 --> 00:50:56,135
This is something
you learned at Hooters.

966
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:02,973
-What the hell is he doing?
-He's shopping.

967
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:05,580
Microsoft went down three points.

968
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,460
That's good.
See you later, Frankenstein.

969
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:12,095
Stay away from the frozen-food section.
Your boobs'll harden.

970
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,736
lsn't Little ltaly the greatest?

971
00:51:21,985 --> 00:51:25,944
l like it. Everyone always tells me
to hang out in the Village and SoHo.

972
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:27,061
That's all right.

973
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:31,298
But you gotta respect a place where
the fatter you are, the cooler you are.

974
00:51:35,585 --> 00:51:38,941
Last time, he was with
a different girl. l guess he ate her.

975
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:44,183
l went to Coney lsland today
with the little boy.

976
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:46,495
You gotta take a look at this.

977
00:51:46,745 --> 00:51:48,622
We had a blast together.

978
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:51,699
He's so happy.

979
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:53,264
He is such a good boy.

980
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:56,861
lf l have a kid of my own,
l hope he's half as cool as that kid.

981
00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:58,779
ls he picking your nose?

982
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:01,221
Yeah, he was picking his own all day...

983
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:03,740
-...so l figured he could borrow mine.
-Sweet.

984
00:52:04,145 --> 00:52:06,340
He must be miserable
without you right now.

985
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:07,984
No, he's in good hands.

986
00:52:09,785 --> 00:52:12,458
Look at Brad's body.
Not an ounce of fat on it.

987
00:52:12,745 --> 00:52:15,384
-What?
-Don't worry. l like yours better.

988
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,581
l got two queens, two jacks
and an ace.

989
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:22,338
-l win.
-Why do you win?

990
00:52:22,585 --> 00:52:26,339
l got a two, a four, a ten,
an eight and a six.

991
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:28,257
l don't understand.
Why do you win?

992
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:30,700
-Because l win.
-What's the name of that game?

993
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:31,695
l win.

994
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:33,173
l'll get it!

995
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,535
-What's up?
-l'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.

996
00:52:37,785 --> 00:52:39,377
He's in China. Who are you?

997
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:43,015
Arthur Brooks, New York City
Social Services. l'm confused.

998
00:52:43,265 --> 00:52:45,779
Chinatown. He loves those egg rolls.

999
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:49,859
l've tried contacting him several times
and he hasn't responded.

1000
00:52:50,105 --> 00:52:51,299
l'm concerned.

1001
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:53,263
lxnay on the ketchupnay.

1002
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:55,336
-Have him call me.
-All right.

1003
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:58,536
My body's definitely better than his.

1004
00:52:58,785 --> 00:53:00,537
Without question.

1005
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:08,140
lt took you a long time to pencil me in.
You work all the time.

1006
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,534
l know. l'm excited.

1007
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,219
You're excited.
How long you been this crazy?

1008
00:53:13,785 --> 00:53:16,345
l guess ever since
l was a little girl.

1009
00:53:17,105 --> 00:53:21,303
See, my mom got married really young
and pretty much just raised us kids.

1010
00:53:21,705 --> 00:53:23,297
So when my dad took off...

1011
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:25,900
...she wasn't left
with a lot of options.

1012
00:53:26,145 --> 00:53:29,023
And l think that's when l decided...

1013
00:53:29,265 --> 00:53:31,733
...that l never wanted to end up
in that situation.

1014
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:34,819
That's actually a good reason
to be working.

1015
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:38,694
l guess l feel like l gotta kick ass
while there's ass to be kicked.

1016
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:42,938
You kick that ass during the day,
but at night you have fun with Sonny.

1017
00:53:43,905 --> 00:53:48,023
The Best of Times

1018
00:53:49,265 --> 00:53:53,304
Are when I'm alone with you

1019
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:59,500
Some rain, some shine

1020
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:11,536
Two guys you were best friends with in
law school fell in love with each other?

1021
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,059
ls that strange for you?

1022
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:15,136
No. Nothing changed, really.

1023
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,536
They watch a different kind
of porno now. But that's it.

1024
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:22,982
My God! This is Corinne's place?

1025
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,693
lf the girls at Hooters
could see her now.

1026
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:29,904
-Do you want your ass kicked?
-l'm just kidding around, Layla.

1027
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,461
You're afraid to get involved
and you got a lot of work, but...

1028
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,938
...when l'm not with you, l'm thinking
of you. Do you have that going on?

1029
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:43,220
Maybe.

1030
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:45,854
Maybe we should try a kiss out.

1031
00:54:46,105 --> 00:54:50,257
We owe it to ourselves to see
if we should move to the next level.

1032
00:54:51,145 --> 00:54:52,544
l'm not sure.

1033
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:55,663
Me either. lt's just that
you kissed Scuba Steve.

1034
00:54:55,905 --> 00:54:58,373
Ever since then,
he's strutted around bragging...

1035
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,698
..." l got a kiss the first night.
After three times, you got nothing."

1036
00:55:02,945 --> 00:55:04,094
-He said that?
-Come on.

1037
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:07,542
Let's just give it a shot
just so l can have some dignity.

1038
00:55:07,785 --> 00:55:09,059
All right?

1039
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,776
Oh, my God!

1040
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:19,299
Gross!

1041
00:55:19,545 --> 00:55:20,944
Did l witness the first kiss?

1042
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:23,619
Yeah, you did.
Thanks a lot for showing up.

1043
00:55:24,265 --> 00:55:27,143
Layla, you didn't actually
enjoy that, did you?

1044
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:29,819
l don't know. l'm going upstairs.

1045
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:32,101
Wash your mouth out. He's dirty.

1046
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:33,858
And he's poor.

1047
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:37,939
What do you got in the bag, Corinne?
Some chicken wings? Booby tassels?

1048
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:39,141
Shut up.

1049
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:40,784
You have a good sleep.

1050
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,538
Pleasant Hooters.

1051
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:48,743
Come on, come on!

1052
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:50,857
This is where we hang our jackets.

1053
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,174
This is my hook.

1054
00:55:52,425 --> 00:55:53,699
That's a capertillar.

1055
00:55:53,945 --> 00:55:55,014
A caterpillar.

1056
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:58,496
-That's right, a capertillar.
-Capertillar, all right.

1057
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:00,258
-Staying clean, pal?
-Yes.

1058
00:56:00,505 --> 00:56:03,338
You drink the booze, you lose.
Remember that, punk.

1059
00:56:04,905 --> 00:56:06,896
l'm Julian's teacher, Ms. Foote.

1060
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:09,136
-You his father?
-l'm Kevin Gerrity.

1061
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:12,980
Do you have some time to go over some
things that have been bothering me?

1062
00:56:13,505 --> 00:56:14,335
Sure.

1063
00:56:14,585 --> 00:56:16,303
Go take a walk, pal.

1064
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:19,458
Julian has been displaying
some odd behaviour.

1065
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:22,822
He spilled glue on the floor
and didn't tell anyone.

1066
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:24,623
He covered it with newspaper.

1067
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:29,583
And then one of our students wore
Rollerblades for show-and-tell.

1068
00:56:29,825 --> 00:56:32,259
And Julian tripped him with a stick.

1069
00:56:32,585 --> 00:56:33,540
l've never--

1070
00:56:36,105 --> 00:56:37,857
Julian found it hilarious.

1071
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:40,335
l like him to express himself freely.

1072
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:43,463
l've really never seen
any problems with that.

1073
00:56:47,225 --> 00:56:50,342
Your boy's making the least progress
of any of the children.

1074
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:54,454
Frankly, his personal hygiene
is becoming a cause for concern.

1075
00:56:54,905 --> 00:56:58,181
He's the smelly kid in class?
l let him become the smelly kid?

1076
00:56:58,425 --> 00:56:59,540
What's wrong with me?

1077
00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:01,616
l've had some smelly ones before.

1078
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:04,140
But your son is by far the smelliest.

1079
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:07,058
All right, l got you.
What do you think l should do?

1080
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:09,865
Start by paying more attention
to his schoolwork.

1081
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:13,741
The class is giving a presentation
of the Founding Fathers.

1082
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:17,898
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin
Franklin, a very important role.

1083
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:19,294
Do what you can to help.

1084
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:22,139
l will turn this all around.
That's a promise.

1085
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:23,704
Thank you very much.

1086
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:26,254
Stinky, let's go.
You got us in trouble.

1087
00:57:26,505 --> 00:57:27,733
Did he call him "Stinky"?

1088
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:33,585
Wow, l didn't know this
about George Washington.

1089
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,100
Yes, his teeth were made of wool.

1090
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:37,858
Wood.

1091
00:57:38,745 --> 00:57:40,417
l sorry. l mix up " D" and " L."

1092
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,814
Well, get it right.

1093
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,103
Turn that game off, pal.

1094
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:46,573
l got four guys left.

1095
00:57:46,825 --> 00:57:48,258
Let's study a little bit.

1096
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:49,620
l don't wanna study.

1097
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:50,775
Give me that.

1098
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:54,623
-You just killed me.
-So what? You'll play later.

1099
00:57:54,865 --> 00:57:56,378
You can't tell me what to do.

1100
00:57:56,625 --> 00:58:00,379
Really? Let's take a vote.
Who thinks the kid should study?

1101
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:04,697
Who doesn't?
Well, you just lost, two to one.

1102
00:58:04,945 --> 00:58:08,062
lt's a tie. That guy doesn't count.
He can't even read.

1103
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,341
l know. He was just joking around.

1104
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:15,461
Can you hang out here a little bit?
l gotta go do something.

1105
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:16,820
No problem.

1106
00:58:18,145 --> 00:58:19,464
Would you like

1107
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:23,183
We'll hop, hop, hop, hop

1108
00:58:23,425 --> 00:58:25,063
What do you say

1109
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,058
Get the door.

1110
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,183
Hi, Julian. How you doing?

1111
00:58:36,825 --> 00:58:38,463
l'm Scuba Sam.

1112
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:40,218
Scuba Steve's father.

1113
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:41,693
You see, my boy...

1114
00:58:41,945 --> 00:58:43,583
...needs to take a bath.

1115
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,384
The only problem is...

1116
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,536
...he's afraid to bathe alone.

1117
00:58:47,785 --> 00:58:49,264
So l was wondering...

1118
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:52,861
...if maybe you could keep him company
in the tub.

1119
00:58:53,745 --> 00:58:54,495
Terrific.

1120
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,698
And after the bath, you have to try
and study hard.

1121
00:58:57,945 --> 00:59:02,461
Because if you wanna be a member of
the Scuba Squad, you have to be smart.

1122
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:04,701
l could be in the Scuba Squad?

1123
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:08,255
Well, sure. All you have to do
is work hard.

1124
00:59:08,505 --> 00:59:10,973
And don't tell a soul
about the Scuba Squad...

1125
00:59:11,225 --> 00:59:13,295
...because then everybody will
wanna join.

1126
00:59:13,545 --> 00:59:14,944
And one more thing...

1127
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:17,335
...be nice to the delivery guy,
would you?

1128
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,297
lt's not his fault he can't read.

1129
00:59:21,105 --> 00:59:22,743
Take care.

1130
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:30,055
He told me to watch his boat for him.
Said that he wanted to...

1131
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:32,865
...talk to you about
some secret mission.

1132
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:35,654
l have no idea what
you're talking about.

1133
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,975
How come l have to wear
a bathing suit?

1134
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:42,658
l don't know the rules...

1135
00:59:42,905 --> 00:59:46,978
...with little kids and grownups
and being naked and just sit down.

1136
00:59:49,225 --> 00:59:52,456
The good news is you're not
smelling like a foot anymore.

1137
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:56,300
l read something interesting.
You know Benjamin Franklin invented...

1138
00:59:56,545 --> 00:59:58,456
...bifocals? That's pretty cool.

1139
00:59:58,705 --> 00:59:59,615
What are they?

1140
00:59:59,865 --> 01:00:03,744
l'll show you in that book. lt might
help you out with your school play.

1141
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:06,143
We'll make this a regular thing.

1142
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:09,377
Bathing and studying
and eating right.

1143
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:12,139
Put your head back.
My grandmother did this to me.

1144
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:16,936
"Oh, boy. When l was a little girl,
frankfurters only cost a nickel."

1145
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:18,334
Can you still have fun?

1146
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:20,177
Yeah, but after you study.

1147
01:00:20,425 --> 01:00:23,303
ln fact, we gotta get you
dressing differently.

1148
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:25,024
We'll go to Barney's.

1149
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:28,738
Not that Barney.
A more expensive Barney.

1150
01:00:38,025 --> 01:00:39,697
All right, one at a time.

1151
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:41,378
That's one.

1152
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:43,013
Two.

1153
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:47,219
See? Urinals are good too.

1154
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:08,498
" Electricity."

1155
01:01:08,825 --> 01:01:09,701
Very good.

1156
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:11,060
" Constitution."

1157
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:12,420
That's it.

1158
01:01:12,665 --> 01:01:13,814
" Philadelphia."

1159
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:15,134
Smart. Good.

1160
01:01:17,865 --> 01:01:18,775
" Fish"?

1161
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:21,974
" Pony"?

1162
01:01:23,905 --> 01:01:24,815
" Hip--"

1163
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:26,695
" Hiphop--"

1164
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:28,460
" Hipopynonamous"?

1165
01:01:30,025 --> 01:01:32,744
Damn you! You gave him the easy ones!

1166
01:01:36,185 --> 01:01:37,504
-Thanks!
-You're welcome.

1167
01:01:41,025 --> 01:01:41,935
Slow down.

1168
01:01:42,745 --> 01:01:44,383
You owe me a Sausage McMuffin.

1169
01:01:52,385 --> 01:01:53,420
There's a pole there.

1170
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,616
My name is Alexander Hamilton.

1171
01:02:04,945 --> 01:02:07,539
l was the first secretary
of the treasury.

1172
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:10,060
l owned a bank and a newspaper.

1173
01:02:10,305 --> 01:02:12,500
Aaron Bird shot me.

1174
01:02:16,385 --> 01:02:18,694
Hi, my name is Benjamin Franklin.

1175
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:21,533
l was a writer, a diplomat...

1176
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,941
...an inventor and a statesman...

1177
01:02:24,185 --> 01:02:27,939
...although l only went to school
for two years.

1178
01:02:29,185 --> 01:02:33,337
l wrote many books and invented
many things we still use today.

1179
01:02:37,945 --> 01:02:41,415
The Declaration of lndependence
is finished.

1180
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:44,623
Who will be the first to sign?

1181
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:48,136
-How about you, John Hancock?
-l want to sign!

1182
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:54,785
-Look at my man stand strong.
-He's so cute.

1183
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:01,534
What are your cards?

1184
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:06,301
l got a six, a five, a jack,
a four and a eight.

1185
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:07,541
l win.

1186
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:08,661
What do you mean?

1187
01:03:08,905 --> 01:03:11,135
l had a hand just like that.
l didn't win.

1188
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:12,261
Because l win.

1189
01:03:12,505 --> 01:03:13,733
This is bullshit!

1190
01:03:13,985 --> 01:03:15,543
All right. Take it easy, man.

1191
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:17,377
Every time it's different cards.

1192
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,024
So what? Relax. He's a kid.

1193
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:22,582
There should be same set of rules,
no matter what age.

1194
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:24,781
He's gotta learn how to lose too.

1195
01:03:25,065 --> 01:03:27,454
-Hello, Mr. Koufax.
-Mr. Brooks, how you doing?

1196
01:03:27,705 --> 01:03:29,343
l was gonna give you a buzz.

1197
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:32,939
You just called me Mr. Koufax,
didn't you?

1198
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,141
lt is your name, isn't it?
Sonny Koufax?

1199
01:03:35,385 --> 01:03:37,774
You held yourself out
to be Kevin Gerrity...

1200
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:39,902
...to gain custody of young Julian.

1201
01:03:40,145 --> 01:03:41,863
Big problem in this state.

1202
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:43,743
l've delivered to you before.

1203
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:46,260
You always order
three pieces of cheesecake.

1204
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,704
The real Kevin Gerrity
asked me to take care of--

1205
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:51,663
Save it, Mr. Koufax.

1206
01:03:51,905 --> 01:03:54,135
He has to come with me
or l'll arrest you.

1207
01:03:54,385 --> 01:03:55,579
Take out your handcuffs.

1208
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:58,544
l don't have any,
but two policemen downstairs do.

1209
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:01,175
Listen, Sonny, l would like to help...

1210
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:05,020
...but my status in your country
is not what you would call legal.

1211
01:04:05,265 --> 01:04:06,300
lt's okay.

1212
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:07,694
l'm Audi.

1213
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:10,618
Julian, you're gonna have to
come with me.

1214
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,183
One second, pal.

1215
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:19,341
Would you just give me a second
to say goodbye to the kid?

1216
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:21,380
Take a second.

1217
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:31,575
You don't want me here anymore?

1218
01:04:31,865 --> 01:04:33,617
No, that's not it, pal.

1219
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:35,981
You just gotta go away
for a little while.

1220
01:04:36,225 --> 01:04:38,580
How long am l going away for?

1221
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:40,702
l don't wanna lie to you.

1222
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,617
l don't think we're gonna...

1223
01:04:45,105 --> 01:04:47,141
...be seeing each other anymore.

1224
01:04:48,545 --> 01:04:51,298
l screwed up, pal. l'm so sorry.

1225
01:04:52,225 --> 01:04:53,453
Come here.

1226
01:04:54,145 --> 01:04:55,260
Put your coat on.

1227
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:03,134
lt's not your fault, okay?
l'm the idiot.

1228
01:05:03,385 --> 01:05:05,376
-l don't wanna go.
-l know you don't.

1229
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,934
But you have to,
and you're gonna be okay.

1230
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,821
Please don't make me go.

1231
01:05:13,065 --> 01:05:15,340
l'm sorry, but l don't know
what else to do.

1232
01:05:15,585 --> 01:05:17,940
l won't play
the kangaroo song anymore.

1233
01:05:18,505 --> 01:05:19,779
Come on.

1234
01:05:20,025 --> 01:05:21,583
Just go. You gotta go.

1235
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:22,974
You gotta go.

1236
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:27,054
l don't wanna go. l promise...

1237
01:05:27,305 --> 01:05:30,138
...l'm sorry. l don't even
like that song anymore.

1238
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,296
l know, pal. That's not it.

1239
01:05:32,545 --> 01:05:35,582
But l wipe my own ass!
l wipe my own ass!

1240
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,624
l know.

1241
01:05:57,025 --> 01:05:59,255
-Layla, they took the kid.
-Who?

1242
01:05:59,505 --> 01:06:01,894
Social Services.
l gotta get him back.

1243
01:06:02,145 --> 01:06:03,863
You said this was just temporary.

1244
01:06:04,105 --> 01:06:06,824
l can't have it be temporary.
lt's gotta be permanent.

1245
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:08,703
Okay, what can we do?

1246
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:12,142
l filed to get custody based
on the child's best interests.

1247
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,980
Tommy knew a clerk, so they fast-tracked
the hearing. lt's Tuesday.

1248
01:06:16,225 --> 01:06:17,977
-This Tuesday?
-You got work?

1249
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:21,103
l gotta go to Washington
for a hearing to dismiss my case.

1250
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,824
Can you get somebody else?

1251
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:25,374
l'm sorry, Sonny.
l can't. lt's my case.

1252
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,617
We don't even know where
this kid's gonna end up.

1253
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:32,141
Sonny, this is exactly why
l didn't wanna get involved.

1254
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:34,262
l had things going the way l wanted.

1255
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:38,134
Then at the park, you and this kid
come barging into my life...

1256
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:41,218
...and it's screwing up everything
l had planned.

1257
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,263
You think l planned on a kid
showing up on my doorstep?

1258
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:45,984
But l fell in love with him.

1259
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:49,176
So now my plans have changed.

1260
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:43,344
All rise.

1261
01:07:50,385 --> 01:07:54,139
We're here to determine
proper custody of Julian McGrath...

1262
01:07:54,385 --> 01:07:57,377
...also known as Julian Gerrity,
a minor child.

1263
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,104
Representing New York City?

1264
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:00,664
Ted Castellucci.

1265
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:02,657
Arthur Brooks, Social Services.

1266
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:04,736
And representing Sonny Koufax?

1267
01:08:04,985 --> 01:08:06,020
Phillip D'Amato.

1268
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:07,220
Thomas Grayton.

1269
01:08:07,505 --> 01:08:09,973
Plus, l'll pretty much
be representing myself.

1270
01:08:10,225 --> 01:08:11,135
Anyone else?

1271
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:13,535
Layla Maloney, Your Honour.

1272
01:08:17,065 --> 01:08:19,021
Does this mean that you love me?

1273
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:20,698
Something like that.

1274
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:22,944
First witness.

1275
01:08:23,185 --> 01:08:25,745
Koufax is a good egg.
He was nice to that kid.

1276
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:28,576
But he fights like a girl.

1277
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:29,621
You like that?

1278
01:08:29,865 --> 01:08:31,503
l'm right here, miss.

1279
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:33,463
What are you gonna do about it?

1280
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:36,863
Are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?

1281
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:39,619
l had a few chardonnays. What of it?

1282
01:08:40,465 --> 01:08:41,659
Get off the stand.

1283
01:08:42,145 --> 01:08:43,373
You got it.

1284
01:08:43,905 --> 01:08:45,338
l've got a few problems.

1285
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:46,934
Off to a good start.

1286
01:08:47,185 --> 01:08:51,781
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy.
l wish my dad was as cool as him.

1287
01:08:52,025 --> 01:08:53,617
My dad was a military man.

1288
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:57,297
Guess l wasn't such a "good soldier."

1289
01:08:57,705 --> 01:09:02,301
When l was 35, he attempted to give me
a crew cut while l was sleeping.

1290
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:04,940
l broke his arm,
haven't seen him since.

1291
01:09:05,505 --> 01:09:08,303
l'd rather live on the streets
than under his rules.

1292
01:09:14,745 --> 01:09:18,863
Anyway, l think Mr. Koufax should be
acquitted of all the charges.

1293
01:09:19,985 --> 01:09:23,694
lf O.J. can get away with murder,
why can't Sonny have his kid?

1294
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:27,056
This guy knows what l'm talking about.

1295
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:30,903
No more questions.

1296
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:36,773
How long have you delivered food
to Mr. Koufax?

1297
01:09:37,025 --> 01:09:38,617
l deliver food for six years.

1298
01:09:38,865 --> 01:09:41,743
Plus, l'm stripper.
But l've put on weight so it's problem.

1299
01:09:41,985 --> 01:09:45,898
l see. And in your experience,
was Sonny a good father to Julian?

1300
01:09:46,145 --> 01:09:48,705
Oh, yes. They make terrific pair.

1301
01:09:48,945 --> 01:09:51,300
They went together like
lamb and tuna fish.

1302
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:54,538
Lamb and tuna fish?

1303
01:09:55,145 --> 01:09:58,535
Spaghetti and meatball?
You more comfortable with that analogy?

1304
01:09:58,785 --> 01:10:00,901
Yes, considering we're in America.

1305
01:10:01,145 --> 01:10:03,613
lf you don't like spaghetti
and meatballs, get out.

1306
01:10:03,865 --> 01:10:05,264
l'll come give you a crew cut.

1307
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:06,819
Let's see your clippers.

1308
01:10:07,065 --> 01:10:08,783
Not my problem your dad was sick.

1309
01:10:11,065 --> 01:10:12,544
Stop yelling at me!

1310
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,934
Order! Order! Order!

1311
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:19,618
Am l in the right room?

1312
01:10:19,865 --> 01:10:20,900
Who the hell are you?

1313
01:10:21,145 --> 01:10:22,737
l'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.

1314
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,577
He has enough co-counsels.

1315
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:25,621
Well...

1316
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:28,774
...one more won't hurt.

1317
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,344
Let's get on with it.

1318
01:10:30,585 --> 01:10:33,463
Mr. Koufax is simply parading
his buddies up there.

1319
01:10:33,705 --> 01:10:35,980
Can't they find someone
who isn't a friend?

1320
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:38,375
What were Julian
and Mr. Koufax doing?

1321
01:10:38,745 --> 01:10:39,541
Shopping.

1322
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:42,504
Did he appear to be
an attentive, loving father?

1323
01:10:42,745 --> 01:10:44,144
He certainly did.

1324
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:46,581
And how long have you
disliked Mr. Koufax?

1325
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:47,974
Since the day l met him.

1326
01:10:48,225 --> 01:10:51,183
For the record, where did you work
during medical school?

1327
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:53,899
Hooters.

1328
01:10:55,705 --> 01:10:57,377
No further questions.

1329
01:10:58,425 --> 01:10:59,653
Asshole.

1330
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:01,099
Next witness.

1331
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:03,616
We'd like to call Julian McGrath.

1332
01:11:17,025 --> 01:11:20,176
lf it's okay with you,
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

1333
01:11:20,505 --> 01:11:22,177
This is just you and me talking...

1334
01:11:22,425 --> 01:11:24,381
...so don't pay attention to
these people.

1335
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,581
Can you tell me how old you are?

1336
01:11:28,305 --> 01:11:29,863
Your Honour, one second.

1337
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:44,017
That's better, huh?

1338
01:11:44,265 --> 01:11:45,857
Can you tell me
how old you are?

1339
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:47,340
Five.

1340
01:11:47,585 --> 01:11:48,813
What's your birthday?

1341
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:50,657
July 1 5th.

1342
01:11:50,905 --> 01:11:51,940
Where were you born?

1343
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:53,174
Toronto.

1344
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:55,734
Toronto? l thought you were
from Buffalo.

1345
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,705
l moved to Buffalo with my mommy.

1346
01:11:58,945 --> 01:12:01,903
For the past six weeks, you've been
living with Sonny?

1347
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:05,463
Did you and Sonny have fun?

1348
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:08,457
What kind of things would you do?

1349
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:12,459
He taught me how to do the sleeper hold
like Chief Jay Strongbow.

1350
01:12:12,985 --> 01:12:14,213
That's nice.

1351
01:12:14,465 --> 01:12:15,454
Anything else?

1352
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:17,900
He taught me how to pee on a building.

1353
01:12:18,425 --> 01:12:19,380
Really?

1354
01:12:22,945 --> 01:12:27,302
And he taught me that Styx was
one of the greatest American rock bands.

1355
01:12:27,545 --> 01:12:29,217
They only caught a bad rap...

1356
01:12:29,465 --> 01:12:32,775
...because most critics
are cynical assholes.

1357
01:12:35,345 --> 01:12:37,301
l think we'd all agree with that.

1358
01:12:39,185 --> 01:12:43,463
Before you came here, do you remember
the last thing your mommy said to you?

1359
01:12:43,705 --> 01:12:47,095
That she loved me and l was gonna
live with my new daddy.

1360
01:12:47,345 --> 01:12:50,098
lf your mother could pick anyone
to be your new daddy...

1361
01:12:50,345 --> 01:12:51,539
...who would she pick?

1362
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,298
Sonny.

1363
01:12:54,225 --> 01:12:55,374
Thank you, Julian.

1364
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:56,944
You can step down now.

1365
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,337
That went good, don't you think?

1366
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:06,458
l don't know.
Judge doesn't look too happy.

1367
01:13:06,705 --> 01:13:09,060
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?

1368
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:15,855
l'd like to call upon myself,
Your Honour.

1369
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:17,254
Awesome.

1370
01:13:17,505 --> 01:13:20,497
Which of your esteemed co-counsels
will examine you?

1371
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:24,615
My father, Lenny Koufax.

1372
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:25,934
What?

1373
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:27,704
Forget it, Sonny.

1374
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,298
What is going on?

1375
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:33,618
Nobody in this world thinks l shouldn't
have a child more than that man.

1376
01:13:33,985 --> 01:13:37,295
He also happens to be
a well-respected lawyer in Florida.

1377
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:41,504
lf l can make a believer out of him,
l can make a believer out of everybody.

1378
01:13:41,745 --> 01:13:46,057
This court is after the truth, not
the opinion of the defendant's father.

1379
01:13:46,305 --> 01:13:48,535
You want my opinion?
My son is a moron.

1380
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:51,060
l withdraw my objection.
Please proceed.

1381
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,423
This is a big mistake.

1382
01:13:57,905 --> 01:14:01,181
l only came today to make sure
you didn't end up in jail.

1383
01:14:01,425 --> 01:14:03,143
That was nice of you. Thank you.

1384
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:06,104
To do what l think is right here.

1385
01:14:06,345 --> 01:14:08,734
Cut your fingernails.
They're too long.

1386
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:09,895
Okay, Dad.

1387
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:11,464
This case is simple.

1388
01:14:12,585 --> 01:14:16,942
lt is absurd to think that Sonny Koufax
is ready to raise a child.

1389
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:18,777
-Objection!
-Shut up, Tommy.

1390
01:14:19,385 --> 01:14:20,864
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.

1391
01:14:21,425 --> 01:14:23,143
First of all, how did...

1392
01:14:23,385 --> 01:14:27,776
...this sweet little boy, Julian,
end up under your supervision?

1393
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:31,857
l told Social Services
that my name was Kevin Gerrity.

1394
01:14:32,185 --> 01:14:34,380
-Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity.
-No.

1395
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,058
-So you lied.
-Yes.

1396
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,138
Like the time l found a bag of pot
in your drawer...

1397
01:14:39,385 --> 01:14:42,104
...and you said you thought
they were pencil shavings.

1398
01:14:44,465 --> 01:14:47,502
Remember when l told you Aunt Fay
was coming to New York...

1399
01:14:47,745 --> 01:14:49,861
...and l wanted you to
show her the city?

1400
01:14:50,105 --> 01:14:52,460
And you said that you had
better things to do.

1401
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:53,740
That's right.

1402
01:14:53,985 --> 01:14:57,739
l'm curious. Just what were those
better things that you had to do?

1403
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:03,818
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert
in New Jersey, so l caught that.

1404
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:08,101
What happened to Aunt Fay
that weekend?

1405
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:09,900
She died.

1406
01:15:10,145 --> 01:15:11,055
Yes, she did.

1407
01:15:12,465 --> 01:15:14,854
Did you happen to make it
to her funeral?

1408
01:15:16,585 --> 01:15:17,461
Why not?

1409
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:21,380
l went to Jones Beach,
got drunk and fell asleep.

1410
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:22,580
Hell, yes!

1411
01:15:23,865 --> 01:15:24,980
Some role model.

1412
01:15:26,865 --> 01:15:28,139
Your Honour...

1413
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,741
...my son doesn't have health insurance.

1414
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,816
He doesn't know how to boil an egg.

1415
01:15:33,065 --> 01:15:36,455
He filed for social security
at the age of 30.

1416
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,818
He is a drain on the economy,
on the country...

1417
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:41,737
...and most of all, on me!

1418
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:45,055
Your Honour...

1419
01:15:45,305 --> 01:15:47,500
...to give this young man...

1420
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:52,300
...custody over another life
is not only wrong...

1421
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:53,654
...it's insane.

1422
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,300
l love you.

1423
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:03,781
What?

1424
01:16:04,305 --> 01:16:06,341
Don't be scared. lt's all right.

1425
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:07,904
l'm not scared.

1426
01:16:08,145 --> 01:16:11,103
lf l get custody of Julian,
l'll be his father forever.

1427
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:14,975
That scares you because you think
there's a good chance l'll fail.

1428
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:18,979
Sonny, it's more than a chance.
lt's a certainty.

1429
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:20,374
You're wrong, Dad.

1430
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:24,898
You can be scared that l might get
pickpocketed in a bad neighbourhood...

1431
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:26,942
...or break my legs skiing.

1432
01:16:27,185 --> 01:16:30,814
But don't be scared about me
being a dad, because l will not fail.

1433
01:16:31,265 --> 01:16:32,903
l love this kid too much.

1434
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:35,500
l love him as much as
you love me, Dad.

1435
01:16:35,825 --> 01:16:38,293
l'm gonna give him advice
and l'm gonna guide him...

1436
01:16:38,545 --> 01:16:40,615
...and l'll be there
whenever he needs me.

1437
01:16:40,985 --> 01:16:43,624
l'll fly to New York to be
at his court case...

1438
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,618
...even if l disagree with
why he's there.

1439
01:16:47,105 --> 01:16:50,097
But, Sonny, you work in a tollbooth.

1440
01:16:50,385 --> 01:16:51,613
Don't worry about money.

1441
01:16:51,865 --> 01:16:54,902
l am in love with a beautiful girl
who makes plenty of it.

1442
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:57,341
She'll be my sugar mama.

1443
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,098
l gotta get me one of those.

1444
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:04,655
l know this is the right thing
because l would die for this kid...

1445
01:17:04,905 --> 01:17:07,260
...just so he won't feel
one ounce of sadness.

1446
01:17:07,505 --> 01:17:11,657
That's why you're here right now,
to protect me, to be scared for me...

1447
01:17:11,985 --> 01:17:13,862
...to be a good father.

1448
01:17:14,825 --> 01:17:17,020
And that's exactly what l'm gonna be.

1449
01:17:21,465 --> 01:17:22,978
Hello, Dad?

1450
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,580
Yeah, l just wanted to say l love you.

1451
01:17:25,905 --> 01:17:29,136
Hi, Mom? Could you put Dad
on the phone for a second?

1452
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:34,256
Can l borrow that when you're done?

1453
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,458
Your Honour...

1454
01:17:37,785 --> 01:17:39,457
...my son deserves this kid.

1455
01:17:51,025 --> 01:17:52,617
l love you too, sir.

1456
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:56,103
Mr. Koufax...

1457
01:17:56,545 --> 01:17:58,934
...the fact is
you kidnapped this child.

1458
01:17:59,185 --> 01:18:00,903
Not only shouldn't you get custody...

1459
01:18:01,145 --> 01:18:04,103
...but since you obtained him
by defrauding the state...

1460
01:18:04,345 --> 01:18:06,256
...you should be in jail.

1461
01:18:06,585 --> 01:18:09,895
Bailiff, remand him until
l can figure out the punishment.

1462
01:18:10,145 --> 01:18:11,976
Wait. You can't take him away.

1463
01:18:13,745 --> 01:18:16,384
As that boy's father,
l refuse to press charges.

1464
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:21,139
Oh, God. Corinne, l'm sorry.

1465
01:18:21,385 --> 01:18:23,740
Six years ago, Joe Carter....

1466
01:18:23,985 --> 01:18:25,020
Joe Carter?

1467
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:27,415
Toronto and the Phillies.
World Series.

1468
01:18:27,865 --> 01:18:30,174
Mitch Williams--
We flew up for the night.

1469
01:18:31,745 --> 01:18:33,224
There was a girl.

1470
01:18:33,465 --> 01:18:34,341
Oh, God.

1471
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,894
l'm an idiot. l was so hammered.

1472
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:40,182
Chicken wings, Molson 3-0.
Canadian beer is like moonshine.

1473
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:41,494
Hell, yes.

1474
01:18:41,745 --> 01:18:44,020
You remember?
lt was at that Toronto Hooters.

1475
01:18:46,545 --> 01:18:50,299
That was before he met you.
That Hooters thing is a coincidence.

1476
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:51,819
l'm sorry, Corinne.

1477
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:55,819
l know this changes everything,
but l had to do the right thing.

1478
01:18:57,825 --> 01:18:59,099
Mr. Castellucci.

1479
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:03,101
Pending a blood test, l....

1480
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,215
Whatever.

1481
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:09,095
The court grants custody to Kevin
Gerrity, pending the DNA test results.

1482
01:19:13,825 --> 01:19:16,737
l want you to be my dad, Sonny.

1483
01:19:17,145 --> 01:19:18,976
l know. l do too, pal.

1484
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:23,138
But l'm not sure that can happen
exactly the way we want it.

1485
01:19:23,385 --> 01:19:26,104
Because it seems you
already have a daddy.

1486
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:28,501
But l'll tell you what l can do.

1487
01:19:28,785 --> 01:19:32,016
l can be your friend, no matter what.
All right?

1488
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:33,903
l'll always be your friend.

1489
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,784
l'll always be your family.
l'll always be around.

1490
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,618
l promise.

1491
01:19:38,905 --> 01:19:40,657
The kid's good at tying his shoes.

1492
01:19:40,905 --> 01:19:42,816
He's not great at it,
so work with him.

1493
01:19:43,065 --> 01:19:45,659
-l'll teach him bunny ears.
-What's bunny ears?

1494
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:48,214
Make bunny ears,
cross and pull them through.

1495
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:51,775
l go with this loop, swoop
and pull thing. He likes that.

1496
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:54,744
-l don't know that.
-Go with the loop, swoop and pull.

1497
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:56,623
l swear to God it's working.

1498
01:19:56,905 --> 01:19:58,020
All right.

1499
01:19:58,545 --> 01:20:02,538
Go with the bunny ears thing.
You're his dad, right? l'm sorry.

1500
01:20:02,785 --> 01:20:05,253
lt's important, when you eat
at my restaurant...

1501
01:20:05,505 --> 01:20:07,541
...you never order BLT.

1502
01:20:07,785 --> 01:20:10,299
You must trust me.
Stay away from BLT, okay?

1503
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:11,580
Hey, guys.

1504
01:20:11,825 --> 01:20:14,180
l'm gonna leave you
with your dad now, Julian.

1505
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:16,859
He's a good man.
l've known him my whole life.

1506
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:19,858
So you two have fun
and l'll see you in the morning.

1507
01:20:20,105 --> 01:20:21,174
All right?

1508
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:24,497
-Quit scaring the kid for a minute.
-Who am l scaring?

1509
01:20:24,745 --> 01:20:26,224
Bye, pal.

1510
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:32,935
l went to China.
Do you know where that is?

1511
01:20:33,265 --> 01:20:34,618
lt's in Asia, which is...

1512
01:20:34,905 --> 01:20:37,465
...by Europe.
l brought some cool stuff back.

1513
01:20:42,105 --> 01:20:44,016
Did you move the bench?

1514
01:20:44,865 --> 01:20:45,900
That's pretty funny.

1515
01:20:47,065 --> 01:20:50,137
You know what l got?
Some noisemakers. Check this out.

1516
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:52,618
Wanna try one?

1517
01:20:58,105 --> 01:20:59,504
That's my foot!

1518
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:22,864
You're nice man.

1519
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:26,217
l've got Spice Channel.
lt's blurry but it's nice.

1520
01:21:28,785 --> 01:21:30,821
Let's make this quick.
l gotta get to work.

1521
01:21:31,065 --> 01:21:33,704
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax
would rather work than eat.

1522
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:37,984
l'm working on a big case.
l gotta sue you for making me come here.

1523
01:21:41,265 --> 01:21:42,903
Surprise!

1524
01:21:45,505 --> 01:21:48,178
Did you just waste
the good surprise on me again?

1525
01:21:50,065 --> 01:21:51,464
Hi, Corinne.

1526
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:53,855
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks, everybody.

1527
01:21:54,105 --> 01:21:55,743
Hey, you guys. How are you?

1528
01:21:55,985 --> 01:21:57,782
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1529
01:21:59,185 --> 01:22:00,379
How you doing, cutie?

1530
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:03,264
Sonny, l beat you so bad
in basketball yesterday.

1531
01:22:03,505 --> 01:22:06,019
From now on, l have to
stop letting you win.

1532
01:22:06,265 --> 01:22:08,176
l stopped that months ago.
He still wins.

1533
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:10,177
That's because you suck.

1534
01:22:10,745 --> 01:22:13,703
Corinne, put a tank top on
for old time's sake.

1535
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:16,505
-What is he talking about, Mommy?
-Nothing.

1536
01:22:17,945 --> 01:22:20,539
-Happy birthday, Sonny.
-Thank you.

1537
01:22:20,785 --> 01:22:21,740
lt's a clock radio.

1538
01:22:21,985 --> 01:22:24,135
-Thanks for telling me.
-l have to split.

1539
01:22:24,385 --> 01:22:25,454
l got deliveries.

1540
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:27,582
Hang out with us. We'll have fun.

1541
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:30,703
No, l can't stay.
l'll hang for a little bit.

1542
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:33,220
There you go. Come on,
let's eat, everybody.

1543
01:22:33,465 --> 01:22:35,660
Hey, you! Still missing
that tooth, huh?

1544
01:22:36,025 --> 01:22:37,094
Can we get some fries?

1545
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:40,094
Vanessa.

1546
01:22:41,505 --> 01:22:42,858
You're a Hooters girl?

1547
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:45,414
What happened to Sid's five-year plan?

1548
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,176
How you doing?

1549
01:22:52,825 --> 01:22:56,579
-Maybe it's a 1 0-year plan.
-ls that the guy with the old balls?

1550
01:22:56,825 --> 01:22:57,701
l think it is.

1551
01:22:58,225 --> 01:23:00,864
Come on. l bet they're nice.

1552
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,740
You're not supposed to say " balls."
Testicles.

1553
