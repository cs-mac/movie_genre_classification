1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500

2
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:04,764
- My name is Meg Murphy. 
#This is my street.

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:07,700
And this is my house.

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,639
That's me. 
#Hi.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,177
Okay, not the best first impression.

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:21,650
Let's skip ahead. 
#Much better.

7
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:25,220
So as I was saying,  
i'm Meg Murphy, 
And today begins what I know

8
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:28,423
Will be the  
greatest summer ever. 
#Being me can be exhausting.

9
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,192
My life is a little... 
#strange.

10
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:33,461
But it's not just me. 
#My whole family is different.

11
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:36,098
Hi, Mom.  
- Good morning. 
- Morning, trouble.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,300
Morning, Dad. 
- Good morning, beautiful.

13
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,769
No, not you, harold. 
#Yes, you do  have beautiful eyes.

14
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,973
- We may look normal, 
But we're not like  other families exactly.

15
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:46,309
- So how did you sleep? 
- Great.

16
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:48,244
I was only woken up once  
when a bat flew into my room

17
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:51,080
And got stuck in my pillowcase. 
- Oh, that's good.

18
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:54,550
That's so much better than the  
angry badgers from last week. 
- Yeah.

19
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:57,319
- Well, it looks  
like somebody's summer 
Is getting off to a good start.

20
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,422
I know you don't like bacon. 
#There's cereal up there.

21
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,724
- Easy enough.

22
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:05,595
Just go get that cereal up there  
on the shelf, right?

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,433
Just use the ladder 
Or a stool.

24
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:13,635
- And the second one...

25
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,551
Nobody move.

26
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,657
- Hi, baby.

27
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:38,994
Yeah, give Mommy the orange. 
#Give Mommy the orange, baby.

28
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:41,597
Give Mommy the orange. 
#Okay, give it to Mommy.

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,267
That's a good girl. 
#Give Mommy the orange...

30
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,535
No!

31
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:48,604
- Oh-Ho-Ho! 
- Oh!

32
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:51,040
Ugh! 
- Ooh!

33
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,274
Oh, not the bacon.

34
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:10,058
- Okay, troops,  
time to evacuate. 
- Charlie, time to go.

35
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,362
- Be right there, Dad! 
- Whoo-Hoo!

36
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:19,768
Whoa! 
- Oh, I know.  It's such a bummer.

37
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,537
- Oh, that was so awesome. 
#I got it on video.

38
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,406
- Walk briskly to the exit,  
everyone.

39
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,575
- Okay, kids, grab  
your emergency suitcases.

40
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:31,412
- Okay, boys and girls,  
time to go. 
- Now I know.

41
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:34,682
- Out the door, charlie.  
- Move, move, move. 
- Let's go!  Let's go!

42
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:38,485
- It's a good thing we have  
insurance on speed dial, huh?

43
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,719
- Yeah.  
Come on, charlie.

44
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,109
- Let me get my camera. 
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

45
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,376
Charlie, i'll get it.

46
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:12,818
Heh.  
Hey. 
#It still works.

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
- Not again.

48
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,565
?

49
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,983
Clank!

50
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,211
Splorch!

51
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,459
Boof!

52
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,172
- I wish I were normal. 
#I wish I could tell you  that our house falling down

53
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:19,209
Was a once-In-A-Lifetime thing. 
#But this was the fourth time  it had happened...

54
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,181
This year. 
#The local hotels have  all politely told us

55
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:25,316
We're never, ever allowed back.

56
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:30,087
So this time we're staying with  
our grandpa in harvest hills. 
#Boing!

57
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,356
- Oh!  
Honey. Oh. 
#Honey.

58
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,659
- Okay.  
- Yeah, i'm stuck. 
#No, it's even worse.

59
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:37,495
- Okay, stop, just...  
- Yeah, okay, go ahead. 
- Let me.  - Yeah, just...

60
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:39,898
Okay, got it? 
#That's the sweet spot...

61
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,600
- here's the deal: 
My family is jinxed.

62
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,003
100 years ago,  
a witch put a magical curse

63
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:49,174
On my great great grandfather  
tommy Murphy, 
And now every Murphy since then

64
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,575
Has been stuck with bad luck.

65
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:54,446
This isn't just any bad luck.

66
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:59,084
I mean, reputation-Tanking,  
life-Frazzling bad luck. 
#We call it Murphy's law.

67
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:02,054
If anything can go wrong, 
It will.

68
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:07,259
But we figured out how  
to deal with it. 
#When you're a Murphy,

69
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:10,662
You have to see things  
a little bit differently 
Than everyone else.

70
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,641
- What?  
- What?

71
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:27,645
- Mom and Dad taught us being  
a Murphy makes us special,

72
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,415
But that's a little harder  
to believe 
Now that i'm in high school.

73
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,150
As you can imagine,

74
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:35,421
Being a walking disaster  
does not equal popularity.

75
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:39,026
People tend to run away  
from me, 
Hurricane Meg.

76
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:50,104
You might think i'm exaggerating  
the whole curse, 
That i'm just accident-Prone.

77
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,575
Nope. 
#The curse is real.

78
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:03,518
It's magic, 
And it's out to get me.

79
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,622
I want to do something important  
with my life, 
Like become a famous scientist

80
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,458
And discover  
the cure for pimples.

81
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:20,202
But it turns out  
science is no match 
For an evil spell.

82
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:24,173
I guess I should settle for just  
trying not to kill anybody. 
- Next up,

83
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:27,976
Meg Murphy. 
- I've tried to be normal,

84
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,811
But I don't even need  
to finish this sentence

85
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:34,015
Because i'm sure  
you've already figured out 
How that worked out for me.

86
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,419
Ready?  
Okay.

87
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,257
- Oh!

88
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,932
- But in the whole history  
of Murphys,

89
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:52,468
No one's figured out how  
to break the curse. 
#Whenever I ask my parents  about it,

90
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,738
They change the subject. 
#Twang!

91
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,215
- Hi.  
Sorry about this.

92
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:08,385
Let me grab it.  
Honk! 
#My house is...  Hold on a sec.

93
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:12,589
- Come on! 
- Ha-Ha!  Oh, this is awkward.

94
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,658
Go ahead. 
#Go ahead.  I'll go.

95
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,230
- If this curse had  
a magical cause, 
It must have a magical solution.

96
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,166
I've got to find it this summer 
So I can leave  all this baggage behind me

97
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,869
And start high school, 
Normal.

98
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,852
Home sweet home  
for the time being. 
#This'll be fun, right, gang?

99
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,789
Hanging with grandpa. 
#24/7.

100
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:52,763
- Oh, I totally forgot  
about the second floor balcony.

101
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:57,032
It's perfect  
for a skating trick. 
#Oh, I can fly up the ramp  to the railing,

102
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,901
And then I could jump  
to the roof 
And then skate the roof ridge,

103
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,504
And then ollie back  
to the windowsill 
And grind it,

104
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,406
And then fall from my board 
And crash onto the side  of the house.

105
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:09,845
Oh, Dad, you  
could totally film it. 
#It would be epic.

106
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,314
- That's my annoying  
little brother, charlie.

107
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:17,152
You might recognize him  
as internet sensation 
Skater fail boy.

108
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:20,955
He's famous for his videos of  
him doing crazy skating tricks.

109
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:25,092
And failing. 
#It's, like, his thing.

110
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:27,061
Clunk!

111
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:31,900
- Yeah! 
- Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh!

112
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,035
Just stay epic down here  
on the ground, buddy.

113
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,006
- The Murphy's have a strict  
policy against heights.

114
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:41,176
I mean, even people  
who aren't cursed 
Get hurt falling  from high places.

115
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:44,112
Charlie's the only one  
who ignores the family motto.

116
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:48,383
All: climb over three feet,  
you're dead meat.

117
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:52,253
- Um... 
#what's that?

118
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:56,592
- Yeah, why does the front door  
look like it's about to fart.

119
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,060
Thoonk!

120
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,802
Whoa. 
- Grandpa has had the curse  a lot longer than any of us,

121
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:11,207
And has found interesting ways  
to deal with it. 
- Hi, Dad.

122
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:14,443
- Oh, hi. 
- Hey, grandpa.

123
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:17,113
A giant bubble, huh? 
#That's new.

124
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:21,384
- Yeah, great find, right? 
#I never go outside  without it now.

125
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,652
Never.

126
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,658
Look. 
#It's a flock  of migrating geese.

127
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,496
- Majestic creatures.

128
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:46,374
Oh, i'm so happy  
you're all here.

129
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,346
I can't believe how much  
you've grown.

130
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,516
Now, kids, you remember  
where your rooms are, right?

131
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:59,087
Get! 
- Wow. I love what you've done  with the place, Dad.

132
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,591
All the memories and... 
#No, don't even think about it.

133
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:06,395
- Be careful. 
#I haven't had time  to baby-Proof the house yet.

134
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:09,131
See, all this  
is just Murphy-Proofed.

135
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,334
- Since my baby sister georgia  
can't walk yet,

136
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,335
The curse doesn't affect her  
too much for now.

137
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:17,340
But it sure does make  
Mom's life harder. 
- My little georgia want  some peaches?

138
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,407
Here it comes.

139
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,651
Okay. 
#So that's a no on the peaches.

140
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:36,159
- Oh, uh, this... 
#was dropped off  for you earlier, son.

141
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,161
I...

142
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,130
Oh-Ho-Ho-Ho.

143
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:45,000
Test case number 456  
for Murphy's machinations.

144
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,503
- Murphy's machinations  
is my Dad's company.

145
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,540
It's hard to keep a job when  
you're cursed by Murphy's law.

146
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:53,543
- Thanks.  
Have a good day. 
#Bye-Bye.

147
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,712
Oh. 
#Uh...

148
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:59,916
smack! 
#Hi.

149
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,288
Whoa! Whoa!

150
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,627
- But Dad found a way  
to turn the curse 
Into a business opportunity.

151
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,596
He tests out new products  
for defects.

152
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,967
This glue is guaranteed  
to create a lifetime hold.

153
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:21,136
Not much of a guarantee  
if you ask me.

154
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:24,439
If there's a flaw, i'll find it 
And help you fix it.

155
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:29,278
If something can go wrong,  
it will 
With mark Murphy.

156
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,679
- We're still rolling.

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,356
- Wow. 
#Wow.

158
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:43,259
Looks expensive. 
#Can't wait to break it.

159
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,629
They call it  
the insta cookie 3000.

160
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:50,333
It's made  
by matayama industries. 
#If I could figure out  what could go wrong

161
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:53,569
With this by monday, 
They said I could test  all their products,

162
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,906
Which could mean big time...

163
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,811
For the whole family. 
- Wait.  What's this mean?

164
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,749
- Money. 
- Oh.

165
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,818
Hey, Dad,  
can I have some of this?

166
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,921
No.

167
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:22,666
- Ah, the Murphy wall of fame,  
huh? 
#Oh.

168
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,868
This one's Daddy.

169
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,343
Okay, I know it's not  
your best scenario 
For your summer.

170
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,945
- Best? 
#Try even worse  than my worst nightmare.

171
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,648
- Okay. 
#Well, I know it's not home,

172
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,550
But harvest hills  
is a nice little town.

173
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:44,455
I think you could have  
a lot of fun here. 
#Oh, oh, look.

174
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:48,326
A science camp for teenagers 
At the university.

175
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,229
You just fill out  
the application. 
- Seriously, Mom?

176
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,165
Do you know what would happen 
If a Murphy was let loose  in a science lab?

177
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,439
I'm sorry! 
#I didn't think you could  actually release the kraken.

178
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,875
- What? 
#We're cursed.

179
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,778
It could happen. 
- Meg, everyone has problems.

180
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,248
It is not just us, okay? 
#How you handle it  is what matters.

181
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,618
- You know the best way  
to handle our problems? 
#Get rid of the curse.

182
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,354
- Okay, sweetie. 
#Could you just let it go,  maybe,

183
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,857
And enjoy your vacation? 
- But there's got to be a way.

184
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,060
I mean, I can't go through  
three more years of high school 
As hurricane Meg.

185
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,565
You know what?  
I know. 
#I know what will  make you feel better.

186
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,568
Here. 
#Yes, I am paying you off  to be a happy daughter.

187
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,939
Seriously, you should just go  
and buy yourself 
A whole new summer wardrobe.

188
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,643
You deserve it. 
- My suitcase got left behind?

189
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,245
- Yeah.

190
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,918
- ? it's a cruel ? 
#? cruel summer

191
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:52,791
d leaving me here  
on my own d 
d it's a cruel d

192
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:56,828
? cruel summer

193
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,432
d you're not the only one d 
d it's a cruel d

194
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:07,038

195
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,510
? the city is crowded 
? my friends are away

196
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,946
d and i'm on my own d

197
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,153
- Oh.  
- Oh.

198
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,525
You. 
- Ivy murray,

199
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,961
Aka the meanest girl  
in the history of mean girls,

200
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,430
Aka the bane of my existence,

201
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:35,534
Aka...  
Oh, no. 
- What are you doing here?

202
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,871
- Well, my grandpa lives here,  
so... 
- Here?  In harvest hills?

203
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:42,242
But this is my town. 
#I come here every summer,

204
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:46,046
And you're not invited. 
- Trust me. I am just as unhappy  about this as you are.

205
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:50,049
- My summer's ruined. 
#My life is ruined.

206
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:53,853
Give me that.

207
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:58,826
This town is supposed  
to be a hurricane Meg-Free zone.

208
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:02,530
- Of all the towns we could  
have come to this summer, 
It had to be here?

209
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:06,334
Harvest hills is horrible. 
#This is going to be  the worst summer ever.

210
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:12,240
- Hold on. 
#I found these  monkey socks first.

211
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:16,043
And finders keepers. 
#These must be yours.

212
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:19,113
- Yeah. 
- I would definitely rock  those socks, though.

213
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:21,216
- Thanks. 
#I'm embarrassed.

214
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:24,586
- Well, hi, embarrassed.  
I'm brett. 
- It's Meg, actually.

215
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,689
- Well, nice to meet you, Meg. 
#Are you from harvest hills?

216
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:31,560
I haven't seen you before. 
- No, i'm just here  visiting my bees.

217
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:34,128
I mean, my grandpa. 
#Well, not visiting.

218
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,998
I guess i'm kind of living here  
this summer. 
#My house, it, uh,

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,333
Kind of fell down. 
#So many bees.

220
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:42,970
- Well, welcome. 
#You're actually just in time  for the harvest festival.

221
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:45,373
- I can see. 
- There's tons of fun stuff  to do.

222
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,109
It lasts all week. 
#And every year  they pick one person

223
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:51,913
To lower the flag  
at the closing ceremony. 
#Guess who they picked  this year.

224
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:55,383
- Who? 
#I have no idea.

225
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:57,618
Wait. 
#Is it you?

226
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,321
- Yes.  
Jeez. 
#Took you long enough.

227
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:04,358
I'll have you know  
it's a very big honor. 
#Get to shake hands  with the mayor.

228
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,262
Get a really snazzy t-Shirt. 
- You know, we can never  have too many t-Shirts.

229
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:13,901
- Smooth, Meg. 
- Well, anyway,  um, you should come.

230
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:17,105
There's gonna be a picnic  
and a fair.

231
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:20,307
And a dance. 
#You've got to come  to the dance.

232
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,209
- I do? 
- Sure.  It's a town tradition.

233
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:27,747
You don't want to hurt  
the town's feelings, do you? 
- I guess not.

234
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:30,616
- Um... 
#let me help you  with the rest of these.

235
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:33,620
- Thanks. 
#Omg, he doesn't know  i'm hurricane Meg.

236
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:36,089
Mom was right. 
#Harvest hills is awesome.

237
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:40,394
This is gonna be  
the best summer ever. 
#If only this bee  would leave me alone.

238
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:43,264
Smack!  
- Ow! 
- Oh, I am so sorry.  I really didn't mean to.

239
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:46,500
- Wow. You got a strong  
right hook there, Meg. 
- Oh, my god.  - Oh!

240
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:48,668
- I'm so sorry. 
#No, no, it was an accident.

241
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,238
Here you go.  
It was very nice to meet you. 
- Nice to meet you.

242
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,774
Sorry. 
- It's okay.  Don't worry about it.

243
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:57,710
- Okay, curse, this means war.

244
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,351
- Butt balloon activate! 
- Sorry, grandpa.

245
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:08,954
Cool invention. 
- Oh, it's handy  for napping anywhere.

246
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,724
- This stupid curse  
is ruining my life.

247
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:15,094
I mean, look at the things  
this family has gone through.

248
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:19,598
"Hiccupping man causes  
circus stampede." 
Okay, "man throws coin  in fountain,

249
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,068
Floods town." 
- That was a lot of water.

250
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,472
- "Local youth  
invents homework." 
The Murphys invented homework?  Really?

251
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,443
- It's been 100 years. 
#Why has no one ever tried  to break it?

252
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:32,812
- Oh, we've tried.  
- Dad. 
- Oh.

253
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,781
- What? Grandpa, is there  
a way to break the curse?

254
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:38,318
- There are certain things  
a Murphy must never do... 
#Needlepoint, whale watching.

255
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,020
But messing with the curse  
is at the top of the list.

256
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,389
- So you admit you've tried it. 
#What do you do?

257
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:46,025
Do you got to a fortune-Teller 
Or do a seance  or find a spell in a book?

258
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:49,162
- Ha! There's a book. 
- Enough, Meg.

259
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:52,231
We've told you before  
that the curse can't be broken.

260
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,700
So don't make yourself miserable  
by trying.

261
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,969
- Okay, so I guess I should just  
stay miserable not trying.

262
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,205
- That is not what I meant. 
- Trust us, Meg.

263
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,607
There are fates worse  
than Murphy's law.

264
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:09,415
- She's getting too curious. 
#She doesn't know the chaos  that she can cause.

265
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:11,817
She'll... 
- She won't find  the diary, son.

266
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,319
- But if she did...  
- Won't. 
- I'm just saying...  - Shush.

267
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:18,090
- I'm playing devil's...  
- Nope. 
- Every time i...  - No.

268
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,797
- I looked everywhere  
for this... This book, 
But things are easily hidden

269
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,666
In grandpa's big old house.

270
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:31,237
And I probably should have  
remembered Murphy rule 51.

271
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,107
Never use matches.

272
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,776
Whoa!

273
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:02,732
Grandpa was right. 
#I didn't find the diary.

274
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,568
The diary found me.

275
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:15,689
- Hey, hey to all my fans. 
#I just made a new invention

276
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:18,559
That's gonna make my videos  
even more awesome than before.

277
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:21,595
The dizzy cam.

278
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,633
World, you are so not ready  
for this. 
- Dude, this is gonna be  so rad.

279
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:29,437
- Dude, I know, right? 
- Let's go.  - All right.

280
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:34,008
- Go, go, go! 
- You got this!

281
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,446
Whoa! 
- Charlie's never landed  a trick

282
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:41,616
Thanks to Murphy's curse. 
#But he doesn't care.

283
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,451
He doesn't even try  
to be a good skater.

284
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:48,222
His fans just want  
to see a cyclone on wheels. 
- Yeah!

285
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:52,260
- Whoa! 
#Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

286
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:55,463
Whoa!  
Whoa! 
- Whoa.

287
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,608
- June 22, 1914.

288
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:13,013
- Hi, honey. 
#I'm gonna run to the store

289
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:16,249
Because georgia has graduated 
To the industrial strength  diapers.

290
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:20,553
So, uh, I could drop you off  
in town. 
#You could go do things.

291
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:23,724
Kids your age, 
They have places they like  to go, hang out, right?

292
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:27,295
You could get down. 
- No, thanks, Mom.

293
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:30,163
- You sure? 
- Yeah.

294
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,798
- Okay. 
#Bye.

295
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,211
- "Tonight is the harvest dance, 
And i, tommy Murphy..."

296
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:47,914
- Am the luckiest man around.

297
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,199
A man once said to me,

298
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:10,704
"Tommy Murphy, you're  
the luckiest guy around." 
And you know what?

299
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,072
Today I feel like I am.

300
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:47,972
Yes! 
#Yeah!

301
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:58,216
? 
#And tonight I bet  i'm gonna end up

302
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:02,220
With the prettiest girl  
in town. 
- Hi, tommy.

303
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:06,557
- No, not violet. 
#Caitlin o'leary.

304
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,096
Now, some townsfolk think  
she's a witch, 
But I think that's just silly.

305
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,199
Everyone knows there's  
no such thing as magic.

306
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:17,469
Although she's certainly  
put a spell on me.

307
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,178
- Will you dance with me,  
tommy?

308
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:32,650
- I don't know. 
#I'm not a very good dancer.

309
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,718
But i'll tell you what.

310
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,489
I will let  
my lucky coin decide.

311
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:42,793
Heads, yes. 
#Tails...

312
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:09,018
- Tommy.

313
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:12,822
- Mm, mm... 
#No!

314
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,061
Caitlin.

315
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:24,067
No, it's...  
It's not what it looks like. 
#Caitlin, wait!

316
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,402
Caitlin, stop!

317
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:34,477
- Caitlin! 
#Caitlin.

318
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,979
Caitlin, come on.  
Come back to the dance.

319
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,782
- I never want to talk  
to you again, tommy Murphy.

320
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:44,554
- Violet means nothing to me. 
#So you're wearing  grandma's underwear.

321
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:49,125
I don't care. 
- You still want to dance with me?

322
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:52,861
I'll flip you for it. 
#Heads, the answer is yes.

323
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:55,431
Tails...

324
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,078
I curse you and every other  
no-Good Murphy forever.

325
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,593
- What's a stupid coin  
know anyway?

326
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:30,466
Caitlin, wait! 
#Splorch!

327
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:38,475
- Unbelievable. 
#We've suffered generations

328
00:25:38,477 --> 00:25:42,412
Because people  
saw her underwear?

329
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:46,216
"I don't want to complain,  
but..." 
- Ever since that day,

330
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:49,919
Things haven't been going  
so well for me here 
In harvest hills.

331
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,891
A man came up to me today,  
and he said,

332
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:58,694
"Tommy Murphy, you are  
the unluckiest guy around."

333
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:00,663
And he was right.

334
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:06,101
Things that were easy for me 
Weren't easy anymore.

335
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:09,471
I tried to find caitlin. 
#I wanted to talk to her.

336
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:13,375
- You may kiss the bride. 
- But I was too late.

337
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:19,282
- Congratulations.

338
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:29,792
But I wasn't giving up. 
#I was gonna find a way  to break the curse.

339
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:31,994
- Very interesting. 
- Even if it killed me.

340
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:36,365
- Ah! 
#Which, the way things  were going,

341
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,567
It might.

342
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:48,944
- I finally found the answer. 
#Yes, this is it!

343
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:55,018
"All I have to do to lift  
the curse is..."

344
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,120
Yes!

345
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:02,192
Ow! 
#Ha-Ha.

346
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:06,130
You stupid curse. 
#You hit me two seconds  too late.

347
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:10,233
I already know everything  
about how to stop you.

348
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,340
Caitlin o'leary,  
your reign of terror 
Has gone on long enough.

349
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,596
- Off to an excellent start. 
#Yeah.

350
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:16,007
- There you are. 
#Sweet.

351
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:18,810
- Hello, sweetheart. 
#How are you?

352
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:21,278
Good. 
#Good talk.

353
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:25,783
- Every step I take  
gets me closer 
To my goal of being normal,

354
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:29,753
Of being just like  
everyone else, 
Of not being hurricane Meg.

355
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,922
I'm gonna find that coin and...

356
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,860
What now? 
- Meg.  Oh, Meg.

357
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:38,730
I've been all over town  
looking for you. 
- What for?

358
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:43,001
- Can't it just be  
because I love my sister? 
#All right, I need 50 bucks.

359
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:47,004
Meg, wait. 
#There's a skating competition  this summer,

360
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:50,374
And i'm gonna rock it,  
build up my fan base. 
#Get cur-A-Zy.

361
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:53,778
Only I can't afford  
the entrance fee. 
- Okay, then why don't you ask  Mom and Dad?

362
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,982
- They said I had  
to pay for it myself. 
- Okay, then why  are you asking me?

363
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,750
- Because I consider you  
a patron of the arts.

364
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:02,988
- Come on, Meg. 
#Help me give the people  what they want.

365
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,357
Loan me the money? 
- No.

366
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,026
But you can earn it 
Helping me break  the Murphy curse.

367
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:10,494
- Whoa! 
#Wait, wait, wait.

368
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:14,466
- Oh, my gosh. 
#Ivy, i'm so sorry.  Are you okay?

369
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:17,268
It was... 
#an accident.

370
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,838
- You being born  
was an accident. 
- If it makes you  feel any better,

371
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,675
That was a pretty sweet wipeout. 
- Who is this person  speaking to me?

372
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:28,212
- My brother. 
- There are more of you?

373
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:31,215
Ugh! 
#Let's go.

374
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:34,852
- Jeez, what's her problem?

375
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:38,623
- So much for making friends  
in harvest hills.

376
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,124
- Sorry, Meg.

377
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:45,897
Okay, so let me get  
this straight. 
#You want to break the curse,

378
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,633
But you were warned not to, 
Which makes me want to help,

379
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:50,468
But how do I get my money?

380
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,676
- "If the curse  
you want lifted, 
"Find the object  that was flipp-Ed.

381
00:29:57,678 --> 00:30:00,312
"Give it to the next o'leary, 
But be sure they  take it cheery."

382
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:05,250
- Yeah, I don't get it. 
- It's the key  to breaking the curse.

383
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:08,953
Great great grandpa tommy  
was cursed with a magic coin. 
#That's what was flipped.

384
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:12,123
If we give it back  
to someone who's related 
To that witch woman  caitlin o'leary

385
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,959
Before the end  
of the harvest dance, 
We can end the curse forever.

386
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:18,163
We just have to find that coin. 
- But, Meg, how are we supposed

387
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:21,399
To find some coin  
from 100 years ago? 
#It's not like he put an ad  in the paper

388
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:24,602
Saying where he spent it. 
- Actually,

389
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:28,006
He kind of did. 
- "Man throws coin in fountain,

390
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:30,809
Floods town"? 
- Tommy threw the coin  in the fountain

391
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:33,211
To try and wish the curse away. 
#It didn't work,

392
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:35,880
And the coin caused a crack  
in the fountain 
That flooded downtown.

393
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:39,950
Typical Murphy. 
- So where's this fountain?

394
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:44,321
Hey, Meg. 
#I found it.  There it is.

395
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:47,858
I solved the mystery. 
- Go.

396
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:54,332
- Which one is it? 
- It's a 100-Year-Old coin.

397
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,068
I'm sure it's got to stand out.

398
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:02,707
- Hey, Meg! 
- Brett.  - Quarters, pennies...

399
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:06,110
- um, sorry. 
- Whoa!

400
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:09,613
What the?

401
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:17,988
- Hey. 
- It's my favorite boxer.

402
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,691
How does my nose look?  
Is it crooked? 
- Your nose is perfect.

403
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:23,027
I mean, 
Perfectly straight.

404
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:25,262
I'm sorry. 
#After what I did,

405
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:27,864
I thought you'd want  
to stay away from me. 
#I'm a mess.

406
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:30,067
- Are you kidding? 
#Of course not.

407
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:34,872
You seem like  
a really cool mess. 
#Harvest hills can be  a pretty boring place.

408
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:39,309
But I feel like hanging out  
with you, 
I wouldn't be bored at all.

409
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,212
Bleeding and terrified, maybe, 
But not boring.

410
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,983
Hey! 
#Hey, come on!

411
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:50,253
I could use some help here. 
#There's a lot of coins,

412
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,255
And I only have two hands!

413
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,358
- Is that kid trying to take  
money out of the fountain?

414
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,593
- Probably just  
some crazy person.

415
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,829
You were saying something  
about hanging out with me?

416
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:05,503
- As long as you promise  
to warn me 
If you're gonna punch me again.

417
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:08,272
- I can't make any promises. 
#These babies have  a mind of their own.

418
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:13,945
So I see your reading up  
on the town history. 
- Oh, this.

419
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:16,881
Yeah, um, 
Just a big fan of history.

420
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:19,350
- Oh, me too. 
#Yeah, I actually used  to volunteer

421
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:22,119
At the town's  
historical society. 
#They have a whole display

422
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,522
On the fountain flood  
that destroyed harvest hills.

423
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:27,792
- And the stupid little coin  
that started it. 
- Wow.

424
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:30,327
You really do know the history.

425
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:42,372
- It's kind of crazy  
how a small thing like that 
Could cause such a mess.

426
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:45,442
They have the actual coin  
on display there. 
- They do?

427
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:48,612
I mean, oh. 
#That's cool.

428
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,883
Uh-Oh.

429
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,120
So... 
#i was wondering...

430
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,122
- whoa, whoa, whoa!

431
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:03,359
If maybe you would, um...

432
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:05,996
- oh, my gosh. 
#Is he going to ask me out?

433
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,898
No, don't be ridiculous, Meg.  
Why would...

434
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,470
- Do you want to go to the  
harvest festival dance with me? 
- Sure.

435
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:14,839
Why not? 
- Awesome.

436
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,212
- Anyway, um... 
#i should go.

437
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:23,415
And I will see you later. 
- All right.  Bye.

438
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,584
- All right.  
Bye.

439
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:32,224
While you were playing  
in the water, 
I just solved the mystery  of the coin.

440
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,560
We just have to figure out  
how to get it.

441
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,065
[Heavy mechanized breathing]

442
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:52,811
- Okay, let's spread out. 
#Hi, baby.

443
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:56,882
Hi, georgie. 
#It's peaches.

444
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:02,320
- Excuse me, everyone. 
#I have an announcement to make.

445
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:05,090
I have a date  
to the harvest dance.

446
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:14,332
- Yeah, Meg!

447
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,521
- Hey. 
#I have a surprise for you.  Close your eyes.

448
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:43,027
Ta-Da. 
#It's for the dance.

449
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,163
- It's fireproof,  
stain proof, wrinkle proof,

450
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:49,100
And short enough  
you won't trip on it. 
- I love it.

451
00:34:49,102 --> 00:34:50,434
Thank you so much.

452
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,704
Let's see.

453
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,642
Oh, honey. 
#Oh.

454
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,315
You know, the harvest dance 
Is where your father took me  on our first date.

455
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:08,118
It was the most romantic night  
of my whole life.

456
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,189
Even after  
your father got sprayed 
By not one,  but two different skunks.

457
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,729
- I'm so happy.  
- Yeah. 
#Mm, you see?  It's like I always told you.

458
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:21,865
The curse doesn't matter 
As long as you have  the right attitude, right?

459
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,368
- Wrong. 
#I was happy because i  was a day away

460
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,004
From breaking the curse. 
#Right.

461
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:28,472
- Hmm.

462
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:39,650
- Well, I think we can agree, 
It's time for this  a-Cha-Ching-Cha-Ching.

463
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:42,153
- And what does that mean? 
- Money?

464
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:44,723
I mean, you got to pay up. 
#I helped you look for the coin.

465
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,693
- Yeah, right. 
#You don't get paid  until we break the curse.

466
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:50,463
And we still don't have the coin 
Or know who  caitlin's descendants are.

467
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:54,133
You have earned zero dollars. 
- Aw, jeez.

468
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:57,069
You know, you're going  
through a lot of trouble 
Just for some boy.

469
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,106
- I'm not doing this  
for some boy. 
#I'm doing this for us,  for our family,

470
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:05,044
So our lives can finally  
be normal. 
- Meg...

471
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:08,013
i don't know if I want  
my life to be normal. 
- What are you talking about?

472
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:10,716
- It's just, 
What about my skating?

473
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:14,787
If we break the curse, then... 
#i won't be a master  of destruction anymore.

474
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:18,224
Don't worry, buddy. 
#Even without the curse,

475
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:22,061
You're probably still  
a terrible skater. 
- Thanks, Meg.

476
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:25,831
- The dance is tomorrow, 
So we're breaking into that  historical building tonight.

477
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,068
And we need to get a coin 
And find out who's related  to caitlin o'leary.

478
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,070
- All right. 
#Heist time!

479
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:35,876
- Shh. 
#Heist time.

480
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,913
- What? 
#It's the only black clothes  i own.

481
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,781
- Okay, but why bring the wand?

482
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,092
All of harvest hills'  
historical treasure 
Is guarded  by impenetrable security,

483
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,394
But I have a plan. 
#We'll get in from above

484
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,930
Through the skylight. 
#You will repel to the roof,

485
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,831
Then through the skylight  
with glass cutters.

486
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:20,035
I'll create a distraction here  
to mask the noise.

487
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,971
Here's where it gets  
a little tricky. 
#You've seen spiderman, right?

488
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:25,640
Take these suction cups and...

489
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:29,978
- hey, sweet.  
It's unlocked. 
- Can do it that way.

490
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,351
Come on.

491
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,456
- Don't make any sound, 
And don't touch anything.

492
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,625
- Like there's anything  
in here i'd want to touch.

493
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:52,133
Hey, check it out. 
#She's picking my nose.

494
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:53,869
- Stop messing around.

495
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:03,879
I have no idea  
what you're saying. 
- I'm gonna go look over there.

496
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:07,782
- Fine. You go look  
for the coin. 
#I'm gonna try and find  the town records.

497
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,970
- Uh!

498
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,023
Whoa.

499
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:01,670
Ha-Ha.

500
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:16,849
Meg, I got it.  
I found the coin. 
- Nice.

501
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:20,418
- Aw, yeah. 
#I saw the target,  and I acquired it.

502
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,720
I slipped in and out  
of the shadows silent 
And undetected.

503
00:39:23,722 --> 00:39:26,756
Yep. 
#I'm pretty much a ninja.

504
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,959
- Shh.

505
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:33,894
Quick.  
Hide.

506
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:26,400
- Hmm.

507
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:44,179
Man, that was so close. 
- Okay.

508
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:45,880
I figured it out.

509
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:51,951
If caitlin o'leary had a baby, 
And that baby had a baby,

510
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:54,019
And on and on  
for five generations,

511
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,921
Then this book shows everyone  
who's related to them.

512
00:40:56,923 --> 00:41:00,858
It goes all the way down  
to present day. 
#So according to this,

513
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,893
The most recent descendent  
of caitlin o'leary

514
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:07,530
And the person we have  
to give the coin to is...

515
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:12,233
oh. 
- Well, who is it?

516
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:19,172
- Ivy. 
#I should have guessed.

517
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:22,407
The girl who dubbed me  
hurricane Meg 
Is the descendent of the woman

518
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:26,544
Who caused the hurricane  
in the first place. 
- Target acquired.

519
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:29,213
- I'm gonna get into position.

520
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:33,682
d All the lights,  
turn them off d 
d it's too loud  in here to talk d

521
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:37,051
d I don't understand  
a word you're saying d

522
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:41,288
d i'm trying to sleep,  
but instead d 
d karaoke on the bed d

523
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:46,992
- As I watched ivy,  
i couldn't help thinking, 
What if this curse  somehow sensed

524
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:50,428
I was about to break it? 
#It would do anything it could  to stop me.

525
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,096
I would have to be more careful  
than ever

526
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:54,732
If I wanted  
to survive long enough to... 
- Hey, Meg.

527
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:57,634
Hey, Meg, does this thing work? 
- Stop interrupting  my inner monologue.

528
00:41:57,636 --> 00:41:59,669
Yes, it works, charlie. 
#You don't have to scream.

529
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:02,204
Where are you? 
- Tonight my name is nighthawk,

530
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:04,738
And i'm up in the lights. 
#I'm a go.

531
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,775
- I'm not calling you  
nighthawk. 
- Please?  Please, please, please?

532
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,109
- Oh, my god, okay, fine. 
- What's fine?

533
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:14,512
- Uh, you. 
#You're looking...

534
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:15,613
fine.

535
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:21,117
- Ha, shut up. 
#I mean, wow.  I should shut up.

536
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,119
I mean, hi.

537
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:28,522
- Uh, hi to you too. 
#You look really pretty tonight.

538
00:42:28,524 --> 00:42:32,191
Do you want  
to go get some punch? 
- No,  me and punch are a bad idea,

539
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:34,825
With the spilling and whatnot. 
- Get your raffle tickets.

540
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:37,027
What about you, young lady? 
- Oh, no, thank you.

541
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:39,629
- You could win  
an all-Expense-Paid trip 
To the grand canyon.

542
00:42:39,631 --> 00:42:42,865
- Trust me.  
I won't win. 
#Not in 100 years.  0% chance.

543
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,434
- Here you go. 
- What's the name  for the ticket?

544
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:46,802
- Meg Murphy.

545
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:51,806
Thanks.

546
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:54,574
So I present to you as a  
"thank you" for being my date

547
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:57,910
A 0% chance  
of winning a vacation.

548
00:42:57,912 --> 00:43:01,279
Or maybe tonight  
your luck will change. 
- Thank you.  And I hope so.

549
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,381
- Oh, and it's also  
your lucky day

550
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:06,950
Because you get to embarrass  
yourself on the dance floor 
With me right now.

551
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:09,953
But I have to warn you. 
#I got moves.

552
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,489
It's the lawnmower. 
#What?  It's the running man.

553
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:14,724
I'm a sprinkler. 
- Stop, stop, I can't take it.

554
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,825
You're too good.

555
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:20,363
Shall we? 
- Yes.

556
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:23,233
- Remember the mission. 
#Target's  in the refreshment area.

557
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:27,636
- I mean, no. 
#I mean,  i have to go get something.

558
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,373
I'll be right back. 
- Okay.

559
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,141
- Nighthawk, cover me.  
I'm going in.

560
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,277
- Hey, Meg, I was thinking  
about the rhyme of the curse.

561
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,080
You know, "give it  
to the next o'leary, 
Make sure they take it cheery."

562
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:40,049
You know, I was thinking  
you could tell her a joke, 
Like, "knock-Knock."

563
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,051
"Who's there?" 
"Give me the coin."

564
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,254
"Give me the coin who?" 
And then give her the coin.

565
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:47,556
- Yeah, no.  
I think i'll just wing it. 
#Ah!

566
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:55,031
Meg Murphy! 
- I am so sorry.

567
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:59,769
- This night was supposed  
to be special. 
#You will never stop  tormenting me.

568
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:02,940
- Tormenting you? 
#You're mean to me for fun.

569
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:05,643
- Are you insane? 
#You're the mean one,  Meg Murphy.

570
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:10,214
You've been ruining my life  
every single day 
For the past eight years!

571
00:44:10,216 --> 00:44:13,583
My last name is murray. 
#Murray,  Murphy...

572
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:17,153
It's alphabetical. 
#Splorch!

573
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,023
Every year, every class, 
I have been one seat over  from you.

574
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,559
Everything that happened to you 
Happened to me.

575
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:27,931
Oh! 
#You've made every day  of my life

576
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:31,301
A living nightmare. 
#Ah!

577
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:36,240
And the saddest part 
Is that you've always been  so full of yourself

578
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:38,843
And your whole,  
"i'm cursed, so pity me" saga,

579
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,878
That you've never even noticed  
anyone around you.

580
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,014
- Could what she  
was saying be true? 
#Do I just ignore  the people around me?

581
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:46,751
- Are you even listening to me? 
- Hey, ivy, cut it out!

582
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:50,087
You're the one feeling sorry  
for yourself. 
- What?

583
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,256
- Yeah, you've been moping  
around this town all summer.

584
00:44:52,258 --> 00:44:56,727
- It's not Meg's fault  
she's a little accident-Prone. 
- Accident-Prone my foot.

585
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:58,729
She's cursed. 
- Oh, come on.

586
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:01,932
- It's true. 
#I am cursed.

587
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:05,936
All the bad stuff  
that happens to me, 
It's...

588
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:09,873
it's never gonna go away, so... 
#that's that.

589
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:14,111
- Come on, who cares what  
my cousin thinks? 
#I like you.

590
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,314
Come on. 
- Seriously?

591
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:21,853
- Wait. You and ivy  
are related? 
- That's what cousins means.

592
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:24,822
- So caitlin o'leary was... 
- my great great grandmother?

593
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:27,925
Kind of weird that you know  
that, by the way.

594
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:30,061
- Hey, Meg, that means  
you can still break the curse.

595
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,930
You just have to give brett  
the coin. 
- This is it, guys.

596
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:36,034
End of the dance. 
#So let's finish up the evening

597
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:40,238
With the traditional  
harvest hills square dance.

598
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,542
- May i? 
- Oh, just give him the coin.  It's the last dance.

599
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:46,944
- Okay.  
- Come on, let's dance.

600
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:50,981
- Uh-Oh.  
Big problem.

601
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:53,717
- I'm nighthawk.

602
00:45:56,722 --> 00:46:00,558
?

603
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,963
?

604
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:24,849
All: whoo! 
#Whoo!

605
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,585
- I need to talk  
to you in private. 
- What is it?

606
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:30,654
- Uh... 
#knock-Knock.

607
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:32,956
- Excuse me?  
- Coming through. 
- Knock-Knock.

608
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,292
- Who's there?  
- Give me that coin. 
- Give me that coin who?

609
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:36,293
- Thank you.

610
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:39,864
- Okay. 
#Well, thanks.

611
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,433
I'll keep it as a memento.

612
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:55,379
- What a fantastic last dance,  
ladies and gentlemen. 
#Thank you.

613
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:59,550
- Nighthawk here. 
#Did you break the curse?

614
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:02,520
- Was it broken? 
#I didn't know.  How could I tell?

615
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:04,789
- And now what you've all  
been waiting for.

616
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:08,727
I'd like to congratulate  
the lucky winner 
Of our raffle,

617
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:09,728
Meg Murphy!

618
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:13,231
- Meg. 
#Meg, you won.

619
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,600
- No, I never win anything.

620
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:18,837
- Meg Murphy, please come up  
here and claim your prize. 
- I won.  - You won.

621
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,940
- I won.  
- I told you. 
#Ms. 0% chance.

622
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:25,310
- Hey, kid if you play  
your cards right, 
Maybe your girlfriend here

623
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:28,513
Will bring you on her vacation. 
- Yeah.

624
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:31,416
Maybe my girlfriend will. 
- Girlfriend?

625
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:45,663
The curse is broken. 
#My life is finally  gonna be normal.

626
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:49,601
I can do anything I want. 
#I even, amazingly,  unbelievably,

627
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:51,836
Stupendously have a boyfriend.

628
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,705
Life is perfect.

629
00:47:56,575 --> 00:47:58,609
- "By harvest night  
complete this verse,

630
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:02,312
And the o'learys  
will receive the curse"?

631
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:04,114
What is this?

632
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:33,150
d It's a brand-New day d 
d and everything is okay d

633
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,419
d I don't have the curse d

634
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:39,122
d something that rhymes  
with curse d

635
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,726
All right,  
this isn't a musical, 
And I can't sing,  but the point is,

636
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:44,828
I'm curse-Free.

637
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,205
Look out, world. 
#There's so much I can do now.

638
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:57,774
No more hurricane Meg.

639
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:04,714
- Okay, mr. Cookie, 
Give me your worst.

640
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:10,086
Ding!

641
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:18,827
What the heck?

642
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,796
Both: something's wrong.

643
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:23,900
- The insta cookie's  
working perfectly.

644
00:49:23,902 --> 00:49:27,337
- I fed the baby,  
and look at me. 
#I'm clean.

645
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:31,775
- If I didn't know any better,  
i... 
- oh, no.

646
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:33,944
Oh, she couldn't. 
- No.

647
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:36,680
She wouldn't. 
- No.

648
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,883
Meg! 
#Meg?

649
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:45,856
- I have some amazing news,  
everyone. 
- Meg, did you break the curse?

650
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,791
- Yes!  
Whoo-Hoo!

651
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:53,030
- Why is no one jumping up  
and down? 
- Meg, honey,  what were you thinking?

652
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,701
- I was thinking i'd get rid  
of that horrible curse 
That's been in our family.

653
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,604
You know,  
the one that makes us trip, 
Throws tree branches at us,

654
00:49:59,606 --> 00:50:03,240
And makes houses fall down  
and stuff. 
#Aren't you happy?

655
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:07,378
- Honey, um,  
who did you give the coin to? 
- Brett,  and it ended the curse.

656
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,816
- No, Meg. 
#You didn't end the curse.

657
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:16,387
You transferred it  
to... To brett and his family. 
- And now he's doomed.

658
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,057
It all makes sense now. 
- What are you talking about?

659
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:22,427
- It's the last verse  
of the rhyme 
From tommy's diary.

660
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:25,697
"By harvest night,  
complete this verse..."

661
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:28,333
All: "and the o'learys  
shall receive the curse."

662
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,685
- This line has been  
temporarily disconnected. 
- Never a good sign.

663
00:50:47,687 --> 00:50:51,489
This has to be some sort  
of horrible mistake. 
#Seriously, brett was fine.

664
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:53,691
I think. 
#I mean, I could never...

665
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:58,495
I would never transfer  
the curse to him. 
#I was just trying  to get rid of it.

666
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:03,902
Hey, is there any way I can  
transfer the curse back to us? 
- I'm afraid not.

667
00:51:03,904 --> 00:51:07,706
The curse can only be broken  
during the harvest dance. 
- I don't believe this.

668
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:10,843
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend 
Before I get my first kiss.

669
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,014
- I got this, honey. 
- Uh, yeah, i'll go.

670
00:51:17,016 --> 00:51:19,383
- I was hoping you  
were gonna say that.

671
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:22,018
- Now that i'm normal,  
i'm supposed to be happy.

672
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,822
But instead i'm more miserable  
than ever.

673
00:51:25,824 --> 00:51:27,891
- Honey, i... I don't know  
why you thought

674
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:30,261
You needed to be normal  
to be happy in the first place.

675
00:51:30,263 --> 00:51:33,498
- Because how can anyone be  
happy when they're jinxed?

676
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,467
- You know,  
i wasn't born a Murphy.

677
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:40,004
For 20 years, I lived  
a perfectly normal life.

678
00:51:41,372 --> 00:51:43,373
And I will tell you a secret.

679
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:47,344
Since I married your father  
and I took this curse on,

680
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:49,513
I have never been happier.

681
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:54,919
Oh, sweetie. 
#I told you before,  this curse does not determine

682
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:59,657
Whether or not your life  
is good or bad or happy 
Or lonely.

683
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:03,128
You do. 
- But it's too late.

684
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,697
I've already given  
the curse to brett.

685
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:09,233
It's over. 
- No, it's not over.

686
00:52:09,235 --> 00:52:12,170
- What?  
How? 
- I took a second look  at the diary.

687
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:15,907
The curse must be broken  
by the end of the festival, 
Not the dance.

688
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:20,512
The festival...  
Back then, 
The dance  was the very last event.

689
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:24,251
- But it isn't anymore. 
#The festival doesn't end  until the closing ceremonies.

690
00:52:24,253 --> 00:52:26,453
- So that means I can still take  
the curse back from brett.

691
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:29,222
- Yeah.  
- I'm going to his house. 
- Quick, you only have an hour.

692
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:31,958
Run! 
- Run!

693
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Okay, we've got  
an hour without the curse.

694
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,430
I haven't used a curling iron  
since I became a Murphy.

695
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:42,736
- One hour with no curse. 
- Dad...

696
00:52:42,738 --> 00:52:45,672
Is it cool if I use this 
To chop down one of your trees?

697
00:52:45,674 --> 00:52:47,708
- Sure, son. 
- Hoo-Hoo-Hoo-Hoo!

698
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:52,380
No curse! 
- I can run!

699
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:55,116
Without tripping or...  
Or hitting tree branches.

700
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:59,020
So this  
is what normal feels like. 
#No worries, no fear  of everyday things

701
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:03,625
Like waking up in the morning  
with a bat in your hair 
Or... Or walking or...

702
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:07,595
wait. 
#If I take the curse back,

703
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:11,665
Good-Bye running, 
Good-Bye science camp,  good-Bye normal.

704
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:14,968
Taking the curse back  
means giving up everything 
I've been hoping for.

705
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,330
Whoosh!

706
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,246
Um...

707
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:03,949
Hello?

708
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,859
- You. 
- What are you doing here?

709
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:16,529
- Not that it's any  
of your business, 
But my house fell down today.

710
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:17,997
Then I come  
to my cousin's house,

711
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:21,367
And there's an angry monkey  
tearing the place apart. 
#Now you show up,

712
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:25,204
And this is officially  
the worst day ever. 
- I know.

713
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:29,343
And i'm sorry,  
but I need to find brett. 
- He's at the closing ceremony.

714
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:32,413
Now bye! 
- Ivy, here's the thing.

715
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:35,583
There's a chance that I maybe  
might have possibly,

716
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:40,387
Accidentally cursed you  
and your entire family. 
- You think?

717
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:44,024
- Right, sorry. 
#But I need your help to...

718
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:48,428
how did you get all that gum  
in your hair? 
- The angry monkey.

719
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,631
I don't want to talk about it. 
- Right.

720
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:54,568
I have to find brett  
to take the curse back 
Before the festival ends,

721
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,039
Or you and your family  
will be stuck with it. 
#We need to go.

722
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,942
Ivy didn't want to go at first, 
Even though after one day  with the curse,

723
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:06,313
She lost her house,  
she has gum in her hair, 
And her cousin's house  is a wreck.

724
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:09,283
It was the thought  
of being alone with the monkey 
That convinced her to help.

725
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:16,309
- Next contestant  
in the harvest hills skate jam, 
Charlie Murphy.

726
00:55:16,311 --> 00:55:20,446
- Yo, I bet he breaks  
every bone in his body. 
#How awesome is this gonna be?

727
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:24,784
- Hey, skater fail boy. 
#How do you plan out  those gnarly crunches?

728
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:28,121
- Eh, it's a gift. 
#I don't even have to try.

729
00:55:35,263 --> 00:55:39,433
- Charlie. 
#What's the matter?

730
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:43,604
- I'm not cursed,  
so i'm not gonna fail, 
And then everyone's  gonna hate me.

731
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:48,208
They're not gonna hate you. 
#Just do your best.

732
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,912
- Dad, i'm skater fail boy. 
- No.

733
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:56,349
You're charlie Murphy. 
#And cursed or not,

734
00:55:56,351 --> 00:56:01,186
You can do anything. 
#If you try.

735
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:04,757
- Thanks, Dad. 
- Go get 'em, son.

736
00:56:28,948 --> 00:56:30,181
- Whoa!

737
00:56:34,254 --> 00:56:35,887
Yeah.

738
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:45,997
I did it. 
- Whoo-Hoo!

739
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:48,632
Way to go, charlie! 
#Yeah!

740
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:51,768
- Yeah, I did it! 
#Yeah!

741
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,836
- Whoo! 
#That's my son.

742
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:55,104
Whoo!

743
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:04,614
- Yeah, I did it! 
#I did it!

744
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:06,916
Yeah, I did it!

745
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:15,725
- Where is this kid?

746
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:18,094
- Whoa!

747
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:24,000
- I'm sorry i'm late, sir. 
#It's been kind of a crazy day.

748
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:27,570
I had to outrun  
a bitey raccoon. 
#But I think I lost him.

749
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:31,908
- Um, okay. 
#Let's all give a big hand  to brett taylor

750
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,244
For being chosen as this year's  
closing ceremony ambassador.

751
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:42,686
Thanks to his tireless community  
service for our great town.

752
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:45,455
Now, once he climbs up there  
and lowers the festival flag,

753
00:57:45,457 --> 00:57:50,192
Another festival of fun  
will officially end. 
#Okay, son.

754
00:57:50,194 --> 00:57:52,227
Climb that tower.

755
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:13,082
- Wait.

756
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:16,953
I need a break. 
#Ah!

757
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:17,954
- Ivy.

758
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,657
- Are you okay?

759
00:58:31,003 --> 00:58:34,537
This whole time I thought  
you were doing 
These awful things  to me on purpose.

760
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:38,509
I thought you were out  
to get me.

761
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:39,810
You weren't, were you?

762
00:58:45,184 --> 00:58:49,621
I've been unfair to you. 
#You really were cursed.

763
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:53,359
- It's okay.

764
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,729
I should have been nicer  
as well. 
#I mean, I never really realized

765
00:58:56,731 --> 00:59:00,499
How much my hurricane can get  
other people caught in it.

766
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:03,069
If it makes you feel any better, 
I've fallen  in enough mud puddles

767
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,738
To know it does wonders  
for your skin.

768
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:09,343
- Now, come on. 
#Let's go find brett.

769
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,789
- Really? 
#Go.

770
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:25,692
Whoa!

771
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:42,142
- I don't see him.

772
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:47,581
- There he is!

773
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:04,831
- All right, go get him, Meg.

774
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:08,500
All: climb over three feet,  
you're dead meat.

775
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:11,170
- Listen to us, dummy!

776
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,573
- Meg?

777
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:18,511
Do you want me  
to climb up there instead? 
- No, just stay right there

778
01:00:18,513 --> 01:00:20,914
And don't look up until I take  
the curse back from brett,

779
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:25,252
Or a meteor might fall  
from the sky 
Or something if you do.

780
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,855
Okay. 
#Not this time, ladder.

781
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,024
Not this time. 
#I won't let my fear of...

782
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,894
- Are you gonna go already? 
- Right.

783
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,163
Okay.

784
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:57,420
- This was it.

785
01:00:57,422 --> 01:01:01,057
My last chance to back out  
and have my life be normal.

786
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:05,362
But then I realized something.

787
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:10,201
I don't want to be normal. 
#I want to be me,  hurricane Meg, a Murphy.

788
01:01:10,203 --> 01:01:13,138
And cursed or not, 
If I can climb a ladder,

789
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,706
I can do anything.

790
01:01:19,812 --> 01:01:24,582
Stop!  
Don't lower the flag! 
- Meg?

791
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:27,518
- You're the first good thing  
i've seen all day. 
#It's been kind of crazy.

792
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,655
- I know,  
and it's all my fault. 
#I gave you a curse.

793
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:34,258
- What? 
- You see, my family was cursed  with bad luck by a witch,

794
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,229
And then I sort of gave it  
to you. 
#I'm sorry.

795
01:01:38,231 --> 01:01:42,534
- What... So this happens  
to you every day? 
- On a good day, yeah.

796
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:45,804
That coin I gave you last night,  
do you still have it? 
- Uh, yeah, I kept it,

797
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:47,872
I thought for good luck. 
- Great.

798
01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:50,475
I can take the curse back. 
#All you have to do  is give it to me.

799
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:52,577
- No. 
- No?

800
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:56,047
What do you mean, no? 
- Well, I don't want you  to suffer from bad luck either.

801
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,450
- No, no, no,  
it's not like that. 
#I don't mind the curse.

802
01:01:58,452 --> 01:02:03,122
I mean, not anymore. 
#I haven't really minded it  since I met you, actually.

803
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:05,891
You make things... 
#well, you make them okay.

804
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,794
Better than okay...  
Happy. 
#And we all have stuff  to deal with.

805
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:13,564
It's all about how  
you approach it. 
#So?

806
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,233
Give me the coin.

807
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:18,636
- Give her the coin, idiot!

808
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,077
- Okay.

809
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:37,924
- Whoa. 
- Ah!

810
01:02:40,662 --> 01:02:43,296
Help me.

811
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:47,233
Please grab my hand.  
Grab my hand. 
#Please pull me up.

812
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:00,445
Thanks. 
- No problem.

813
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,740
- Now that everything  
was back to normal,

814
01:03:28,742 --> 01:03:32,544
Dad discovered the cookies  
from insta cookie 
Turned your teeth blue.

815
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:35,413
- Holy smurf,  
my teeth are blue.

816
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:41,819
I got you, insta cookie. 
#We're gonna be rich.

817
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:46,925
- So he turned his report in  
after all. 
#To celebrate, we decided  to take the trip

818
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:50,662
That I won at the raffle. 
#The Murphys, the grand canyon?

819
01:03:50,664 --> 01:03:53,699
What could go wrong there?

820
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:55,834
Charlie's big win  
at the skating competition

821
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:59,604
Made him realize he doesn't need  
the curse to be awesome.

822
01:04:05,548 --> 01:04:08,315
Best of all, 
I realized that my Mom  was right.

823
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:11,718
It didn't matter  
if I was cursed. 
#I could be anything I wanted.

824
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,888
That's right. 
#I went to science camp.

825
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:18,158
I will now add  
hydrogen chloride. 
- No, no!  No, no, no, wait!

826
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,292
That's not hydrogen...

827
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:33,138
What? 
- Then I realized my bad luck

828
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:37,777
Could sometimes do good things. 
#You're welcome,  bald people everywhere,

829
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:42,382
And I found out  
my great great grandpa 
Learned the same thing.

830
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:46,152
- If i'd never had the curse, 
Then i'd never have been  at the hospital,

831
01:04:46,154 --> 01:04:50,990
And i'd never have met my edna. 
#She makes me happier  than anything.

832
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:53,392
And I don't need  
this coin anymore.

833
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:56,295
'Cause i'm the luckiest guy  
in town.

834
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,466
Splash!

835
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,959
- Meg, time to go!

836
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:38,470
- Grandpa. 
- Oh, hi, honey.

837
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:41,440
- I'd give you a hug, but... 
- oh, I know.

838
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:44,943
It's like hugging  
a pregnant orange. 
#I still got some kinks  to work out.

839
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:48,414
- And I know you will. 
#Even though this isn't  the summer that I imagined,

840
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,416
In some ways it was better. 
- Bye.  - Bye.

841
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:53,119
Don't get me wrong. 
#I'm happy we're  leaving harvest hills

842
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:56,356
To go to the grand canyon, 
But i'm going to miss  my new best friend.

843
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:59,326
- Meg.  
- You heard me right. 
#I have a best friend.

844
01:05:59,328 --> 01:06:01,561
She truly gets me, 
Curse and all.

845
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:04,130
What are you guys doing here? 
- We had to come  and say good-Bye

846
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:07,333
And remind you about rule 34. 
#Careful on road trips.

847
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:11,570
- And you be careful  
of angry monkeys. 
#I'll see you in school.

848
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:15,874
- Yeah. 
- Hey.  - Hey.

849
01:06:23,384 --> 01:06:27,553
- Standing right here. 
#Okay.

850
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:36,795
See you when you get back,  
okay? 
#Call me when you get there,  all right?

851
01:06:36,797 --> 01:06:39,464
- Okay. 
#See you guys later.

852
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:46,372
You know, I think we all feel  
like we're cursed at times.

853
