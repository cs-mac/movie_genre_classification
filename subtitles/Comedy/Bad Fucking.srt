1
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,440
What's this "having a picnic"
in my car?

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm not getting sex at home.
Don't deny me this.

3
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,040
You sleep with
a beautiful woman nightly.

4
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,720
"Married" means you sleep together,
but you can't get none.

5
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,320
Watch it with all that shit,
all right?

6
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,720
Where are your cup holders?

7
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,040
I don't have one.

8
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,280
$80,000 for this car
and there's no cup holder?

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
It's $105,000, and it's one of
the fastest cars on earth.

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,320
<i>0 to 60 in 4 seconds.</i>

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,320
- It's a limited edition.
- You damn right!

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
No cup holder, no back seat.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,720
It's a shiny dick
with 2 chairs in it.

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,720
I guess we the balls,
just dragging along.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,880
Damn!

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
Sorry.

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,320
Get it.

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,440
I can't get down there.
You got an engineering flaw.

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
My shit ain't going down
up in there.

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Go!
Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,520
Make them want it.

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,520
I ain't cleaning up after you.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,520
My hand can't get down there.
When it does, it gets stuck.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,920
Then you got this shit.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,240
Get that fry.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,200
This ain't Denny's!

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,640
I wouldn't buy from Denny's.
I don't like how we been treated.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,000
They bit.
Let's gank these fools!

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,960
You ain't interested in the fry.
You all up in that.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,080
Get out.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,160
Shit!

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,880
- What the fuck?!
- We've had a big week.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,840
So get out of the car.

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,120
Damn!
What you weigh, 350?

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,480
You're a chicken-eating fucker, right?

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,000
Why I always get
the big motherfuckers?

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
Get out!

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
All right! All right!

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
Hold on!

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Funny! Let me tell you
how bad a day you're having.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
We're cops.

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,880
And I'm a standup comedian...

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,600
...and I suck!
So I need your car.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,920
I ain't Wesley Snipes.

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,480
I just hang out with stupid friends
who drive cars...

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,720
...that attract fucking attention!

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,920
I need to jump over this car
and smack you in the head.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,960
- You're arguing over a fry!
- It's not about that.

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
It's your disrespect
for my property!

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,200
- Hey, hey!
- Shut up!

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,400
This is stupid!
Hold the fuck on!

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,720
If you want some bad enough,
come get some!

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,320
You like that shit?

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
<i>Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.</i>

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
Now get me a fucking Handi Wipe.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Let's hear a joke, bitch!

57
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,440
What do you think?
Looks like the real thing.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
Remember your assignment?

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm a decoy.

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,640
You are.

61
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
What are you doing?!

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,880
Police?

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,360
I just saw a policeman shot...

64
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,640
...at South Miami and 1st Street.
Help, please!

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,120
<i>All units. Officer down.</i>

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,680
<i>A squad code 3.</i>

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
<i>All units respond and identify.</i>

68
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
<i>Officer down.
We need additional ground units.</i>

69
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,800
<i>Air 3, Roger.
Suspect or suspects unknown.</i>

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,280
<i>Gentlemen, it's clear.</i>

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
<i>We're inside.</i>

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,080
We're in.

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
You got 20 minutes.

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Goddamn tacos will kill me.

75
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,400
<i>We got 12 minutes.
Let's go.</i>

76
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,840
Clear. We're in.

77
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,560
<i>Move your ass.
We got 6 minutes.</i>

78
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
Ready.

79
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,440
Ready to fire.
Go!

80
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
<i>Fire!</i>

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go!

82
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,440
Move!

83
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,520
Damn!

84
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,920
Did you have sweet dreams?

85
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
You're so nasty.

86
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,240
You always saying
you want quality time.

87
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,600
I got the time and you
damn sure got the quality.

88
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
Come on now.

89
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
You know what it is?

90
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,360
I can't remember the last time
we fell asleep together.

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Baby...

92
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,800
It's my job.

93
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
That's required.

94
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm a better cop when
I get some in the morning.

95
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
I feel lighter on my feet.

96
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,360
Keep it in your pants.
I hear 3 little Burnetts coming.

97
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
That's cold.

98
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,000
You leave me here
like a humping dog.

99
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,280
Hi, baby boy!

100
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,280
- Daddy! Daddy!
- What's up?

101
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,240
At school, people say I look weird.
They say my ears look funny.

102
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,160
I have that problem, I got the ears.
But you know what?

103
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,640
They for you to listen
to people's problems.

104
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,280
You're an angel.
These are your wings.

105
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,600
James, stop!
Would you take them off?

106
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't make me come to your school.
I'll arrest the principal.

107
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,520
Talking about my boy's ears.

108
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
Uncle Mike's in the house!

109
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,040
What's up?

110
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,960
Partner, partner!

111
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
Check it out.

112
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,000
What'd you take my food for?

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,680
Don't! I don't know where
your lips were last night.

114
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,760
Did you have a date last night?

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Did I!

116
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
Let me tell you.
This girl was--

117
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,160
Don't tell my son
your sleazy sex stories.

118
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,040
I only tell your husband
my sleazy sex stories.

119
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,440
Him neither.
It gives him ideas.

120
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,960
Why put me in this?
I'm with my babies.

121
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,360
Okay? Thank you.

122
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,880
Eat. Go on!

123
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
No problem.

124
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
Mike here.

125
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
Captain, I think you mean,
"Get our asses down there, please."

126
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Maybe not.

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey, baby!

128
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,960
Where's Howard?

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,040
He's looking for you.
He's been in better moods.

130
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,320
Damn!

131
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,760
Get it done, goddamn it!

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Welcome to our nightmare.

133
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
See this?

134
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,680
What's wrong with this picture?

135
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Remember this room?

136
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
These flats look familiar?

137
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,080
There were these silver packets
that looked like bricks.

138
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,480
Little red tags on them,
about so high?

139
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,040
All that heroin, gone!

140
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,680
Our career bust.
$100 million!

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,960
- Gone!
- This is bad.

142
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,480
Let me call it what it is:
Fucked up!

143
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
You got that right.

144
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Hello, Alison.

145
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,880
You know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs's top watchdog.

146
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,640
I'd take that as a compliment,
but I know you.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,520
If you two want to get personal,
we could step out--

148
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,360
It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job.

149
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,560
I know one leak can turn
this nightmare into a media frenzy.

150
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,320
That won't happen.
We'll get the dope back before that.

151
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,760
Start by looking here.
It had to be an inside job.

152
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,920
I'll find out about it.

153
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,920
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

154
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,360
So they put this in for
toxic drug fumes?

155
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,840
Brilliant design!

156
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,960
This was intelligent.
I like this.

157
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,720
I didn't ask how he feels.
What did he see?

158
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,240
What does he know?

159
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,560
Where were you last night?

160
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,760
Have your cousins bring it back
and we can sleep.

161
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,600
We were going to,
but we found a problem.

162
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,720
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

163
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,720
Get over there.

164
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,560
O'Fee is okay
but has nothing to tell us.

165
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
They kill a decoy, it empties
the station. Very smart!

166
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,600
But not a real cop, or the
whole force would be on them.

167
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,200
This was your case.
You're back on it.

168
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,920
Sanchez, Ruiz, back them up
with whatever they need.

169
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,880
Shut your mouths!

170
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
It was Carrera's drugs
in the first place.

171
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,760
But he was killed in prison.
What about his crew?

172
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Those idiots don't have
the precision to do this.

173
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,760
But check them out.

174
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,800
They would have been
in here with Uzis.

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,520
It takes brains do this.

176
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
<i>Big cojones too.</i>

177
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
What do you mean?

178
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,080
It would take a month to explain.

179
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,680
We've got nothing.
What's the matter with you?

180
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,040
The guy who pulled this off
knew what he was doing.

181
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,480
He left us a big "Fuck you."

182
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Find out who installed
the ventilating system.

183
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
- That's cold.
- So's your mama's bed.

184
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,760
This could definitely be
an inside job.

185
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,920
We got 72 hours before the FBI and DEA
come and shut us down.

186
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,640
We'll be the bad guys.

187
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,320
The politics demand...

188
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,160
...that somebody take the rap,
and it'll be us.

189
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,880
Just do what you do.
Only faster.

190
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Jojo, you still a chemist, right?

191
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,640
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

192
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,560
I don't know about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

193
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
You know something.

194
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
I just said "no" to drugs.

195
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,360
You said "no" to drugs!
What you into, Jo?

196
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Rubber.

197
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,120
You're selling tires, huh?

198
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,360
You know nothing?
Jojo don't know nothing.

199
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,760
I know tires.

200
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,960
- You telling the truth?
- Would I lie to you?

201
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,960
Hey! You driving.

202
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,000
This is a waste of time.

203
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,880
In Maxie's line of work
she definitely gets the 411.

204
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Maxie! How'd I know
I'd find you here?

205
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,520
We got to talk.
Where can we talk?

206
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,200
The equipment room?

207
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,520
- Behave yourself.
- I'm cool.

208
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Listen, I need some help.
Again.

209
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
What else is new?

210
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,360
Some major ill shit
happened down at the P.D.

211
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,240
There's lots of heroin
and cash involved.

212
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,360
There'll be some jolly young men
who want to party.

213
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,960
What do you need?

214
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,360
Lots of people
will talk to you, not me.

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
You mean customers?

216
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,960
Don't get in any wild shit.
Just call if you hear something.

217
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,040
I think I will.

218
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,400
What are you doing?

219
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Trying to keep my shit quick.

220
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,600
Right, you ain't getting none at home.
You got extra energy.

221
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
We got anything?

222
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,440
Sanchez says the air conditioning
contract went to...

223
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,440
...Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

224
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,400
He works out of his house this week.
That's the number.

225
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,640
He's not answering.

226
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,240
I guess we should leave.

227
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,800
Make a trip all the way here
to high society for nothing?

228
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,200
No, man.
We can peek in the windows.

229
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,640
That's okay.

230
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,480
- I tripped.
- The handle just opened?

231
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,880
Right after I tripped.
They must want us to come in.

232
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,360
Take a peek.

233
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
Hello!

234
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,400
We're your new neighbors.

235
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,160
Don't be alarmed.
We're Negroes.

236
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
No man!
Too much bass in your voice.

237
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
That scares white folks.
Sound like them.

238
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,040
We were wondering if we can
borrow some brown sugar.

239
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
You fart?

240
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,120
No, man!

241
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Dead guy.

242
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,920
Looks like somebody's home.

243
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,520
Let me take a stab at this one.

244
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,280
He sells the ventilation plans
to the bad guys.

245
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,560
- He gets rich, but dead.
- You're right on that.

246
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,600
- I'm going to go call homicide.
- Wait!

247
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,760
Why do you act like this
around corpses?

248
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,200
It's cool. I just--

249
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
Please? Look around.

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
The smell and the--

251
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
It's just unexpected.

252
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,000
It's looks like our buddy Arrona
was a gambler.

253
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,840
Got dog track, jai alai...

254
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,120
- Needed money to pay his debts.
- Bookie.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
Damn, man!

256
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,040
Watch where you swing
the dead leg!

257
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,560
My bad, my bad!

258
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,200
Damn this.
I'm calling homicide.

259
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,120
I'm a narcotics cop.

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,960
Dead bodies...

261
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
...dead ends.

262
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,440
Maggots.

263
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,120
What's wrong?

264
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,360
Want to grab some burritos?

265
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,280
You drive slow enough
to drive Miss Daisy.

266
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,200
Man, the transaction is done.

267
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,520
We ain't got shit. It's over.

268
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,080
We got it before, we'll get it again.

269
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
Got it all figured out, don't you?

270
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
You got to have faith.

271
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,840
By the time we figured out how,
we'd be out of a job.

272
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,200
Scratch that! Everybody in
the unit will be out of a job!

273
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,000
But don't worry!

274
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,080
They tend to think
Mike Lowrey going to be all right.

275
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,200
Especially since they think
you some rich kid playing cop.

276
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,480
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

277
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,800
See, for me, no job, no check.

278
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,400
That's like all the other guys
in the unit.

279
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,800
At least, most of us.

280
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
So I'm playing cop now?

281
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
This is a game?
I'm just joking?

282
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,200
You always wanting to be
Starsky or Hutch.

283
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
You know what?

284
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm so sick of this bullshit!

285
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,760
I'm supposed to apologize
for my family leaving me money?!

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,360
All I ever wanted to be was a cop!

287
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,840
I take it to the max every day.

288
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm the first guy in and the last
to leave a crime scene.

289
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,360
So fuck you! And fuck them!

290
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,800
And fuck anybody who got
a problem with Mike Lowrey!

291
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,160
- I love you, man.
- Fuck you, Marcus.

292
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,200
I do.

293
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,800
You're cool, man.

294
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,280
- You're my partner.
- Shut up.

295
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,720
Slow-ass driver.

296
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,600
- Driving like a bitch.
- Why I got to be all that?

297
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Slow-ass.

298
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,120
I'll take us off this cliff,
keep fucking with me.

299
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,400
Then it would be, what,
two bitches in the sea?

300
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,920
- Is that what you want?
- Shut up.

301
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,360
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

302
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm a bad boy.

303
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,080
<i>Bad boys, bad boys
What you going to do?</i>

304
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,840
<i>What you going to do
When they come for you?</i>

305
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,040
Only models and that's all.

306
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,000
Max just dropped by.
I got to go.

307
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,320
You want me to call around
looking for the newly rich?

308
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,240
Are there any new guys partying a lot,
spending lots of money?

309
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,560
This guy called me today, desperate...

310
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,000
...looking for new girls in town.
Are you available?

311
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
It'll be a quick $2,000.

312
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,160
I got plans with Julie.

313
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,280
She's your roommate, right?

314
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,600
Bring her.
She's cute, she's sexy.

315
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,400
She's not a working girl.

316
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,200
He's on speedballs.

317
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,520
He probably can't get it up.

318
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
Maybe we'll go check it out.

319
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,960
Could be the party I'm looking for.

320
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,400
A party at the Biltmore.
That'll really rock.

321
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
I owe you one.

322
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,960
I'll just deduct it from
the hundreds of favors I owe you.

323
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,600
Am I becoming a guest who won't leave?

324
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,920
No, I like having you live with me.

325
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who can't cook.

326
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Not a big upside for you there.

327
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,600
What hip individual inspired
this visit to the Biltmore?

328
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,960
It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.

329
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,800
The cop I think you're
a little bit in love with.

330
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,400
Maybe I am.
But we're just friends.

331
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,680
If I were in trouble,
he's the person I'd call.

332
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,680
I know, I know.
I've heard this before.

333
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,000
You must be Max. Welcome.

334
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm Eddie.

335
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,120
To the AI Capone suite.

336
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,120
I guess we're a little early.

337
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
This is Julie.

338
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,680
You like AI Capone, don't you?

339
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,440
I hadn't thought about it.

340
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,720
I'm not kidding
about this being Capone's.

341
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,720
He had the place
rigged with secret passageways.

342
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,720
10 minutes, we're gone.

343
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
Five.

344
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,280
- One drink.
- One sip.

345
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,680
Just girl chat.

346
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,440
Where's the bathroom?

347
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
Upstairs on your right.

348
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,480
Watch your step.

349
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,160
Come.

350
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,960
Sit.

351
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,720
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

352
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
Eddie's got some favors
to play with.

353
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,720
That he does.

354
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,520
I should've told you about his party.

355
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,640
Well, now it's a surprise party.

356
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,120
Okay, Max, I think we've been here
about 5 minutes too long.

357
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,240
I see you treat yourself well, Eddie.

358
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,040
I needed to blow off
a little steam after...

359
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,200
...the move, you know.

360
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,040
So a little party with
a few friends, that's all.

361
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
I was going to invite you guys.

362
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,520
Invite?

363
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
Looks like I'm catering this.

364
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,040
I was looking for my 2 keys of dope.
Now I know where they are.

365
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,440
Yours? It's our score.

366
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
- And the girl?
- Nobody.

367
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,040
Just entertainment.

368
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
I'm Max.

369
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,240
Nice to meet you.

370
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,040
I like a woman who
takes pride in her appearance.

371
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,360
Don't you?

372
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,040
I hate when
a bitch lets herself slide.

373
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,800
You look like a model in that dress.

374
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,280
Will you model for me?

375
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,120
Oh, great!
It's the goon squad.

376
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,000
You were a cop.
You should know hookers talk.

377
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,000
You couldn't wait 4 more days
until I made the deal?

378
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,560
I can't work with
that kind of stupidity.

379
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,120
I got you connected inside.

380
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,560
I brought you my family.

381
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
It's my family now.

382
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,640
We're still friends.

383
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,640
- What're you guys doing?
- You pissed him off.

384
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,320
You got blood on me again.

385
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,680
Someone's there!

386
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Get her!

387
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,240
Get her!

388
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,480
What the fuck?!

389
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,240
Shoot her!

390
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,480
- I got her.
- I got her!

391
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,040
- Bullshit!
- What do you know about shooting?

392
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,960
I can't believe she made it!

393
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
Are you serious?

394
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
She jumped.

395
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
Fuck!

396
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,040
Find out who she worked for,
and find out where she lives.

397
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,600
It's about fucking time!

398
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,560
Come here, look at this.
See this guy?

399
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,200
He's dead, right?

400
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
- Look familiar?
- Eddie Dominguez.

401
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,640
- The ex-cop.
- Two points for you.

402
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,040
And there's high-grade
heroin over there.

403
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,840
That's a headline Sinclair will love.

404
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,800
No sign of forced entry.

405
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,240
What is this? Looks like Beirut.

406
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
It's the AI Capone suite.

407
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,280
What can I say? Shit happens.

408
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
It's a shitty day.

409
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
Real shitty day.

410
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,240
We've got two shades
of lipstick over here.

411
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,160
Someone's missing from the party.

412
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,880
Listen to me.

413
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,640
Your only function in life now
is to find that person.

414
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,960
It's the only lead we have.

415
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,640
I'll check all calls to the room.

416
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
What you got over there?

417
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,120
Cover her.

418
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,120
He knew the girl?

419
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,200
We'll get the witness
and get the fools who did this.

420
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,320
See if you can
catch a ride with Howard.

421
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Where you going?

422
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,040
Checking calls made to Lois Fields.
Maxie worked for her.

423
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,320
- I'll come with you.
- No, we'll catch up later.

424
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
You okay?

425
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm cool.

426
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,520
Hello?

427
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,920
Shit!

428
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,200
Look, baby, I know
quality time was my idea.

429
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,120
<i>Don't talk about it.</i>

430
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,440
Hold on, babe.

431
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,960
I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

432
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
<i>Just a minute.</i>

433
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,280
<i>I got on the red one.</i>

434
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,800
The red one? With the snaps?
Couldn't you wait?

435
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,280
<i>You're never home.</i>

436
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
<i>All his files are blocked.</i>

437
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,760
I don't care about his personal files.
He's dead. Unblock it.

438
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
<i>Screw you, that's illegal.</i>

439
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
No, screw you!

440
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,640
<i>Are you talking to me?</i>

441
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,360
No, it's a term you use.
"Screw you" is a cop term.

442
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,320
<i>You ain't screwing nothing!</i>

443
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,120
Goddamn it!

444
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,800
Where's Lowrey?

445
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,120
I just paged him.

446
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,560
He's following up
this Lois Fields lead.

447
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
The madam?

448
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Requesting backup.
614 Reach Road.

449
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
That might be him.

450
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
Lowrey's desk.

451
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,680
I need to talk
to Detective Mike Lowrey.

452
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,520
<i>Can I help you?</i>

453
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,120
You can get me Detective Lowrey.

454
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,280
Is this another paternity case?

455
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,240
No, it's another murder case,
you twerp!

456
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,960
You mean the murder case
at the Biltmore tonight?

457
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,000
<i>I've just seen my best friend murdered.</i>

458
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,160
I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

459
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,280
Why only Mike Lowrey?

460
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,640
None of your business.
I talk to Lowrey or I blow town.

461
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,760
Mike, phone! Telephone!

462
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,160
He's coming right now.
Hold on.

463
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,240
Talk.

464
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
I ain't got time.

465
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,040
This is the witness from the hotel.

466
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,480
He just got out of the john.
Hold on.

467
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,520
- Talk to her now or she'll walk.
- I can't be Mike.

468
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,120
She's going to walk out.

469
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
- This is our witness.
- Calm down!

470
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Hello.

471
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,520
This is Lowrey.

472
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,600
He doesn't talk that way.
Talk like him.

473
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,760
You don't sound sexy enough.

474
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,320
Damn!

475
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,680
You don't know me.
My name's Julie Mott.

476
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
I was Max Logan's best friend.

477
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
Calm down, calm down.

478
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,880
Talk to me now.

479
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,280
She said if she ever needed anything...

480
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,040
I need your help.

481
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,680
Give me the address.

482
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,360
All right.

483
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,960
It'll be okay.
Mike's to the rescue.

484
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,640
I'm on the way.

485
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,520
- I'll find Lowrey.
- I can't go.

486
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,920
You got to go!

487
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,320
Get Mike to handle this.

488
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,640
Get to this address now.
Get up!

489
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,680
You won't see your wife for a month!
Get up!

490
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,960
Get this fucking door fixed!

491
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,760
Mike Lowrey.

492
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,640
No, easy.
Mike Lowrey.

493
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Shit!

494
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,280
Who's there?

495
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,280
Mike Lowrey.

496
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,360
How do I know it's Lowrey?

497
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,760
'Cause, I'm Mike Lowrey!

498
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,680
We ain't got much time.

499
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,080
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

500
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,840
I won't let you in until you do.

501
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,120
No way!

502
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,280
- What was that for?
- You're not him!

503
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,960
What do you mean?!
You've never met him!

504
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Max described you differently!

505
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm undercover!

506
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,760
Prove it!

507
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,760
I know Max from way back.
I helped her brother get out of jail.

508
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,040
So?

509
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,320
Sometimes we got together
to bump and grind...

510
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,720
Wrong!

511
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
Give me the bat!

512
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,200
Fine!
You don't want to believe me?

513
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,280
You go at this shit alone!

514
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,640
I forgot.

515
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,040
The bad guys probably
know where you live...

516
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,680
...and are coming for you.
Good luck!

517
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,640
I saw the whole thing.

518
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,080
I watched him shoot her
like she was nothing.

519
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,960
Shut the door.

520
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,480
Look, lady.

521
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,640
You ain't got
no more bats, golf clubs...

522
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,840
...or anything like that
to swing at me, do you?

523
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
I knew Max, okay?

524
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,920
I cared about Max also.

525
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,680
I'm just here to help you.

526
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
You're not what I expected.

527
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,120
I ain't expect to walk
into Yankee Stadium either.

528
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,880
We got to get out of here, okay?
Let's go.

529
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,360
I've got to get my dogs.
Dukie!

530
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,240
Lukie, Dukie, whatever!

531
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,440
You got a back door?

532
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,240
Where we going?

533
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,560
Protective custody.

534
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,360
Fuck that!
I'm only dealing with you.

535
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,120
A cop threw that party at the hotel.

536
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,040
Former cop.
We got rid of him long ago.

537
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,280
Come on, Luke!

538
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Listen, if you want to live,
you got to trust me.

539
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,360
Here, doggie!
Come on, doggie!

540
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Who the hell was that?!

541
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,040
There is too much killing going on!

542
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,600
Go after them!

543
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
I'll go around front!

544
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,000
Come on, move your ass!

545
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,560
Get in the car!

546
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,920
- Go, goddamn it!
- Fucking door!

547
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,640
Go, goddamn it, go!

548
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,280
How did you miss them?
You fat fuck!

549
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,920
Watch your fucking mouth!

550
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,760
Lose weight, you'd have caught them.

551
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,480
I'd like to squeeze your fucking head.

552
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,480
Now you're fucking in trouble!

553
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,840
- You get the license plate?
- I got the plates.

554
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,440
You cockeyed fuck!

555
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,280
This is a getaway car?
We won't get away from anything!

556
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,680
Is this a family station wagon?

557
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,800
You got a baby seat in the back!

558
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,480
It's an undercover car, okay?

559
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,320
I know they saw my license plate.

560
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
Were those the guys who shot Max?

561
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,320
I only saw bullets.
You tell me what they look like.

562
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,120
I was busy trying
to keep a bullet out of you.

563
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,600
I need you to look
through some mug shots...

564
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,640
...to identify Max's shooter.

565
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,600
- Where?
- Protective custody.

566
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
I told you I'm not going
into protective custody!

567
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm not playing.

568
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,480
You really pissing me off.
I'll book your ass!

569
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,080
I'll develop amnesia. I suddenly
feel a case of it coming on.

570
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,920
Fine, where would you feel safe?

571
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,240
You want to do protective custody?

572
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,800
In-home protective custody,
at your place. I can handle that.

573
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,400
Yeah, my place.
My place is--

574
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,920
No way!

575
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Right!

576
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,560
Yeah, my place is the shit.

577
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,520
Mike Lowrey's place.
You right.

578
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's the best idea
you came up with tonight.

579
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,480
Wait here.

580
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,320
Wait here.

581
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
Detective Burnett!

582
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,120
How are you?
Mr. Lowrey's not here.

583
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,440
He said I could use his place.

584
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,560
He didn't mention it to me.

585
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,720
Who's the chick?
How's your wife?

586
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,960
Fine, she's fine.

587
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,040
Your kids, they're good?
Family's the most important thing.

588
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Is it?

589
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,960
Mr. Lowrey said you got a baby factory
going on at your house.

590
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,440
Here you go.

591
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,600
If that ain't enough,
I'll run you in for extortion.

592
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
You know,
I'm so stupid sometimes.

593
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,200
Now that you mention it,
Mr. Lowrey mentioned you'd come by.

594
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,000
Did he say he had a key?

595
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,400
Hang out.

596
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
- Here.
- Is this it?

597
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,040
You're hurting me.

598
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,320
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

599
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,000
Have fun.

600
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,760
It's not like that.

601
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,480
It's not like that.

602
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,320
Come on.

603
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,800
Watch your step up through here.

604
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,320
I must've left some incense burning.

605
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,120
<i>Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.</i>

606
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,280
This is kind of...

607
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,480
I'm always moving my switches.

608
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,440
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

609
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,360
Shit!

610
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,720
Why am I tripping on shit
I know is there?

611
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,720
You found a light switch.

612
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,960
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

613
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,840
<i>This is Yvette.</i>

614
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,160
Ignore this.
It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

615
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,440
She's always calling,
got to have it.

616
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,200
Don't call here no more now, freak!
Just one of my freaks.

617
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,760
All this on a cop's salary?

618
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,920
Well...

619
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,400
...it's honest money.

620
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,960
I'm a second-generation rich kid.

621
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,680
If you're not in it for the paycheck,
are you an action junkie?

622
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,800
If that what you want to call it.

623
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,800
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets grazing my ass.

624
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,680
Gives me a rush.

625
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,960
Look...

626
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,280
...I'll give you a broad stroke
of the place.

627
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,760
I got some T-bones in the fridge
for Lukie and Dukie...

628
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,720
Sorry, the fridge is this way.
I confuse my own shit.

629
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,880
Wait, are you going to
leave me here alone?

630
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,480
I must go to the P.D.

631
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,840
These are Miami's
peak crime hours, you know.

632
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,280
Apparently.

633
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,720
They said this deal was going down
in 4 days, and I, you know...

634
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,400
...obviously seem to be kind of
a major glitch in their--

635
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,400
You ain't with the bad guys now.
You're with the cops.

636
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,920
With Mike Lowrey. You with the cops.

637
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,440
Everything will be all right.
Trust me.

638
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,600
I'll be back.

639
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,960
I know that it's no time to joke,
but remember in the movie when...?

640
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,280
All right, all right.

641
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,320
Thanks for everything, Mike.

642
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,120
I'm going.

643
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,960
You're one of those in and out guys.

644
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
It's not like that, Chet.

645
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,840
- She's a witness.
- Right.

646
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,760
- Keep an eye out.
- No problem.

647
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,560
Listen to me. Hear me.

648
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,160
- Me?
- That's right.

649
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,800
All right, the moment Lowrey gets in,
you have him call me at home.

650
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,720
- At my home.
- Call you at home.

651
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,600
Don't let him go upstairs.

652
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,680
What? But he lives here.

653
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,920
I could lose my job.

654
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,080
Chet, trust me on this, okay?

655
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,360
Call you from here.

656
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,960
Don't let him up.

657
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,640
- No problem.
- Important witness.

658
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,920
Thank you.

659
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,560
I got an idea. I'm off in 2 hours,
I could go upstairs...

660
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,840
...and watch the door.

661
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,960
Like cops do in the movies.

662
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,680
I got a magazine and everything.
And I don't let anybody in or out.

663
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,560
All kidding aside, I want to help.

664
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,240
You're helping.
Do that from here. Can you?

665
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,480
Yes, I can.

666
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,440
Fine.
That helps. From here, okay?

667
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,000
It's funny that you ask me,
because I was going to be a cop.

668
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,600
I took the test and everything.
Just didn't work out.

669
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,800
Politics.

670
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,240
I know, you're my deputy.

671
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,560
- I am.
- From here.

672
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,720
Watch out.

673
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,120
Right.

674
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,160
Take care, chief.

675
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm a deputy.

676
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,040
Don't "honey-baby" me,
you smell like perfume.

677
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,120
And you don't have
your wedding ring on!

678
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
Damn!

679
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,440
I went undercover...

680
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,760
...and it required
taking off the ring.

681
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,520
I got the ring. I put my hand
in my pocket to get it...

682
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,280
...and it's right back on.

683
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,240
Damn!

684
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,560
Can I get a pillow?

685
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,440
If it isn't the guy
who doesn't return phone calls.

686
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,160
Where you been
the last 12 hours?

687
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,840
I paged you all night!

688
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,720
We got a situation here
that you need to know about.

689
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,160
Look, Marcus...

690
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,920
...I got a dead madam, a concussion
and a bad headache.

691
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,640
Let me tell you what I did last night.

692
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,040
I had to sleep on my couch.
I woke up with a Power Ranger in my ass.

693
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,840
While we're discussing my ass,
I damn near got it blown off.

694
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,760
The good news is I got a witness.

695
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,760
Let me tell you about her.
She likes to--

696
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,800
You sound like a nagging wife.

697
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,560
I'm a nagging...?

698
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,200
See what happens when you go off alone?
You get into shit.

699
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,200
Like shit don't happen
when you're there.

700
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,760
That ain't the point.

701
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,040
If your partner pages you,
you should call him back.

702
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,600
I want to meet the man
who whupped your ass.

703
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,680
I want to meet
who whupped Shaft's ass.

704
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,160
Look at me. You don't know
what I've been through.

705
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,680
My wife kicked me out
of my happy home.

706
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,120
But, no.
You got to go off by yourself.

707
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,360
"I got this, partner, I got this."
Bullshit.

708
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,760
I'm feeling much better,
thanks.

709
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,120
I'll get him.

710
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,760
I'll beat you up.

711
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,280
Did you hear what I said?!

712
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,120
I did, because I was there
when I said it.

713
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,160
I told you.
I told you to secure a witness...

714
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,160
...not shoot up a neighborhood.

715
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,440
Not to do another dead body.
Just get the dope back, quietly.

716
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,360
This whole situation
is getting out of control.

717
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,800
You're damn right it is!

718
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,640
I had to pass a pop quiz
before she believed I was him.

719
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,240
Going, it's going...

720
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
Shit, little off.

721
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,520
I haven't killed anyone today.

722
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,440
Do you want me to yell at you?

723
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,440
Listen, this witness...

724
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,480
...it's the only good news I got,
okay?

725
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,280
You guys are bad news.

726
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,520
What does that mean?
It means if you must be Mike Lowrey...

727
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,960
...I don't give a shit,
that's who you'll be!

728
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,680
Wait a minute,
what the hell is going on?

729
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,400
I was getting them all in
before you came.

730
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,520
Can somebody talk to me, please?
What's going on?

731
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,200
These fools could have seen
my license plate.

732
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,360
Where is she?

733
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,080
His place.

734
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,120
What?

735
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,960
You left her alone?

736
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,720
Our only witness?!

737
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,920
You left a hooker in my apartment?!

738
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,480
The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know.

739
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,640
I had to stash her somewhere.
Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

740
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,640
You left dogs in my house?
There's dogs and a hooker in my house?

741
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,240
Add some chimps, we'll have a carnival.

742
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,920
- She's not a hooker.
- Respect my stuff.

743
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,000
- Can you please--
- Shut up!

744
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,800
For years, Sinclair has tried
to pin something on me.

745
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm always taking it for you.
Do it for me!

746
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,240
If this witness IDs the shooters,
maybe we catch our bad guys.

747
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,280
But until then...

748
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
...until then...

749
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,160
...you are Mike Lowrey.

750
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,360
You be him,
that's what you are.

751
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,440
You're him!
I don't want to hear it!

752
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,120
You be you.

753
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,440
But not in front of her!
You're him, you're you!

754
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,080
Can we get a time-out?
Am I the designated homeless?

755
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,840
Does it look like I care?
Whatever it takes, all right?

756
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,880
What did she say to you?

757
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,520
The shooters will make their drop
in 4 days? So we got 4 days.

758
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,000
What kind of plan is that?

759
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,120
I can't be shacked up with her.

760
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,640
I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass.

761
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,880
You don't like your job, quit!

762
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,000
Damn!

763
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,280
I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids.

764
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,880
Thanks, but no thanks.
You won't last 5 minutes with my family.

765
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,840
Married life is easy.
You only got one woman to satisfy.

766
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,280
Yo, man...

767
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,800
...we ain't the Cosbys.

768
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,360
Let's go, I got this.

769
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,560
Go.

770
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,360
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

771
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,280
You're going to be retired
like him too.

772
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,960
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

773
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,720
Cleveland?

774
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,520
I never-- Look, woman,
I done told you...

775
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,400
...it's a federal subpoena.

776
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,800
Am I going to tell them no?

777
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,400
I don't know. Why can't he go?

778
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,880
Why can't you go?

779
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,840
I wanted to, but Captain Howard said
I'm irresponsi--

780
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,680
No, he said, "loose cannon."
Because I be shooting in public.

781
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,080
Out of nowhere sometimes.

782
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,680
No, man.

783
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,560
Please. All right.

784
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,280
Look. The neighborhood
has lots of break-ins.

785
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,120
I can handle it.

786
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,360
I know, but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here.

787
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,840
Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back.

788
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,440
Who'll pick up the kids from day care?
Mike can't do it.

789
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,080
Are you listening to me?

790
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,360
I read a book
that could probably help y'all.

791
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,680
Can you go down and have a Coke?

792
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,080
Please!

793
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,240
All right.

794
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,680
Want something?

795
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,440
Bring me a Coke.

796
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,520
Want one?

797
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,880
I'm fine, thanks.

798
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,120
All right.

799
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,120
Explain it to me. There's a problem
with our chemistry set?

800
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,680
It's not a chemistry set.

801
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,600
He knows it ain't a chemistry set.

802
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,440
So what is it?

803
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,320
The cutting agent
is a highly volatile...

804
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,880
...substance.

805
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,520
- I don't care.
- The ether--

806
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,440
I don't care! I don't care!

807
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,760
I'm not
a fucking chemistry teacher.

808
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,080
What is the problem?!

809
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,040
There's too much moisture down here.

810
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,040
It's totally fucked.

811
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,240
Shut up!

812
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,280
Okay.

813
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,560
What else?

814
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,680
It's taking longer to cook
than we planned. If we rush it...

815
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,360
...we can't sell the drugs.

816
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,560
You're fucking with my timetable.
I gave you a deadline.

817
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,680
Understand?

818
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,560
- Do you understand?!
- I do.

819
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,480
You dressed?

820
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,840
Yeah, I am.

821
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,520
We must go through some mug shots.
I'll hook into the computer.

822
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,760
- And we can do this.
- Who's that guy in the photos?

823
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,640
Sometimes I don't look
and forget all those pictures was here.

824
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,640
That's my partner. That's my partner,
Marcus Burnett.

825
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,920
I've never seen anything
like this before.

826
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,800
I see how it may throw you
a little bit.

827
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,440
It's a cop thing.

828
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,520
These pictures are here for
each time he saved my life.

829
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,040
It's the same with him.
At his place, just pictures of me.

830
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,680
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

831
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,760
When I saw it, the whole wall,
I thought maybe they were...

832
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,480
...pictures of your lover.

833
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
Who?

834
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,120
I thought you were gay.

835
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,440
Gay?

836
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,160
Nah, nah, nah.

837
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,520
I didn't mean to offend you.
It's okay to be a homosexual.

838
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,400
You're not listening.
It's not registering.

839
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,680
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?
You didn't feel the dents?

840
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,480
The dents come from that.

841
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,040
That's how I gets down.

842
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,480
That's...

843
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,680
...sweet.

844
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,920
I'm gay. If I was, I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker.

845
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,800
No.

846
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,880
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

847
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,840
I don't eat flesh.

848
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,480
What?

849
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,920
That's flesh that you're...

850
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,560
...shoveling in your mouth.

851
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,440
That was a living, breathing creature.
It probably had a name.

852
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,040
It's just bologna.

853
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,240
My bologna has a first name.

854
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,280
Actually, your bologna has
about 30 names...

855
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,920
...because they take odd parts
from all different ones.

856
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,960
The leftovers: the hooves,
stomach lining, ears...

857
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,000
...and stuff. They put it into
a machine and grind it up.

858
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,680
Then out comes, like, this sheet.
That's what you're eating now.

859
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,000
You know what?

860
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,080
I don't eat bologna no more.
How about a pickle?

861
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,640
- Can I eat the pickle?
- It has salt, but it's a vegetable.

862
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,080
Salt in the pickle?

863
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,880
Let me rinse-- Let me rinse it off.
There we go.

864
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,400
How's that?

865
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,840
Just... Let's keep going.

866
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,480
I don't taste salt now.

867
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Go back.

868
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,040
That's the guy.

869
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,240
He was there, in the room.

870
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,640
We got a tip they was running
major druggage, like 50 keys.

871
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,520
So we steps to the door.

872
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,440
"Freeze! Miami P.D.!
Get down, get down, get down!"

873
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,160
Out of nowhere, this pimp named Chino
punched me in the head.

874
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,960
Chino's running ho's.
Your dad will explain that.

875
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,080
Look at it.

876
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,320
Your dogs shit all over my place.
Liquid shit.

877
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,400
It doesn't help, shellacking it in
with furniture polish.

878
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,600
There's a piece there.
Get it.

879
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,080
- I got it.
- Look like a chip of shit.

880
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,200
Can I please have the parole jacket
on Noah Trafficante?

881
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,040
- Thank you.
- You know what?

882
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,040
I'm tired of this witness.

883
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,880
I want my life the way it was.

884
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,160
I'm tired.
I got married so I could stop lying.

885
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,320
I can't believe you're complaining.

886
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,120
You've got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo.

887
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,520
Why you call my place a zoo?!

888
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,040
- I'm tired of you.
- You want to fight?

889
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,480
Listen, Francine, please...

890
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,240
That's my silk shirt, man!

891
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,480
It's nice.

892
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,360
I figure since I'm gonna be Mike,
I might as well dress like Mike.

893
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,000
<i>I want to be...</i>

894
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,600
<i>...I want to be like Mike.</i>

895
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,360
You're sick.
Something's wrong with you.

896
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,400
You have a problem
that should be checked.

897
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,680
Probably.

898
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,480
- The file. He worked at Club Hell.
- Thank you.

899
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,040
Can you take care of this?
I gotta call the wife.

900
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,000
Whose wife?!

901
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,040
Can you please do some work?

902
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,600
- Once today, just do something!
- I tell you--

903
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,520
Do something to help this case.

904
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,760
Boy!

905
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,880
You look handsome today.

906
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,280
No, see, it's not that kind of day.
Leave me alone.

907
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,520
Seriously.

908
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,440
What's up, babe, PMS?

909
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,000
Damn the jokes!

910
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,280
- Damn them! Ring it.
- Okay, I won't say anything.

911
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,960
That's cool. Hold on.

912
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,840
Go ahead.

913
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,920
All right.

914
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,920
How are the kids?

915
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,320
How's potty training going?

916
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,600
You're so silly.

917
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,840
<i>Will you be late?</i>

918
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,920
No, it'll be 10:30, 11:00
before I get in.

919
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,120
Don't wait up. I'll be there.

920
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,000
Rent a movie.

921
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,440
Something we can kick back to.

922
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,880
What're you wearing?

923
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,400
Give me the phone! Give it!

924
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,760
She hung up a long time ago.
I was playing. I was playing.

925
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,400
I was playing.

926
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,280
Don't play like that.
That's my family. My happy home.

927
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,960
Stop wearing my clothes.

928
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,320
Everybody about the
motherfucking jokes today!

929
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,280
I can't believe this.

930
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,680
Come on, Eddie Dominguez's file
can't be that hard to get into.

931
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,040
I tried 3 times, I just can't get in.
Besides, this is illegal.

932
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,720
That never stopped you before.
Just let me know if you get anything.

933
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,240
Anything for you.
But I can't get in. I tried.

934
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,080
- What's up, Chet?
- Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

935
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,120
Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

936
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,000
The Lowrey Brothers.

937
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,880
Let's just get down to Club Hell
and pick up Noah.

938
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,160
Julie, it's me!

939
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,840
You're supposed to get us
the Dominguez file.

940
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,120
It'll take a day or two.

941
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,680
- We don't have a day or two.
- I'm not a computer whiz.

942
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,640
It'll take awhile.

943
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,200
- You ain't taking care of shit.
- I was thinking--

944
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,400
Hi.

945
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,840
- You must be Marcus.
- I'd be Marcus.

946
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
- That's right.
- Marcus, right?

947
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,200
I'm Julie.

948
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,000
Julie, hi.

949
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,440
Nice to meet you.

950
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,000
You too.
I recognized you from...

951
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,800
...every one of the photographs.

952
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,560
Well, it's my man, you know.

953
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,160
The wall.
Yeah, those on the wall.

954
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
You must be very good.

955
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,120
I'm sorry?

956
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,400
As a partner.
Given your job, what you do.

957
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,320
What time are we
doing this thing tonight?

958
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,880
Mike said we're going to a club.

959
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,760
"We"...

960
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,600
...as in me and my partner.

961
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,800
You wanted protective custody.
You at my house.

962
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,480
That's just great.

963
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,320
I'll stay here with Chet
the mini-moron doorman to protect me?

964
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,040
Chet is very good.

965
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,760
That looks like a stain on your rug.
Damn.

966
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That was my baby, Luke.
He gets nervous and--

967
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,520
He just shits.

968
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,680
It's like marking his territory.
Sort of a male thing.

969
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,920
I offered to pay Mike for the cleaning
and he refused.

970
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,280
I'll get rid of it.

971
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,560
You don't need that.

972
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,720
I was going to throw it out.
I want a new look.

973
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,560
Mike, he's a special guy.
Mike is special.

974
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,880
I call him Special Mike.

975
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,720
It's funny, you can laugh at that.
That's why...

976
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,440
...I love him.

977
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,480
Me, I'd be pissed.

978
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,480
Look at this cute dog on the couch.

979
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,600
That's Luke.

980
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,160
Look how he crawls on the leather.

981
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,640
You want to meet Duke?
He's in the bed. He's upset...

982
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,160
...and having diarrhea and throwing up.

983
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,760
Oh, baby.

984
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,960
Let's go see
if Duke is going to be okay.

985
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,800
Me and you. Me and you.

986
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,560
Who are you?

987
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,320
- Who are you?
- Look, you must get out.

988
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,680
- Hands off!
- Don't push me!

989
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,960
I'm Yvette.

990
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,600
Get your hands off me!

991
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,400
What're you doing?

992
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,560
Get out. If you don't stop
stalking me, I'll arrest you.

993
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,760
You old psycho!

994
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,360
- You asshole!
- She's into some weird shit.

995
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,800
What's going on?

996
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,360
That was crazy Yvette.

997
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,200
Stalking me.

998
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,680
I forgot she was coming.
You threw her out?

999
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,080
Yvette is a masseuse.

1000
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,800
She massages shit.

1001
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,120
She told me.

1002
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,000
Are there any other
totally hysterical...

1003
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,800
...half-naked women popping by
I should know about?

1004
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,320
She was naked?

1005
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,920
Titties were out.

1006
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,360
You threw her out naked?

1007
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,520
My wife would hate--
She hates womanizers.

1008
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,960
Something's wrong with you.

1009
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,800
You don't respect
other people's shit.

1010
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,240
I've been telling you that for years.

1011
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,920
Your trash is all over.

1012
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,720
Enough! Please!

1013
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,200
Me and my partner...

1014
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,360
...we're going to Club Hell
to bust Noah.

1015
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,560
Anyone have a problem with that?

1016
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,000
Fine.

1017
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,600
Don't blow the case.

1018
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,000
Here's the deal: You stay put.

1019
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,160
Anyone tells you to move,
you're making a delivery for Fouchet.

1020
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,160
You got it? You got it? Frank?

1021
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,440
It's ether! It'll explode, you dope!

1022
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,080
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!

1023
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,720
I remember you.

1024
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,480
Check it, Lowrey...

1025
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,520
...we got 2 days left.
Let's do this right.

1026
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,040
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

1027
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm not trying to lose my job.

1028
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,440
As I recall, the last dead bad guys
belonged to you.

1029
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,800
Next time you kill them...

1030
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,920
...do it after you get the information.
Just a suggestion.

1031
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,680
Please. You ain't even
comparing body counts.

1032
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,560
Should I keep going?

1033
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,840
I'm out.

1034
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,160
Noah's parole jacket
says he works here.

1035
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,320
We're here arguing
like schoolgirls.

1036
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,480
Let's stop this bickering.

1037
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,040
Because you're getting on my nerves.

1038
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,080
He got no package.

1039
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,000
Look at you! Look at you!
Can you stay focused?

1040
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,320
I'm focused.

1041
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,320
Focused on all this ass around here.

1042
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,720
Let's do what we came to do and go.

1043
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,040
- Simple.
- Fine.

1044
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,920
Check around. Meet at the bar
in 10 minutes.

1045
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,880
- Fine.
- Fine.

1046
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,720
Holy shit, what is he doing?

1047
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,000
Oh, man!

1048
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,360
That's the cop! There he is!

1049
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,760
That's him! I'm going.

1050
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,840
What's up?

1051
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,920
Budweiser. Feel like I had
a million of them.

1052
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,120
What's up?

1053
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,960
Tell me where to throw him!

1054
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,600
Fuck!

1055
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,640
Learn how to work the safety
with your punk-ass.

1056
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,920
I'll be back.

1057
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,800
Who whupped your ass now?

1058
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,920
This really ain't the fucking time.

1059
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,600
They know.
Let's get Noah and go.

1060
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,640
It's the chick.

1061
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,160
Look, the chick!

1062
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,560
The bitch from the rooftop!

1063
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,400
Let's go!

1064
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,840
That was the guy who shot Max!

1065
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,720
The truck!

1066
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,080
Take the truck!

1067
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,440
There! Go!

1068
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,160
We're in a hurry.

1069
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,040
Let's go!

1070
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,520
You're cops! Why are we running away?!
He's in there!

1071
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,800
Here! Go!

1072
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,800
This is good.

1073
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,360
Noah's chasing us!

1074
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,360
What was that?

1075
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,520
What was that?

1076
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,880
That was-- I don't know.

1077
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,880
I had a perfect shot at him
if Action Jackson here--

1078
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,160
No! This is official police business!

1079
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,920
You had no business in there!
Can you drive?

1080
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,840
- Please drive!
- Don't bring it here!

1081
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,240
You picked an ice cream truck!

1082
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,040
- What am I smelling?
- Drive!

1083
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,480
What am I smelling?

1084
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,600
Ether.

1085
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,960
Extremely flammable ether.

1086
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,160
Oh, shit.

1087
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,600
Goddamn.

1088
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,120
You the man!

1089
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,560
You the man tonight!

1090
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,680
How you pick an ice-cream truck
that's a bomb?!

1091
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,680
Shit!

1092
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,640
This is protective custody?!

1093
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,880
Yes!

1094
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,600
Shit!

1095
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,040
Do something!
We're out of road!

1096
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,880
Who picked this road?!

1097
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,520
All the road in Miami
and you run out!

1098
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,520
Come up with an idea, fast!

1099
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,880
Why must I come up with the ideas?!

1100
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,520
Take this shit!

1101
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,040
Dead end!
There's no more road!

1102
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,480
We out of fucking road!

1103
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,800
It's going to blow!

1104
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,400
Get the fuck out!

1105
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,520
Well...

1106
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,720
Should I add this to your body count?

1107
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,600
There goes our only lead to the dope.

1108
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,840
Ain't this a bitch!

1109
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,280
The dope?!

1110
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,760
What are you talking about?

1111
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,040
"There goes our only lead to Max's
killer?!" He's out there!

1112
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:09,160
That's not important, it's not
your job to protect people! Shit!

1113
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,640
- She's crazy!
- I'm crazy?!

1114
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,320
Her rocker's gone!

1115
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,280
Stop your barking!
This is the witness!

1116
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,040
She done zoomed.
You deal with her.

1117
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,720
No way.

1118
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,080
Listen, yes, okay, you're right.

1119
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,560
This started because of missing drugs.
But let me tell you:

1120
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,960
There's nothing more
important to Mike...

1121
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,480
...than doing this guy that killed Max.

1122
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,360
Sometimes he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings.

1123
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,200
Come on.
It'll be all right.

1124
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,920
We need you.

1125
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,000
Part of the team.

1126
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,800
I thought he was supposed to be
the smooth one.

1127
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,080
This has not been a good day.

1128
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:02,200
Damn right. It's bullshit.
We got 2 days to find these fools...

1129
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,520
...and no leads because
you cooked Noah's ass.

1130
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,280
Shampoo?

1131
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,640
Hello.

1132
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,040
What's up?

1133
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,080
It don't take that long
to get shampoo.

1134
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,160
- Let's go.
- Look at this.

1135
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,000
Animal tested. Animal tested.

1136
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,680
You know how many chemicals
are in this?

1137
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,760
I don't care if you go bald.
Let's go.

1138
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,800
Jojo.

1139
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,280
He's a chemist.

1140
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,720
Too much heroin and ether
for nobody to know nothing.

1141
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,440
What's he talking about?

1142
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,720
You know the barrels of ether that
blew up on the truck?

1143
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,880
It's used to process heroin.

1144
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,640
They do that to cut it.
It quadruples the value.

1145
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,360
You can't stick it in the microwave.

1146
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,480
Let's pay for this.

1147
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,240
How much?

1148
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,720
$14.25.

1149
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,080
I left my wallet somewhere.

1150
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,400
Freeze, motherbitches!

1151
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,160
- Don't move.
- Wait.

1152
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,520
I'm not understanding.

1153
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,360
Do you attract violence?

1154
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,520
Shut the fuck up!

1155
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,720
Take it easy.

1156
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,160
We are cops.

1157
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,480
You're not cops. I'm not stupid.
I know.

1158
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,280
- Wait.
- I've seen police.

1159
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,480
I'm reaching for my badge.

1160
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,960
You want badges, motherbitch?!

1161
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,640
I give you badges!

1162
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,200
Here! 99 cents.
I sell you some.

1163
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,080
You got 8 badges.
This cop thing don't work.

1164
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,680
I blow you!

1165
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,080
Then I blow you!

1166
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,960
Blow me? No, hump me,
that's all right.

1167
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,360
I kill before. I kill again.

1168
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,320
- Hold on!
- I'll blow you!

1169
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,680
- Hump me.
- Hold on!

1170
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,520
The emotion I'm going through
means this is serious.

1171
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,200
Me and this motherfucker
is not vibing right now.

1172
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,240
- Something on your chest?
- I got something.

1173
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,480
Hello! The guy's got a cannon.

1174
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,480
What do you want?

1175
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,800
You want some?
Then come get it.

1176
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,800
I'm gone!

1177
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,840
Freeze, bitch!

1178
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,640
You freeze, bitch!

1179
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,840
Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1180
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,520
Now back up.

1181
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,840
Put the gun down.
Get me a pack of Bubblicious.

1182
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,040
And some Skittles.

1183
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,800
Hell of a night.
I'm going to bed.

1184
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,240
So make yourself at home.

1185
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,240
It's your bed.

1186
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,280
I'll sit down...

1187
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,000
...for a minute.

1188
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,440
Because I'm guarding shit.
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

1189
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,520
I can see things real well, you know...

1190
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,320
...from my peripherals.

1191
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,520
For such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

1192
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,760
...you sure seem rigid about having
a girl in your bed.

1193
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,960
Who?

1194
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,560
Me? Mike Lowrey?
I'm not rigid.

1195
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,400
Comfortable.

1196
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,640
It's my bed.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

1197
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,280
I don't know. I think it's more
than just wired.

1198
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,120
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

1199
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,520
I never really shot a gun before.

1200
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,720
All that steel...

1201
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,720
Don't you feel a little funny?

1202
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,560
I'm not a comedian, but...

1203
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,400
I don't mean that kind of funny,
I mean, like...

1204
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,760
...funny.

1205
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,760
You don't want that.

1206
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,920
You don't want that,
because when I come...

1207
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,600
...I come with thunder.

1208
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,120
And that's...

1209
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,640
You sound like you're saving yourself
for marriage.

1210
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,640
No, that ain't me there.

1211
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,640
That's Marcus.

1212
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,840
You know what I'm saying?
He's the man.

1213
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,040
I got some others--

1214
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,520
I done seen it now.
Turn the page.

1215
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,360
Turn the page.
I done already seen it.

1216
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,720
Don't laugh.

1217
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,280
I cannot believe he wore
his Afro that big.

1218
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,280
- I forgot about that.
- He looked cute like that.

1219
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,800
What's Marcus' wife like?

1220
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,400
She's like a wife.

1221
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,360
I mean, she must be pretty amazing
to keep a guy like Marcus.

1222
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,560
Keep a guy like what?

1223
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,080
You know, watching him tonight,
he's very...

1224
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,920
...sort of take charge.

1225
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,400
The way he was throwing guys
this way and that.

1226
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,120
There's something about him.
I don't know what. He's so smooth.

1227
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,360
Boy...

1228
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,080
...I bet...

1229
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,440
...his wife's enjoying the smoothness
right this minute.

1230
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,240
He got a quality that women respond to.

1231
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,160
I can't imagine the kind of woman
that wouldn't find Marcus...

1232
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,960
...attractive.

1233
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,880
Probably couldn't be around him...

1234
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,520
...just like our situation.

1235
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,200
- If two people were alone--
- Not with a guy like that.

1236
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,400
Excuse me.

1237
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,160
What is wrong with him?

1238
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,200
This one goes on
the bulletin board at work.

1239
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,520
Don't do that, no, come on.

1240
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,280
<i>Put it back in. I can't believe you
took it out.</i>

1241
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,240
Marcus'll kill us if he finds out.
Give it to me.

1242
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,400
<i>I can't believe I let you see it.</i>

1243
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,720
Motherfucker!

1244
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,960
Goddamn it.

1245
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,960
Got some jewelry for you.

1246
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,120
I'm sorry, but damn that.

1247
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,200
We need to address the serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

1248
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,200
Please.

1249
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,360
Is this legal?
I don't think it's legal.

1250
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,600
I won't be long.

1251
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,520
It's legal.

1252
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,080
Out of sight.

1253
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,680
Sanchez, Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1254
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,960
These guys
are about to make a move.

1255
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,200
Blue convertible. Two occupants.
Check it out.

1256
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,320
Here we go.

1257
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,440
Is that our guy?

1258
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,840
Where's the girl?

1259
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,360
I don't see any girl.

1260
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,880
Fuck off, barking-ass dog.
Shut up!

1261
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,280
Sneak up on my own house.

1262
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,200
What in the world?

1263
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,440
Very strange.

1264
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,760
His ass is upstairs.
Supposed to be my boy!

1265
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,120
You motherfucker!

1266
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,440
Ducking and weaving,
up and down.

1267
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,920
Look at this shit.
This is what you want?

1268
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,520
Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.

1269
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,080
No, I ain't going out like that.

1270
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,800
Don't take nobody that long
to get in bed.

1271
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,400
Got my babies in the house.

1272
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,480
The man can't get no quality time...

1273
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,880
...but my partner gets
quality time.

1274
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,080
I don't play that shit.

1275
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,400
Somebody's out there!

1276
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,200
Get the kids. Get the kids!

1277
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,920
I knew it! I didn't
need a psychic.

1278
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,240
Freeze!

1279
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,760
Move, and you're dead.

1280
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,120
They're going to shoot each other.
This is unbelievable.

1281
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,520
Miami Police!
Freeze!

1282
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,240
I am the police!

1283
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,960
What are you doing?

1284
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,040
- You're doing Theresa!
- No, I'm not!

1285
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,600
- You're doing my baby!
- Shut up!

1286
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,640
We could sneak up and
snuff them both right now.

1287
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,200
But we want the girl.

1288
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,480
Never fuck with
a cop's family, asshole.

1289
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,440
- Doesn't that piss you off?
- Yeah.

1290
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,160
Don't get me started.
Out of the car.

1291
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,360
Motherfucker!

1292
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,400
Shit is making you crazy!

1293
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,400
You know it ain't going on between
me and Theresa!

1294
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,600
I've been your partner for six years...

1295
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,640
...and your boy all my life.

1296
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,400
For you to even think...!

1297
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,680
To let dumb shit
like that get in your mind!

1298
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,640
This is me!
What's your problem?

1299
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,320
Fucking...

1300
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,800
I'm just...

1301
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,800
I'm fine!

1302
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,480
Get out of here!
Where's Julie?

1303
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,960
She's in the car, handcuffed
to the steering wheel.

1304
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,040
Are you trying to blow this case?

1305
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,960
My bad.
I ain't had no quality time.

1306
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:43,840
You know how it is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1307
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:48,840
My bad.

1308
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
It's cool.

1309
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,960
Go, go. All right.

1310
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,720
These phone calls were made
to Club Hell from this precinct.

1311
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,520
Explain.

1312
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,440
I'll ask you once more.
Give me a goddamn name!

1313
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,000
- All I know is his name.
- Give it to me.

1314
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,760
You're looking at
a lot of time.

1315
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,880
Fouchet.

1316
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,320
Fouchet, I think.

1317
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,280
That's his whole name?

1318
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,200
I'm just an errand boy.

1319
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,200
Stop. You'll make me cry.

1320
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,000
I swear. Watching the house
was my first gig.

1321
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,440
How sweet.
Does that make you union?

1322
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,840
If you were a real cop...

1323
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,040
...in the field, working every day...

1324
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,960
...you'd realize shit happens.

1325
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,640
Don't give me that!

1326
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,720
You're on your way
to reassignment.

1327
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,160
Who'll reassign me?
You?

1328
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,160
Until you have the authority
to reassign me...

1329
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,880
...stay the hell out of here.

1330
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,280
They should bone
and get it over with.

1331
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,160
I'm getting really tired of this.

1332
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,960
You're tired?

1333
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,920
They're overfed, lazy.
We need video surveillance.

1334
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,520
The guard dogs are nothing.

1335
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,720
Don't make this hard!

1336
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,400
Nice running into you, Jojo.

1337
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,240
Always making it
hard on yourself, Jojo.

1338
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,520
Gee, Julie,
what have you been up to?

1339
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,440
Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels.

1340
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,720
We're looking for someone
to step on some heroin.

1341
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,400
Do it fast and well.
A real pro.

1342
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,560
I told you, I'm
in the rubber business now.

1343
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,120
Jojo, we're not playing, man.

1344
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,120
I'm telling you, I'm straight.

1345
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,320
I'm straight like a board.

1346
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,120
I'm so straight, it's sick.

1347
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,600
It's a lot of dope.
Who could cut it real quick?

1348
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,720
Cut it?
You mean, cut it up?

1349
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,240
I'm sick of this bullshit.

1350
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,920
Bullshit!

1351
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,000
What's up?

1352
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,880
You're pulling a gun on me?

1353
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,280
<i>You're cops! I should
turn you in to Hard Copy.</i>

1354
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,880
Put your ass on TV.

1355
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,000
I got this.

1356
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,680
I got 15 bullets.

1357
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,760
If you don't start talking,
I'll fill you with hot shit.

1358
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,760
He's a former ganja-smoking fucker.

1359
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,680
- He ain't worth it.
- You want some?

1360
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,280
I'll bust your ass too!

1361
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,520
So sad.

1362
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,080
You're on your own.

1363
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,120
What's up?

1364
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,560
I'll tell you...

1365
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,000
...you splatter his ass,
he's no good to us. Fuck that!

1366
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,160
Fuck that! I'm not going down for you
killing Jojo the tire man!

1367
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,160
I don't want no brain fragments
in my clothes! It stinks!

1368
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,160
Fuck that!

1369
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,960
I'll tell you what I know.
I don't know everything about everything.

1370
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,880
Tell him something!

1371
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,920
3 guys.

1372
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,520
They got a laboratory.

1373
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,720
No, no.

1374
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,400
2 guys! One guy died in
a plane crash last year.

1375
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,200
Used to be more!

1376
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,520
No, it's one guy, really.
It's only one guy.

1377
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,400
Don't fuck with me.

1378
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,720
This guy's an Einstein,
genius college boy...

1379
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,600
...egghead motherfucker.
He got glasses.

1380
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,760
His rich parents
live in Coconut Grove.

1381
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,960
Where? Tell him again, Jojo!

1382
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,400
I'll tell you where.

1383
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,320
You'd do that?

1384
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,720
I want to help. Stick that gun down.
I got the address...

1385
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,080
...in the...

1386
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,160
...office.

1387
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,640
Thanks. Why don't you get it?

1388
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,800
Cool.

1389
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,200
- Go.
- Now?

1390
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,560
Now's good. Now is real good.

1391
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,960
This is on me.

1392
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,960
Why don't you pick out
some white walls? A gift from me to you.

1393
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,520
You made me think
you were going to shoot me.

1394
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,880
I was.

1395
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,760
When's this punk-ass chemist
coming home?

1396
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,720
This is a stakeout.

1397
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,520
Not what I imagined.

1398
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,320
Thought there'd be more conversation.

1399
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,080
Sorry, it's not up to your...

1400
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,880
...usual high standards.

1401
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,760
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

1402
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,520
What is it?
Too much caffeine?

1403
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,200
Not enough sex?

1404
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,440
I can't believe she went there.

1405
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,240
You don't know who
you talking to?

1406
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,640
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1407
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,520
King Ding-a-ling.

1408
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,920
Why don't you whip it out for her?

1409
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,040
Yeah, right on your forehead.

1410
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,360
Shut up.

1411
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,680
There he is!
Let's go!

1412
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,520
- Let's go!
- I'm on him!

1413
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,680
What are our chances?

1414
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,720
Remember Club Hell?

1415
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,080
Worse.

1416
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:06,400
That's it. Call major backup.
I want swimming ducks in here.

1417
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,800
Hold it.

1418
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,280
Sinclair tapped the phones.
We must do that in person.

1419
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,800
By the time we do that...

1420
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,520
...every junkie in America
will be high off our bust.

1421
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,720
Can we help you?

1422
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,560
I staked out all night
in that jalopy too. I earned a peek.

1423
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,880
<i>This is real cop stuff, okay?
Not Charlie's Angels.</i>

1424
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,320
Can't hurt for her to take a peek.

1425
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,280
It can't? If they fire a bullet over
here, it'll hurt!

1426
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,800
We have guests.

1427
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,840
Have them followed.
Call me with their location.

1428
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,680
<i>This high-speed chase, ending
near River and 34th Streets...</i>

1429
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,480
<i>...was captured 2 nights ago
by our news team.</i>

1430
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,000
Mom!

1431
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,880
I thought you said Daddy was in
Cleveland. Can't be.

1432
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,680
No. Your daddy just wishes
he was in Cleveland.

1433
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,600
I'm telling you, this Fouchet,
he's slick.

1434
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,640
FBI, DEA, they got nothing on him.

1435
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,200
But he got to deal with us today.

1436
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,080
What's that?

1437
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,520
That's the last time they handcuff me.

1438
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,200
That's what.

1439
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,840
Good boy.

1440
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,640
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

1441
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,880
All visitors must be announced!

1442
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,520
Pisses me off!

1443
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,520
Lady! Lady!

1444
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,040
When you get back,
this'll be over, right?

1445
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,560
You got that right.

1446
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,800
Now don't worry.
You'll be set free.

1447
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,040
Cut loose.

1448
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,920
You'll be back to your own life.

1449
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,880
No more handcuffs.

1450
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,440
- I'm out of here.
- That's Chet with my veggie burger.

1451
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,720
- Move your ass.
- You got it.

1452
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,880
Hi, can I help you?

1453
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,000
I'm here to kill
my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1454
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,880
The tall one,
or the short one?

1455
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,280
The short one.

1456
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,440
Thought so.

1457
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,080
Is Chet ringing--

1458
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,840
Oh, babe!

1459
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,400
Let me get your husband.

1460
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,280
Get over here.

1461
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,520
I know what it looks like.
Did you get my message?

1462
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,800
Can you...

1463
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,440
...leave me and...

1464
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,480
...Mrs. Burnett alone?

1465
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,240
Right.

1466
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,240
Y'all met?

1467
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,000
Baby...

1468
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,760
I know-- Let me--

1469
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:17,080
As far as I'm concerned, keep the
wedding ring in your pocket...

1470
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,920
...because you, your girlfriend...

1471
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,640
Oh, shit.

1472
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,720
...and Mike will be
very happy living here.

1473
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,680
Sweetie! Sweetie, honey!

1474
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,360
No, no, I saw it on the news.

1475
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,000
That shit's slanted.

1476
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,800
You're no longer welcome to my house.

1477
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,720
He didn't tell you
I was coming in early?

1478
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,960
Remember, I said call,
and that you'd bring me here?

1479
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,040
Tell her what I told you?

1480
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,840
You'd bring me here--

1481
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,840
I ain't even going to--

1482
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,600
We're not arguing.

1483
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,080
I'm raising my--

1484
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,720
All right-- Baby!

1485
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,440
We wanted to tell you.

1486
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:05,320
It really doesn't matter, Mike, Kojak--
whatever your name is.

1487
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,800
I'll tell you something else:

1488
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:11,840
If his wife can find us,
I'm better off on my own.

1489
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,280
This...

1490
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,200
I can see how it'd look a trip.

1491
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,040
You see me, I run out,
I got a shirt open.

1492
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,960
You see Mike half-naked.

1493
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,080
Then you see the white girl.

1494
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:27,320
It looks like we having an orgy,
and ain't nobody humped.

1495
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,840
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

1496
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,600
It's not what it looks like, okay?

1497
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,160
Baby, she's a material witness.

1498
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,720
That's real!

1499
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,520
Baby, Theresa, listen.

1500
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,240
It was orders.
Listen, it was orders.

1501
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:47,520
Can I talk to you?
Can you stop so I can talk to you?

1502
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:51,000
Enough smooth shit, Mike.
It's not going to work anymore.

1503
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,920
I don't care!

1504
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,360
Duck!

1505
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,760
Julie, get down!

1506
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,040
Get down!

1507
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,560
Get out!

1508
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,200
911!

1509
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,240
911? Chet here.

1510
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,520
Go upstairs and take this!
Take it!

1511
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,440
I'll keep everyone calm
until my backup comes.

1512
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,160
I love you.

1513
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,120
I forgot to give the address!

1514
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,240
Go, go, go!

1515
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,400
Watch out!

1516
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,000
Keep going!

1517
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,360
Get her in!

1518
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,120
Move!

1519
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,320
It's okay.

1520
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,280
I'm with the police. It's cool.
You look great.

1521
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,200
Drive!

1522
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,280
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

1523
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:53,960
<i>What is it with you?</i>

1524
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,280
How come it always has to be
good news/bad news?

1525
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,720
You know where the dope is, but you lose
our witness.

1526
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,160
I don't get it!

1527
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,480
Telephone!

1528
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:10,000
I'm keeping your friend for 4
hours, until I make my deal.

1529
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,440
And I will make it.

1530
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,360
I just put a bullet in the chemist...

1531
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,160
...who fucked with my timetable.

1532
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,360
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

1533
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,040
Son of a bitch!

1534
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,360
That twisted motherfucker
shot one of his employees.

1535
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,920
Says if we don't back up,
he'll kill Julie.

1536
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,200
Not now!

1537
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,800
I told you to play by the rules.

1538
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,400
I'm on the verge of solving this case!

1539
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,800
I've finally got the authority
to shut you down.

1540
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,600
You're all reassigned.

1541
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,200
This guy is painting me into a corner.

1542
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,480
We won't let the girl die.

1543
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,800
We're not walking away.
I don't care what she says.

1544
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,000
The deal goes down in 4 hours.

1545
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:00,000
You got 2 hours to find them.

1546
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,760
It's time to get lucky.

1547
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,360
Go do what you got to do.

1548
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:11,680
You told us that this thing would
move a little quicker.

1549
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,400
It's not that easy.
If it was, you'd be doing it.

1550
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,320
Work your magic.
You say you're a computer whiz.

1551
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,480
Back off! I'm doing an illegal
favor for you.

1552
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,640
This is what I went to jail for.

1553
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,160
So you back up off me.

1554
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,360
You don't sit your lanky ass down...

1555
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,840
...bottom line,
I will knock you out.

1556
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,080
What's wrong with you?

1557
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,560
- Can you have a seat?
- You said I'd get out of jail.

1558
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,320
And I wasn't lying.

1559
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,760
Cops are so dumb. Look.

1560
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,120
Remember, you promised
to get me out.

1561
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,160
Eddie Dominguez.

1562
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,880
There it is.

1563
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,720
Girlfriend?

1564
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,840
It was New Year's Eve,
and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

1565
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,800
...and this French guy...

1566
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,840
...they took some
horrible pictures of me.

1567
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:14,240
They said...

1568
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:18,320
...they'd post them
at my kid's school...

1569
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,400
...unless I gave them
narcotics information.

1570
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,120
But I never, never gave them you...

1571
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,600
...or the girl.

1572
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,200
They got her.
We need to get them now.

1573
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,200
If we don't, she's dead.
How do you make contact?

1574
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,360
I have their mobile-phone number.

1575
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,880
I know, I'm sorry.

1576
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,920
I'll make it up to you.
I will.

1577
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,160
We don't have time. Let's go.

1578
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,840
You have sexy ears, you know that?

1579
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,440
I want to lick them.

1580
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,520
Can I speak to Romeo?

1581
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,640
There's no Romeo here, asshole.

1582
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,200
What're you laughing at?

1583
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,800
This cellphone will triangulate him,
no matter where he goes.

1584
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,200
We watch the map until he stops.

1585
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,880
The signal's still strong.

1586
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:14,960
Come on.

1587
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,640
Thank you.

1588
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,920
Lucy was the queen, baby.
Think about it.

1589
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,160
Lucille Ball was a bimbo.

1590
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,040
- Desi was the brains behind it.
- How can you say that?

1591
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,160
What do you mean?

1592
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,640
Take the bongos away, he's nothing.

1593
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,040
It's conga!

1594
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,760
Yo, fellas, what's up?

1595
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,040
The fucking pencil squad.

1596
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,720
Are we on traffic duty?

1597
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,320
No, this is real.
We got something for you.

1598
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,720
You could get killed.

1599
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,920
Let's go.

1600
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,080
It's Conrad.

1601
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,000
I'm calling in a favor.

1602
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,320
Eastbound towards 135th Street.

1603
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,000
Northeast, go northeast.

1604
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,800
If I'm wrong, you can fire me.

1605
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,800
This is what I need:

1606
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:20,520
I need a SWAT team, helicopters.
We're calling all cars.

1607
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,960
Only I don't know where I need them.

1608
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,800
Nice car.

1609
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,200
Oh, yeah.

1610
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,000
That's my toy.

1611
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,400
I'm taking it with me
for my collection.

1612
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,640
And how about the wire transfers?

1613
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,800
Two wire transfers to your banks...

1614
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,000
...totaling 180 million dollars.

1615
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,800
And 20 in cash.

1616
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,040
Damn.

1617
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,560
This has been a shitty week.

1618
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,440
Getting full integration on that signal.

1619
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,240
We're on the airfield now.

1620
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,480
I bet it's up in the old hangar section.

1621
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,360
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1622
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
Deposit confirmation requested.

1623
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,520
$90 million, Geldersbank of Zurich.

1624
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,560
No easy approach.

1625
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,240
No time.
Fuck the backup.

1626
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,720
We must go now.

1627
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,200
Not a problem.

1628
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,080
You got an itch?
I'd love to scratch it.

1629
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,560
- Scratch this.
- I'll scratch whatever you want.

1630
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,160
Did you go to college?

1631
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,440
Thank you.

1632
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,800
- You sure you want to do this?
- Let's go!

1633
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,520
Tuck in your skirt.

1634
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,440
My shit always works sometimes.

1635
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,120
This is the best you can buy.
Nice doing business with you.

1636
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,160
Oh, shit.

1637
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,920
It's a setup!

1638
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,400
If I get killed,
I'm fucking you up!

1639
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,560
Goddamn it, go!

1640
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,000
Go, goddamn it!

1641
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,720
My God!

1642
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,600
Get down!

1643
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,760
You forgot your boarding pass!

1644
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,840
You motherfuckers!

1645
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:57,920
What's up?

1646
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,600
Shit!

1647
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,080
Let's go!

1648
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,840
Get in the car!

1649
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,840
Get in, Mike! Come on!

1650
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:02,680
Get in!

1651
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,360
Get in the car!

1652
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,680
This shit's going to blow!

1653
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,200
Get up!

1654
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,280
Shit! Please, catch that motherfucker,
he shot me.

1655
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,080
He shot me!

1656
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:38,240
I'm fine. I just had a run-in
with Jim Brown over here.

1657
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,320
He steals our shit...

1658
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,600
...kidnaps Julie...

1659
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,200
...shoots at my wife.
We beat him down!

1660
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,320
Marcus, I just got
one question for you.

1661
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,600
How can you leave me at a gunfight
to get the car?!

1662
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,960
Shut up and let him drive.

1663
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,000
Getting shot improved
your driving skills.

1664
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,680
You got the right to remain silent.

1665
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:19,640
Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law.

1666
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,800
What're you doing?

1667
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,000
Getting it out the way.

1668
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,640
Punch it!

1669
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:40,960
What if his car's faster?

1670
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,080
It's not!

1671
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:45,640
It'll be one or the other!
It'll be him or it'll be us!

1672
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,720
You better win!

1673
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,440
You better win!

1674
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,960
That's how you're supposed to drive!

1675
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,840
From now on, that's how you drive!

1676
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,600
Freeze!

1677
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,960
He ain't worth killing.

1678
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,640
Freeze!

1679
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,120
Bet when your punk-ass
woke up this morning...

1680
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,960
...you didn't think by 5:00
you'd have a hole in your leg.

1681
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,120
You couldn't kill me,
you chickenshit, could you?

1682
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,720
I could.
You're talking like it's over.

1683
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,280
I'm just pausing.

1684
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,760
I'm getting the hang of this
marksman shit.

1685
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:47,760
Shooting them from 30 yards
while they run, that's not it.

1686
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,040
Here's where it is.

1687
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,400
Up close and personal.

1688
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1689
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:56,680
Would you do it?

1690
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:58,600
Step off!

1691
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:01,240
Do it!

1692
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,360
Do it!

1693
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,320
It's over.

1694
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,160
He's a joke.

1695
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,440
He's a motherfucking joke.

1696
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,440
<i>I ever tell you I love you, man?</i>

1697
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,720
<i>You always be getting emotional
after a gunfight.</i>

1698
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,080
<i>Because I'm glad we survived.</i>

1699
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,760
<i>Shit.</i>

1700
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:01,680
I love you too.

1701
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,800
Don't be looking at me. I love you.
I said that shit.

1702
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:06,960
You my boy!

1703
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,760
No, no, you like my brother, man.

1704
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,440
So what am I?

1705
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,680
Julie, sweetie, you...

1706
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,760
You're a little dangerous.

1707
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,800
See, you like a magnet
for random gunfire.

1708
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,160
But you're cool.

1709
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,440
You're down.

1710
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,760
So what's next?

1711
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,120
See...

1712
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,400
...there won't be no next.

1713
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,120
You wanted Mike Lowrey...

1714
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,480
...you got him.

1715
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,000
That's Mike.

1716
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,360
Old Mike Lowrey.

1717
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:49,080
I'm going home to my wife
to get my quality time.

1718
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,120
Stop playing, man.

1719
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,920
I've been beat 3 times out here.

1720
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,960
I'm cool, I don't need no help.
Back up.

1721
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:02,160
Why're you going home to your wife?
Your dick probably don't work.

1722
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,640
Do you have the keys?

1723
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,000
Mike wanted me to go
to this gunfight, then...

1724
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,560
Well, then
there was this witness...

1725
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,120
My man!

1726
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:14,960
You let me out of here?

1727
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:18,800
- I don't got the keys.
- What do you mean you don't have keys?!

1728
01:50:43,401 --> 01:54:02,601
