SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,510
<i>- Nice!
- An ideaI famiIy portrait...</i>

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,676
<i>Look into the camera, pIease.</i>

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,633
Great!
How about giving us a smile?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,471
<i>Let's see some happy faces.
You too, Mother... Great!</i>

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,116
Mind your hair! There we have it.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,710
- That should do it, right?
- Yes, l think so.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,675
- We've finished with the girls.
- You've been so good!

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,679
- Bye-bye!
- They were good as gold...

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,078
How about some shots
of the parents on the sofa?

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,239
Lean forward, you're sliding
too far back. That's it!

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,799
- l'll try and make myself small.
- Talk to each other.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,275
Marianne, turn your eyes
slightly towards us...

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,475
Look as if you were fond
of each other... There, like that.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,716
Hold that pose! Great....

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,150
- That's it. Thank you very much.
- Good!

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,591
We'll need some portraits later.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,796
Well then, let's start, shall we?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,516
l always begin with a standard
question, to soothe the nerves.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,635
- l'm not particularly nervous.
- Good. The question is:

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,151
How would you describe
yourselves in a few words?

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,353
- That's not an easy one.
- Not all that difficult, surely?

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,552
- l may be misunderstood.
- Really?

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,355
lt may sound conceited to say
l'm highly intelligent, youthful,

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,191
successful, sensible, sexy and
l care about the world we live in.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,156
l'm educated, well-read
and a good mixer. Let's see...

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,319
l'm a good friend even to people
who are worse off than myself.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,754
l'm good at sports.
l'm a good husband and a good son.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,554
l have no debts and l pay my taxes.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,389
l respect our government,
no matter what it does.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,592
l love our royal family.
l've left the state church.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,598
- Shall l go on?
- Please.

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,635
- l'm a splendid lover.
- Perhaps we can skip that question.

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,639
What about you, Marianne?

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,114
Well, what shall l say?

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,918
l'm married to Johan
and l have two daughters...

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,069
- That's all l can think of...
- Come on, think harder.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,996
- l think Johan is awfully nice...
- How kind of you.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,559
- We've been married for 10 years.
- We've just renewed our contract.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,755
Unlike Johan, l lack the ability
to see myself in such glowing terms,

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,794
but in all honesty, l'm glad
l'm able to lead the life l do.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,993
lt's a good life,
if you know what l mean.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,069
What else? My, this is difficult...

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,559
- She has a nice figure.
- l'm trying to be serious.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,429
- l have two girls, Karin and Eva.
- You've already said that.

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,759
How about some personal data?
Let's start with your ages.

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,874
- l'm 42, but l don't look it.
- l'm 35.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,038
Both of us come from
obscenely middle-class homes.

49
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,111
- Johan's father is a doctor.
- And my mother is the motherly type.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,152
My father is a lawyer.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,750
lt was decided from the outset
that l was to be a lawyer too.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,034
l'm the youngest of seven children.
Mother ran a big household.

53
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,278
- Nowadays, she takes it easy.
- Oh, does she?

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,554
Oddly enough, we get on with our
parents. We see a lot of each other.

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,879
There's never been
any friction to speak of.

56
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,958
Let's talk about your professions.

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,919
Mine is a bit unusual.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,590
l'm an associate professor
at the lnstitute of Psychotechnology.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,476
Family law is my specialty. l belong
to a large firm of solicitors.

60
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,036
Most of my work concerns divorce,
but the interesting thing is...

61
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,276
Hold that pose!

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,270
Take a picture, l want
to capture that expression. Good!

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,439
- My, l feel so...
- lt will pass.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,396
- Tell me, how did you meet?
- l'll leave that to Johan.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,879
- Lord, that is interesting!
- lt wasn't love at first sight.

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,110
We both had a large circle of friends
and ran into each other often.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,472
We were also both involved
in politics for several years

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,311
and we went in for amateur
dramatics quite a lot as students.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,673
Well, l can't say we made any
deeper impression on each other.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,837
Marianne thought l was stuck-up.

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,039
Johan had a rather highly publicized
affair with a pop singer...

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,632
..which gave him a certain image
and made him insufferable.

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,797
Marianne was 19.

74
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,595
She was married to a fool whose
only saving grace was a rich father.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,668
He was very kind
and l was madly in love with him.

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,999
Besides, l got pregnant
early on in the relationship.

77
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,829
- But how was it that...
- That the two of us joined forces?

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,351
That was actually Marianne's idea.

79
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,438
My baby died soon after birth

80
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,678
and my husband and l divorced,
to our mutual relief.

81
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,714
And Johan's singer
had given him his walking papers.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,197
We were both a bit hurt and lonely,

83
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,756
so l suggested making a go of it.

84
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,750
We weren't in love at all,
but we were both downhearted.

85
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,430
And then we found out
that we got along very well

86
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,679
and we really
buckled down to our studies.

87
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,354
We moved in together, a situation
our mothers actually took in their stride.

88
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,791
ln fact, they became good friends.

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,795
We were accepted
as Johan and Marianne.

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,275
After six months we got married.

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,757
- By then we were in love as well.
- Very much so!

92
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,795
- We were seen as an ideal couple.
- And that's still the case.

93
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,710
- No complications?
- We've never had material worries.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,516
We're on good terms with friends
and relations on both sides.

95
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,918
We have good jobs that we enjoy.
We're healthy.

96
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,389
And so on, to an almost vulgar
degree. Security, order, loyalty...

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,150
We're almost indecently lucky.

98
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,193
Naturally, we have our differences,
just like other people.

99
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,436
But we agree on all the key issues.

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,917
- Don't you ever quarrel?
- Marianne does.

101
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,875
Johan is very slow to anger,
so l run out of steam.

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,391
This all sounds wonderful. All of it.

103
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,797
Only last night someone was saying

104
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,312
that the very lack of problems
is a serious problem.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,639
We are well aware that
a life like ours can be dangerous.

106
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,993
How do you mean, dangerous?

107
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,637
The world is going to hell. l claim
the right to mind my own business.

108
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,876
Live and let live, that's my motto.

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,631
lt sickens me
to hear about the latest panacea.

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,357
- l don't agree with Johan.
- So, what's your opinion?

111
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,510
- l believe in compassion.
- Please elaborate on that.

112
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,716
lf people learned to care
about each other in childhood,

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,434
the world
would be a different place.

114
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,349
Hold that pose!
Look into the camera, please.

115
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,792
Listen to this:

116
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,870
"Marianne's eyes, blue as an old
folk song, are lit up from within.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,675
When asked how she copes
with a job and a household,

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,349
she smiles with shy delight

119
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,317
and replies that she and Johan
help each other." That's true.

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,511
"'We understand each other,'
she says,

121
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,315
brightening as Johan sits down
beside her on their heirloom sofa.

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,833
He puts a protective arm around her
and she snuggles up to him."

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,669
- Hey!
- This is the best bit!

124
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,272
"So l leave, noticing that they
seem pleased at the prospect

125
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,836
that they can once more
be alone together.

126
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,638
Two people who have matured:
strong, happy and positive.

127
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,313
People who have never forgotten
to give love pride of place."

128
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,673
- We almost died when we read it.
- l was going to file a complaint.

129
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,350
But our mothers and our daughters
simply loved the article.

130
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,996
What really riles me is that
it says nothing about my eyes.

131
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,479
- lsn't there a secret glow in them?
- They're more like dark pools.

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,153
- Very sexy, actually.
- Katarina has a crush on you.

133
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,797
- Johan, will you elope with me?
- A change would do Johan good.

134
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,755
He's been so good for 10 years
and has never been unfaithful.

135
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,873
Are you sure?

136
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,869
l believe everything Johan says.

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,109
- Did you hear that, Katarina?
- Johan is a better liar than you.

138
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,392
- But l have no imagination.
- That's just it.

139
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,994
- lt makes you a better liar.
- Peter tarts up his stories.

140
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,918
At times l really find it touching.

141
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,957
<i>l read your article in TechnicaI Times.
Even l could understand it.</i>

142
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,392
- Actually, Katarina wrote it.
- Are you that clever?

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,196
You see, l was in Germany and
they wanted an article on the spot.

144
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,438
So Katarina wrote it
and read it to me on the phone.

145
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,430
- But why did it have your by-line?
- lt's not discrimination.

146
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,996
- We collaborate.
- That's admirable.

147
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,840
You wouldn't say that
if you knew the details.

148
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,671
Things are rotten between us.
Cheers, Katarina, my poppet!

149
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,234
Cheers...

150
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,154
Does it bother you that l speak
freely to Johan and Marianne?

151
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,191
- What is it, Katarina?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

152
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,631
Only Peter can be
so damn clumsy sometimes.

153
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,550
Clumsy is the right word...

154
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,469
l take pride in being clumsy...
and imaginative.

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,558
The funny thing
is that according to Katarina,

156
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,515
l am nothing
but a spineless jellyfish.

157
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,032
- Jellyfish? Now you're talking.
- Let's try to enjoy ourselves now.

158
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,598
Exactly, because we mustn't forget...

159
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,553
l'm making a thank-you speech now.

160
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,991
Bearing in mind
that fabulous magazine article

161
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,718
reminding us
that we are in a happy home

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,916
that we must not soil
with emotional rubbish.

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,117
Cheers, Marianne!

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,358
l may not envy your domestic bliss...

165
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,077
..but l envy
your talent as a cook.

166
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,554
No, l really mean that.

167
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,868
l wish Katarina
would learn to cook like that.

168
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,549
Katarina is a much better cook.

169
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,789
- Peter says l poison the food.
- lt's a standing joke in our house.

170
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,712
- Right, it's obviously a joke.
- One that's seen better days.

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,074
Well, let's go into
the drawing room and have coffee.

172
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,671
Well, Johan, what am l to do?

173
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,997
l've put my foot in it again.

174
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,158
The girls will clear the table.

175
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,920
- lt's all too bloody touching.
- What is?

176
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,071
Your marriage.

177
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,918
Johan and Marianne...

178
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,510
lt can move a person to tears.

179
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,988
ln fact, it makes you want to stick
a pin into your beautiful balloon.

180
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,239
- So would you?
- Cheers to you both!

181
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,992
- lt's been 10 years, right?
- We just had our 10th anniversary.

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,432
- No skeletons in the cupboard?
- You never know.

183
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,874
- Both Johan and l like tidying up.
- You hear that, Katarina?

184
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,188
That's where you and l have been
remiss... We never clean things up.

185
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,636
But next week l'll call Marianne
and make an appointment,

186
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,276
so she can get started
on our divorce.

187
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,559
Peter will have changed his mind
by the time he's sober.

188
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,549
That's when the calculator
starts running.

189
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,957
This is what he says:
"l'll agree to a divorce,

190
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,358
if Katarina gives up her claim
to our assets in Switzerland."

191
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,792
And my reply is:
"But it's my money, l've earned it."

192
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,674
Then Peter
will say he has multiplied it

193
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,635
and l can have the whole factory.

194
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,072
Then l say, "that's nice of you
to let me have a factory in ltaly -

195
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,875
that gets more risky
with every rise in labour costs."

196
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,233
- But Katarina, l've said...
- "Take the whole set-up in Sweden.

197
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,910
The apartment, the country house,
the boat, the car,

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,079
the shares and the premium
bonds." lsn't that nice?

199
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,273
l get all the taxable stuff!

200
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,788
Excuse me for going on
about such trivial matters,

201
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,029
but when Peter gets started on
assets, l know how drunk he is.

202
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,996
- And the insults aren't far off.
- That's what l've said all along.

203
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,356
Katarina is a businessman,
with equal stress on both words.

204
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,916
A businessman...

205
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,637
ln addition to which,
she's a brilliant artist

206
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,550
and she has
an lQ of l don't know what.

207
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,832
She's attractive as well.

208
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,114
She's a paragon,
and gift-wrapped to boot.

209
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,871
How l ever got lucky with that
monster of perfection is a mystery.

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,596
l really think we'll ring for a taxi
and go home now.

211
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,350
This can't be pleasant
for Johan and Marianne...

212
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,119
No... Johan and Marianne?

213
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,676
They're candy figurines
decorated with red ribbons.

214
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,190
Just like the marzipan pigs
of our childhood.

215
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,398
lt's good for their moral fibre,

216
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,549
to gaze
into the bottomless pits of hell.

217
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,312
August Strindberg

218
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,875
once wrote:

219
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,869
"ls there anything more fearsome

220
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,029
than a husband and wife
who hate each other?"

221
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,039
What do you say?
Maybe child abuse is even worse.

222
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,190
But then Katarina and l are children.

223
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,474
Deep down, Katarina
is a little girl who is crying

224
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,194
because she has fallen down

225
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,711
and no one comforts her.

226
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,678
And l haven't grown up either.

227
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,114
l cry
because Katarina can't love me,

228
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,710
in spite of my bad behaviour.

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,309
There's one thing to be grateful for.

230
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,673
That there is nothing
more hellish than this.

231
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,589
That's why we're ready for a divorce.

232
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,440
Provided you listen to reason.

233
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,678
Provided we simultaneously,

234
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,428
in each other's presence

235
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,157
and in front of reliable witnesses,
sign all the papers.

236
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,069
So no one can stiff the other.

237
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,989
- We'll call you up this week.
- We have a great business lawyer.

238
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,716
Borglund can help you
with the financial arrangements.

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,399
What do you say?

240
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,549
Even if we agree on money matters,
you'll never let me go.

241
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,432
l'm convinced of that.

242
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,795
You think you're that bloody
indispensable, my dear Katarina?

243
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,079
Whatever gave you that idea?

244
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,636
Do tell me... Tell us.

245
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,275
You force me to have sex,

246
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,357
since you can't get it up
with other women.

247
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,556
Your need of a guilty conscience
knows no bounds.

248
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,279
Now that it's all over with Jan
l expect you're in a panic.

249
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,439
You're stuck with old Peter.

250
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,917
He has the right patience.

251
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,873
So you think
you're the only one, do you?

252
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,874
How touching...

253
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,677
You think there are no others.

254
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,916
Let me tell you one thing, Peter...

255
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,237
Please excuse me
if l'm rather outspoken,

256
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,594
but Peter is asking for it
and he needs to be enlightened.

257
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,235
l'll tell you this, Peter...

258
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,308
You nauseate me so much...

259
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,478
..in a physical sense...

260
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,231
that l'd buy myself a lay just
to wash you out of my sex organs.

261
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,674
"Abide with me,
fast falls the eventide

262
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,955
The darkness deepens,
Lord with me abide..."

263
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,514
You son of a bitch!

264
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:54,114
"When other helpers fail
and comforts flee

265
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,953
Help of the helpless,
Oh, abide with me."

266
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,312
Whatever
that's supposed to mean...

267
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,157
l hope there won't
be any stains on the carpet.

268
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,432
l don't know about liqueur...

269
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,233
Why don't you bill me?

270
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,397
Do as l say!

271
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,679
Would you mind
pouring me a cup of coffee?

272
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,552
l'm pretty sloshed.

273
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,758
Forgive us.
We don't usually behave like this.

274
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,918
But you're our best friends.

275
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,674
You're our only friends.

276
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,071
Forgive me... Forgive us.

277
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,435
lf you ring for a cab,

278
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,439
l'll take my bacchante home

279
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,678
and we'll finish our little scene.

280
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,478
The finale is usually
not suitable for an audience.

281
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,790
- What's the time?
- Ten past twelve.

282
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,471
- Thank goodness we got rid of them.
- Yes, things got a bit out of hand.

283
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,548
Do you believe it's possible
for a couple to be partners for life?

284
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,796
lt's an absurd convention.

285
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,548
Marriage should
be a five-year contract.

286
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,277
- Or be subject to annual renewal.
- What about us?

287
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,190
No, we're the exception
that proves the rule.

288
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,270
- So you think we'll stay together?
- What a funny question.

289
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,632
Are you ever sorry
you can't sleep with anyone else?

290
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,592
- No, are you?
- At times.

291
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,111
- Well, l'll be damned!
- lt's a purely theoretical longing.

292
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,791
l wonder if there's something wrong
with me, l never feel like that.

293
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,631
- l'm content.
- So am l. Now l've got it!

294
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,959
Katarina and Peter go through hell
because they don't communicate.

295
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,438
They have to translate everything
they mean into a common language.

296
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,919
- l think it's simpler than that.
- We understand each other instantly.

297
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,034
We speak the same language,
that's why we're doing fine.

298
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,673
l think it's the money.

299
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,795
lf you speak the same language,
money is not an issue.

300
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,198
- You and your languages.
- l see it all the time at work.

301
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,471
Sometimes it's as if the couple

302
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,469
are talking on bad telephone lines.

303
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,197
Sometimes it's like listening to
two pre-programmed tape recorders

304
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,995
and sometimes it's
the utter silence of outer space.

305
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,750
- l don't know which is the worst.
- l don't know...

306
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,238
Supposing the kids went to day care
while we worked shifts at a factory?

307
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,954
- lt wouldn't matter.
- l think it would.

308
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,789
lf you speak the same language,
it doesn't matter where you are.

309
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,877
That's a romantic view.

310
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,029
Do you think our relationship would
suffer if we lived that kind of life?

311
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,269
- Yes, l do. Seriously.
- lt would diminish our relationship?

312
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,994
Regardless of our language.

313
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,876
lsn't the danger of estrangement
just as great in the life we lead?

314
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,276
Definitely not.

315
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,997
Hard, tedious labour exposes
people to much greater strain.

316
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,479
You're sillier than l thought
and you're taking the romantic view.

317
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,716
- We'll see.
- What? What will we see?

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,913
- l don't know, do you?
- Are you teasing me?

319
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,475
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes, terribly.

320
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,117
How about
some beer and sandwiches?

321
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
Sounds marvellous.

322
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,997
THE ART OF SWEEPING
MATTERS UNDER THE RUG

323
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,588
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

324
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,077
- Did you sleep well?
- Like a log and you?

325
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,957
Well, l woke up at 5 o'clock
and couldn't get back to sleep again.

326
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,038
- Why not?
- l got all worked up.

327
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,073
- Should l feel guilty?
- No.

328
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,069
For once you're not to blame, dear.

329
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,035
l lay fuming about
that wretched Sunday dinner.

330
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,756
We always have Sunday dinner
with your parents or mine.

331
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,395
- lt's absurd.
- lt's for their sake.

332
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,434
- l'm going to cancel dinner.
- Cancel it?

333
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,599
- What will your mother say?
- Whatever she damned well likes.

334
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,031
l want to spend Sunday
with you and the kids.

335
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,517
- Well, if you can swing that...!
- l certainly can!

336
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,916
l'm fed up...

337
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,988
- ls it the curse?
- You always say that!

338
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,796
Even if my period's due on Monday,
that may not be why l'm edgy.

339
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,389
- What's wrong?
- Has it ever struck you

340
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,549
that our life is mapped out and
every last second is accounted for?

341
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,792
- But we have our vacations.
- They're even more scheduled.

342
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,755
- Aren't you going to wake the girls?
- They're sleeping in today.

343
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,035
Karin has the day off from school
and Eva has a sore throat.

344
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,919
She needs to come along on Sunday
to spare us from nagging!

345
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,590
- You were going to cancel dinner.
- l'd rather you did it.

346
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,792
Oh no, l'm not making
excuses to your mother!

347
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,674
Aren't you going to call your mother?
She's an early bird.

348
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,750
- Didn't we agree you would call?
- No, dear.

349
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,316
l'll hold your hand in moral support.

350
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,235
All right, l'll do it...

351
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,395
- My, my heart's pounding!
- The first sign of the great revolt.

352
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,590
No answer? What a relief!

353
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,158
Hello. Miss Alm? ls my mother in?

354
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,510
May l have a word with her?

355
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,315
How is your knee, by the way?

356
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,989
Oh, it's not any better?

357
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,559
lt's worse? That's too bad...
What does the doctor say?

358
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,152
He's not sympathetic, you say?
lt's a sign of the times.

359
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,350
Hello, Mother. How are you?

360
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,349
Now isn't that nice.
Has Dad left yet?

361
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,710
Right, he was going to the country.

362
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,675
So you let him go off
on his own like that?

363
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,714
Oh, Erik is with him. That's good.

364
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,471
l'm sorry, but there's
something l have to tell you...

365
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,751
Exactly, how did you guess?

366
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,396
What reasons do we have?

367
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,798
l simply want to spend Sunday
with Johan and the girls.

368
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,117
No, we're not going anywhere.

369
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,196
We just don't
want to come over for dinner.

370
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,632
l don't think for a moment that dad
was looking forward to Sunday.

371
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,479
lt should be a pleasure
and not a duty, right?

372
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,639
Yes, l see. l see.

373
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,993
You hadn't told me that bit of news.

374
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,193
Bored stiff, to be quite honest.

375
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,150
No, forget all about it, Mother.

376
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,635
We'll be there.

377
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,148
Yes, we'll manage. lt's fine.

378
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,000
We're looking forward to it.

379
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,193
Bye for now, Mother dear.

380
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,635
The revolution
was smothered at birth.

381
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,512
Aunt Elsa is coming

382
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,870
and she was so
looking forward to seeing us.

383
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,357
- She has a present for you.
- And Mrs Danielsson is cooking.

384
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,030
- And your dad longed to see us.
- Damnation!

385
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,869
l admire your courage all the same.
We'll say no another time.

386
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,435
Don't be upset.

387
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,154
- Will you be home for dinner?
- No, meet me at the theatre.

388
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,352
Don't you like
coming home any more?

389
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,110
My, aren't we in a fine mood today?

390
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,517
l'd love to stay in bed for a week,

391
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,916
so we could just hold each other.

392
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,796
- And we'd both have a good cry.
- That's not the life we chose.

393
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,470
lf only l could be sure
we chose it and not our mothers.

394
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,752
You're suffering from
a maternal persecution complex.

395
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,919
- Did you want a life like this?
- No.

396
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,875
What if we started
cheating on each other?

397
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,718
What would you do then?

398
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,153
Kill you, of course.

399
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,228
- Sometimes l wish...
- What?

400
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,318
Nothing...

401
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,475
- Wait a second, l'll come with you.
- Why not take your own car?

402
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,910
We can go home together
after the play.

403
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,399
- What about the girls?
- l'll ask Miss Andersson to cook.

404
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,752
She makes fabulous pancakes.
l'll go wake the girls.

405
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,033
- But l'm in a hurry.
- lt'll only take a minute.

406
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,992
While l remember it,
please pay your parking tickets.

407
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,273
- There's a whole pile here.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,997
l'll see you tonight at the theatre.

409
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,790
Hello? Yes, speaking.

410
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,436
Hello, Mother. The line is bad,
l didn't recognise your voice.

411
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,349
l'm fine, how are you?

412
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,313
You're worried. Now, why is that?

413
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,273
Marianne's mother called

414
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,949
and she's worried as well, you say.

415
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,878
Good Lord...

416
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,039
No, Marianne and l are doing fine.

417
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,914
We're healthy and cheerful

418
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,192
and ecstatically happy.

419
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,630
Nothing's wrong, l swear!

420
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,639
Don't worry, Mother dear.

421
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,639
Your intuition? lt's led you astray.

422
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,229
Marianne and l are happier than ever.

423
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,034
Tell Marianne's mother

424
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,233
that you should do something
more constructive than gossip.

425
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,553
l'm pressed for time, Mother dear.

426
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,276
Yes, l'll see you soon.

427
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,315
We'll pop in on Friday, just like
we said. Say hello to dad.

428
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,116
Hell and damnation!

429
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,438
Am l disturbing you?

430
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,590
l just had to see what you're up to.
A lot of rumours are floating around.

431
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,555
What is all this mysterious stuff?

432
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,752
- Shouldn't you be in Lund?
- That's right.

433
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,556
However the students are demonstrating.

434
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,991
The lectures were cancelled.

435
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,033
- What's this going to be?
- Take a look.

436
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,108
- What am l supposed to do?
- Hold this pen.

437
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,555
When l put the lights out
you'll see a bright dot on the wall.

438
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,149
Try and touch it with the pen.

439
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,876
lf you miss, draw a line to it.

440
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,277
The TV camera
will register your efforts.

441
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,028
- But it's dark.
- There's infra light.

442
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,154
l'll watch on the monitor outside.

443
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,751
l'll put the lights out now.

444
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,119
Off you go.

445
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,274
Get to it.

446
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,189
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No, please continue.

447
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,837
But... lt keeps moving.

448
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,556
lt's not a trick, it's quite still.

449
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,918
l've had enough of this.
Turn the lights on.

450
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,076
Well, aren't you cross?

451
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:58,230
- That was unpleasant...
- Yes, it makes people nervous.

452
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,911
Look how you've wandered,
getting more and more irritated.

453
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,069
- What does that prove?
- That remains to be seen.

454
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,155
- l'd like a cigarette.
- Sure. Have a seat.

455
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,719
l gave up smoking six days ago.
lt's awful.

456
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,675
- Having withdrawal symptoms?
- Stefan is away...

457
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,918
My friends avoid me,

458
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,749
but l'll try and stick it out.

459
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,758
Go on, have one.

460
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,191
That spy Bromeus left some here.

461
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,392
Oh, that's heaven!

462
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,116
- Lord, what bliss!
- Well?

463
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,471
Right...

464
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,598
l spent the day reading
your poems yesterday. Very carefully.

465
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,436
- They baffled me.
- Were they so strange?

466
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,755
That's not it.

467
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,118
Well, l might be wrong...

468
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,508
- Has Marianne read them?
- No, she's not interested in poetry.

469
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,358
- She ought to be interested in you.
- She is, but not in that way.

470
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,913
Really?

471
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,876
You and l are old friends.

472
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,074
We've never been sexually involved.

473
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,434
You can provide an objective opinion
before l try the publishers.

474
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,111
- l shouldn't bother.
- Are they that bad?

475
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,393
lt's not that they're bad...

476
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,476
..if only that was the case.

477
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,638
You mean they're mediocre?

478
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,395
They're insipid, neat, and puerile?

479
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,391
That l'm indulging
in spiritual masturbation?

480
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,198
Several of us in our set believed
you were destined for greatness.

481
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,558
We admired you.

482
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,628
You left us all behind.

483
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,471
We even envied you.

484
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,231
- Does that affect my poetry?
- No.

485
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,198
- You read it while craving nicotine.
- That's true...

486
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,392
l intend to show them around.

487
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,151
Naturally...

488
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,638
l'll wait until
some publishers tell me they're bad.

489
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,154
- You feel offended.
- You bet l do!

490
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,836
l'm sorry.

491
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,989
Well, l know
someone who likes them...

492
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,397
- Who would that be?
- Curious, are you?

493
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,758
My dear little Johan...

494
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,399
Pay no attention to what l said.

495
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,558
lt was just my craving talking.

496
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,394
Well, l must go.

497
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,629
l'll leave the poems at your door.
Give my love to Marianne.

498
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,039
l'll stick to you
through thick and thin.

499
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,435
Bye!

500
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,913
l'll see you around 12:30, then. Bye.

501
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,317
l'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

502
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,878
During this first encounter,
we customarily establish the problem.

503
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,798
l want a divorce.

504
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,675
- How long have you been married?
- More than 20 years.

505
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,431
- Do you have a profession?
- No, l'm a housewife.

506
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,598
Why do you want a divorce?

507
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,517
lt's a loveless marriage.

508
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,759
- ls that your reason?
- Yes.

509
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,513
- Has it always been like this?
- Yes, for the full 20 years.

510
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,910
But now you want to break away.

511
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,469
Yes.

512
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,759
My husband is a responsible man.
He's kind and conscientious.

513
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,190
He's been an excellent father.
We've never quarrelled.

514
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,112
We have a nice apartment
and a house in the country.

515
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,909
We're both fond of music.

516
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,988
We belong
to a chamber music society.

517
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,592
- lt all sounds ideal.
- Yes, doesn't it?

518
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,351
But there's no love between us,
there never has been.

519
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,554
Forgive me for asking,
but have you met someone?

520
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,558
No, l haven't.

521
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,557
What about your husband?

522
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,308
Not as far as l know.

523
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,319
Won't it be lonely for you?

524
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,672
l guess so...

525
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,439
But that's better

526
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,154
than living in a loveless marriage.

527
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,913
Have you informed
your husband of this?

528
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,872
Naturally.

529
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,230
15 years ago, l told him

530
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,433
l didn't want to live with him.

531
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,438
He asked me to wait

532
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,313
until the children had grown up.

533
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,956
Now that they've left home,

534
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,152
l can get my divorce.

535
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,874
And what does he say?

536
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,793
He keeps asking me
what is wrong with our marriage.

537
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,196
l tell him l can't go on

538
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,790
in a relationship that lacks love.

539
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:42,108
Then he asks what this love
is supposed to consist of.

540
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,516
But l can't describe

541
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,792
something that doesn't exist.

542
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,676
Have you been on good terms
with your children?

543
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,558
l've never loved my children.

544
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,351
l know that now...

545
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,394
l used to think l did. People do.

546
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,318
But l know now

547
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,397
that l never loved them.

548
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,956
l've been a good mother
to them all the same.

549
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,391
l've done all l could, even though

550
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,512
l've never felt anything for them.

551
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,318
l know just what you're thinking:

552
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,118
"She's been overindulged
and has no sense of humour."

553
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,395
She has all she could ever want,

554
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,151
but still she moans about love.

555
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,396
There are other qualities:

556
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,160
"friendship, loyalty, security..."

557
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,238
Something like that, yes.

558
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,518
Let me tell you something.

559
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,070
l have a mental image of myself,

560
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,152
which doesn't correspond
to reality.

561
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,718
Forgive a personal question...

562
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,676
lsn't it so that love...

563
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,113
What were you going to ask?

564
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,636
l'm not sure. Forgive me.

565
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,154
l have the capacity to love.

566
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,199
But it's all been... bottled up.

567
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:50,154
The life l've led
has stifled my potential.

568
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,351
The time has come to change that.

569
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,631
The first step is divorce.

570
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,310
My husband and l

571
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,034
block each other
in some deadly way.

572
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,231
That sounds frightening.

573
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,358
lt is frightening.

574
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,391
Something peculiar is happening.

575
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,071
My senses, sight, hearing, touch

576
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,316
are starting to fail me.

577
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,431
This table, for instance,

578
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,269
l can see it and touch it...

579
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,710
But the sensation

580
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,788
is diminished and dry.

581
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,799
Do you understand?

582
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,515
l think l do.

583
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,519
lt's the same with everything -

584
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,716
music, scents, faces and voices.

585
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,991
Everything seems...

586
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,559
puny, grey and undignified.

587
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,951
Now for a drink and some food.

588
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,956
Sitting through lbsen
on an empty stomach is deadly.

589
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,028
Remember when we joined
the May Day procession?

590
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,039
You were
the more fervent believer.

591
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,517
You told me l neglected our home.

592
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,839
That was the winter, we all
came down with the Asian flu.

593
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,990
- We believed in the future then.
- lt's nice to believe in something.

594
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,115
And we had the pleasure
of annoying our parents.

595
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,598
- You were a hothead.
- So was your dad.

596
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,475
A pretty hothead. You were
very attractive as a socialist.

597
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,709
Aren't l now? Very attractive?

598
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,992
But married people
lose interest in each other.

599
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,636
We haven't.

600
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,598
We're just too busy. When evening
comes around, we're exhausted.

601
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,839
That wasn't a reproach, l promise.

602
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,717
- We like each other.
- Not in that way.

603
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,357
- Oh yes, we do.
- Our life is full of evasions.

604
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,270
l can't help not enjoying it
as much as l used to.

605
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,839
There's a natural explanation.
You shouldn't reproach me.

606
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,477
- Don't get upset.
- We have a fine sex life.

607
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,949
We're not as passionate nowadays,
but it could be worse.

608
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,789
Sex isn't everything.

609
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,596
lf you're not satisfied
you'd better find a mistress

610
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,633
who is more exciting sexually.

611
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,151
- l assure you, l do my best!
- Right...

612
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,749
You've got that look again.

613
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,874
Tell me what you're brooding about.

614
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,075
- You'll only get angry.
- No, l'm listening.

615
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,478
Why make sex so complicated?

616
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,194
lt's pretty elementary stuff.

617
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,553
lt's become such a sore spot.

618
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,718
lt's all your mother's fault.

619
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,357
- You're so superficial.
- You're a sourpuss!

620
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,200
You put all the blame on me.

621
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,359
- You said you do your best.
- l do!

622
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,710
That's preposterous!

623
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,356
Are you calling me a liar?

624
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,154
Then what are you talking about?

625
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,910
Let's drop this and go to bed.

626
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,113
lt's just like you
to get me so worked up

627
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,075
and then yawn and say it's bedtime.

628
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,229
You suffer from ferocious ambition.

629
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,717
lt's something we often joke about,

630
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,790
but can't
our poor sex life be spared?

631
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,958
Why won't you leave me alone?

632
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,800
First you attack me for not trying

633
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,434
and later for making the effort.

634
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,789
Now look what l've done!

635
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,877
Yes, indeed, you have.

636
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,550
Couldn't you be kind instead?

637
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,709
There, there... Don't be upset.
l'm sorry.

638
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,869
lt's possible to talk too much
about these matters, you know.

639
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,994
l know you shouldn't keep secrets,

640
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,989
but in this case the rule is wrong.

641
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,229
There are some things
you shouldn't pry into.

642
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,595
We hurt each other to no end

643
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,793
and the barbs still remain
when we go to bed.

644
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,072
lt's like lying on a bed of nails.

645
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,880
- What are you laughing at?
- The bed of nails.

646
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,314
- lt's all very well to laugh.
- Let's go to bed.

647
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,831
You've been unbelievably tactless.

648
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,395
l apologise.

649
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,038
Don't l give you enough affection?

650
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,390
Affection takes time.

651
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,630
- Then you don't get enough.
- We don't, or give enough either.

652
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,879
That's why l wanted us
to go away this summer.

653
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,472
Affection shouldn't
be kept for vacations.

654
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,069
You're nice,
even if you are a moron.

655
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,874
Lucky l'm married to you.

656
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,314
You're mediocre, but you have
your moments of greatness.

657
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,317
At our age, thousands
of brain cells burn out every day.

658
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:08,948
- Never to be replaced...
- You must lose a million!

659
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,351
You're awfully sweet anyway,
even if you do scold and fuss.

660
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,272
l'm nearly asleep already.

661
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:27,749
- l'll just go check on the children.
- l'm nearly asleep, so don't worry.

662
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,228
Aren't you going to set the alarm?

663
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,868
You may make love to me
now if you like.

664
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,391
Thanks for the offer,
but l'm too tired.

665
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,352
Here already? l wasn't
expecting you until tomorrow.

666
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,919
What a lovely surprise!
Are you hungry?

667
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,112
We all went to bed early.

668
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,635
We thought we'd have an early night.
The girls and l have been dieting.

669
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,675
- Would you like some sandwiches?
- Sounds good to me.

670
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,159
Or shall l fry you some eggs
and ham, or fix some soup?

671
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,034
No, sandwiches
and beer will do fine.

672
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,074
By the way, Peter and Katarina
will call you on Monday.

673
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,239
What an ordeal they're having!

674
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,910
They don't seem able
to decide about their divorce.

675
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:31,036
l told them to get a lawyer each,
but they won't.

676
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,949
Listen, change into your pyjamas
and l'll bring in a tray.

677
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,595
Sounds nice...

678
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,270
l was afraid you were angry with me.

679
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,429
- Why should l be?
- l was beastly on the phone.

680
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,275
l called back,
but you'd pulled out the plug.

681
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,675
l was tired last night.

682
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,555
l'd been with
that numbskull from the ministry.

683
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,755
Those bureaucratic idiots
in charge of our well-being...

684
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,511
- l still think l behaved badly.
- Let's drop the subject.

685
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,509
You never want
to finish talking about anything,

686
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,234
but this won't take long, dear.

687
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:20,436
l just wanted to say
that you were right, but so am l.

688
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,272
lf you don't want to wear a tuxedo,
that's your business.

689
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:33,193
- But l've a right to my own opinion.
- l hate wearing a tux.

690
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,793
lt's a ridiculous outfit.
l feel like a dressed-up chimp.

691
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,071
Let's not start quarrelling.

692
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,999
Tux or no tux, l love you.

693
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,477
A tuxedo is hardly
essential to our marriage.

694
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,038
- lt seemed like that last night.
- l said l was wrong.

695
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,399
Watching you eat
makes me hungry...

696
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,836
l need a sandwich.

697
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,556
l'm so hungry, l feel light-headed.

698
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:19,518
l've lost nearly two kilos this week.
Does it show?

699
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,155
l can feel it, though.

700
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,716
But it seems pointless at times...

701
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,039
Why should we grudge ourselves
the good things in life?

702
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,472
Why can't we be fat and cheerful?

703
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,638
Remember
Aunt Miriam and Uncle David?

704
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,559
They were big, fat and cheerful.

705
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:46,710
They slept in that double bed
of theirs, holding hands.

706
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,199
Content with each other
the way they were.

707
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,950
Why can't we be like them,

708
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,198
brimming with contentment?

709
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,391
What's the matter?

710
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,274
Are you upset?

711
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,393
Has something happened?

712
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,557
What's wrong?

713
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,877
Tell me.

714
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,676
l came here to tell you something.

715
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,715
l've gone and fallen in love.

716
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,358
lt's quite absurd
and probably all wrong...

717
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,839
l met her at that congress in June.

718
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,475
She was an interpreter.

719
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,675
She's a student of Slavic languages.

720
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,429
She's nothing much to look at.

721
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,395
You might even think she's ugly.

722
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,470
l've no idea what this will lead to.

723
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,435
l don't know a thing. l'm bewildered.

724
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,150
On some level l'm happy,

725
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,432
but l have one hell of a guilty
conscience about you and the girls.

726
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,156
We've always got along so well.

727
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,399
Things have been
no better or no worse

728
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,558
than in most families.

729
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,077
Say something, for Christ's sake.

730
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,315
l don't know what to say.

731
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,311
lt was wrong not to tell you sooner,

732
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:59,549
but l figured l'd get over it.

733
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,513
l didn't want to worry you.

734
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,277
lt's funny...

735
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,878
..that l haven't noticed anything.

736
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,473
Everything's been like usual.

737
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,594
Better, in fact.

738
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,030
You've been so sweet.

739
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,996
l've been a silly blind fool.

740
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,158
l didn't understand...

741
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,591
- How mortifying.
- No, you haven't understood a thing.

742
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,554
You've never been
particularly observant.

743
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,677
- Where do we go from here?
- l don't know.

744
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,678
Do you want a divorce?

745
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,269
Are you going to marry her?

746
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:59,669
Why tell me now? What's the rush?

747
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,430
We're leaving for Paris tomorrow.

748
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,231
l want to get away from it all.

749
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,238
l was going this autumn anyway.

750
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,874
Paula has this scholarship...

751
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,149
..and l want to be with her.

752
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,319
l can't make it without her.

753
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,990
So we're leaving tomorrow.

754
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,840
Now that l'm talking to you,

755
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,112
l want to ditch the whole damn thing.

756
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,676
l feel tired and scared.

757
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,838
Nothing could be more ridiculous.

758
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,999
l know just what you're thinking.

759
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,197
How could you know that?

760
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,874
l'm trying not to feel guilty,
which has rather affected me.

761
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,675
Facts are facts,
there's nothing to be done.

762
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,633
Let's go to bed. l expect
you need to make an early start.

763
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,674
l have a meeting at nine.

764
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,356
Then we should get some sleep.

765
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,913
Aren't you going to undress?

766
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,392
You have marks on your chest.

767
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,548
How tactless of you.

768
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,994
ls my grey suit here or in town?

769
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,989
- lt's at the cleaners.
- What a shame.

770
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,158
Did you want to bring it along?

771
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,070
Can't you go and pick it up?

772
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,078
l won't have the time.

773
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,239
l'm busy right up to 3 o'clock.

774
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,035
l can pick it up for you.

775
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,791
l'll do your packing, too.
You're no good at such things.

776
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,958
- No, thank you.
- Don't be silly...

777
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,471
l'm a bit conventional.

778
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,954
l think you have all you need here.

779
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,950
There are clean shirts
and underwear.

780
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,950
Why don't you travel
in your jacket and flannels?

781
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,312
- They give you a youthful air.
- Whatever you say...

782
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,873
- How long will you be away?
- lt depends.

783
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,720
What do you mean?

784
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,678
l've taken leave of absence
for at least six months.

785
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,638
l'll probably stay away for
at least seven or eight months.

786
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,798
l want to make a clean break.

787
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,153
- And if l'm not here?
- l couldn't care less.

788
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:05,791
Do you know how long
l've wanted to leave?

789
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,435
How long
l've thought about leaving you?

790
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,996
- Don't tell me!
- Four years!

791
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,432
- l can't take this!
- Empty words...

792
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,473
What are you going to live on?

793
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,799
You'll have to pay child support.

794
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,958
Don't worry, l'll manage.

795
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,755
You must have assets
l'm not aware of.

796
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,155
That is correct, Marianne.

797
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,192
- How is that possible?
- Listen, damn it!

798
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,676
Even though it's none
of your damn business,

799
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,679
l've sold the boat

800
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,997
and l've raised a loan.

801
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,276
The bank will pay you and the girls
1,600 krona a month.

802
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,952
We'll make some other arrangement
when l return.

803
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,791
Get advice from your colleagues,
l don't care.

804
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,355
Name your price!

805
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,510
l'm not taking a thing
apart from my books.

806
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,153
l'll just vanish.

807
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,193
l'll dematerialize.

808
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,999
l'll pay all l can to support you.

809
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,159
All that interests me
is to end this.

810
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,992
Do you know
what l'm most fed up with?

811
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,556
All this carping about
what we're expected to do

812
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,035
and the people
we must accommodate.

813
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,232
What will your mother think?

814
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,629
Hadn't we better ask
so-and-so to dinner?

815
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,118
We have to go here,
we have to go there...

816
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,076
We must celebrate
Christmas, Easter, birthdays...

817
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,750
Every single damn occasion!

818
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,274
- My poor darling...
- l don't want your sympathy!

819
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,869
Stop pawing me!

820
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,997
This is pure affectation,
my running on like this.

821
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,716
l can't get at the truth about us.

822
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,878
There isn't any one truth.

823
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,918
Whichever way we turn, it hurts.

824
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,715
Please don't go!

825
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,709
- l beg you.
- lt's no use.

826
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,075
Postpone your trip.
l believe we can save our marriage.

827
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,593
We could make a fresh start.
You must give me a chance!

828
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,758
Perhaps Paula would understand me.

829
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:32,192
l should meet her and talk to her...

830
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,277
Let us face this together.
Let me have a chance!

831
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,235
You're facing me
with a fait accompli.

832
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,354
You're forcing me
into an intolerable situation.

833
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,270
You mean:
What are our parents going to say!

834
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,120
What will our friends think?
Jesus, how tongues will wag!

835
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,631
How will it affect the girls?

836
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,549
What about the dinner parties?

837
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,674
What will you tell Peter
and Katarina? Who cares?

838
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,315
lt feels good to be a cad!

839
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,636
That wasn't what l meant.

840
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,797
Forget it...

841
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,834
l forgot to set the alarm.

842
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,352
- When do you need to leave?
- Please set it for 5:30.

843
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:40,509
l need to pack
and l have a conference at nine.

844
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,270
l've been meaning
to get a new alarm clock.

845
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,588
This one's so noisy
and it's not very reliable.

846
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,077
There, it's set for 5:30.

847
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:58,229
l'll wake up on my own anyway,
so you needn't worry.

848
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,791
- Tell me about Paula.
- Please... What's the point?

849
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:17,198
- Why torment yourself?
- l want to know what she's like.

850
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:22,235
lt's much worse
picturing some faceless threat.

851
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,793
- Do you have a picture of her?
- Can't we be spared this ordeal?

852
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,231
Please help me with this.

853
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,398
Well, you asked for it...

854
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,873
Where's my wallet?
l guess it's in my jacket...

855
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,914
Here are two photos.

856
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,956
That was taken
two years ago, on holiday.

857
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:05,109
That is her passport photo.
lt's a good likeness.

858
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,992
She has a nice figure.

859
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:19,991
- And lovely breasts, right?
- Yes, she does...

860
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:27,069
- Does she dye her hair?
- lt's possible.

861
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,550
- Her smile is nice. How old is she?
- 23.

862
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:43,114
She hasn't been lucky in love.

863
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,790
She's been engaged twice

864
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,756
and has had lots of affairs.

865
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,190
- Does that bother you?
- Yes, it does...

866
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,234
Her frankness is quite unpleasant.

867
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:10,390
She insists on giving me
the details of her erotic past.

868
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:15,800
l suffer from retrospective jealousy.

869
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,389
She has no illusions

870
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,275
and she has no great hopes
for the two of us.

871
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,553
She knows l'll go back to you.

872
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:35,313
lt all sounds like
a hackneyed old melodrama.

873
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,871
Are you compatible in bed?

874
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,348
Yes, we are, actually.

875
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,914
At first it was all wrong.

876
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,758
l wasn't used to it -
being with other women, l mean.

877
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:17,797
We've spoiled each other, you and l,
living in a bubble of our own.

878
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,312
Everything's gone like clockwork.

879
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,958
- The lack of oxygen smothered us.
- And Paula will revive you?

880
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,478
l have little self-awareness.

881
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,914
l know little of reality, regardless
of all the books l've read,

882
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,795
but this may be an opportunity
for you and l to really live.

883
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,638
Has Paula filled your head
with rubbish like that?

884
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,029
- Just how naive can you get?
- We can do without your taunts.

885
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,792
- Forgive me.
- l'm trying...

886
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,313
l'm trying to be honest
and it's not easy!

887
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,473
We've never talked like this before.

888
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,594
ls it any wonder we're naive?

889
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,714
What else can we expect?

890
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,153
You're in a tight spot.

891
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,838
Come and lie down beside me.

892
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,193
Come...

893
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,677
l want you to make love to me.

894
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,837
Please?

895
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,998
For old time's sake.

896
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,678
Lie here in my arms

897
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,516
and we'll both go to sleep together.

898
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,231
l don't think l can sleep.

899
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,116
l'd better leave at once.

900
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,957
Close your eyes.

901
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,756
We both need the rest.

902
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,430
Tomorrow will be a busy day.

903
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,994
l'm so damned ashamed.

904
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,636
We'll talk about that later.

905
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,999
Right now, it's just the two of us.

906
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,748
We still have a few hours left.

907
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,317
Just you and l...

908
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,351
- Are you going to pack first or eat?
- You decide.

909
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,638
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.

910
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,550
- What about your mail?
- l'll send you my address.

911
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:23,313
You can send the letters on,
pay the bills in the usual way.

912
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,479
The plumber was scheduled
to come to fix the bathroom.

913
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,910
Shall l call him?

914
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,116
l figured it might
have slipped your mind.

915
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:47,997
l've phoned him dozens of times,
l haven't forgotten it.

916
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,473
What about your car?

917
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,911
l've asked Paula's sister
to take care of it.

918
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,829
She needs a car.

919
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,838
l see.

920
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,637
Would you please

921
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,718
cancel my dentist's appointment?

922
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:17,910
lt's your father's birthday on
Friday, we're supposed to dine there.

923
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,590
Are you planning to phone him?

924
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,316
That's tricky...

925
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,750
Maybe l can write him a letter.

926
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,270
As long as you don't forget.

927
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,915
Dealing with our parents
will be tough.

928
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,672
- What should l tell the girls?
- Say whatever you like.

929
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:51,717
- That you walked out on us?
- You couldn't have put it better.

930
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,072
l don't expect you to understand me.

931
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,114
l have to leave now,
to avoid traffic.

932
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,188
Goodbye, Marianne. Take care.

933
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:10,395
- l may be home in a week's time.
- l wish...

934
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,590
We'd make a fresh start.

935
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,395
We'd throw out stale old routines.

936
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,229
We'd talk about the past.

937
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,875
We'd try and find out
where we went wrong.

938
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,631
You'd never hear me blame you.

939
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,191
Johan, it's all so unreal...

940
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,473
l don't know what to do.

941
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,474
You're shutting me out.

942
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,116
Any solution
would be better than this.

943
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,474
Couldn't you promise to come back?
Then l'd have something, at least.

944
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,036
You can't leave me without hope.

945
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,790
Even if you don't intend to return,
tell me you will.

946
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,958
l have to go now.

947
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,753
Fredrik? lt's Marianne.
Sorry to wake you.

948
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:51,194
ls Birgit there? No, let her sleep.

949
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,110
So, how are you doing?

950
01:22:54,720 --> 01:23:00,989
Oh, you're an early riser, are you?
l won't keep you long.

951
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:06,149
lt's cloudy... That sounds lovely.

952
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,557
There's something
l need to talk to you about.

953
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,798
l really need to talk...

954
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,958
You and Birgit are friends of ours.

955
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,117
l have to...

956
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,029
lt's all so unreal, Fredrik.

957
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,473
You see...

958
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,599
l'm on the verge of tears

959
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,714
and crying only makes things worse.
