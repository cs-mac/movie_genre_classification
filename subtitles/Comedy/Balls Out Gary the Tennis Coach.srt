1
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,399
St. Francis High School
basketball phenom

2
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,899
Ty Crane,
who they recruited just last year,

3
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:25,265
is widely held as
the next LeBron James.

4
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:27,736
We simply know him
as ''The Crane.''

5
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:30,411
Come on.

6
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,020
Come on, y'all!
Timo, let's go man, come on.

7
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,458
Yeah, whatever.

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,901
Where you at? Where you at?

9
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,576
Pick him up! Pick him up!

10
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:12,211
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

11
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,647
Right here, right here.

12
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:18,413
- Blue ball!
- Good D, baby!

13
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,285
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing, y'all?

14
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:23,484
- You took three steps this way.
- Yo, l put my fist up, man.

15
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:26,027
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing
the ball, man. Damn.

16
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,530
- Get your man!
- l knew it. l knew it.

17
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,765
Yeah!

18
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,837
St. Francis is up by 22.

19
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,579
Stay out of my way, bitch.
l own you.

20
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:49,720
- Oh, hell no!
- Bitch!

21
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,822
Let's go! Let's go!

22
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,417
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

23
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:59,794
- Let me go!
- Hey! Hey!

24
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:03,126
l'm good. Get off me!

25
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,998
Get off me, get off me!

26
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,464
That's it! Game's over!

27
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,938
Game's over!

28
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:11,506
Crane. Great game, great game.

29
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,769
Tell everyone out there what it
feels like to be the next LeBron James.

30
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,540
LeBron James?
l'm the only Ty Crane.

31
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:25,047
All right, you heard it here first,
''the only Ty Crane.''

32
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,753
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

33
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,391
We watching the damn game,
that's why.

34
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,083
- You got a good view, huh?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,262
Ty Crane outscored
our whole team by himself.

36
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,829
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had nothing but 32 points.

37
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,932
l got 1 2 of them.
What did you get, Kenyon?

38
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,930
Just shut up, dog.
The Crane swooped down on you

39
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,262
and delivered a basket of beat-down.
He clowned you, dog.

40
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:45,235
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.
- He had you on lock the whole game.

41
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,876
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before l close it for good.

42
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,602
You didn't do shit either
the whole game.

43
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,780
What, homey?
l will slap the taste out your mouth!

44
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,006
- Can we all just get along?
- Shut your little ass up!

45
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,275
- You didn't even play!
- That's what l'm talking about.

46
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,215
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!
- You got two points in 1 6 minutes,

47
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:01,514
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.
- Exactly!

48
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,157
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

49
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,987
You didn't do shit.
You might as well--

50
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:09,528
- Who was you passing the ball to?
- You were playing and didn't do shit!

51
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:19,539
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond
High School all-American, 1 9 72.

52
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,506
Good to see you, sir.

53
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,870
l was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

54
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:27,377
l have to tell you, sir,
l haven't made up my mind yet.

55
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:31,580
As l've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

56
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:34,050
Last few years
have been really tough.

57
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:36,223
Well, losing's hard, sir.

58
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:40,358
This isn't about
losing games, Kenny.

59
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:45,861
l can't get them to show up
for school, for practice.

60
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,563
l can't get parents involved, and l'm
done chasing kids in the streets

61
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,237
and pulling them into the gym.

62
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,063
Yeah, it's a tough job.

63
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,434
Richmond is a tough little city.

64
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:59,073
When l saw you here tonight,
l thought, ''l got him. He's in.''

65
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,111
Well, actually,
l was here for another reason.

66
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,944
My son plays for St. Francis.

67
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:06,642
He does?

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,850
- Which kid was he?
- Well, you didn't see him.

69
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:13,321
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.
- That's great. Great school.

70
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,021
What, you wanna go?

71
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,598
- Hey!
- Lyle, bring it!

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,031
Let him go. You think everybody's
scared of you? l ain't scared of you!

73
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:28,571
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be
trying to act all hard all the time, man?

74
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,206
God, l'm sick of you, man!

75
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,944
You know, that school was rough
when l went there.

76
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,638
lt's way beyond that now.

77
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,546
Well, then, just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

78
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:45,884
l can't quite do that. Coach officially
offered me the job tonight.

79
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:47,285
The clock's ticking.

80
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:50,359
And when you say ''offering job,''
there's usually money involved.

81
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:53,963
Yeah, there might be
a thousand bucks in it for me.

82
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,564
For five months of work?

83
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,701
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

84
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:01,132
And the team, it's so bad.

85
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:04,137
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

86
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:06,276
And besides, you know,
you don't have the time.

87
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:07,968
You're trying to open up
a second store.

88
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,578
Exactly, l don't have the--
Hell, l don't have any time.

89
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:12,806
And you promised to take
your girlfriend to Mexico.

90
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:14,484
And l'm definitely
keeping that promise.

91
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:16,915
There's no way
l'm not going to Mexico

92
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:20,181
and hanging out on the beach
with you in your bikini.

93
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,584
l can't take that job.

94
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,527
So when do you start?

95
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,000
- You should've spoken to me first.
- Why?

96
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:34,567
- lt was a personal choice for me.
- So, what happens to me?

97
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:36,295
You still gonna come to my games?

98
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:39,339
l'll probably miss most of
your games, Damien. l'm sorry.

99
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,066
Then l'll go to Richmond
and play for you.

100
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,471
No.

101
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,307
Well, why not?

102
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:49,183
- Dad, you've always been my coach.
- This is a great school, Damien.

103
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,211
lt puts you in a great position
for college.

104
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:52,854
Dad, l'm a freshman!

105
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,648
Just because l'm coaching
at Richmond,

106
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:57,324
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

107
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:27,348
Yo, my man, l need a vial, man.
You got that good dope? How much?

108
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,302
You forgot to bring your lD,
didn't you?

109
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,529
- l forgot it.
- Every day.

110
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:48,570
Good morning. Ken Carter.

111
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,579
- Thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

112
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,342
Hey, yo, what's up?

113
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,886
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

114
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:08,322
lf the offer still stands,
l'd like to coach the team.

115
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,328
Well, l hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

116
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:16,068
The job comes with a $1 ,500 stipend

117
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,362
and a major time commitment
for the next four months.

118
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,570
- l accept.
- Great.

119
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:25,342
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, l hate to be abrupt,

120
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,740
but l do have a budget meeting
l need to run to.

121
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:30,073
Mr. Carter, is there anything
you need from us?

122
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:34,651
Well, l just need about
25 copies of this document.

123
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:38,519
- l'm all set.
- Ray, would you see to it

124
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:40,885
that Mr. Carter--?
Coach Carter gets these copies?

125
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:43,594
- Will do.
- Gentlemen.

126
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:49,632
l'm not saying this is
not gonna be a challenge,

127
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,302
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

128
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:54,494
Just keep in mind,
these are good boys.

129
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,969
Guys! Guys!

130
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,767
Guys!

131
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:02,208
Now, as you know, l've been-- Hey!

132
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:03,972
You know l've been looking
for a new coach

133
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,309
to take over for me this season.

134
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:10,011
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

135
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,746
He was a two-sport all-American.

136
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,288
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

137
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:19,929
Basketball scholarship to
George Mason University.

138
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,258
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

139
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,459
Now, let's give him
the respect he's due.

140
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,103
- They're all yours, coach.
- Thank you, sir.

141
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:33,202
Good afternoon, young men.

142
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,279
As Coach White said, l'm your
new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

143
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,250
l guess l need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

144
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:43,885
l'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

145
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,385
We hear you, dog.
But we can't see you.

146
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,091
The glare from your
big, black-ass head

147
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:51,293
is hella shiny, man.
Damn, do you buff it?

148
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:54,861
Oh, you got jokes to go along
with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

149
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,562
First of all, if you need to know
my credentials,

150
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,135
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

151
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:09,977
Secondly, if basketball practice
starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

152
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:14,741
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

153
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,884
Jason Lyle, but l ain't no sir.

154
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,485
You're not a sir.

155
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:21,712
Well, are you a madam?

156
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:27,152
- Little bitch. Bitch.
- As of now, you are a sir.

157
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,057
So are the rest of you.

158
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:31,824
''Sir'' is a term of respect.

159
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:35,594
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

160
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,231
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

161
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,566
Like four wins, 22 losses.

162
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:46,039
- Sir.
- Sir.

163
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:50,813
l'm going to give you contracts.

164
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:56,687
lf you sign and honor
your side of them,

165
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,052
we are going to be successful.

166
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,625
Damn, do l get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

167
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,594
Yes, sir.
You get to become a winner.

168
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,765
Because if there's one thing l know,
it is this:

169
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,703
The losing stops now.

170
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,234
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners,

171
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,278
and most importantly,
you will be winners.

172
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,007
lf you listen and learn,
you'll win basketball games.

173
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,510
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

174
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,251
...is the key to winning out there.

175
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:36,184
This contract states that you will
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

176
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,226
You will attend all your classes

177
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,195
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

178
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,062
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.
- Excuse me.

179
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,932
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering,

180
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,073
are you some country church nigga,
with your tie on and all that?

181
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,867
- Right.
- That's what you wanna say, right?

182
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:53,305
And what is your name, sir?

183
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,543
l'm Timo Cruz, sir.

184
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,942
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

185
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:04,619
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

186
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:06,256
We don't use the word ''nigga.''

187
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,358
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

188
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,789
Because God ain't gonna do you
no good in this neighborhood.

189
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:13,088
- l live in this neighborhood, sir.
- Sir.

190
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,289
Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

191
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,494
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

192
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:23,105
- ...leave the gym right now.
- For what?

193
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:27,141
l'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym

194
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:30,871
- before l help you leave.
- Before you what?

195
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:33,711
Do you even know who l am?

196
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:37,446
From what l can see, a very confused
and scared young man.

197
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:41,089
Scared of who? Scared of you?
l'm supposed to be scared of you?

198
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,359
Nigga, l ain't scared of nobody.
l will lay your ass out.

199
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,822
l don't think so.

200
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,324
All right.

201
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,172
What you doing? Get off me!

202
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:06,204
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

203
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,212
l'm not a teacher.

204
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:10,808
l'm your new basketball coach.

205
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:21,729
This ain't over!

206
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:39,178
ls there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

207
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,813
Come on, man, where you going?

208
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:47,243
l don't do high school contracts.

209
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:48,955
Tell us when you need
the real ballers.

210
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:51,249
l will do that, sir.

211
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,260
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

212
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,954
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

213
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:57,324
Then l guess we'll have new
leading scorers this season, huh?

214
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,295
Now, l cannot teach you the game
of basketball

215
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:05,495
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

216
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,868
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

217
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,211
To the baseline!

218
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,418
l presume you all know
what suicides are.

219
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,851
So...

220
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,357
l saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

221
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,595
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

222
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:42,464
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

223
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:46,400
lf you are late, you will run.

224
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:50,479
lf you give me attitude,
you will do push-ups.

225
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,817
So you can push-up or shut up.

226
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,486
That's up to you.

227
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,118
- Yo, how many we gonna do?
- Sir.

228
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,749
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

229
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,022
Let's see how many you can do
in one hour and seven minutes.

230
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,599
Fellas, don't make me
commit homicide.

231
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:14,336
l said, suicides!
Put your hand on the line!

232
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,406
Put your hand on the line!

233
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:23,613
Damn, l can't keep this shit up, man.
l can barely walk.

234
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:27,251
- l know, my legs is hella sore, son.
- Need some Gatorade or something.

235
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,444
- There go your girl right there, son.
- Yeah.

236
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,216
Hey, what's with you and her homeys?
You gonna try to holler at them?

237
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,620
Man, l'm hollering
at both of the friends.

238
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:38,420
- Both of them?
- Yeah, because l need that.

239
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,620
You know, l need variety in my life.
l can't just have one girl.

240
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,197
You know what l'm saying?
l need both.

241
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,628
Hey.

242
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,097
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

243
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:49,466
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard
about that two-for-one special, right?

244
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,571
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

245
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,472
- Please. Whatever, Worm.
- Yeah, special ed.

246
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:59,272
- Get your arm off me.
- l like this fox.

247
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:01,882
You working that chinchilla.
But, look, baby, me and you...

248
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:05,645
You need to tell him to stop playing it
so close. She don't even like him.

249
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,786
- Why not? Worm's the man.
- Worm is Worm.

250
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:17,092
Anyway, l got something
for the baby today.

251
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:29,310
We don't even know if it's a baby yet.
l mean, it's kind of early.

252
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:31,205
You ain't even been
to the doctor yet.

253
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:35,508
Hello? l passed the pregnancy test,
Kenyon. Three times.

254
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,752
- These are kind of cute, though.
- l know, l got good taste, right?

255
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,427
Yeah, all right.

256
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:49,624
Precious little shoes.

257
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:52,891
Well, l got a little
somethin'-somethin' for you too.

258
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:57,794
Thank you.

259
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:00,670
This definitely is a little something.

260
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:06,070
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

261
00:17:07,614 --> 00:17:08,842
Kenyon!

262
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,313
- What? What's up?
- What are you doing? Give me!

263
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,349
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

264
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,111
You got that for 99 cents?
l've been there.

265
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:18,257
You can get three brooms and a bucket
for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

266
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,393
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

267
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:25,128
Well, would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

268
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,125
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

269
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,033
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

270
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:35,867
Three push-ups and move.
One! Two! Three!

271
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,905
Let's go. Explode!

272
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,409
Let me hear you. Let me hear you!
Let me hear it.

273
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,809
Explode! Worm, explode!

274
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,381
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

275
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,643
Give me five!
Just give me five! Push!

276
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:50,878
Push! Go! Go!
Let me hear you!

277
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:54,287
Come on, close out!
Explode! Let's go!

278
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:58,588
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

279
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:05,127
That's ten suicides for the
whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

280
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,803
This ain't the track team, man.

281
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:09,439
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

282
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:11,108
But you're right.

283
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:15,479
And because you're right,
that's 20 suicides for the entire team

284
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,841
and you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle

285
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,882
- with 250 push-ups of your own.
- What, are you serious?

286
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:22,849
- Yeah.
- This is bullshit!

287
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,686
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

288
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,414
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

289
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,058
Because you gave
such a good answer

290
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,785
and you gave the coach attitude,

291
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:35,523
you win the bonus prize
of 500 push-ups!

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,992
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of a thousand?

293
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,399
No, sir.

294
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:47,409
To the baseline!
On my whistle! Let's go!

295
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,407
J.B., come on, baby.

296
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:52,438
l can't even move, son.
Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

297
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,584
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't l say nothing to him?

298
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,076
l'm a white boy? Man, what the--?

299
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,322
Right here. Right here.
Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

300
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,682
Where you going, homey?
Where you going, huh?

301
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,053
- l ain't got shit.
- What?

302
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,729
Please don't shoot me, man.
Go on, take my bag, dog!

303
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,897
Run your shit, homey!

304
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,366
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

305
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,076
Yo, l'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

306
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,972
l'm just playing, B.
Look at you!

307
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:28,347
Damn! l seen y'all
walking from up the block

308
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,042
like somebody put a pipe
in your asses.

309
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,287
You all right, dog?

310
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,116
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

311
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:38,849
but y'all damn sure
look sad without me.

312
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,120
But you know what?
l'm gonna watch y'all play.

313
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,762
See y'all get your asses kicked.

314
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:47,263
Yo! l'd love to shoot the shit with
you bitches all night, but l gotta go.

315
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,763
- All right.
- Yo, who that, man?

316
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,734
That's my cousin, Renny.

317
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,464
l'm gonna check y'all.
Come on, let's go.

318
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,642
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

319
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,208
- No, l'm straight, man.
- You sure?

320
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:59,242
- Yeah, l'm good.
- All right, my nigga.

321
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,642
- One love.
- All right, Lyle!

322
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:05,808
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

323
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:12,658
Hey, you was scared, huh?
l wasn't scared.

324
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,551
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

325
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:17,253
Now, you got in here
they need a 2.3.

326
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,763
lf you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1 050 on the SAT

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,491
to be eligible
for an athletic scholarship.

328
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:27,034
lf you have a 2.3,
you only need 950.

329
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,902
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

330
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:33,109
lt shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

331
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,675
These boys are student athletes.

332
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:37,877
''Student'' comes first.

333
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,577
lt says they gotta wear
coat and ties on game days.

334
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:44,312
They don't own ties!
You gonna supply the ties?

335
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,582
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store

336
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,818
less than two blocks from here.

337
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,496
They got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

338
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,562
Yo, man, what you
trying to say, huh?

339
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,226
Oh, we too good to shop at the
Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

340
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,869
- Yeah, l ain't that broke.
- This is crazy!

341
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,906
A dress code and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

342
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:07,874
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

343
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,013
lf you want to play basketball
on this team,

344
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,946
these are the simple rules
you have to follow

345
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:16,883
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

346
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:20,415
Now, if you decide
to follow these simple rules,

347
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:24,455
l need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

348
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:28,594
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

349
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,733
lf you come to practice.

350
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:34,094
l wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support,

351
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,239
and l hope l have your support
the rest of the season.

352
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:40,237
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

353
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:43,674
Look, l have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

354
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,147
- How you gonna make them wear ties?
- l want the other coach back!

355
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:04,389
lt's one of your contracts, sir.
l've amended that contract.

356
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,870
You require your players
to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

357
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:10,732
l've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

358
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:14,170
You require ten hours of community
service, and l've committed to 50.

359
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:18,574
Any unexcused absences, any other
disciplinary issues at school,

360
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:21,944
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

361
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:26,186
And how many days do l have
to consider this offer?

362
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,753
None.

363
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,549
The second page
is a letter you need to sign

364
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,851
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

365
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,485
- They know l'm leaving.
- What?

366
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,221
- You withdrew from St. Francis?
- l called Richmond.

367
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:40,195
- They expect me there in the morning.
- You called Richmond?

368
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:42,399
You should have spoken to me
about this.

369
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:45,738
lt was a personal choice for me.

370
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:51,468
Well, l can fix all that in the morning.

371
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,315
Sir, please listen.
All l wanna do is play for you.

372
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:57,542
lf l'm one of the top students
at Richmond,

373
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:01,251
l mean one of the top in the whole
school, and l have great SATs,

374
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,787
l can go to any college
in the country.

375
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,557
l'm asking you to trust me.

376
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,963
You really wanna do this, huh?

377
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,026
Okay.

378
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,673
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions

379
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:23,672
and living with the consequences.

380
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:30,873
3.7.

381
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:35,216
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

382
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:39,854
Open it, please.

383
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,284
Morning, sir.

384
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,431
My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild

385
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:53,429
lt's all right
Kenyon's mom tonight

386
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,732
- Say what?
- You might think l'm wrong

387
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:58,139
But she's got these thongs

388
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:01,807
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
lt's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

389
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,647
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!
- Whatever.

390
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:06,181
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here, son?

391
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:09,947
- l transferred to Richmond.
- Oh, no, son, l think you're just lost.

392
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:12,646
Well, l am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to...?

393
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:16,156
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm,
tell your man Fresh Prince here

394
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:19,330
- how to get to his mansion.
- Fresh bitch.

395
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:26,431
l hope seeing you in this hallway mean
l get to see you on the court today.

396
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:31,733
l can't wait. With your five browns.

397
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,444
Everybody up.

398
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,841
Today we're going to play defense.

399
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:42,875
Sorry, sir.

400
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:47,056
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

401
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:50,024
He is my son, and he is late.

402
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,695
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

403
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,693
Sir, it's my first day of school,
l had to stay--

404
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:56,798
Basketball practice starts at 3.

405
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:00,602
As of 2:55, you are late.
Get changed in the locker room.

406
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:04,706
Do your suicides on the far side
of the court so as not to disturb us.

407
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:07,240
All right, gentlemen,
give me two lines!

408
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:11,906
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna
take it to the next level.

409
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:15,276
Everything l knew about basketball,

410
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:17,375
l learned from women.

411
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:21,580
l have a sister, her name's Diane.

412
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:26,055
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

413
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:28,763
Matter of fact, she still is.

414
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:32,264
''Turn down that radio!
You eat the last piece of cake?

415
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,458
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?''

416
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,964
She was always in my face.

417
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:40,331
So when l call ''Diane,''

418
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:44,206
we're gonna play straight
man-to-man pressure defense.

419
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:51,484
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

420
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,948
Look at your defensive posture.

421
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:56,521
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

422
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:59,716
This hand guards against the passing
lane, this hand protects the crossover.

423
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:02,692
All right? Palms up!
Get your head in the game.

424
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,599
Now we have Delilah.

425
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,199
She was my childhood sweetheart.

426
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:09,801
Sir, was she hot?

427
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:14,600
Oh, yes, sir.
She was steaming hot.

428
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,377
But she was the devil.
That girl was evil.

429
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,682
l remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies

430
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:27,285
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

431
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,656
She smiled
and got her way out of it,

432
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,653
while l damn near had to wear
a pillow on my butt

433
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,486
for a month
before l could sit down.

434
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:38,328
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

435
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,961
Take notes, freshman. This is as
close as you gonna get to playing.

436
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,801
Come on, come on. Move, move!
Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

437
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,979
Now, l know you're all
concerned that

438
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,345
we didn't work
on our offense during practice.

439
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,579
We have all season to do that.

440
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:07,121
But what did we do in practice,
Mr. Stone?

441
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,690
- Run.
- That's right.

442
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,420
So, what do you think l want you
to do on offense tonight?

443
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,026
- Run?
- Correct again.

444
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,464
l want you to run.

445
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:22,800
l want you to run every second
that clock is ticking, all game long.

446
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,008
Put him back on the bench!

447
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:35,480
Rebound! Rebound!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

448
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,448
Nice pass, baby!

449
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,323
Push it! Push it!

450
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,993
- Screen.
- Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

451
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,296
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

452
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,206
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

453
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,743
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

454
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,744
White four, fifth.
He's out of the game.

455
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,246
- Oh, ref, come--
- That's his fifth foul, coach.

456
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:10,385
- Time, sir.
- Time out, white.

457
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:13,055
Bad call, ref!
That was a jump ball, damn it!

458
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,848
- Time out, white.
- Come on, fellas.

459
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,650
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

460
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,225
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

461
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:22,421
- Carter, you're in.
- But, coach, he a freshman.

462
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,361
You wanna coach?

463
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:28,266
All right, take a deep breath, guys.
Come on, deep breaths.

464
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,102
- You tired?
- No, sir.

465
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,101
Those guys are exhausted.

466
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:35,174
That's why this guy's gonna miss
that free throw.

467
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:38,403
When he does,
Worm and Lyle are our first option.

468
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:41,980
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards, got that?

469
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,277
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Richmond on three.

470
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,447
- One, two, three!
- Richmond!

471
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,283
- All right, let's out, all right?
- Step it up, let's go!

472
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:51,356
Look alive out there.

473
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:55,955
All right, guys, you're in better shape
than they are. Push it.

474
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,758
Box out, box out.

475
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:01,267
One shot.

476
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:09,573
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

477
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,505
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, baby!

478
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:21,622
All right.

479
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:28,519
Kenyon!

480
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:31,894
- Worm!
- Yo, yo.

481
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,965
Oh, yeah!

482
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:38,526
Yeah! That's what l'm talking about!

483
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:49,480
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.
- lt was all you.

484
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:50,979
A win like that don't mean nothing,

485
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:52,741
because they can't play anyway,
you feel me?

486
00:29:56,222 --> 00:30:00,319
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated
down low tonight. Any thoughts?

487
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:04,323
l dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

488
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,691
We the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

489
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,697
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

490
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:11,630
Yo, man, on the real,

491
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:13,701
that was the worst game
l've ever seen in my life.

492
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,373
l thought that shit would never end.
l was dying in the bleachers.

493
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:18,542
That's right, you were in
the bleachers, weren't you?

494
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,302
We were on the court
handling our business.

495
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:22,741
That's right. We 1 -0, bitch.

496
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:26,542
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B,
and y'all barely beat them.

497
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,650
Damn, Timo,
why you throwing salt, man?

498
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:31,515
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

499
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,588
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

500
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,783
l'll knock all y'all off.

501
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:09,853
- Yo. l'll check y'all later, all right?
- All right.

502
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,619
Yo. Let's do this.

503
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:21,902
- What's up?
- Here's two bundles.

504
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:24,869
- All right.
- Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

505
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:26,598
Yo, l got you.

506
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:30,078
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

507
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,144
You look good.

508
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:33,676
Got some paper for you.

509
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:38,244
Now we're talking, yeah.

510
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:42,818
How you living, Timo?

511
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,158
l'm good.

512
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:49,889
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

513
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,233
- Here, take some.
- l'm all right.

514
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:56,404
No, no, no, take some, please.

515
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:59,406
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

516
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:04,068
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me, thank you.

517
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:05,870
You earned it.

518
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:11,278
Take a nickel bag, okay?

519
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:14,551
Go get yourself something, man.

520
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,184
- l'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

521
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,520
Okay, l'm gonna see you.

522
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:23,262
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

523
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:43,113
Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.

524
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:45,277
Rafeca, l see you looking.

525
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,386
Ain't nobody
thinking about you, Worm.

526
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:50,488
- Oh, okay.
- Gentlemen,

527
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,624
let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

528
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,657
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

529
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:58,092
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

530
00:32:58,298 --> 00:33:00,425
No, sir. l had 1 2 points
and eight assists, sir.

531
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:05,093
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five
turnovers and four missed free throws.

532
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:09,304
Now, we're talking
about fundamentals here.

533
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:14,036
Until we learn them, l'm adding
a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

534
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,410
- Six a.m.?
- We shot 56 percent at--

535
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:21,743
Mr. Cruz.

536
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:23,586
Are you lost, sir?

537
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:25,250
What l gotta do to play?

538
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:30,622
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

539
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,024
Now, as l was saying,

540
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:38,067
as a team,
we shot 56 percent from the line.

541
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,068
From now on,
before you leave my gym,

542
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:46,572
you must pay an exit price of 50
made free throws before you can go.

543
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,608
- What?
- That's everybody.

544
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:50,940
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

545
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:55,786
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

546
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,288
Before you can play on this team...

547
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:01,384
...you owe me...

548
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:06,161
...2,500 push-ups...

549
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:07,990
...and 1 ,000 suicides.

550
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:09,893
- Damn.
- Damn.

551
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:15,767
And they must be
completed by Friday.

552
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:18,804
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

553
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:22,937
Today's flavor: offense.

554
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,114
- Now we talking.
- Now, l have a sister.

555
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,476
Her name is Linda.

556
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,148
Linda is smart, she's political.

557
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:33,548
Well, actually, she's radical.

558
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:36,487
Linda's got a big Afro.

559
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:40,561
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

560
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:43,090
Before we get into that,
let's warm up.

561
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:45,359
Give me a lay-up line.

562
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,501
- Let's go.
- All right.

563
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:49,330
Let's do it.

564
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:52,301
- Damn, how many sisters he got?
- Who knows.

565
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,338
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

566
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,877
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys, energy.

567
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,570
We got this, let's go.

568
00:34:59,782 --> 00:35:01,044
- l'm open.
- l got him, l got him.

569
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,808
Right here, right here.
l'm open. l'm open.

570
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,314
l'm sorry.

571
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,543
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

572
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:06,845
- Come on.
- lt's not my fault.

573
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,249
- He was early.
- Hey.

574
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,120
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball,

575
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:14,160
but you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

576
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:18,389
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

577
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,726
Okay. Switch it up.

578
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:23,403
We got it, come on.
Let's go. Let's get it.

579
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:26,539
- And call out them picks.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

580
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:31,878
What is your deepest fear,
Mr. Cruz?

581
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:34,638
That you're inadequate?

582
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:36,614
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

583
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,952
Go home.

584
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:47,259
All right, l want seven passes
before you shoot.

585
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:50,157
- Seven.
- All right.

586
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:53,462
- l got him. l got him.
- Get that ball in there.

587
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:59,601
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

588
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:05,108
Move.

589
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:07,404
Work it, work it.

590
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,980
Run it back.

591
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,405
What time your mom getting home?

592
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:37,370
She doesn't get off for another hour.

593
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:48,249
Oh, that's Myles.

594
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,249
What?

595
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:07,470
Say, ''Hi, Uncle Kenyon.''

596
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:09,467
Say, ''Hi.''

597
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:10,935
All right, don't worry about it.

598
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,701
He'll go back to sleep
right after his bottle.

599
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,139
Right, boo-boo?

600
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:17,711
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

601
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:20,383
Or when your cousin get back
from getting her hair fried and dyed,

602
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:23,280
like she can afford all that shit.
lt's her baby anyway.

603
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:26,683
Well, my mother had to work
a double shift,

604
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,447
but they cut her overtime.

605
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:30,956
And my cousin,
don't be trying to dis her.

606
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,924
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

607
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:35,892
Well, that's why we need
our own spot.

608
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:40,866
Did you turn this off?

609
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,267
- Yeah, it was boiling.
- Oh, come on.

610
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:46,339
Well, turn it down, not off.

611
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:50,341
This is milk, butter and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

612
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,875
And hold him up.

613
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:02,453
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

614
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,557
All right, Myles, here we go.

615
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:07,250
Gotta cool off a minute.

616
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:15,926
Ever think about what you were
gonna do before you were pregnant?

617
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:18,368
What you mean,
going to junior college?

618
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:19,733
Yeah.

619
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:22,465
l mean, yeah, l thought about it.

620
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:25,677
l could go later, l guess.

621
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,542
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

622
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,711
Me too.

623
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:33,713
- So l'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

624
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:35,582
Why you asking me
all these questions?

625
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:38,383
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

626
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,425
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

627
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,064
- l am holding him.
- You ain't doing it right.

628
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:46,732
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

629
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:48,490
Look...

630
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,236
l don't know how to do this.

631
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,137
You'll get it.

632
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,809
Right?

633
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:04,715
Look, l gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

634
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:08,283
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

635
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:12,381
Call me later, okay?

636
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,487
Later.

637
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:19,822
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

638
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,056
- Don't get lost in there.
- Move it. Move it.

639
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,130
Stay with your man.

640
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,005
- Box out, box out!
- Position.

641
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,741
Guys...

642
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:33,510
Up. Up.

643
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:34,679
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,371
You don't get to your man, stand,
watch the ball.

645
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,108
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position,

646
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:43,254
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

647
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:45,820
All right? Let's go.

648
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:47,319
Run it. You got it.

649
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,959
- Go on, do it.
- Forward pass. Forward pass.

650
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:51,925
- Work it.
- There you go.

651
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,326
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

652
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,933
l wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, l'm here all week.

653
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,237
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

654
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:02,838
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1 -0.

655
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,439
Very good.

656
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:05,904
How may l help you?

657
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:09,941
Well, l had my boys sign contracts

658
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:12,809
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

659
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:15,650
Yes, l believe one of the faculty
members mentioned that.

660
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,718
Very interesting scare tactic.

661
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,822
Well, in order for that
to be successful,

662
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:24,653
l need their teachers to fill out
weekly progress reports

663
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:27,920
so l'll know how the boys
are doing in their classrooms.

664
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:30,865
- Okay.
- Well, l haven't received anything

665
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:32,261
from their teachers.

666
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:39,172
l don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

667
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:43,243
Well, l took this job with the
understanding l could do it my way.

668
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:44,840
And you can.

669
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:46,810
Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

670
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:48,449
l'll remember to bring it up.

671
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:52,281
Why, that would be great.
Thank you, ma'am.

672
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:55,386
Thank you, sir.

673
00:40:57,926 --> 00:40:59,894
Bring it in, guys.

674
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:02,129
Let's go, hustle up.

675
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:04,128
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

676
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,298
All right, that's it for today.

677
00:41:07,502 --> 00:41:10,267
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

678
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:14,909
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

679
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,471
Clyde.

680
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,844
Mr. Cruz.

681
00:41:29,157 --> 00:41:31,887
l'm impressed with
what you've done.

682
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,626
But you came up short.

683
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,627
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 push-ups.

684
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,696
Please leave my gym.

685
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,195
Thanks, Clyde.

686
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,940
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

687
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,406
l'll do push-ups for him.

688
00:41:58,285 --> 00:41:59,775
You said we're a team.

689
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:03,582
One person struggles,
we all struggle.

690
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:06,851
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

691
00:42:23,476 --> 00:42:25,000
l'll do some.

692
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:27,772
l'll run suicides too.

693
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,114
l'll do some too.

694
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,286
Clyde, keep count.

695
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,462
Call me when they're done.

696
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,060
Defense! Defense!

697
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,329
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

698
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,801
Let's go.

699
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,666
Ball, ball, ball.

700
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,008
Ball, ball, ball.

701
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,169
- Yeah!
- Go.

702
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,145
Move your feet, move your feet.

703
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:44,319
Go, defense. Go.

704
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:46,746
Good job. Good job.

705
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,183
- Worm.
- White ball.

706
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:52,555
Palms up, move your feet, right?
Come out. Come out. Come out.

707
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,252
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

708
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,027
Hey, hey.

709
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:02,193
What is your deepest fear,
young man?

710
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:05,566
Go on.

711
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,242
Why he keep saying that, ''What's
your deepest fear?'' What that mean?

712
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:12,413
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

713
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:15,514
Move. Move. Move.

714
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:17,548
No, one more pass.

715
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,058
Hands up.

716
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:15,167
Three points, Cruz!

717
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,174
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

718
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:22,642
You do that again and you're going
to be glued to the bench.

719
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:28,516
- Swing it.
- Right here.

720
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:35,224
Come on, last kick.

721
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:37,918
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

722
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:48,869
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

723
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:51,304
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah. Delilah.

724
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,876
Come on, come on, come on.

725
00:45:54,112 --> 00:45:56,579
- Shot.
- Yeah, Jason.

726
00:46:00,284 --> 00:46:01,308
Kenyon, pose for me.

727
00:46:02,486 --> 00:46:05,047
- Smile.
- Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

728
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:07,418
Just play the damn game.

729
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,218
Linda, Linda, Linda!

730
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,798
There he is. Yeah.

731
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:17,900
That's me, baby.
That's me. l did that.

732
00:46:18,102 --> 00:46:20,501
l drew that up. Yeah.

733
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:23,034
Run it again.

734
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:27,339
All right, 1 -4, 1 -4.
Linda, Linda, Linda!

735
00:46:31,948 --> 00:46:35,076
All day, baby. All day!
Can't stop that.

736
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:37,185
Can't stop that!

737
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:42,280
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

738
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,658
Look at that bow. Look at that.

739
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:50,594
l tied that. l tied that shit.

740
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,768
Can l get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

741
00:46:53,737 --> 00:46:55,203
Are you crazy?

742
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,762
What is wrong with you?

743
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:00,237
What's wrong with all of you?

744
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:04,009
Since when is winning not enough?

745
00:47:04,214 --> 00:47:07,580
Playing hard not enough?

746
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:11,453
No, you have to humiliate
your opponent.

747
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:14,452
Taunt him after every score.

748
00:47:14,923 --> 00:47:17,390
You won four games last season.

749
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:18,786
Four.

750
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:22,225
What gives you the right
to taint the game that l love

751
00:47:22,431 --> 00:47:25,127
with trash talk and taunting?

752
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:28,633
What gives you the right to wear
Richmond on your chests

753
00:47:28,837 --> 00:47:29,928
and act like punks?

754
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,572
- Coach, they were jawing too.
- So?

755
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,399
You can't show some class?

756
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:37,076
Act like a champion?

757
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:42,744
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

758
00:47:43,284 --> 00:47:45,650
On the line. Now.

759
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:48,845
- Damn.
- Oh, man, come on.

760
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:08,145
Listen, shorty, l'm just gonna be real
with you, okay?

761
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:10,302
You're my girl.

762
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:13,945
l get out on that court
and everything is just getting crazy,

763
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:16,876
all l gotta do is just think about you.

764
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,277
Mr. Lyle.

765
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,349
Why aren't you in...

766
00:48:22,422 --> 00:48:25,186
- ...geometry?
- l'm going there right now, sir.

767
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:27,890
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

768
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:29,959
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

769
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:31,754
Go to class.

770
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:40,326
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

771
00:48:40,538 --> 00:48:43,736
- So if any of you need extra time--
- Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

772
00:48:43,976 --> 00:48:46,035
- Yes.
- l...

773
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:49,378
...don't see Junior Battle
in this class.

774
00:48:49,582 --> 00:48:52,482
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

775
00:48:52,684 --> 00:48:56,677
We rarely see him, but when we do,
it's always special.

776
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,155
Thank you.

777
00:49:01,894 --> 00:49:04,885
''Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 1 9th.''

778
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:07,792
- Top 20, baby.
- We're 1 9th, dog.

779
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:10,263
''The Oilers have posted
a perfect 9-0 mark,

780
00:49:10,468 --> 00:49:12,459
winning on the road against
perennial powerhouses

781
00:49:12,704 --> 00:49:14,068
Xavier and Baxter Union.''

782
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:19,765
Junior, you should read
the rest of this.

783
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,808
They blowing you up
in this paper.

784
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:25,374
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

785
00:49:25,582 --> 00:49:28,278
- Man, shut up.
- Shut up, Maddux.

786
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:34,916
''Richmond center has been big
as the Oilers are 'boyed.'''

787
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:39,060
Buoyed. The word is ''buoyed.''

788
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:44,727
''Buoyed by Junior Battle's
1 9.8-rebound-a-night numbers.''

789
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:48,599
See, that's my big nigga
right there, son. Hey.

790
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:51,306
lf you was any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigga.

791
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:54,943
Sit down. Sit down!

792
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:10,317
''Nigger'' is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

793
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,387
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

794
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:17,429
Your using it teaches him to use it.

795
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:20,625
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

796
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,100
And when you're around me,
l don't wanna hear that shit.

797
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:25,863
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

798
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,540
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:50:27,742 --> 00:50:29,039
Yes, sir.

800
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,473
Mr. Worm,

801
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:35,149
what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

802
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:38,983
To win that state championship, sir.

803
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:44,217
Well, who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

804
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,490
Hell if l know, sir.

805
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:48,859
Does anybody know?

806
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,456
Okay.

807
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,528
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

808
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:02,875
My father's in jail, sir.

809
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:08,540
Well, l'm sorry to hear that, sir.

810
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:11,273
But that doesn't have to be your life.

811
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:14,052
My point's this:

812
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,586
l have four seniors on this team,

813
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:19,759
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

814
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,725
All of whom l think can play
basketball at the college level.

815
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,294
College.

816
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:29,301
That's a viable option for all of you.

817
00:51:29,702 --> 00:51:33,637
But you have to perform in the
classroom to have that chance.

818
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:36,369
You have to have a vision.

819
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:41,504
Tell me, how do you
see yourselves?

820
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,207
ESPN, baby.

821
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,984
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

822
00:51:49,187 --> 00:51:53,681
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't
see you in his classroom very often.

823
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:56,683
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

824
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,886
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

825
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,567
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

826
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:04,531
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play

827
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,330
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

828
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:11,006
And that's a shout out
to the rest of you.

829
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,607
You signed a contract.

830
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,505
You made a commitment.

831
00:52:14,712 --> 00:52:17,910
Now, l have your schedules and l'll be
getting reports from your teachers.

832
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:22,316
lf you don't perform in the
classroom, you will not play.

833
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:24,918
What's up with that?

834
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,120
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

835
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,526
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

836
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:38,133
Man, this is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

837
00:52:38,336 --> 00:52:41,362
That's 1 ,000 push-ups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

838
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,765
You wanna try for 2,000?

839
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:06,093
Young man, think about the choice
you're making if you walk out that door.

840
00:53:14,737 --> 00:53:16,706
To the baseline.

841
00:53:19,842 --> 00:53:24,006
All right. How about LaQuisha,
if it's a girl.

842
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:28,707
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto
called and they want they name back.

843
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:31,009
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

844
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:33,517
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

845
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,313
You're stupid.

846
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:40,052
All right, l was thinking
l could call her Harmony.

847
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:43,229
- l like Harmony.
- Harmony, oh, that's good. l like that.

848
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:46,696
- What did Kenyon say?
- Please, he want a boy.

849
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:49,267
- Figures.
- Speaking of Michael Jordan...

850
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,869
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

851
00:53:51,205 --> 00:53:54,696
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

852
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:57,275
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

853
00:53:58,379 --> 00:54:01,075
Guess he wants me all to himself.

854
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:02,306
See you later.

855
00:54:02,517 --> 00:54:04,178
Don't forget,
l need your notes for history.

856
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:07,581
- All right, l got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

857
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:11,715
l bought us tickets to the dance.

858
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,959
Why you telling these
loudmouth girls about the baby?

859
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:17,129
Now everybody's gonna know.

860
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,854
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

861
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:22,266
- lt's not people's business, Kyra.
- Why you jumping down my throat?

862
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:23,902
What's wrong with you?

863
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:29,237
Look, me and coach been talking,
and he thinks l can play college ball.

864
00:54:29,442 --> 00:54:30,466
All right, so?

865
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:33,868
So how am l gonna do that
and raise a baby?

866
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:40,107
l don't know. l mean,
l'm not saying it won't be hard.

867
00:54:40,853 --> 00:54:42,718
Hard? lt's already hard.

868
00:54:42,922 --> 00:54:44,480
The kid ain't even here yet
and l'm worried

869
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,818
about how l'm gonna feed it,
how l'm gonna pay for this and that.

870
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,487
Everything.

871
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:51,862
- l'm not ready.
- So, what are you saying?

872
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:55,158
You want out?
ls that what you're saying?

873
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:56,868
Go ahead and say it.

874
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:59,833
Look, if l wanted to be out,
l would've been out by now, Kyra.

875
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,734
That's not it at all. l love you.

876
00:55:02,141 --> 00:55:03,334
l wanna be with you.

877
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:05,566
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

878
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:07,142
l'm thinking about
what's best for us.

879
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,575
You're not trying to think about
what's best for both of us,

880
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:11,373
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

881
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:15,219
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond.

882
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,253
You wanna go play college ball.
So guess what?

883
00:55:18,456 --> 00:55:22,392
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

884
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:25,487
l'm ready enough to do what
l gotta do all by my damn self.

885
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,698
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

886
00:55:31,802 --> 00:55:32,962
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

887
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,662
Look, ma'am, we talked about this.
l don't see what the problem is.

888
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,398
Do you know what the APl is,
Mr. Carter?

889
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:38,939
No, l don't.

890
00:55:39,143 --> 00:55:40,804
The Academic Performance lndex.

891
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:44,037
They judge schools on a scale
of one to ten, ten being the best.

892
00:55:44,248 --> 00:55:46,682
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

893
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:48,146
No, ma'am, l have no idea.

894
00:55:48,352 --> 00:55:51,081
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have
been for the last seven years.

895
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:53,255
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

896
00:55:53,456 --> 00:55:55,823
So every year l have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

897
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:58,994
- Look, ma'am--
- Can l ask what it is you want?

898
00:55:59,196 --> 00:56:01,095
- l want my boys to go to college.
- College?

899
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,992
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50 percent of its students,

900
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,497
the higher percentage being girls.

901
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:08,568
Now, in my very educated opinion,
you have 1 5 players on your team,

902
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:10,500
you'll be lucky to graduate
five of them.

903
00:56:10,706 --> 00:56:12,503
l'm sorry, ma'am,
but l don't agree with you.

904
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,506
Look, these boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them--

905
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:18,179
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

906
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:23,011
- l suggest you start doing your job.
- And your job is to educate these kids.

907
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:26,813
l suggest you start doing yours.

908
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,562
Well...

909
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:44,128
...we had another good week.

910
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:47,671
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

911
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:50,741
But l'm on my own.
You're never here.

912
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,642
- lt gets crazy.
- Look, l appreciate everything you do.

913
00:56:53,848 --> 00:56:55,941
And l promise you-- We're closed.

914
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:58,711
--as soon as the season is over,
l will be here for you.

915
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,284
Mr. Carter?

916
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:02,078
- l'm--
- Junior Battle's mother.

917
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:03,847
Yes, ma'am, l remember you.

918
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,719
Willa. Willa Battle.

919
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:09,322
How may l help you, ma'am?

920
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,929
Mr. Carter, l got a phone call today

921
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,827
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

922
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:16,059
Now, they wanna see
Junior play this Friday.

923
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,602
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules--

924
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:20,330
And l agree with them.

925
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:23,100
l'm not here to argue
with your rules.

926
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:24,901
l'm not.

927
00:57:27,747 --> 00:57:30,181
Almost two years ago now,

928
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:34,680
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

929
00:57:35,388 --> 00:57:40,724
...killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me and for Junior.

930
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:44,092
After you lose a son...

931
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:50,224
...every time the phone rings,
your heart stops.

932
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:54,730
Now, l'm not asking
for special attention.

933
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:58,535
l agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

934
00:57:59,077 --> 00:58:02,706
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

935
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:06,782
Now, l could move to the Hercules
school district, and he could play there.

936
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:11,718
- But moving is not gonna solve--
- But l want him to play for you.

937
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:14,757
Look, l'm not gonna stand here

938
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,487
and say l know how it feels
to lose a son, because l don't.

939
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:23,562
And l do appreciate you
putting your trust in me.

940
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,567
But l need to hear that from Junior.

941
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,700
He in the car.

942
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,209
Junior!

943
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,579
Go on.

944
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:55,295
l'm sorry for what l said and did
at practice,

945
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:58,592
and l promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

946
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,039
Look me in the eye, sir.

947
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,678
Everything inside me tells me
if l take you back,

948
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,442
l'd be making a mistake
and you'll make a fool of me.

949
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,586
No, sir.

950
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:23,088
You owe me 1 ,000 push-ups

951
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:25,954
and 1 ,000 suicides
before you can play.

952
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:28,796
l'll see you at practice tomorrow.

953
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,864
Thank you, sir.

954
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:43,706
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

955
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:45,970
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

956
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,579
l don't know who you think you are.

957
00:59:47,815 --> 00:59:51,183
The next time you make a decision,
you better ask me first.

958
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,853
Yo, Junior,
you did your thing tonight, man.

959
00:59:54,055 --> 00:59:56,683
- Good looking out, yo.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

960
00:59:56,891 --> 00:59:59,485
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

961
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:04,159
l just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

962
01:00:04,365 --> 01:00:06,696
You have been invited.

963
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,392
- Yeah!
- Yeah, baby!

964
01:00:13,508 --> 01:00:15,271
Now, l have more good news.

965
01:00:15,476 --> 01:00:17,568
l spoke to Principal Garrison today.

966
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:21,646
She informs me that your teachers will
have your academic-progress reports

967
01:00:21,882 --> 01:00:23,782
prepared by the end
of holiday break.

968
01:00:23,984 --> 01:00:25,451
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

969
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:27,548
Yo, not only are our grades
all right, coach,

970
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,416
- but we undefeated, homeboy.
- Yeah!

971
01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:34,851
We undefeated
We undefeated

972
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:39,293
We undefeated
We undefeated

973
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:43,298
We undefeated
We undefeated

974
01:00:45,104 --> 01:00:48,596
Big ups to everybody who came out to
the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

975
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:50,367
Get down!

976
01:01:12,898 --> 01:01:15,730
So give it up for the new
kings of Richmond, y'all!

977
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,799
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

978
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:19,936
Yo, we 1 2-0, y'all,
and l just wanna say

979
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:22,800
l wanna see all the beautiful people
up at that tournament.

980
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:24,531
You know!

981
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:27,505
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on
the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

982
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:29,440
when the Richmond Oilers
roll into town.

983
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,876
Holla!

984
01:02:52,294 --> 01:02:54,626
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink!

985
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:56,626
- You're pregnant, girl.
- Stop.

986
01:02:56,831 --> 01:02:58,059
lt's soda, all right?

987
01:02:58,266 --> 01:02:59,995
So why don't you just go
back downstairs

988
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,065
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

989
01:03:02,269 --> 01:03:04,499
lt ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

990
01:03:04,705 --> 01:03:06,367
- That ain't shit.
- Whatever.

991
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,475
You shouldn't be here.
lf you're serious about this,

992
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,473
you need to check this bullshit.
Because if not--

993
01:03:10,712 --> 01:03:13,942
lf not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold
my hand through an abortion?

994
01:03:14,148 --> 01:03:16,116
- ls that what you want?
- l don't know what l want.

995
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:17,807
You so damn sure you wanna
have this baby,

996
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:19,542
why don't you tell me how
it's gonna be.

997
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,448
Everything's great, right?

998
01:03:21,655 --> 01:03:24,282
Your cousin is 1 9 with two kids
already, Kyra.

999
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,855
lt's great?

1000
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,925
lt was great when we
was getting down.

1001
01:03:28,128 --> 01:03:29,823
You ain't having no second
thoughts about that.

1002
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,328
You loved me
when it came to that.

1003
01:03:34,335 --> 01:03:36,461
Look, Kyra, l can't tell you
what to do,

1004
01:03:36,903 --> 01:03:39,667
but l look around and l see exactly
how l don't wanna live.

1005
01:03:39,872 --> 01:03:41,169
Paycheck to paycheck?

1006
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:42,874
Dead-end job?

1007
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:45,441
You make it seem like everything's
gonna be all good,

1008
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:47,909
like everything's so wonderful.

1009
01:03:48,881 --> 01:03:51,179
You don't care about me.

1010
01:03:51,818 --> 01:03:55,549
You just wanna go to college,
play ball and forget about me.

1011
01:03:55,888 --> 01:03:58,288
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.
- l don't care what you say.

1012
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:01,323
- l'm having this baby.
- And then what?

1013
01:04:01,526 --> 01:04:02,993
You got everything figured out, right?

1014
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:06,094
So tell me what comes next.

1015
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:35,490
The third and final day of
the 22nd Bayhill Tournament

1016
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:37,752
finds the host team, Bayhill,

1017
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:42,126
trying to win the championship against
the surprising Richmond Oilers.

1018
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,732
Defense! Defense!

1019
01:04:43,934 --> 01:04:45,333
Get your hands up!

1020
01:04:50,841 --> 01:04:52,536
Get that ball!

1021
01:05:01,918 --> 01:05:06,322
Richmond uses their last timeout with
1:20 remaining in the fourth quarter

1022
01:05:06,524 --> 01:05:08,855
- and Bayhill up by six.
- Time out!

1023
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:14,286
Come on, man.
We still in the game. Come on.

1024
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:26,609
Don't panic.

1025
01:05:27,343 --> 01:05:29,311
We're six down with 1 :20 left, right?

1026
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:31,343
We've been in these guys' ass
the whole game.

1027
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:32,741
We can do this.

1028
01:05:32,948 --> 01:05:35,348
- This is our time, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1029
01:05:35,984 --> 01:05:38,612
All right, set up the 1 -4.
Run Candy.

1030
01:05:38,821 --> 01:05:40,413
Damien's gonna hit the three.

1031
01:05:40,622 --> 01:05:43,215
Kenyon, Lyle,
set a hard screen down here.

1032
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:46,052
When he hits the three,
go right into Diane.

1033
01:05:46,261 --> 01:05:47,523
Pressure the inbound pass.

1034
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,357
Suffocate that pass.

1035
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:51,192
l want the ball back!

1036
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,231
- Come on, baby, lock up.
- Hands in.

1037
01:05:53,435 --> 01:05:55,459
- Let's go.
- ''Our time'' on three!

1038
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:57,728
- One, two, three!
- Our time!

1039
01:05:57,972 --> 01:05:59,337
Come on, let's go.

1040
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:08,946
One, two, three, Cougars!

1041
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,777
Let's go, guys!

1042
01:06:17,058 --> 01:06:19,617
1 -4! 1 -4! Candy!

1043
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:23,422
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Ball, ball, ball, ball!

1044
01:06:24,165 --> 01:06:25,723
Watch him!

1045
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:31,159
- Watch your back! Come in!
- Watch the screen!

1046
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:33,371
Make the shot, Damien!

1047
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:39,308
Diane! Diane!

1048
01:06:39,513 --> 01:06:40,810
Defense!

1049
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:46,109
Go, go, go. Ball, ball, ball.

1050
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,079
Right there, right there. l got him.

1051
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,024
- Off him, man. Off him.
- Richmond's ball!

1052
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:54,954
Richmond's ball!

1053
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:56,418
Yeah!

1054
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:03,200
Kenyon! Kenyon!
Hattie Jean! Hattie Jean!

1055
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,630
Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean,
Hattie Jean!

1056
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:07,930
- D up!
- Check! Check!

1057
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:13,274
- Get there!
- Right there!

1058
01:07:19,651 --> 01:07:20,913
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1059
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:24,282
Move your feet!
Move your feet!

1060
01:07:34,499 --> 01:07:36,262
A foul, ref!

1061
01:07:40,237 --> 01:07:42,706
Right wing, Kenyon, wing!

1062
01:07:49,214 --> 01:07:51,841
Richmond takes the lead
for the first time in the game,

1063
01:07:52,049 --> 01:07:54,813
7 8 to 7 6.

1064
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,653
Slow the ball down!
Slow the ball down!

1065
01:08:05,062 --> 01:08:08,054
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!

1066
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:13,328
Defense! Defense!

1067
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:23,543
- That's a charge! Driving!
- Basket's good!

1068
01:08:24,281 --> 01:08:28,683
The basket counts,
and the Cougars have tied the game.

1069
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,520
That was a bad call, ref!

1070
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,988
- Basket counts! One shot!
- That's a charge!

1071
01:08:39,194 --> 01:08:42,426
- Foul's on red five. On the block.
- Don't tie me like that!

1072
01:08:43,299 --> 01:08:45,392
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1073
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:47,660
Please get in the box?
Please get your head in the game!

1074
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:49,132
Give me a break!

1075
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:51,567
Cruz. ln for Lyle.

1076
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:54,940

1077
01:08:55,477 --> 01:08:57,001
Let's go.

1078
01:08:57,812 --> 01:09:00,543
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1079
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:03,274
The ball's coming to you, Kenyon.
Run Linda. Run Linda.

1080

You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

Let's go! Let's go!

01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:16,591
One shot.

1085
01:09:17,097 --> 01:09:19,224
Backboard D!
Backboard D!

1086
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:34,871
And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead
with nine seconds left.

1087
01:09:35,082 --> 01:09:38,482
Go to war, Miss Margaret,

1088
01:09:38,685 --> 01:09:40,381
Let's go, let's go!

1089
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:42,887

1098
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,612

01:10:44,816 --> 01:10:47,579

Line up! Line up!
Let's shake hands.

1102
01:10:53,424 --> 01:10:55,517
That's what l'm talking
about, coach.

1103
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,895
- Way to go, Lyle. Good game, son.

1104
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:00,495
Ladies and gentlemen,

1107
01:11:27,524 --> 01:11:29,355
Hey, number three.

1108
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:37,555

1109
01:11:42,605 --> 01:11:44,162
Okay, cool.

1110
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:58,716
- All right, come on.
- All right.

1111
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:00,684
Watch his door.

1112
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:08,153
Yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.

1113
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:27,839
Load up, load up.

1114
01:12:45,765 --> 01:12:46,754
Tonya, guess what.

1115
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,093
We won the whole thing.

1116
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,595
That's right, 1 6-0.

1117
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:54,499
Oh, and here's the best part:

1118
01:12:54,707 --> 01:12:57,074
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1119
01:12:57,277 --> 01:12:58,505
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1120
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:00,373
l shouldn't tell you that.
He should tell you.

1121
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,378
l'll wake him up so he can tell you.
Hold on.

1122
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:07,382
Why don't you try their doorbell
with your ghetto self. Move.

1123
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:09,349
Can you reach that?

1124
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:18,692
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.

1125
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:21,399
Oh, you know, we try to be
up in here, baby.

1126
01:13:23,936 --> 01:13:25,426
Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1127
01:13:38,217 --> 01:13:41,344
Know what? He must be
in somebody else's room.

1128
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:56,824
Like l was saying, you know,
l'm Junior Battle. l'm the man.

1129
01:13:58,203 --> 01:13:59,761
- That's what l'm talking about.
- l know.

1130
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:02,940
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.

1131
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:17,353
Yo!

1132
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:19,887
You looking for your team?

1133
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,788
Yes, sir.

1134
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:26,153
Oh, baby. Hard biz.

1135
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:29,728
This is my style right here.

1136
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,661
Hey, yo, Lyle.
Let me get a coochie juice.

1137
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,233

1138
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:36,030
- Yo, Worm!

1139
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,867

1140
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:39,564
l'm open!

1141
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:41,636
Damien!

1142
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,813
- Damien, are you drunk?
- No. l don't drink.

1143
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,882
- Sorry about the thing.
- lt's okay.

1144
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,554

1145
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:57,385

- Why don't we go swimming.

1146
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,458
- We're going swimming?
- Yeah.

1147
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,128
Hey, l'm going swimming!

1148
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:04,287
l'm going swimming!

1149
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:08,001
You're going swimming
with the MVP!

1150
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:10,431
MVP!

1151
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,744
This water's probably
cold as hell, shorty. l don't know.

1152
01:15:25,953 --> 01:15:28,285
And swimming ain't my cup of tea,
baby. Know what l'm saying?

1153
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:31,390
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1154
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:34,255
- We don't have bathing suits.
- Right.

1155
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,464
Neither do we.

1156
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,664
Oh, so it's like that?

1157
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:42,563
Show me the money, then,
know what l'm saying?

1158
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,500
- Damn!
- Since it's like that.

1159
01:15:51,277 --> 01:15:55,078
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1160
01:15:55,549 --> 01:15:59,451
- Damn!
- You are looking right.

1161
01:15:59,653 --> 01:16:01,552
l like that.

1162
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:03,483
You guys coming?

1163
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:05,988
We're getting in there.

1164
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:09,585
l gotta take my chain off
so it don't turn green.

1165
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:13,528
Oh, man, l can't believe this.

1166
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:16,232
Heaven!

1167
01:16:37,322 --> 01:16:38,983
Excuse me.

1168
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,624
- Can l help you?
- l'm Ken Carter,

1169
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:45,626
coach of the Richmond High
basketball team.

1170
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:47,553
Richmond?

1171
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:50,893
- You're a little lost, aren't you?
- Well, l'm looking for my son.

1172
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:54,834
The cab driver told me he dropped
the team off here for a party.

1173
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,564
Excuse me.

1174
01:17:38,815 --> 01:17:40,339
Oh, my God, is that--?

1175
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,108
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1176
01:17:42,318 --> 01:17:44,309
You see your son?

1177
01:17:45,187 --> 01:17:46,848
Yes, sir, l do.

1178
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:54,392
Damien Carter.

1179
01:17:54,864 --> 01:17:57,457
Get your ass out of that pool.

1180
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,634
Yes, sir.

1181
01:17:59,768 --> 01:18:02,293
Richmond High players, let's go!

1182
01:18:03,205 --> 01:18:05,730
- Coach!
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1183
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:07,499
Worm?

1184
01:18:08,876 --> 01:18:10,468
What up, coach?

1185
01:18:10,678 --> 01:18:12,704
l got somebody l want
you to meet.

1186
01:18:13,015 --> 01:18:16,610
Now, l just met her,
but she is fine as hell.

1187
01:18:16,819 --> 01:18:19,616
- Her name is...
- Susan!

1188
01:18:19,854 --> 01:18:22,049
- Susan. He right!
- Oh, shit.

1189
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:25,088
My daughter, Susan.

1190
01:18:26,127 --> 01:18:30,029
You are not going to like
what happens in practice on Monday.

1191
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:32,461
You think you've run for me before?

1192
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:37,195
l come to your rooms to celebrate
with you, and you sneak--

1193
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,267
l end up taking a road trip
to the suburbs,

1194
01:18:43,477 --> 01:18:46,037
where l find my
drunk-ass point guard

1195
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:48,544
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1196
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:52,608
Actually, l was on the bottom, coach.
She was on the top.

1197
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:55,321
Worm, do you wanna be
on this team?

1198
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:58,116
Because you're about six words
from getting kicked off

1199
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:01,191
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1200
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:03,658
Cruz, open your eyes!

1201
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,060
Ghetto hoop stars!

1202
01:19:06,432 --> 01:19:09,993
Signing autographs
and humping the honeys!

1203
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:13,303
Well, l'm gonna show you
what humping is.

1204
01:19:13,807 --> 01:19:17,436
Coach, we won the tournament.

1205
01:19:17,644 --> 01:19:18,974
We undefeated.

1206
01:19:19,178 --> 01:19:21,271
l mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1207
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,811
Winners?

1208
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,713
Oh, no.

1209
01:20:39,522 --> 01:20:41,922
Oh, no, no, no.

1210
01:20:42,124 --> 01:20:44,684
Oh, no!

1211
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:50,559
God--!

1212
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:04,042
You guys are awesome!

1213
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:19,017
What's up, Cruz?

1214
01:21:19,227 --> 01:21:20,421
l don't know.

1215
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:23,257
Coach giving us a day off, l guess.

1216
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,991
Yo, l don't even know where
the library's even at.

1217
01:21:28,203 --> 01:21:30,296
- l bet you don't.
- ''Library's at''?

1218
01:21:30,505 --> 01:21:32,735
He don't know
where the library's at.

1219
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:49,380
Quiet.

1220
01:21:50,891 --> 01:21:52,483
Quiet!

1221
01:21:53,527 --> 01:21:57,019
Gentlemen, in this hand,
l hold contracts

1222
01:21:57,264 --> 01:21:59,630
signed by me and signed by you.

1223
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:04,430
ln this hand, l hold academic-progress
reports prepared by your teachers.

1224
01:22:05,038 --> 01:22:07,633
We have six players failing
at least one class,

1225
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:11,937
eight players getting incompletes
based on attendance.

1226
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:15,341
Gentlemen, you have failed to up--

1227
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:17,573
No, l'm sorry.

1228
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:20,276
We have failed.

1229
01:22:20,653 --> 01:22:22,587
We have failed each other.

1230
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:25,679
Now, there are some of you
who have upheld this contract.

1231
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:29,293
But know that we are a team.

1232
01:22:29,495 --> 01:22:32,396
And until we all meet the terms
of this contract,

1233
01:22:32,598 --> 01:22:34,327
the gym will remain locked.

1234
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:35,727
- Locked?
- What?

1235
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:38,129
- What you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?

1236
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:40,236
- He must mean for the day.
- Mr. Thompson,

1237
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:43,670
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have
generously volunteered their time

1238
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,365
to help us reach our goals.

1239
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,203
But, coach, l have a 3.3.

1240
01:22:47,446 --> 01:22:48,811
That's good, sir.

1241
01:22:49,014 --> 01:22:51,039
Do you score all the points
for the team too?

1242
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:57,083
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1243
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,516
Do you know what Oilers
stands for?

1244
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:05,793
Sir?

1245
01:23:06,598 --> 01:23:09,396
Know that you're not just
walking out on me.

1246
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:11,625
You're walking out on them.

1247
01:23:12,436 --> 01:23:14,336
l had to beg you.

1248
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,734
And then l ran all those sprints.

1249
01:23:19,543 --> 01:23:21,010
l did all that shit.

1250
01:23:21,245 --> 01:23:25,340
l killed myself for you, sir,
to get back on the team.

1251
01:23:28,853 --> 01:23:30,616
This is bullshit.

1252
01:23:53,543 --> 01:23:56,512
You put a lock on the gym and forced
them to meet you in the library?

1253
01:23:56,746 --> 01:23:58,235
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison.

1254
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,471
l'm surprised you know
where my office is.

1255
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:02,240
Take the lock off that gym.

1256
01:24:02,484 --> 01:24:03,951
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1257
01:24:04,153 --> 01:24:05,746
Maybe someone on the other end
of that phone

1258
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:07,650
has a solution to our problem.

1259
01:24:07,857 --> 01:24:10,950
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter,
but your methods are a bit extreme.

1260
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,094
You painted an extreme picture.

1261
01:24:13,295 --> 01:24:16,128
No one expects them to graduate,
no one expects them to go to college.

1262
01:24:16,565 --> 01:24:19,090
So you take away basketball,
the one area of their lives

1263
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:21,200
- where they have some success?
- Yes, ma'am.

1264
01:24:21,402 --> 01:24:23,029
And you challenge them
academically?

1265
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:24,966
- Yes, ma'am.
- And what if they fail?

1266
01:24:25,174 --> 01:24:27,267
Then we've failed.

1267
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:31,102
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter,
both you and l know

1268
01:24:31,346 --> 01:24:33,575
that for some of these kids,
this basketball season

1269
01:24:33,781 --> 01:24:36,375
will be the highlight of their lives.

1270
01:24:37,351 --> 01:24:40,946
Well, l think that's the problem.
Don't you?

1271
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,247
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.

1272
01:25:08,448 --> 01:25:10,211
Quite the Pandora's box
you've opened.

1273
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:11,850
Oh, l get all the blame now?

1274
01:25:12,052 --> 01:25:14,919
Let's just say l'm happy to give you
all the credit.

1275
01:25:15,121 --> 01:25:18,352
l've got every news reporter in town
waiting to speak to you.

1276
01:25:18,558 --> 01:25:21,253
Got a press conference set up
around the front of the gymnasium.

1277
01:25:21,694 --> 01:25:23,719
Coach Carter has taken the lockout
to the next level

1278
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:25,659
by canceling last night's game.

1279
01:25:25,866 --> 01:25:29,427
Richmond forfeited the game,
making it their first loss of the season.

1280
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:31,432
And for now,
the lock remains on the gym.

1281
01:25:31,637 --> 01:25:33,400
Here he comes.
Here he comes now.

1282
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:37,769
Coach Carter! Coach!
Can l get a question?

1283
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:41,402
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
l'd like to thank you for your patience.

1284
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:44,411
At this time, l'd like to introduce
Coach Ken Carter.

1285
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:46,881
You may direct
your questions to him.

1286
01:25:47,086 --> 01:25:51,682
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players
whose grades qualify them to play?

1287
01:25:51,891 --> 01:25:53,585
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1288
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:56,123
We support each other
on and off the court.

1289
01:25:56,327 --> 01:25:58,659
Anybody still think coach
bluffing now?

1290
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:01,457
l feel like running right up
in the middle of all those reporters

1291
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:04,101
and telling them l think this
is bullshit, son.

1292
01:26:04,303 --> 01:26:06,668
Maybe you should've gone
to class, Lyle.

1293
01:26:06,905 --> 01:26:09,635
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.

1294
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:12,843
- lt's Junior they should've locked out.
- Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1295
01:26:13,044 --> 01:26:16,377
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.
- Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1296
01:26:16,581 --> 01:26:19,310
- Junior, if you need help, l'll tutor you.
- Man, l don't need no help.

1297
01:26:19,516 --> 01:26:21,177
Well, he ain't lock us out
for no reason.

1298
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:24,818
We been tripping lately, man.
All y'all know it.

1299
01:26:25,023 --> 01:26:27,389
How do you think the community's
gonna react to this lockout?

1300
01:26:27,592 --> 01:26:30,685
l'm not really sure. l hope
they'll support these young men.

1301
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,885
What, man?

1302
01:26:33,096 --> 01:26:35,326
No, man, it's just funny, dog,
because, Junior, man,

1303
01:26:35,532 --> 01:26:38,729
you thought it was bad all us knew
your dumb ass was failing science.

1304
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:41,436
Now the whole world about to know
your dumb ass failing science.

1305
01:26:41,671 --> 01:26:44,368
- Man.
- Hey, man.

1306
01:26:46,276 --> 01:26:49,245
And you have Fremont this Saturday,
the biggest game on your schedule.

1307
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:53,312
Now, Richmond is gonna riot
if you forfeit that game.

1308
01:26:53,516 --> 01:26:55,074
Saturday is a long way off.

1309
01:26:55,284 --> 01:26:57,218
We'll see what happens.
Thank you all for coming.

1310
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,888
That's all the time l have right now.
l have to get back to work.

1311
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:02,991
Coach, have you talked to any
of the parents?

1312
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,655
Thank you for your time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1313
01:27:05,861 --> 01:27:08,523
l'd like to remind you that classes
are in session,

1314
01:27:08,731 --> 01:27:11,097
so as you leave campus,
please do so quietly.

1315
01:27:12,735 --> 01:27:13,929
l ain't turning the cheek.

1316
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:16,569
He come up in my 'hood,
l'm serious, it's on.

1317
01:27:16,771 --> 01:27:19,001
- Young sirs.
- lt's always been like that.

1318
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:21,175
lt's been a long day.

1319
01:27:21,376 --> 01:27:24,369
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1320
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:28,675
Let's take this time to say whatever it is
we want while the doors are closed.

1321
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:32,478
You have the floor.
This is about us.

1322
01:27:32,687 --> 01:27:36,020
Man, this shit ain't about us.
This is all about Coach Carter.

1323
01:27:36,224 --> 01:27:37,953
We're the basketball team.

1324
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,616
All l see is you on TV,
getting famous, eating that shit up.

1325
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:44,128
- ls that all you see?
- lt's all l see.

1326
01:27:44,332 --> 01:27:46,095
You ain't lying.

1327
01:27:46,668 --> 01:27:48,226
Well, let me tell you what l see.

1328
01:27:49,204 --> 01:27:53,936
l see a system that's designed
for you to fail.

1329
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:56,969
Now, l know you all like stats,
so let me give you some.

1330
01:27:57,277 --> 01:28:00,974
Richmond High only graduates
50 percent of its students.

1331
01:28:01,181 --> 01:28:06,346
And of those that do graduate,
only 6 percent go to college.

1332
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:11,513
Which tells me, when l walk down
the halls and l look in your classrooms,

1333
01:28:11,725 --> 01:28:15,990
maybe only one student
is going to go to college.

1334
01:28:16,462 --> 01:28:20,057
''Well, damn, Coach Carter, if l ain't
going to college, where l'm gonna go?''

1335
01:28:20,299 --> 01:28:22,393
Now, that's a great question.

1336
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:28,073
And the answer for young
African-American men in here is this:

1337
01:28:28,307 --> 01:28:30,207
probably to prison.

1338
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:34,546
ln this county,
33 percent of black males

1339
01:28:34,747 --> 01:28:39,183
between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.

1340
01:28:40,385 --> 01:28:42,115
So look at the guy on your left.

1341
01:28:43,022 --> 01:28:45,422
Now look at the guy on your right.

1342
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:48,956
One of you is going
to get arrested.

1343
01:28:49,628 --> 01:28:51,323
Growing up here in Richmond,

1344
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:56,160
you're 80 percent more likely
to go to prison than college.

1345
01:28:56,868 --> 01:28:59,336
Those are the numbers.

1346
01:29:00,137 --> 01:29:02,333
Those are some stats for your ass.

1347
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:05,440
Now, l want you to go home...

1348
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:08,072
...and look at your lives tonight...

1349
01:29:08,713 --> 01:29:11,113
...and look at your parents' lives...

1350
01:29:11,682 --> 01:29:14,651
...and ask yourself, ''Do l want better?''

1351
01:29:15,386 --> 01:29:17,547
lf the answer is yes,

1352
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:19,949
l'll see you here tomorrow.

1353
01:29:20,826 --> 01:29:22,657
And l promise you...

1354
01:29:23,627 --> 01:29:26,926
...l will do everything in my power

1355
01:29:27,164 --> 01:29:28,859
to get you to college

1356
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,330
and to a better life.

1357
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,690
l don't understand this.
lt's a letter, how can it be a number?

1358
01:30:01,998 --> 01:30:03,590
How are balancing
those equations coming?

1359
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,802
- l can't do this.
- Hold on. Come on, son.

1360
01:30:07,003 --> 01:30:08,163
Don't give up yet, son.

1361
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:11,168
Here's a story out of California
that's getting national attention.

1362
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:14,206
The entire boys' basketball team
at Richmond High School

1363
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:15,740
has been benched.

1364
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:18,469
The highly ranked Oilers have
a perfect season on the court,

1365
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,081
but some players were
in big trouble academically.

1366
01:30:21,283 --> 01:30:25,185
And in an unprecedented move,
Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,

1367
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:28,823
locked the gym and sent his players
straight to the library.

1368
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,184
Now, at the start of the season,

1369
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:32,985
l understand you made all of
your players sign a contract

1370
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:34,524
before they could join the team.

1371
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,787
What exactly were the conditions
of that contract?

1372
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,500
The contract states that
the players must maintain

1373
01:30:39,735 --> 01:30:41,293
a 2.3 grade point average

1374
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:43,903
and that the players must
attend all their classes

1375
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:46,437
and sit in the front row
of those classes.

1376
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,735
Well, Coach Carter, it's an
unusual strategy, and a risky one

1377
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,809
in a sense, in light of
your team's winning record,

1378
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:55,141
but l think there's gonna be a lot of
people out there pleased to learn

1379
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,978
that at least somebody still cares
about the concept of a student athlete.

1380
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,882
Thanks a lot for joining us today.

1381
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:08,354
l'm sorry to disturb you.

1382
01:31:08,595 --> 01:31:11,530
l'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond
High School basketball team.

1383
01:31:11,731 --> 01:31:12,857
Oh, yeah.

1384
01:31:13,099 --> 01:31:14,726
l need to ask you a favor.

1385
01:31:14,935 --> 01:31:18,098
My team is studying in the library,
and l've been trying to tell them

1386
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,273
that brains and beauty
are a perfect combination.

1387
01:31:20,473 --> 01:31:21,440
Know what l'm saying?

1388
01:31:21,641 --> 01:31:23,370
l mean, l'm Worm, baby.

1389
01:31:23,577 --> 01:31:25,477
How would you like
to watch the Worm work?

1390
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,613
Hey, where did you get
that backpack?

1391
01:31:27,814 --> 01:31:28,906
Watch out, Too Short.

1392
01:31:29,115 --> 01:31:34,575
Why study earth science
or history or algebra?

1393
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:40,189
Getting good grades in those subjects,
combined with basketball skills,

1394
01:31:40,427 --> 01:31:43,395
can get you into college.

1395
01:31:43,629 --> 01:31:46,530
Girl, you should've bought it.
l would've worn it.

1396
01:31:56,007 --> 01:31:58,977
You selfish son of a bitch.
You snake.

1397
01:31:59,178 --> 01:32:01,408
- Miss--
- No, no, don't ''miss'' me, snake.

1398
01:32:01,614 --> 01:32:03,081
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1399
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:06,079
Now, after all the things that my son
has been through for your team,

1400
01:32:06,284 --> 01:32:08,479
for you to go lock up
this gym like this, how dare you...

1401
01:32:25,203 --> 01:32:26,693
Open up the damn gym!

1402
01:32:26,904 --> 01:32:29,099
Let the boys play!

1403
01:32:34,077 --> 01:32:35,874
What's up, little cousin?

1404
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:38,014
How you doing?

1405
01:32:38,383 --> 01:32:39,475
Got something for me?

1406
01:32:41,451 --> 01:32:42,941
That's what l'm talking about.

1407
01:32:53,429 --> 01:32:56,262
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.

1408
01:32:58,201 --> 01:32:59,725
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:32:59,936 --> 01:33:02,336
- Yeah? Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.

1410
01:33:02,539 --> 01:33:04,335
- Yeah. How you like that?
- Oh, hell no.

1411
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,735
- What? What?
- You wanna get out the car?

1412
01:33:06,942 --> 01:33:09,172
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

1413
01:33:09,378 --> 01:33:11,369
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.

1414
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:15,373
Trust me, you don't want me
out this car.

1415
01:33:15,584 --> 01:33:17,142
Yeah, see? Yeah.

1416
01:33:17,887 --> 01:33:19,218
- Get on!
- Don't be no punk.

1417
01:33:19,455 --> 01:33:20,422
Say what you gotta say.

1418
01:33:20,623 --> 01:33:22,648
- Come on back, punk.
- Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1419
01:33:22,892 --> 01:33:24,052
No, l ain't letting nothing go.

1420
01:33:24,293 --> 01:33:27,819
These people in Richmond--
Goddamn it!

1421
01:33:28,196 --> 01:33:29,163
- Relax, Dad.
- Damn it!

1422
01:33:29,364 --> 01:33:32,265
Relax, relax. Chill out.
lt's over. lt's over. All right?

1423
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:34,697
He doesn't mean anything. lt's over.

1424
01:33:34,903 --> 01:33:36,132
Let it go.

1425
01:33:36,339 --> 01:33:38,671
Come on, get back in the car.
Let's go.

1426
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:59,349
l think you know who she is,
but she's got a friend.

1427
01:34:59,585 --> 01:35:01,211
l mean, dog...
You gotta hook me up.

1428
01:35:01,453 --> 01:35:04,115
Why l always gotta hook him up?
Sound like l'm the Love Connection.

1429
01:35:04,356 --> 01:35:06,256
Just start a conversation.
l'll take care of it.

1430
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:08,187
- Yeah.
- Yes, girl.

1431
01:35:08,627 --> 01:35:10,424
You don't remember me, do you?
But, see...

1432
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:12,528
l was just ready to duff Duke out.

1433
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:15,199
- Some serious shit.
- You should have did it, man.

1434
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,028
You talking all that shit, just do it.
Know what l'm saying?

1435
01:35:18,236 --> 01:35:20,067
- You let somebody do that to you.
- l let him?

1436
01:35:20,272 --> 01:35:21,637
- Yo, Oscar, man.
- What?

1437
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,171
Don't go nowhere. l'll be right out.

1438
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,274
- l gotta talk to you.
- l already told you...

1439
01:35:25,476 --> 01:35:28,570
- No. You guys is kind of passing...
- l know l'm fine.

1440
01:35:28,779 --> 01:35:31,373
But l'm not feeling myself,
l'm feeling you.

1441
01:35:31,949 --> 01:35:35,249
Hey, l'm gonna holler at my boys
across the street for a quick minute.

1442
01:35:35,486 --> 01:35:36,680
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1443
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:38,388
- All right.
- You know who we are, then?

1444
01:35:38,622 --> 01:35:40,647
- Here they go.
- What do we have here?

1445
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:43,121
- The Three Stooges from Richmond.
- Punk, punk, punk.

1446
01:35:43,327 --> 01:35:44,726
- Larry, Co and Dummy.
- Bitches.

1447
01:35:44,929 --> 01:35:46,692
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
l mean, what the hell

1448
01:35:46,897 --> 01:35:50,297
is the bitchman from Richmond
doing on our side of the turf?

1449
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,000
You garbage.
l can't believe y'all won.

1450
01:35:53,203 --> 01:35:54,398
- Shut up, woman.
- Don't be--

1451
01:35:54,605 --> 01:35:56,800
l don't understand how y'all won.

1452
01:35:58,742 --> 01:36:00,538
- Y'all wack-star niggas.
- Y'all wacked.

1453
01:36:00,743 --> 01:36:02,108
Wacked.

1454
01:36:02,345 --> 01:36:04,210
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1455
01:36:04,414 --> 01:36:07,247
- l don't wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1456
01:36:09,152 --> 01:36:10,846
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1457
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:15,683
Let's do it, homey.
Let's do it, homey.

1458
01:36:15,892 --> 01:36:17,587
- What you trying to do?

1459
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:21,162
You feel me right now, huh?
You feel me right now?

1460
01:36:21,397 --> 01:36:24,126

1461
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:26,631
Keep it up the block, homey.

1462
01:36:26,835 --> 01:36:28,996
l'm right here. Right here.

1463
01:36:29,204 --> 01:36:31,069
lt's all good. Y'all brought a gun!

1464
01:36:31,273 --> 01:36:32,672
Pinole!

1465
01:36:32,908 --> 01:36:34,739
Bitch-ass...

1466
01:36:34,943 --> 01:36:36,911
Pinole, right?

1467
01:36:37,346 --> 01:36:40,611
- Are they serious?
- l'll knock his braids out.

1468
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,810
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.

1469
01:36:44,586 --> 01:36:46,348
- Know what l'm saying?
- Appreciate the backup.

1470
01:36:46,554 --> 01:36:47,953
Word.

1471
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:50,814
l'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1472
01:36:51,025 --> 01:36:52,458
- All right, homey.
- Good looking.

1473
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,060
No doubt.

1474
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:56,322
- l'm gonna check y'all.
- You got this.

1475
01:36:58,533 --> 01:37:00,660
This is my paper, man.
l'm not playing with you.

1476
01:37:00,868 --> 01:37:02,768
Then why don't you stop
getting in my face.

1477
01:37:06,874 --> 01:37:08,341
Renny!

1478
01:37:17,318 --> 01:37:19,309
Renny!

1479
01:37:26,793 --> 01:37:28,420
l can't believe--
He was just standing there.

1480
01:37:28,628 --> 01:37:30,357
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.

1481
01:37:30,564 --> 01:37:33,032
- Come on. Help me. Call 91 1 .
- Call 91 1 , man.

1482
01:37:33,233 --> 01:37:34,894
Yo, l need a phone.

1483
01:37:35,101 --> 01:37:37,865
l just need you
to stay with me, okay?

1484
01:37:41,508 --> 01:37:42,998
Hold his head up.

1485
01:37:48,981 --> 01:37:51,415
Somebody help me!

1486
01:38:15,274 --> 01:38:16,798
- Cruz?
- l wanna come back, coach.

1487
01:38:17,009 --> 01:38:20,000
- What's going on?
- l wanna come back on the team.

1488
01:38:22,113 --> 01:38:23,580
What the hell happened?

1489
01:38:25,283 --> 01:38:27,012
They shot him.

1490
01:38:28,286 --> 01:38:30,378
Renny. They shot Renny.

1491
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,551
l mean, we was just there.

1492
01:38:32,757 --> 01:38:35,055
We was just there.
Everything was good.

1493
01:38:35,259 --> 01:38:37,386
- Come inside. Come on.
- Everything was good, coach.

1494
01:38:37,595 --> 01:38:40,428
l mean, you know...

1495
01:38:40,632 --> 01:38:41,962
Come inside, son.

1496
01:38:42,165 --> 01:38:44,759
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1497
01:38:44,968 --> 01:38:48,301
l wanna come back on the team.
What do l gotta do to play?

1498
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:50,439
Don't worry about that, son.
Just come inside.

1499
01:38:57,047 --> 01:38:58,947
Whatever you want me to do,

1500
01:38:59,349 --> 01:39:00,748
l'll do it, okay?

1501
01:39:00,951 --> 01:39:02,145
Okay. Okay.

1502
01:39:02,352 --> 01:39:04,843
Okay. l got you.

1503
01:39:05,054 --> 01:39:06,954
Come on. Come on,
you're back with us now.

1504
01:39:07,156 --> 01:39:09,215
l can't believe they shot him.

1505
01:39:09,425 --> 01:39:11,121
Just come inside now, all right?

1506
01:39:11,328 --> 01:39:12,818
- Come on.
- l just wanna be on the team.

1507
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,019
Come on. Come on.

1508
01:39:14,998 --> 01:39:16,897
Whatever you want me to do,

1509
01:39:17,099 --> 01:39:19,624
l'll do it, okay?

1510
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:25,673
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1511
01:39:25,908 --> 01:39:28,535
for participation
in extracurricular activities.

1512
01:39:28,777 --> 01:39:30,803
- Yes, ma'am.
- And according to your contract,

1513
01:39:31,047 --> 01:39:33,277
the players are agreeing
to maintain a 2.3?

1514
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:35,416
That, among other things.
Yes, ma'am.

1515
01:39:35,618 --> 01:39:37,950
- Other things like...?
- Attending all classes,

1516
01:39:38,154 --> 01:39:39,678
sitting in the front row
of those classes,

1517
01:39:39,889 --> 01:39:41,583
and wearing a tie on game day.

1518
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,449
l see. Mr. Carter,

1519
01:39:44,659 --> 01:39:47,423
does the lockout include
practices and games?

1520
01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:49,722
And do you have
a set period of time?

1521
01:39:49,932 --> 01:39:51,796
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1522
01:39:54,235 --> 01:39:57,033
Please. Quiet, please.

1523
01:39:57,439 --> 01:39:59,532
That includes practices and games,

1524
01:39:59,741 --> 01:40:02,005
until we as a team
reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1525
01:40:02,744 --> 01:40:04,335
Please, quiet.

1526
01:40:04,945 --> 01:40:07,004
Please, quiet.

1527
01:40:07,247 --> 01:40:09,010
Quiet.

1528
01:40:09,551 --> 01:40:10,916
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1529
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:15,111
ln the interest of time, l'd like to open
this board meeting up for comments.

1530
01:40:15,322 --> 01:40:17,813
As a teacher, l was offended
when asked by a coach

1531
01:40:18,025 --> 01:40:20,050
to provide progress reports.

1532
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:23,661
Nowhere in my contract does it say
that l have to do so.

1533
01:40:23,864 --> 01:40:25,456
lt creates more work.

1534
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:27,929
This lockout has brought
negative media attention

1535
01:40:28,134 --> 01:40:30,899
that questions our abilities
as educators.

1536
01:40:31,205 --> 01:40:34,971
End this madness. End this lockout.

1537
01:40:37,311 --> 01:40:39,039
l'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1538
01:40:39,245 --> 01:40:40,439
That boy lives to play ball.

1539
01:40:40,646 --> 01:40:42,637
Comes to school every day now.

1540
01:40:42,882 --> 01:40:45,248
You take away basketball,

1541
01:40:45,518 --> 01:40:47,884
God knows what he'd be into.

1542
01:40:48,688 --> 01:40:52,215
Yesterday, he canceled
the Fremont game.

1543
01:40:52,425 --> 01:40:54,757
Now, that's the biggest game
of the year.

1544
01:40:54,961 --> 01:40:56,895
l have scouts coming
to watch my boy play.

1545
01:40:57,096 --> 01:41:00,190
- Me too.
- These boys are 1 6-0.

1546
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:03,561
This whole school, this whole
community, is behind this team.

1547
01:41:07,239 --> 01:41:09,435
Everybody goes to every game.

1548
01:41:09,675 --> 01:41:12,075
Basketball is the only thing
that these boys have got.

1549
01:41:12,278 --> 01:41:15,440
Are we gonna let Carter come in here
and take that away from them?

1550
01:41:15,647 --> 01:41:18,241
- No!
- l don't think so.

1551
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:19,644
Not gonna happen.

1552
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:29,756
- l'd like to make a motion.
- Yes, Mr. Walters?

1553
01:41:30,128 --> 01:41:34,428
l move that we remove Mr. Carter
as head basketball coach.

1554
01:41:38,068 --> 01:41:40,730
Order, please. Order.

1555
01:41:40,971 --> 01:41:42,529
This board does not have
the authority

1556
01:41:42,773 --> 01:41:44,798
to terminate employment
of a staff position.

1557
01:41:45,042 --> 01:41:49,376
Then l move we end the lockout
and let the kids play.

1558
01:41:50,614 --> 01:41:52,206
l second the motion.

1559
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:53,781
- Okay.
- lf l may?

1560
01:41:53,984 --> 01:41:55,315
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1561
01:41:55,519 --> 01:41:57,544
You really need to consider
the message

1562
01:41:57,755 --> 01:41:59,382
that you're sending these boys.

1563
01:41:59,722 --> 01:42:03,783
lt's the same message that we
as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1564
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:06,553
which is that they are above the law.

1565
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:10,364
Now, l'm trying to teach these boys
the discipline that will inform their lives

1566
01:42:10,568 --> 01:42:12,228
and give them choices.

1567
01:42:12,569 --> 01:42:16,869
lf you endorse the fact
that 1 5-, 1 6- and 1 7-year-olds

1568
01:42:17,106 --> 01:42:20,598
don't have to honor the simple rules
of a basketball contract,

1569
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:23,937
how long do you think it'll be before
they're out there breaking laws?

1570
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:28,150
Now, l played basketball
at Richmond 30 years ago.

1571
01:42:28,384 --> 01:42:30,682
lt was the same thing then.

1572
01:42:30,887 --> 01:42:33,253
Some of my teammates
ended up in prison.

1573
01:42:33,456 --> 01:42:35,719
Some of them ended up dead.

1574
01:42:35,924 --> 01:42:38,859
l took this job because
l wanted to effect change

1575
01:42:39,061 --> 01:42:40,528
in a special group of young men,

1576
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:44,665
and this is the only way
l know how to do that.

1577
01:42:46,068 --> 01:42:48,127
lf you vote to end the lockout,

1578
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:51,396
you won't have to terminate me.
l'll quit.

1579
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,039
Good.

1580
01:42:58,613 --> 01:43:00,877
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1581
01:43:02,984 --> 01:43:05,680
The board now recognizes
five voting members.

1582
01:43:05,887 --> 01:43:09,721
ln this instance, we will be accepting
the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1583
01:43:10,224 --> 01:43:13,887
Now, l put to those members
the vote on whether or not

1584
01:43:14,095 --> 01:43:15,892
to end the lockout.

1585
01:43:16,097 --> 01:43:18,190
All those in favor
of ending the lockout

1586
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:21,492
will raise their right hand
when called upon.

1587
01:43:21,735 --> 01:43:26,069
l will vote first
by not raising my hand.

1588
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:29,335
Principal Garrison?

1589
01:43:33,146 --> 01:43:35,740
Valerie Walker.

1590
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,744
Benson Chiu.

1591
01:43:41,121 --> 01:43:42,884
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1592
01:43:45,124 --> 01:43:47,093
And Ms. Nyugen.

1593
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:49,592
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1594
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:07,607
The lockout ends with a vote
of 4 to 2.

1595
01:44:07,813 --> 01:44:11,078
lf there's no other business,
this board meeting is adjourned.

1596
01:44:11,784 --> 01:44:13,251
Thank you all for coming.

1597
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:32,560
Mr. Carter.

1598
01:44:32,804 --> 01:44:35,272
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1599
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:39,639
Look, l know we haven't always seen
eye to eye,

1600
01:44:39,844 --> 01:44:42,607
but you've done such a great job with
these boys, it seems wrong to just--

1601
01:44:42,813 --> 01:44:46,682
Look. No offense, ma'am,
but all the work l did with those boys

1602
01:44:46,884 --> 01:44:48,579
was negated when they ended
the lockout.

1603
01:44:49,053 --> 01:44:50,452
l don't think that's true, l--

1604
01:44:50,655 --> 01:44:52,589
The board sent the message
loud and clear.

1605
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:54,552
Winning basketball games
is more important

1606
01:44:54,758 --> 01:44:57,283
than graduating from high school
and going to college.

1607
01:44:57,494 --> 01:45:01,157
l'm sorry, l just can't support
that message.

1608
01:45:48,811 --> 01:45:54,271
Sir, they can cut the chain off the
door, but they can't make us play.

1609
01:45:56,484 --> 01:46:00,443
We've decided we're gonna finish
what you started, sir.

1610
01:46:01,356 --> 01:46:03,153
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1611
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:05,015
We got shit to do, sir.

1612
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:21,173
Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

1613
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:24,368
Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure.

1614
01:46:25,313 --> 01:46:28,713
lt is our light, not our darkness
that most frightens us.

1615
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:30,983
Your playing small
does not serve the world.

1616
01:46:31,185 --> 01:46:32,812
There is nothing enlightened
about shrinking

1617
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,750
so that other people
won't feel insecure around you.

1618
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:39,748
We were all meant to shine,
as children do.

1619
01:46:39,992 --> 01:46:42,962
lt's not just in some of us,
it's in everyone.

1620
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:45,388
And as we let our own light shine,

1621
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:48,430
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

1622
01:46:48,936 --> 01:46:51,904
As we are liberated
from our own fear,

1623
01:46:52,338 --> 01:46:54,966
our presence automatically
liberates others.

1624
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:03,714
Sir, l just wanna say thank you.

1625
01:47:06,085 --> 01:47:07,882
You saved my life.

1626
01:47:16,795 --> 01:47:19,195
Thank you, sirs.

1627
01:47:21,733 --> 01:47:23,964
All of you.

1628
01:48:06,243 --> 01:48:09,735
Academic-progress reports,
young men.

1629
01:48:09,947 --> 01:48:12,744
These things are...

1630
01:48:13,183 --> 01:48:15,378
...unbelievable.

1631
01:48:15,885 --> 01:48:18,649
l know you've been trying.

1632
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:24,248
l guess there's only one way
to say this.

1633
01:48:25,695 --> 01:48:27,925
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal.
Let's play ball.

1634
01:48:33,503 --> 01:48:35,732
Rich what? Richmond!

1635
01:48:35,938 --> 01:48:38,338
Rich what? Richmond!

1636
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,531
Rich what? Richmond!

1637
01:49:07,636 --> 01:49:09,331
Hustle back. Get back, get back.

1638
01:49:11,005 --> 01:49:12,870
Set it, Worm. Set it.

1639
01:49:13,407 --> 01:49:15,307
Watch baseline.

1640
01:49:15,509 --> 01:49:17,773
- Take it.
- Take it, come on.

1641
01:49:20,415 --> 01:49:22,848
- Yes!
- Find a man. Find a man.

1642
01:49:26,254 --> 01:49:28,154
Swing it, swing it.

1643
01:49:28,789 --> 01:49:30,780
Go, go, go.

1644
01:49:33,394 --> 01:49:35,384
Go, go.

1645
01:49:35,629 --> 01:49:37,062
Come on!

1646
01:49:47,107 --> 01:49:48,369
Go Richmond!

1647
01:49:48,842 --> 01:49:50,742
Hold the ball, hold the ball!

1648
01:49:53,546 --> 01:49:57,072
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1649
01:49:57,283 --> 01:50:01,380
five, four, three, two, one,

1650
01:50:01,621 --> 01:50:02,883
see you!

1651
01:50:10,462 --> 01:50:12,657
- Great game, coach.
- Good game.

1652
01:50:16,635 --> 01:50:19,935
Richmond returns from their lockout
and keeps their streak alive

1653
01:50:20,139 --> 01:50:21,436
at 1 7 games.

1654
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:25,906
A team that won only four games
last year is now a Cinderella team

1655
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:28,306
that has to be thinking
that there's a chance

1656
01:50:28,514 --> 01:50:31,074
of getting the phone call
to come to the dance.

1657
01:50:31,283 --> 01:50:33,546
ls Richmond headed
for the state tournament?

1658
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:48,725
So, what else y'all gonna do
at the park when you go?

1659
01:50:48,933 --> 01:50:50,924
- Seesaw.
- Seesaw?

1660
01:50:51,135 --> 01:50:52,727
- You're gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.

1661
01:50:52,937 --> 01:50:55,564
- Who's gonna push you?
- My mommy's gonna push me.

1662
01:50:55,772 --> 01:50:57,865
Yeah?

1663
01:50:58,075 --> 01:51:00,340
That's good.
l wish l could go with you.

1664
01:51:00,545 --> 01:51:03,446
- Come on, baby.
- But l'll see you later, okay?

1665
01:51:03,648 --> 01:51:05,775
- Bye.
- Bye.

1666
01:51:11,455 --> 01:51:12,615
How you been?

1667
01:51:14,758 --> 01:51:16,487
Good.

1668
01:51:17,094 --> 01:51:19,221
You look good.

1669
01:51:19,429 --> 01:51:22,398
Thank you. So do you.

1670
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:24,624
Considering.

1671
01:51:29,106 --> 01:51:33,041
You know, everything's been crazy,
with the lockout.

1672
01:51:33,242 --> 01:51:34,709
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1673
01:51:35,711 --> 01:51:37,474
For sure.

1674
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,581
Can we sit down somewhere?

1675
01:51:59,635 --> 01:52:03,196
l've been trying to get my head
straight about things.

1676
01:52:03,406 --> 01:52:05,999
A lot of things. Especially us.

1677
01:52:06,207 --> 01:52:08,869
- Kenny, l--
- Kyra, just listen.

1678
01:52:09,778 --> 01:52:11,837
Please.

1679
01:52:13,314 --> 01:52:18,445
For a long time, it's just been
my moms, my boys and you.

1680
01:52:18,686 --> 01:52:20,210
And that's what l counted on.

1681
01:52:20,622 --> 01:52:24,183
l'm trying to count on myself now,
and l'm all right and shit,

1682
01:52:24,392 --> 01:52:28,760
it's just, without you,
nothing good feels as good.

1683
01:52:29,196 --> 01:52:33,792
lt's like l'm missing
some happy part of me.

1684
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:47,010
l got you something.

1685
01:52:49,016 --> 01:52:50,745
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1686
01:52:52,885 --> 01:52:55,080
Shut up.

1687
01:52:58,859 --> 01:53:00,986
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1688
01:53:01,195 --> 01:53:05,893
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1689
01:53:06,098 --> 01:53:08,293
Oh, my gosh.

1690
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:10,264
l know you gonna kill it up there.

1691
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:12,938
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1692
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:15,538
l told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.

1693
01:53:28,019 --> 01:53:29,611
Kenyon...

1694
01:53:30,555 --> 01:53:32,614
...there is no more baby.

1695
01:53:36,429 --> 01:53:39,625
l decided not to go through with it.

1696
01:53:40,632 --> 01:53:42,759
Kyra.

1697
01:53:43,435 --> 01:53:46,131
l had a choice to make,

1698
01:53:46,338 --> 01:53:48,772
so l made it.

1699
01:53:48,974 --> 01:53:51,407
For me, Kenny.

1700
01:53:53,911 --> 01:53:57,279
Well, when...?

1701
01:53:57,482 --> 01:54:00,918
Why didn't you tell me?
l would have gone with you.

1702
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:07,454
l'm so sorry.

1703
01:54:08,659 --> 01:54:11,787
Kyra, l'm so sorry you had to
go through that by yourself.

1704
01:54:14,163 --> 01:54:16,962
My mom went with me.

1705
01:54:18,702 --> 01:54:20,329
But l think that...

1706
01:54:20,538 --> 01:54:26,237
l think you should go to school
and play ball and do your thing.

1707
01:54:26,442 --> 01:54:28,034
You know?

1708
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:31,714
l want that for you. And that's real.

1709
01:54:32,582 --> 01:54:34,880
l think you should be all you can.

1710
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,350
l want you to come with me.

1711
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:44,023
Kyra, l love you.

1712
01:54:44,627 --> 01:54:46,356
l want you to come with me.

1713
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:49,759
- You serious?
- l'm serious.

1714
01:54:50,566 --> 01:54:52,830
- Oh, my God.
- l love you.

1715
01:54:53,035 --> 01:54:55,266
l love you too.

1716
01:55:03,211 --> 01:55:04,405
Ken Carter.

1717
01:55:06,548 --> 01:55:08,812
l understand, sir.

1718
01:55:09,651 --> 01:55:11,675
All right. Thank you, sir.

1719
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:21,986
We're in.

1720
01:55:23,731 --> 01:55:25,323
That's what l'm talking about.

1721
01:55:31,906 --> 01:55:34,841
Guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.

1722
01:55:35,076 --> 01:55:37,340
lt's not gonna be easy.
lt's gonna be a long road.

1723
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:41,105
- We're a really low seed.
- Who did we get, coach?

1724
01:55:42,984 --> 01:55:44,576
St. Francis.

1725
01:55:44,785 --> 01:55:46,274
St. Francis?

1726
01:55:46,486 --> 01:55:49,649
Coach, they ranked number one
in the state.

1727
01:55:50,924 --> 01:55:53,951
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry
about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.

1728
01:55:54,395 --> 01:55:57,795
We got this. That's all right, baby.
One game at a time. We got this.

1729
01:55:57,998 --> 01:55:59,829
- All right, guys.
- lt's on.

1730
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:12,002
- Bring your A game, young man.
- Yes, sir.

1731
01:56:43,509 --> 01:56:47,467
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first round of the ClF playoffs.

1732
01:56:47,712 --> 01:56:51,148
St. Francis is one of the best
high school teams in the nation,

1733
01:56:51,349 --> 01:56:53,215
with Ty Crane
believed to be a shoo-in

1734
01:56:53,419 --> 01:56:56,114
for the top NBA draft pick next year.

1735
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,811
On the other side of the court
is Richmond,

1736
01:56:59,023 --> 01:57:01,253
a team that's had
a media-worthy season as well.

1737
01:57:01,693 --> 01:57:04,594
Richmond High has never played
in a state tournament.

1738
01:57:04,796 --> 01:57:08,128
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1739
01:57:13,204 --> 01:57:15,263
- Settle down, settle down.
- 1 -4!

1740
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:20,276
Ball, ball.

1741
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:22,068
Move, move.

1742
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,445
Good shot, baby.

1743
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,480
- Get back, get back.
- Run motion. Run motion.

1744
01:57:32,689 --> 01:57:34,281
Motion 44.

1745
01:57:38,562 --> 01:57:40,052
Right here, right here. Swing it.

1746
01:57:42,798 --> 01:57:44,561
Force him left. Force him left.

1747
01:57:50,372 --> 01:57:53,831
You gotta force him left.
The baseline's another defender.

1748
01:57:56,545 --> 01:57:58,274
D up!

1749
01:58:03,219 --> 01:58:05,187
Better get somebody else to hold me.
l'm dropping 50.

1750
01:58:07,555 --> 01:58:08,886
Set up!

1751
01:58:13,195 --> 01:58:15,857
Come on. Get on him, get on him.

1752
01:58:16,632 --> 01:58:19,122
Get over here and help.
He shouldn't be scoring.

1753
01:58:19,334 --> 01:58:20,995
Get back, get back. Bring it in.

1754
01:58:22,737 --> 01:58:24,932
Get back, get back.
Find your man, find your man.

1755
01:58:25,173 --> 01:58:27,164
Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1756
01:58:27,408 --> 01:58:30,843
Watch the trap. Motion. Motion.
That's the one.

1757
01:58:32,547 --> 01:58:34,845
That's it. Yes! Yes!

1758
01:58:35,049 --> 01:58:38,610
S-C-O-R-E! Score! Score!

1759
01:58:41,288 --> 01:58:43,085
Ball, ball. Ball, man!

1760
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:52,694
Lyle, stop the ball.
Less talk out there.

1761
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:07,039
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, Richmond!

1762
01:59:07,246 --> 01:59:09,908
You gotta help Junior
on the weak-side pick.

1763
01:59:14,521 --> 01:59:18,752
- Delilah! Delilah!
- Defense! Defense!

1764
01:59:18,958 --> 01:59:21,188
- Defense! Defense!
- Delilah! Delilah!

1765
01:59:21,394 --> 01:59:22,861
Delilah! Delilah!

1766
01:59:24,530 --> 01:59:27,123
- Get there, get there.
- Trap, trap, trap. Left side, left side.

1767
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:42,839
- Use the pick, use the pick.
- l got it.

1768
01:59:45,483 --> 01:59:48,680
- Yeah! That's what l'm talking about.
- Foul, number three.

1769
01:59:48,887 --> 01:59:49,946
- Hold up.
- Number three.

1770
01:59:50,156 --> 01:59:52,919
- Mustangs, bring it in. Bring it in.
- Count the basket.

1771
01:59:53,124 --> 01:59:55,456
- Damn.
- Timeout, sir. Time.

1772
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:58,356
Come here, come here. Damn it.

1773
02:00:00,298 --> 02:00:02,663
Come on, guys,
keep up the defense!

1774
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:05,368
Come on, what you gonna do?

1775
02:00:05,803 --> 02:00:08,499
We still in this game.
Come on, fellas.

1776
02:00:09,306 --> 02:00:12,640
Gentlemen, you told me
you deserved to be here.

1777
02:00:12,844 --> 02:00:14,401
Well, you're not playing like it.

1778
02:00:14,612 --> 02:00:17,479
All season long,
we played our game.

1779
02:00:17,681 --> 02:00:20,081
Right now, you're playing theirs.

1780
02:00:20,284 --> 02:00:24,186
When we step on the floor,
every second that clock is ticking,

1781
02:00:24,388 --> 02:00:26,412
we are pedal to the metal.

1782
02:00:26,623 --> 02:00:29,149
We run the ball.
We pressure the ball.

1783
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:34,662
And most importantly,
we control the tempo of the game!

1784
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:39,494
We make them play
Richmond Oiler ball.

1785
02:00:39,736 --> 02:00:41,704
Worm, you can take this kid.

1786
02:00:41,938 --> 02:00:43,428
Force him left,
and when he crosses over,

1787
02:00:43,673 --> 02:00:46,699
you jump him.
Damien, push the tempo.

1788
02:00:46,910 --> 02:00:49,242
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

1789
02:00:49,445 --> 02:00:52,972
Cruz, when you're in the game in
transition, take that jumper you love.

1790
02:00:53,416 --> 02:00:55,884
Junior, just keep doing
what you're doing.

1791
02:00:56,085 --> 02:00:57,950
Hold on to that monster.

1792
02:00:58,154 --> 02:01:01,452
You do those things, gentlemen,
and l guarantee you,

1793
02:01:01,657 --> 02:01:05,559
at the end of the game,
we will be there.

1794
02:01:08,063 --> 02:01:10,191
All right, hands in.

1795
02:01:10,433 --> 02:01:12,992
- Game time.
- All right, take control of this game.

1796
02:01:13,235 --> 02:01:14,395
Who's gonna win this game?

1797
02:01:14,636 --> 02:01:18,163
One, two, three, Richmond!
Let's go. Let's do this.

1798
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:24,600
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1799
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:34,755
- Get up, get up.
- Go, go, go.

1800
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:43,922
Yes.

1801
02:01:47,701 --> 02:01:50,068
- Reach-in foul.
- That's the only damn one.

1802
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:53,763
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.

1803
02:01:53,975 --> 02:01:56,443
Cruz. ln for Kenyon.

1804
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:02,680
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.
- Run it, run it, run it.

1805
02:02:16,696 --> 02:02:18,823
Get back, get back!
Everybody get back.

1806
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:21,128
Yeah! Come on!

1807
02:02:41,286 --> 02:02:43,015
Get back, get back, get back.

1808
02:02:52,498 --> 02:02:54,056
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.

1809
02:02:54,299 --> 02:02:56,324
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?

1810
02:03:04,842 --> 02:03:07,607
Take care of the ball, man.
l'm gonna catch my breath.

1811
02:03:16,854 --> 02:03:18,116
Come on. Get back, get back.

1812
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:24,821
Swing it right here. l got it.

1813
02:03:29,267 --> 02:03:30,666
Charge.

1814
02:03:32,702 --> 02:03:35,034
- Go get them, boys.
- Yeah, baby.

1815
02:03:35,238 --> 02:03:38,139
Charge, number 30. Red ball.

1816
02:03:38,341 --> 02:03:40,571
Come on, ref,
you wasn't even there.

1817
02:03:46,083 --> 02:03:49,246
- Red ball, red ball. Red, red, red.
- Yes. Yes.

1818
02:03:49,453 --> 02:03:50,750
- Richmond's ball.
- What?

1819
02:03:50,954 --> 02:03:53,320
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1820
02:04:00,796 --> 02:04:02,263
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!

1821
02:04:03,165 --> 02:04:05,634
- l know that's a foul.
- lt's all ball.

1822
02:04:05,836 --> 02:04:08,395
- What are you talking about?
- What's up, man?

1823
02:04:11,707 --> 02:04:13,675
Knock his bitch ass out.

1824
02:04:13,876 --> 02:04:15,810
Calm down, man.
We're still in the game.

1825
02:04:16,245 --> 02:04:17,371
Come on.

1826
02:04:18,113 --> 02:04:19,603
- Ease back.
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

1827
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:24,777
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.

1828
02:04:26,188 --> 02:04:28,713
Let's go, let's go.

1829
02:04:28,958 --> 02:04:32,051
All right, baby, it's all us now.
lt's all us. Let's go.

1830
02:04:41,269 --> 02:04:44,237
They're standing on the edge of a cliff.
All we gotta do is push them off.

1831
02:04:44,705 --> 02:04:45,730
We're gonna run Candy.

1832
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:47,931
Worm, you gotta sell them
the pass to Damien.

1833
02:04:48,143 --> 02:04:50,941
Junior, we come to you
on the weak-side seal.

1834
02:04:51,146 --> 02:04:53,272
But, gentlemen,
just because you deserve this

1835
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:55,072
doesn't mean they're gonna
give it to you.

1836
02:04:55,282 --> 02:04:59,150
Sometimes you gotta take
what's yours. You ready to do this?

1837
02:04:59,353 --> 02:05:00,877
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

1838
02:05:01,121 --> 02:05:03,453
- All right, hands in.
- Come on, take this.

1839
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:05,783
Richmond on three.
One, two, three, Richmond!

1840
02:05:13,233 --> 02:05:15,793
- Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.
- l got you. 1 -4, 1 -4!

1841
02:05:16,903 --> 02:05:19,565
- All right.
- Defense! Mustangs!

1842
02:05:19,772 --> 02:05:21,603
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1843
02:05:24,444 --> 02:05:26,571
Candy! Candy!

1844
02:05:30,316 --> 02:05:32,307
Ball, Damien.

1845
02:05:37,056 --> 02:05:39,785
- Move, move.
- Help, help.

1846
02:05:56,208 --> 02:05:58,267
Get back, get back, get back!

1847
02:06:02,681 --> 02:06:04,114
Junior, get back!

1848
02:06:15,025 --> 02:06:16,890
Hands up!

1849
02:06:31,008 --> 02:06:33,738
Yeah, that's what l'm
talking about, baby. Yeah!

1850
02:07:25,727 --> 02:07:28,855
Mustangs! Mustangs!

1851
02:07:30,132 --> 02:07:33,568
Hold on, hold on. Let me down,
let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

1852
02:07:36,270 --> 02:07:39,262
You're real, man.
l mean that. All right?

1853
02:07:40,074 --> 02:07:43,044
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1854
02:07:55,790 --> 02:07:58,554
Well, not quite
your storybook ending, huh?

1855
02:07:58,759 --> 02:08:01,124
Not for us, anyway.

1856
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:06,525
But you men played like champions.

1857
02:08:06,734 --> 02:08:08,395
You never gave up.

1858
02:08:09,203 --> 02:08:13,298
And champions
hold their heads high.

1859
02:08:13,506 --> 02:08:16,942
What you achieved goes way beyond
the win-loss column

1860
02:08:17,143 --> 02:08:18,940
or what's gonna be written
on the front page

1861
02:08:19,145 --> 02:08:21,671
of the sports section tomorrow.

1862
02:08:21,916 --> 02:08:23,678
You've achieved something
that some people

1863
02:08:23,917 --> 02:08:27,478
spend their whole lives trying to find.

1864
02:08:27,721 --> 02:08:33,682
What you achieved
is that ever-elusive victory within.

1865
02:08:34,993 --> 02:08:36,722
And, gentlemen...

1866
02:08:37,596 --> 02:08:41,033
...l am so proud of you.

1867
02:08:44,304 --> 02:08:48,171
Four months ago, when l took
the job at Richmond, l had a plan.

1868
02:08:48,841 --> 02:08:51,309
That plan failed.

1869
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:56,311
l came to coach basketball players,
and you became students.

1870
02:08:57,749 --> 02:09:00,081
l came to teach boys...

1871
02:09:00,619 --> 02:09:02,678
...and you became men.

1872
02:09:03,255 --> 02:09:05,052
And for that, l thank you.

1873
02:09:08,961 --> 02:09:11,929
lf someone walked in this door
right now

1874
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:17,727
and offered me the coaching job
at any school in the state of California,

1875
02:09:17,935 --> 02:09:20,700
you know which team l'd choose?

1876
02:09:20,905 --> 02:09:22,998
St. Francis?

1877
02:09:23,608 --> 02:09:25,838
l'm just saying, man.

1878
02:09:26,811 --> 02:09:28,870
Kenyon?

1879
02:09:32,716 --> 02:09:35,048
- Richmond?
- Rich what?

1880
02:09:36,219 --> 02:09:38,187
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

1881
02:09:38,388 --> 02:09:39,548
Richmond.

1882
02:09:39,756 --> 02:09:42,351
- Rich what?
- Richmond.

1883
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:44,720
- Where we from?
- Richmond!

1884
02:09:44,928 --> 02:09:47,362
- What's my hometown?
- Richmond!

1885
02:09:47,564 --> 02:09:49,589
- What do we love?
- Richmond!

1886
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,064
- Rich what?
- Richmond!

1887
02:09:52,065 --> 02:10:54,065
