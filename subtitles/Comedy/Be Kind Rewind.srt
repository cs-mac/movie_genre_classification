1
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,866
Everyone thinks Harlem
was the capital of jazz in the 1930s.

2
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:40,576
That all of New York flooded uptown
at night to party till dawn.

3
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,688
Nice story. But unfortunately.
It's just not true.

4
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:48,991
It was all happening in the little town
of Passaic. New Jersey.

5
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,702
Passaic was the capital of jazz
in the '20s and '30s...

6
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:55,310
...because of its own native son...

7
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:57,174
...Thomas "Fats" Waller...

8
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,013
...one of the greatest entertainers
of all time.

9
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,658
Chapter 1. the birth of Fats Waller.

10
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:07,130
It all began right here.
A hundred years ago...

11
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,772
...in Passaic. New Jersey.

12
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,705
Right here. On this block.

13
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:14,006
It was a different neighborhood then.
But look here...

14
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:15,845
...he was born at 261 Main Street.

15
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,856
When he was young. He used to follow
his father around the streets...

16
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:21,291
...because his father
was a street minister.

17
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:25,234
He started playing piano. As I understand.
Out in the streets here in Passaic...

18
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:26,430
...on a harmonium.

19
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:30,069
Poor boy put on pounds
faster than the price of aluminum.

20
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:33,414
One-forty-seven.

21
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:36,082
Thomas. You're gonna break
Dr. Benton 's scale.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,751
You're getting worse.

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,461
Maybe that's why he would have to play
a very huge instrument.

24
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:44,302
So he would spend nights here.
At the great organ.

25
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:47,073
Fats used the church
as his training ground.

26
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:51,155
And soon. All of Passaic
would know his name.

27
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:53,692
Fats lived his life all in excess.

28
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:58,462
Loads of music. Ioads of food
and loads of women.

29
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:03,377
Who would expect a simple influenza virus
would get him in his bed?

30
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,280
A sleeping-train bed. Though.

31
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:10,259
But still. The train had been stopped
in the freezing cold winter...

32
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,026
...in the train station in Kansas City.

33
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,368
Fats. Are you okay? Fats? You okay?

34
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:20,573
Is there a doctor on the train?

35
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:29,298
Fats was the star
that made the whole town shine.

36
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:42,058
Hey, Jerry, hand me Number 9.

37
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:47,064
I will give you

38
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:50,300
- Okay. All right.
- Number 9

39
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,368
Handing you number

40
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,484
- Would you shut up?
- Number 9

41
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,885
Could you just paint
and be quiet, please?

42
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,550
Knock it off.

43
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,891
It's terrible.

44
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,283
- What the duck, Jerry?
- What?

45
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:15,756
I asked you to give me Number 9,
the nose.

46
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,123
Yeah, that's what I did.

47
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,235
No, you didn't. This is Number 6.
This is the eye.

48
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:23,671
All right, well, how am I supposed to tell
the difference between a six and a nine?

49
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,371
Because we did both the eyes already,
you doofus.

50
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,575
Come on, get organized.

51
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:30,018
I told you, put the finished ones
in a separate pile.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,658
Look, what's the difference, man?

53
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:34,822
A nostril and an upside-down eye
are the same anyway. It looks fine.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,906
Oh, is that supposed to be funny?
Are you trying to say Fats had big nostrils?

55
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:41,602
- Jerry.
- Hi, officer, how's it going?

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,946
Look what happened. Last night,
some hoodlums came and did...

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,056
- Oh, really?
...all this stuff here, this...

58
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,718
- Here we go again.
- It's disgusting.

59
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,834
- I hate graffiti.
- Yeah, they even left the ladder.

60
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:55,371
That's, like, evidence.
We should confiscate it.

61
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,910
- Catch them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,912
You're getting on my nerves.

63
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,284
You keep this up,
you'll be spending the night in jail.

64
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:05,450
- Okay.
- Moron.

65
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,825
Lf... If they come back for the ladder,
we'll catch them.

66
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:11,906
Hey, fellas, is that supposed to be
Biggie Smalls or something?

67
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:15,103
No, man, that's that dead old blues guy,
Louis Armstrong.

68
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,617
No, my ignorant little buddies,
this is Fats Waller.

69
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,690
- Really?
- Famous jazz musician.

70
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,320
He was born in my building
about a hundred years ago.

71
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,803
- Ice cream. Anyone?
- Oh. Yeah.

72
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,313
That's what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,989
Mr. Fletcher, you know,
really, seriously...

74
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,686
...if you don't like the painting,
you can... You can tell me.

75
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:43,770
I know that there's something wrong
with the nose, I don't know if you noticed.

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,470
What about the authorities, Mike?

77
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,377
The city already has issues
with the building as it is.

78
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,987
Mr. Fletcher, you don't have
to worry about the police.

79
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:55,127
- I worked my magic on them.
- Yeah, he did confuse them.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,288
Okay, they think some gangsters did it.

81
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,493
- And you confused them?
- Yeah, with my finesse.

82
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:02,699
Yeah, I feel great. You sure
this is gonna bring us more customers?

83
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:06,077
I hope so. I mean, anyway, don't you think
it's time the people around here...

84
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,654
...started to learn a bit little about, you
know, the history of their neighborhood?

85
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,227
I mean, people don't even know
who Fats is.

86
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,095
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Hey. Hey. That's not true.

87
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,070
- We know who Fats Waller is.
- Is that right?

88
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:20,508
Bet you can't sing a jazz song.

89
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,583
- Oh, challenge.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

90
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:26,483
That's not jazz.

91
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:27,717
Fuzzy. Oh. Oh

92
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,857
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy jazzy had no hair

93
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,370
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn 't fuzzy. Was he?

94
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,140
Yes. He was. He was Fuzzy
Had a fuzzy face

95
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:42,619
Check this out and let me say
One thing to you

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,261
Watch me play my fuzzy bass

97
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:50,596
Standup bass.

98
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,313
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher.

99
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,009
It's all right, Jerry. I got it.

100
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:58,780
Actually, you gotta go back to work.

101
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,292
Duty calls. You gotta
go back to the microwave.

102
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,363
I think I saw one of your creations
just roll by.

103
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,628
- Turn the microwave on high.
- You think it's a joke?

104
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:08,332
Let me tell you, you're gonna
be responsible for my brain tumor.

105
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,706
- All of you guys are.
- Where the hell is Jerry?

106
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,110
Man, what's her problem?

107
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:14,618
She said she wanted a sporty car,
now she's freaking out.

108
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,882
You did that?

109
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:22,396
- I don't want this.
- Don't forget your salad bowl.

110
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:24,768
I told you she wouldn't be
into them big pipes.

111
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,673
Polish or not, she's still a girl.

112
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,215
Come on, Wilson.
She couldn't get the doors open.

113
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:31,821
Well, she could have went through
the window.

114
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,688
These damn helmets.

115
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,493
I don't think they're helping
with the microwaves at all.

116
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,001
Oh, you'll thank me.

117
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,108
- All right, l'll see you in the morning.
- All right, thanks.

118
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,546
Good night, Mike.
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

119
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,581
Good night, Mr. Fletcher.

120
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:20,147
A rent party was the place to be
in the '20s and '30s.

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,346
They were jumping.

122
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:23,584
If you didn't have enough money
to cover your rent...

123
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:27,963
...you'd invite a few musicians,
charge for drinks, and you'd get it on.

124
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,607
Everybody would throw
just a little bit in the pot.

125
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,643
A dollar. Whatever they could spare.

126
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:35,249
Jerry doesn't believe you've ever been
to a rent party, Mr. Fletcher.

127
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,445
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

128
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:38,955
Oh, man, I used to go to all of them.

129
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,289
That's where I'd meet
all the girls on Saturday night.

130
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:44,026
I can't imagine you with a girl,
Mr. Fletcher.

131
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:47,334
Oh, nice, that's great. That's perfect.

132
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,943
Yeah, what about you, Jerry?

133
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:52,643
I don't see much action
coming out of your trailer at night.

134
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,054
When I was your age,
my balls were flapping so hard...

135
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,993
...I had to scrape them off the ground
and beg them to come home with me.

136
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,569
- Come on, balls.
- Yeah, come on.

137
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,798
Come on. That's hilarious.

138
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,000
What about you, Mike?

139
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:07,114
When was the last time you heard
some action coming out of his room?

140
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:08,774
Why are you all worried about me for?

141
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:10,649
I heard some action sometime.

142
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,226
Now, it's more like a trumpet solo.

143
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,360
Trumpet solo.

144
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,471
Could you close your mouth
when you chew? Thanks.

145
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,371
How come you never got married,
Mr. Fletcher?

146
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:25,211
Well, the common story is...

147
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:28,619
...the girl that you was gonna ask,
you waited too long to ask...

148
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,127
...and she went on
and married somebody else.

149
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:34,394
And then you can't find anybody
that compared to her.

150
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,474
So, what happens? You get old.

151
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,556
Obviously we're looking
at a real improvement in quality of life.

152
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:51,705
These brand-new condominiums
are gonna bring us...

153
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,899
...the fresh blood
that we need for our community...

154
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,946
...and transform this slum forever.

155
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:00,453
"Slum"? Hey, this is not a slum.

156
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,653
Hey, sure, the place needs a few repairs,
but I'm taking care of it.

157
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,960
Look, look,
business is about to pick up.

158
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,366
I can feel it.

159
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,705
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher,
but the building is condemned.

160
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,649
It violates structural,
fire and plumbing standards.

161
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,587
I don't see wheelchair access.

162
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,524
Your video store is a tenement.

163
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:24,329
You have 60 days from this notice
of demolition...

164
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:27,476
...to bring it up to code,
otherwise we will have to demolish it.

165
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,637
- But we will relocate you...
- Yes.

166
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:32,720
...to a property
of proportionate fair-market value.

167
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,447
Projects aren't so bad, you know.

168
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,526
Move to the projects?

169
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,459
How am I gonna tell Mike?

170
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:44,737
Look, I just wanna improve the life
of the people of Passaic, that's all.

171
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:51,349
You know, you don't have to pay me
this month, Mr. Fletcher. I'm okay.

172
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,965
Don't worry about the money, Mike.
L'll pay you soon.

173
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:59,871
I n fact, I... I need for you
to take over for me.

174
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,104
- You're retiring?
- Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:05,047
This year's the 60th anniversary
of Fats' death.

176
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:08,681
And there's a ceremony
that's being organized in commemoration.

177
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,731
We gonna all get together
in that abandoned train where he died...

178
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,995
...and we're gonna play his records
until morning.

179
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,970
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:17,941
I wanna come. Can I come with you?

181
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,206
No.

182
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:21,318
I just told you,
I need you to take over for me.

183
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:25,449
Oh, right, right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay.

184
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,859
You want me to just run the shop
while you're gone?

185
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,399
You think I could do that?

186
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,300
You tell me.

187
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,468
I'm not gonna let you down,
Mr. Fletcher.

188
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,674
Good, just don't set the place on fire.

189
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:39,846
Oh, no. Service, quality, safety,
you can count on that.

190
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:41,890
Excellent.

191
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:44,190
Here's something really important

192
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:45,458
You must never...

193
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:47,605
Slam the door, because
the building will collapse.

194
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,769
No, Mike. I mean, yes,
but that's not what I wanted to say.

195
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:54,646
- You must never...
- Use the v CR to rewind the tapes...

196
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,189
No. Why do you always
have to finish my sentences?

197
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,522
- Okay, just listen.
- Okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

198
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:02,532
Okay, you must... Damn it.

199
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,574
Now I forgot what I had to say.

200
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:08,144
- But it's very...
- Lock the door.

201
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,846
- Mr. Fletcher, have a good trip.
- L'll have a good trip.

202
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,420
Take some pictures and call me.

203
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,114
Oh, yes, yes. L... I remember.

204
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,585
See, you wanted to finish my sentence.

205
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:20,226
- I lost my focus. I can't...
- No, no. I was listening. I was listening.

206
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:23,502
Hey, Mike. Mike. Keep Jerry...

207
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:25,945
I can't hear you.

208
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,512
Keep Jerry out. Out, out.

209
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,324
What? I don't know what that means.

210
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:36,095
"Peek your edge too.
Peek your edge..."

211
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:41,280
"tuo. Too. Peek your edge too."

212
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:43,281
That's what it is.

213
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,657
I just found out something sad today.

214
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:50,155
Mr. Fletcher can't spell.

215
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,571
Maybe his parents
couldn't afford school.

216
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,438
Did he have parents?

217
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,576
- Yeah.
- I nteresting.

218
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,086
Don't mention this to anybody.

219
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,661
- Just keep this between us. Don't...
- Of course not, that would be racist.

220
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,098
Peek your... Pick.

221
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,761
Your age. Pick your age.

222
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:12,966
He's talking gibberish.

223
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:15,775
It's nonsense, but it's not his fault.

224
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:19,985
The power plant's controlling us.
I know it.

225
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,095
- Through microwaves.
- Mm-hm.

226
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:25,030
They're using it to make us do things.

227
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,400
To buy things, to accept things.

228
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,942
And who...? Who...? Who are they?
Who are "they"?

229
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,948
The government, the FBI, of course.

230
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,715
- And I say no more.
- Right.

231
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,019
I'm gonna sabotage
the power plant tonight...

232
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:39,562
...and you're gonna help me.

233
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:42,295
Look, I got a map.
Completely worked out.

234
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,599
We short-circuit this
with whatever that thing is.

235
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,642
And that blows up the transformer.

236
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,475
All we gotta do is climb the fence...

237
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,486
...and throw this sweet grappling hook
right into the transformer. Boom.

238
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,255
You know what I mean?

239
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:56,022
Yeah.

240
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,601
This, my friend, is your camouflage.

241
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,068
Camouflage.

242
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,265
Bones.

243
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:02,808
We need that electricity.

244
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:06,145
You know, we got the machines, we...
And nobody rewinds the tapes.

245
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,254
- This is more important than that.
- You gotta rewind the tapes.

246
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,016
That's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.

247
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:12,960
It's totally non-sequitury,
what you're saying to me.

248
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:14,965
- It's a lame excuse?
- Yeah, it's lame.

249
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,333
Really? And the power plant
is controlling us?

250
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,136
That's not nonsense?
That's not paranoia?

251
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,407
Okay, it sounds crazy,
and you know why?

252
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,985
- Because it's affecting my brain too.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:25,179
It's paranizing it.

254
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:28,295
Mr. Fletcher left me
in charge of the store.

255
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:31,263
Me. He trusted me with the store.
Do you know what that means?

256
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,408
No, actually I don't.
Maybe you could explain it to me.

257
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,170
- It means that I'm not doing this.
- What?

258
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:37,644
- I'm not doing this with you.
- Okay.

259
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,478
So you'll just do anything
Mr. Fletcher says...

260
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,588
...even though, by the way,
he's not your real father.

261
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,589
- So... So what?
- And he's completely illiterate.

262
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,059
- He's not...
- But you won't do anything for me...

263
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:46,961
...your best friend,
who has a melting brain.

264
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:50,573
Can I...? Can I...? Can I help you
make a selection? Because if not...

265
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:53,872
...I'm gonna have to ask you
to make space for the other customers.

266
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,477
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
it was rush hour.

267
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,054
I won't bother you anymore.

268
00:13:58,223 --> 00:14:01,252
You know, it does get busy unexpectedly.

269
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:02,863
And you know, he's not illiterate.

270
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,834
First of all, because if he was illiterate,
smart guy...

271
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:07,532
...he wouldn't be able to write

272
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,541
"Peek your edge too."

273
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:12,879
Which is... It's probably Buddhist
or something.

274
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,852
It's like... Like a chant.

275
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,460
"Peek your... Pick your edge too."

276
00:14:17,963 --> 00:14:19,899
- Smart guy.
- I'm not saying he's illiterate.

277
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,234
I mean, he could just use some
night-schooling to perfect his spelling.

278
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:24,899
Just go.

279
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,977
Slow. Slower.

280
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,861
You all right?

281
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,467
Come on over. It's easy.

282
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:43,912
Freeze.

283
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,690
They always come at night
and bother me.

284
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:56,169
- Oh, come on, it's my turn tonight.
- No way. This is my baby.

285
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,572
Department of Homeland Security.

286
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,146
Wake up.

287
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:01,715
Be invisible.

288
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,046
Shh, did you hear something?

289
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:04,815
Yeah.

290
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,098
There's that ladder again.

291
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:13,773
What do you think?

292
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,777
I don't know, some kind of ladder gang
or something?

293
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,679
Oh, the ladder gang.

294
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,221
Let's go get some ice cream.

295
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,981
- "Peek your edge too."
- What's so funny?

296
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,379
"Keep Jerry out."

297
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:39,288
- Who cares about that right now?
- He's not illiterate. "Keep Jerry out."

298
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,795
- He's not illiterate.
- Who cares? Get over...

299
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:43,959
- What are you doing?
- I can't be here for this.

300
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:45,936
What are you doing? Mike, no. Mike.

301
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,510
- Mike, put that ladder back.
- I can't let you in the store.

302
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,150
- Mike, you're coming over the thing.
- Mr. Fletcher trusted me.

303
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,812
Mr. Fletcher's not gonna yell at you,
he's way too laid back.

304
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,392
I know he's not gonna yell at me.
That's part of the problem.

305
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:58,759
He's very good to me. I can't
let him down. I can't disappoint him.

306
00:15:58,933 --> 00:15:59,958
Listen, you don't need me.

307
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:01,969
- You're almost there.
- L'll never speak to you.

308
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,574
I will never speak to you again.

309
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:06,145
Mike! Mike!

310
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,215
Traitor.

311
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:10,546
L'll do it alone, baby.

312
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:13,185
Solo mission.

313
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,196
Solo sabotage.

314
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,286
Mike! Come back!

315
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:45,857
No, Jerry, no.

316
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:48,624
No. No. You have to go.

317
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,166
You see the signs? "Keep Jerry out."

318
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:53,742
This is in, that's out.

319
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,409
Go home, take a shower, lie down.

320
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,519
Oh, come on.

321
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,257
Get out of the street.
Get out of the street.

322
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:23,335
Wipe your face.
Jesus. Stand right there.

323
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,566
L'll get you some water.

324
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,502
Don't move, just wait a minute.

325
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,997
Oh, you feeling better now?

326
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:46,172
Mike, aren't you gonna ask me
how the sabotage went?

327
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,478
No, I wasn't, actually.

328
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:50,624
Oh, come on,
ask me how the sabotage went.

329
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,728
Okay, how'd the sabotage go?

330
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,424
Terrible. It was a two-man operation.

331
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:59,033
- It was a two-person sabotage.
- Shh.

332
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:02,148
Ma'am, if you need any help,
just let me know.

333
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,048
How about if I need any help?
Should I let you know?

334
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,317
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yeah, apparently not.

335
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,053
Thanks.

336
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,508
Oh, that's not in alphabetical order.

337
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,649
I know that, it's the new order.
Excuse me.

338
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,582
- Do you work here? I don't think so.
- Jerry.

339
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:24,089
Haven't you heard
about the new West Coast video...

340
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,891
...more efficient,
non-alphabetical order...

341
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,761
...Miss l-Know-Where-to-Put-the-videos?

342
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,313
No, it's time for me
to educate your customers.

343
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,746
Do you put everything in your house
in alphabetical order?

344
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,389
- Like all of your food in the refrigerator?
- You know, maybe...

345
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:42,324
- Apples, bananas, carrots.
- She might, and that would be fine...

346
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,831
- Ding-Dongs.
...because she didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:47,564
You know what I just realized?
I bet she's super-organized.

348
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,609
She's really like
I hate those kind of people.

349
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,682
- You are incredibly rude.
- Don't attack me, lady.

350
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:55,345
- You're incredibly rude, mister.
- Are you done yelling in my ear?

351
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:56,548
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

352
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,421
Did I put your forks
into the spoon drawer?

353
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,589
- Go home.
- Don't put the tv next to the radio.

354
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,258
- Why don't you just go, go, go?
- Get some rest.

355
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,066
- Lunatic!
- You're the cuckoo. Hey. Hey.

356
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:07,270
Don't put the shoes in the refrigerator,
because they'll get cold.

357
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,182
- Wow...
- Dumb broad.

358
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:12,414
- I am really, really sorry.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,751
He's a veteran, actually.

360
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:16,796
He's had a lot of exposure to,
you know, chemicals and stuff.

361
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,962
If there's anything you need, we got...
We got books, we got albums.

362
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,338
I got some refreshments
in the icebox.

363
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,605
Okay, I appreciate it.

364
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:26,307
You're welcome.

365
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:38,866
Fletcher...

366
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:45,980
...you'll pull through. Every time you think
it's the end, you always pull through.

367
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,356
Look here, look here, Mo.
I wish it was that easy, man.

368
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,931
But not this time.

369
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,832
I can't adapt, and that's why I'm broke.

370
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,841
Fletcher, this is America.

371
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,574
Anybody can make money.

372
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,916
But you...
No, let me show you something.

373
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,790
We made a ton of money
with this little thing.

374
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:07,559
- What, this is a dish-squirting brush?
- Mm-hm.

375
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:10,571
- And the soap goes in here?
- Yep. Yep.

376
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,905
- A great idea.
- You know, the squirting idea...

377
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,411
...has been around for years.

378
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:17,885
But we didn't make squat
until we added this.

379
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:20,219
A stainless-steel cover on the handle.

380
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:22,193
People going crazy over it.

381
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:25,860
- Man, our sales increased 800 percent.
- What?

382
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,879
And we expanded our market share
tenfold in two years.

383
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,511
You need to go visit all
of the successful renting businesses...

384
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,559
...and learn and adapt.
You said you can't adapt.

385
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:40,633
Adapt. Then just give the people
what they want.

386
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:44,263
- That's all you gotta do.
- Give the people what they want.

387
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:06,977
Hello?

388
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,384
Hello, Miss Falewicz? Lt's...

389
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:11,154
I... I know who this is, Mr. Fletcher.

390
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,063
L... I was hoping to hear from you.

391
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:17,572
I was calling regarding the tape
of Driving Miss Daisy.

392
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,234
Mike told me you still have it.

393
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,006
Oh. Do I?

394
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,814
Well, l'll find it and...
And bring it by tomorrow.

395
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,016
Oh, no hurry.
I'm... I'm out of town anyway.

396
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm doing a little work
and doing a little research.

397
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,432
Oh? Well. How long will you be gone?

398
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,767
- A week at the most.
- Really.

399
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,775
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yes.

400
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:38,816
Would you keep an eye out on Jerry
for me while I'm gone?

401
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:40,682
He destroys everything he touches.

402
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,469
Hi, good morning.

403
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,740
- It's blank.
- I'm sorry?

404
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,684
Rewound this tape all over,
and it's blank.

405
00:21:57,857 --> 00:21:59,486
Really? Did you check the...?

406
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,390
Sure did. Checked that.

407
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,830
You know, sometimes
you gotta use head cleaner...

408
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:05,095
Okay. I did that, actually.

409
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:06,672
It'll eat the tapes.

410
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,605
L'll just pop it in, see what's going on.

411
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,269
Excuse me, this video don't work.

412
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,781
- Sorry?
- It don't work.

413
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,580
It does... It won't play?

414
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:16,385
No, I rewound it,
I played it and everything.

415
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,291
It's nothing but fuzz. Yeah, like that.

416
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:21,598
Huh. Is your v CR NtSC?

417
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:22,829
No, it's brand-new.

418
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,909
Do you always blame
everything on the customer?

419
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,876
- No, not at all.
- Where is...?

420
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,312
Where's...? Where's Mr. Fletcher?

421
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:31,980
He's away on a...
On a memorial trip...

422
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:36,122
...so he left me in charge
as manager of the store.

423
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,702
So you know what I'm gonna do?

424
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:42,471
Both of you, free of charge, can have
any two tapes that you'd like in the shop.

425
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:46,814
No, thanks. What I would like
is to be reimbursed my dollar.

426
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,480
- Okay.
- Because I've had enough.

427
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,221
Okay. Is there anything
that I could do to make...?

428
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:53,094
No, just my dollar.

429
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,930
L'll just... I was just...

430
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:57,903
- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Unfortunate.

431
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,638
Yeah, the whole thing is unfortunate.

432
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:01,943
This button... I'm really... Okay.

433
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,382
That one right there.

434
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:05,457
I tried... Oh, that's not it either.

435
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,151
You know what?
I think I have a dollar.

436
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,196
- Okay, there it is.
- Good. Okay, great.

437
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,836
I'm really very sorry about that.

438
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:12,029
Thank you.

439
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,073
You don't have to mention this
to Mr. Fletcher.

440
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:15,837
- Give me my dollar.
- You can have it.

441
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:18,075
Okay, not... Not a problem.
I'm sorry about that.

442
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,347
- Uh-huh.
- All right, I got these two.

443
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:22,926
Okay, that's... Okay, not a problem.

444
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,075
Stop.

445
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:43,466
No! No!

446
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:46,033
All the tapes are blank.

447
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:50,512
The movies, all of them, they're all...

448
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:53,417
they're all gone,
all the tapes are gone.

449
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,955
Where?

450
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:00,093
Mr. Fletcher's gonna flip
when he sees this.

451
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,469
You know that look he has on his face.
He's gonna be so disappointed...

452
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,079
...that he left me with this responsibility.
Look, look, look.

453
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:08,082
What the duck?
All the tapes are like this.

454
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:10,119
All the tapes.
I tried every tape on this table.

455
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:13,056
Relax. It's the tv, Mike.

456
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:14,459
The tv's malfunctioning.

457
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,330
- It's not all the videotapes. Think about it.
- Well, show me what it's doing.

458
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,475
Show me how... What was that?

459
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:23,207
Maybe that's the picture coming back.
Wait, do... What was that?

460
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,244
Why is it doing that?

461
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:30,060
Does that happen when you do it?

462
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,632
No, it hasn't done that at all... Wow.

463
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,006
What is that?

464
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:39,205
Why is it doing that when you do that?

465
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:40,680
What is wrong with you?

466
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,915
You're magnetized.

467
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,651
You...

468
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:48,594
You erased these tapes.

469
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:49,827
It's you.

470
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:53,066
What happened
during the sabotage attempt, Jerry?

471
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:01,422
I didn't sabotage the power plant,
the power plant sabotaged me.

472
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:04,326
Really? The power plant
sabotaged you?

473
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:06,263
- I'm gonna sabotage you.
- I'm magnetized!

474
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:08,464
I'm not gonna get... Are you serious?

475
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,975
Sabotage a power plant?
What are you, a superhero?

476
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,512
Don't do this, man.

477
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:14,811
You were right.

478
00:25:14,987 --> 00:25:17,390
I did have the Driving Miss Daisy tape
at home.

479
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,289
Oh, good, that's really good.

480
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:26,403
Thank you for returning the tape.

481
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:28,068
I like your ensemble.

482
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,545
Listen, I wanna rent Ghostbusters.

483
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:34,088
Ghostbusters.

484
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:36,322
Is that out?

485
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,194
Lsn't that a horror movie?

486
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,393
- Really?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,869
- That could be interesting.
- Miss Falafelwicz...

488
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,675
- It's Falewicz.
- It's actually got a lot of nudity in it.

489
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,819
- So...
- Oh, you. Come on.

490
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:49,080
You're pulling my leg.

491
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,385
We're right in the middle
of reorganizing.

492
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:54,499
That's why all the tapes are there like that.
We're getting the stock together.

493
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,727
I think you should know
that Mr. Fletcher...

494
00:25:56,905 --> 00:26:00,845
...calls me every night at 8 p.m.
Just to see how I am.

495
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:05,921
And I think he would not be pleased
to see his business go off the deep end...

496
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,861
...because some sort of boxing match
going on on his premises.

497
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:11,499
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I don't think so.

498
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:13,193
We're not boxing.

499
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,367
It's just... You know, it's just buddies...

500
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:19,778
...just, you know, horsing around.

501
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:21,682
- Yeah, well...
- It's nothing, just boys.

502
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:24,919
What I can do is that I can get that to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

503
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:26,654
No, I don't think so. Uh-uh.

504
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:29,098
I'm gonna come back before 7,
when you close.

505
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,399
- Oh, okay.
- And I really strongly suggest...

506
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:36,175
...that you get this place in order fast.
- Okay, well...

507
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,688
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

508
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,662
She's a communist.
I don't like commies.

509
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:53,177
- I gotta get some rest, I still feel sick.
- Yeah?

510
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:54,752
Yeah, me too.

511
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,084
What time is it?

512
00:26:58,161 --> 00:26:59,356
This is a message is for Mark.

513
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:01,933
I was wondering if you had a copy
of Ghostbusters?

514
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:04,096
Hey, bro, is Pablo around?

515
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,867
I'm under a little bit of pressure here.

516
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:09,142
Do you have a copy of Ghostbusters
that I could...? That I could borrow?

517
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:11,254
You do? Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

518
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:15,385
No, no, no.
Because I don't need it on D vD.

519
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:18,695
I need it on... I need it on vHS.

520
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,207
Yeah, well, you know,
they said that about laser discs too so...

521
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:23,971
Okay, take care.

522
00:27:24,147 --> 00:27:25,946
Shit.

523
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:50,967
A clear image,
even in the middle of the day.

524
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,764
It's as powerful as the sun.

525
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:55,672
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry.

526
00:27:55,844 --> 00:27:58,714
Do you...?
Do you have Ghostbusters on vHS?

527
00:27:58,884 --> 00:28:01,515
There's no vHS here, buddy.

528
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,284
Ho, ho, ho, Little Mikey?

529
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,794
What are you doing here, man?

530
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,370
- You know me?
- Of course I know you, Mike.

531
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:10,974
Oh, I get it.

532
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:13,772
Old man Fletcher sent you by here
to get a movie that he's missing.

533
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:16,214
He's too embarrassed to get it himself.
Ain't that right?

534
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:18,015
- Now, ain't that right, Little Mikey?
- No, no.

535
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,420
- Yeah, that's right!
- No.

536
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:21,391
- Okay.
- I call it like I see it.

537
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:24,160
- All right, you take... You take care.
- I got you.

538
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:32,374
Tell me the truth, doc.
How long have I got left?

539
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:33,679
Ten minutes.

540
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,780
Ten minutes?

541
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,225
This should help.

542
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:15,227
Miss Kobayashi had a fever of...

543
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:18,742
I'm Bill Murray, you're everybody else.

544
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:21,110
What, are you crazy?
She's never gonna buy it.

545
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:25,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't know
what the movie's supposed to look like.

546
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,464
The only thing that she knows
is what's on this box.

547
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,330
She's never seen it before.

548
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:35,605
If we stay 10 feet away from the camera
she's not gonna recognize us.

549
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,775
We come up with some special effects,
we do it ourselves.

550
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:41,116
She's gonna be back in, like,
two hours and 45 minutes.

551
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,523
She's on the phone with Fletcher
every night.

552
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,494
The first scene is at the library.

553
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,263
And take that thing off, please.

554
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:50,231
Okay.

555
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:58,649
And action.

556
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,759
- Start over. Sorry, cut.
- What?

557
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,062
I looked right in the lens.

558
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,296
- We gotta start over.
- We can't start over.

559
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,442
- I looked right in the lens.
- You just have to do one good take.

560
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,375
All right? Don't...
Listen, what you're doing is good.

561
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,606
- I am doing good, right?
- Just do the same thing.

562
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,275
- Yeah, just do the same thing.
- Am I doing great?

563
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:14,287
- You're doing great, but don't look...
- All right, you're doing good too...

564
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:17,258
...with the cinematography.
- All right, thanks. Okay, good.

565
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,558
Go check the cards.

566
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,930
Check the cards.

567
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:25,069
You're doing... that's good, that's right.
That's great. That's good.

568
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,683
- Put your head down, put your head down.
- I can't see.

569
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,787
Go back to the shelf.

570
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:34,455
Suspecting nothing, and ghosts.
Ghosts.

571
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:49,487
When you're walking down the street
And you see a little ghost

572
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:53,101
What you gonna
Do about Ghostbusters?

573
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,175
- What? What? What is that?
- That's the Ghostbusters theme song.

574
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,749
- No.
- I'm pretty sure it is.

575
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:16,245
- About this stuff...
- We've got one right there.

576
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:18,385
Let's get a closer look.

577
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:21,856
Hey, have you talked to Elvis lately?

578
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,632
We're moving on to stage two.
We can capture her.

579
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:30,777
We have the megapixels.
You just have to stay with me, okay?

580
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:31,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,226
Excuse me.

582
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:48,407
We got her. We did it,
because we're Ghostbusters.

583
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,673
- All right.
- Pound it.

584
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,788
I'm in the hotel reading area
for children...

585
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:55,188
...and I'm getting a lot of creepy vibes.

586
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,558
I think I did hear something.

587
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:00,135
You heard something?
Stay where you are, I'm on my way.

588
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,594
I got... I got slimed.

589
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:24,577
Okay, Wilson, go now. Wilson, now!

590
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:26,278
- Wilson?
- Should I come in now?

591
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:28,586
- Yes, for duck's sake, now, Wilson.
- I wasn't sure.

592
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:33,726
If you or any of your family
have seen ectoplasmic apparitions...

593
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:36,240
...or heard funny noises in your attic...

594
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,743
Call Ghostbusters.

595
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,316
We're fully staffed and ready
24 hours a day...

596
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,614
...to fulfill your supernatural needs.

597
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:45,317
- We're ready to believe you.
- We're ready to believe you.

598
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,556
Look at the refrigerator.

599
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:53,834
Hello, I need Ghostbusters, fast.
There's a strange alien in my refrigerator.

600
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:01,117
- Okay, go.
- Rock 'n' roll. How does it look?

601
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,264
- Amazing, very real.
- Hey, come on. Yeah.

602
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:06,028
Okay, now, the next scene
is the car screeching through the night.

603
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:07,400
- Okay.
- Well, not night...

604
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:09,942
...because we're not in the night.
We gotta just go with the day.

605
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:12,081
No, no, no. All dramatic scenes
are shot at night.

606
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,220
You got... You gotta...
You gotta shoot it at night.

607
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:17,552
- The day is fine. What are you doing?
- And then, you also have to wet the floor.

608
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:19,161
- You wet the floor.
- Would you stop?

609
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,062
That's just a waste of water.
Would you stop?

610
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:23,068
Mike, I'm not gonna botch this job, man.

611
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,607
If you wanna do it in the day,
you'll find somebody else.

612
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:29,113
Miss Falewicz will be back
in less than an hour. We don't have time.

613
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:31,949
We just need a minimum amount
of professionalism.

614
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,389
I can shoot a night scene in the day,
give me the camera.

615
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,928
- No.
- Give me the camera.

616
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,498
Let me just show you how you...

617
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:42,773
You... You cannot touch the camera. You're
gonna erase everything that we've done.

618
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:46,680
Mike, look on the side of the camera.
There's a button that says, "negative."

619
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:49,722
See? Makes it look like nighttime
in the day. Am I right?

620
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,725
- Oh, there it goes.
- Thank you, you're welcome.

621
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:55,164
Your face is negative, though. Don't.

622
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,533
- There's something we can do about that.
- What?

623
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,076
- Okay, go.
- All right.

624
00:34:01,382 --> 00:34:04,012
- Close your eyes.
- You're telling me that now?

625
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,283
Sorry. Good job.

626
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:12,700
Gotta run,
got a date with a Ghostbuster.

627
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:18,910
Busting makes me feel good.

628
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:23,182
Okay, Wilson.

629
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:27,531
- Ghostbusters, open the door!
- Wait, wait, do it one more time.

630
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:29,136
Ghostbusters, open the...

631
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:32,209
Are you the Gatekeeper
or the Keymaster?

632
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:35,544
Are you the Keymaster?
I want your key inside of me.

633
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:37,984
- Are you menstruating?
- That's not from the...

634
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:40,752
Back off, I'm the scientist here.

635
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:43,455
I'm gonna open that refrigerator door.

636
00:34:48,277 --> 00:34:52,547
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

637
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,154
We ionized it.

638
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:57,316
It was a complete particle reversal.

639
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,987
Can I go now?

640
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:01,830
As the 100-foot marshmallow man
tried to kill them...

641
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:07,846
...they decided to reverse reality
by crossing their beams.

642
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:11,683
Run, everyone, run.
There's a Stay Puft Marsh...

643
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,092
Okay.

644
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:19,466
- Nice working with you, Dr. V enkman.
- See you on the other side.

645
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,040
The end. Starring Bill Murray
and other actors.

646
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:29,124
Written by Dan Aykroyd,
directed by lvan Reitman.

647
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:31,627
Ghostbusters

648
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,967
Wait, wait. Miss Falewicz,
Miss Falewicz. Hi. Hi.

649
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,700
- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah, I'm here.

650
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:41,180
By the way, it looks a load better.
Big improvement.

651
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:44,220
- Oh, yeah. We were just...
- Mr. Fletcher will be pleased.

652
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,553
Yeah, we were doing...
We were doing inventory here.

653
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,896
A nice and tidy house.
First step to combating depression

654
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:54,041
- to have an optimistic view of the future.
- Hey, that sounds...

655
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,339
You know what I do
whenever I'm feeling depressed?

656
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:58,541
- Oh, what's that?
- I clean my house.

657
00:35:58,718 --> 00:36:00,950
- Oh, really?
- Honest to God, it clears the mind.

658
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:03,891
You'll see, in the morning
when the sun comes in.

659
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:06,795
- Uh-huh.
- Number one step for fighting depression.

660
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:10,408
Here it is, Miss Falewicz, there you go.
Ghostbusters like you asked for.

661
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:12,409
When you're walking down the street

662
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,482
- You know what, I...
- And you see a little ghost

663
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,417
- All right.
- I have a... I have a...

664
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:19,082
I was gonna say I have a...

665
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,730
- What are you doing? I have a method.
- What you gonna do?

666
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:24,769
- A foolproof method for fighting depression.
- Ghostbusters

667
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:27,738
You get a notebook
and you, like, put four columns in it.

668
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,607
- And the first column is...
- And you see a little ghost

669
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:31,044
...the effort you believe...
- What you gonna do?

670
00:36:31,217 --> 00:36:32,948
...the dreaded task will take...
- Ghostbusters

671
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,284
tell me the other two tomorrow,
because I'm really...

672
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,794
- Good movie you got there.
- I'm focused on those first two.

673
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:40,197
Wait a sec, 1 dollar, one tape,
one night, right?

674
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,498
- No, Miss Falewicz, it's not a problem.
- I'm in it.

675
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,576
- It's okay. That's on us today.
- Really?

676
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,770
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

677
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:49,979
- You're welcome. Take care.
- Enjoy the movie.

678
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:55,696
We should've had, like, a premiere
of that thing or something.

679
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:58,565
- What?
- What are you talking about, "what"?

680
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:00,800
She's not supposed to know
that we're in the movie...

681
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:02,845
...because we're not in Ghostbusters.
- Yeah? Maybe I want her to know...

682
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,144
- Maybe I am in Ghostbusters.
- Why is it...?

683
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,755
- Because I'm proud of my work.
- Oh, you're...

684
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,761
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, you have zero ambition.

685
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:13,059
- What's...?
- That's your problem.

686
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:16,605
You're gonna be stuck in this dump
for the rest of your life.

687
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,439
Good night.

688
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,280
Wh...? What? What? What's a dump?

689
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,348
What's a dump?
My... My shop is a dump?

690
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:25,720
You live in a junkyard.

691
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:29,355
Not just the store,
the whole city is a swamp.

692
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:33,498
- It's a swamp now?
- Yeah, a dump swamp.

693
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,679
When you get stuck here,
you're stuck for life.

694
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,724
Come on, Mike, what is so great
about this town? Huh?

695
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,326
- The people.
- The people?

696
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:48,473
You're gonna make me cry.
The people.

697
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,079
The only reason there's anybody here
is because they have nowhere to go.

698
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:55,881
Why don't you...? Why don't you
go somewhere, Mr. "Junkman"?

699
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:59,254
We got a customer. We got a customer.

700
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,922
- Mr... Mr. Jack.
- Hi, how you doing?

701
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,298
Yeah, actually, we're closed.

702
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:07,535
- I'm actually open later...
- It'll just take a moment, guys.

703
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,613
- Rush Hour 2. that's all.
- Excellent choice.

704
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:13,051
It's out. But you come back tomorrow,
and I can... I can get you Ghostbusters.

705
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,750
Seen it. Jaws?

706
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,628
- Whoa, what the duck?
- Whoa, what was that?

707
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:24,936
How about Towering Inferno?

708
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:26,878
- I saw it.
- Mr. Jack...

709
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:28,577
...if you just come back tomorrow.

710
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:31,453
L... l'll take care of all of that tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Jack?

711
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:34,827
I can't believe you don't have Rush Hour 2.
I'm gonna go to West Coast video.

712
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:37,027
No, you... No, you're not.
Dude, you'd better...

713
00:38:37,204 --> 00:38:40,074
You don't do that, you...
Have some morals.

714
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:43,513
Just wait till tomorrow.
L'll have Rush Hour 2 tomorrow.

715
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,084
Good!

716
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:57,745
Lee, I'm coming.

717
00:39:01,186 --> 00:39:03,088
I'm taking the stairs.

718
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:04,955
Lee.

719
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,187
Lee.

720
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:07,388
Cut, that was great.

721
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,158
Lee!

722
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,465
- Over here.
- Lee, what you doing down there, man?

723
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,473
Carter, behind you.
Behind you, look out.

724
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:38,291
Lee, this Chinese bamboo
ain't gonna hold.

725
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:43,268
Don't worry, Carter,
Chinese bamboo, very strong.

726
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:54,819
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

727
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:58,867
Forget about the bamboo.
We gotta go solve a crime.

728
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:03,902
Go in for the kiss now, Jerry.
Go in for the kiss.

729
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,449
Go in for the kiss now.
Go now, kiss him now.

730
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,019
Hold on.

731
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:11,251
Why do I have to kiss Wilson?

732
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:13,456
- She's the bad guy, right?
- Right.

733
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:16,297
She's got the detonator...
He's got the detonator in his hand.

734
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:18,100
You have the bomb in your mouth.

735
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,542
You have to press it against her
to keep her from blowing your head off.

736
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:22,410
- I'm not kissing Wilson.
- It's not a kiss!

737
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:25,488
I don't wanna kiss Wilson.

738
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,757
We've been working with him all day.
We can't replace him.

739
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:31,298
- Could I just say something?
- What?

740
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:33,131
I quit.

741
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,642
- Amateurs. I hate this movie.
- Wilson...

742
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:38,475
thanks, good work today.

743
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:40,377
Mike.

744
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:42,751
Mike, Mike. Listen to me.

745
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:45,624
Maybe you can understand that
I don't want the whole neighborhood...

746
00:40:45,798 --> 00:40:49,898
...to think I'm having a homosexual,
interracial relationship with my mechanic.

747
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,302
Oh. Okay.

748
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:54,743
- So the interracial is the issue.
- Okay, forget about the interracial thing...

749
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:59,517
...but kissing my mechanic is disturbing
and inappropriate.

750
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,992
He could sue me
for sexual harassment.

751
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,827
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, come on.

752
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:07,030
Mike, Mike, Mike. I got a better idea.

753
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,136
Follow me.

754
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:13,114
Right, yeah,
there's a stain on this sweater.

755
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,018
- Okay. Okay.
- You see what I'm talking about?

756
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:16,989
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

757
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,033
We're moviemakers and we're making
a movie around the corner.

758
00:41:21,203 --> 00:41:23,537
And we have a kissing scene,
and we need an actress...

759
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,540
...and you are amazing.

760
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:28,547
I'm sorry, I can't leave the store.

761
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:31,086
I have work to do, but my sister can.

762
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,226
- Alma.
- What?

763
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:34,418
Come here.

764
00:41:35,397 --> 00:41:38,564
These guys are making a film
around the corner. They need a girl.

765
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:40,229
What kind of film are you making?

766
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:43,345
Actually it's like comedy,
action, adventure.

767
00:41:43,513 --> 00:41:46,178
- Like, the types of movies, you know...
- I don't think you understand...

768
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:47,719
- Like what kind?
...what we're offering you, though.

769
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:51,191
- We want you to be a movie star.
- I told you I have to stay here.

770
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:54,097
I can't leave, but she should go,
she's a really good actress.

771
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,105
- I was in the school play.
- She was a fridge.

772
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:59,303
- A refrigerator?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,677
So check it out.
Okay, so I'm standing in the kitchen...

774
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:02,944
...and this is my door.

775
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,616
And then I had, like, to close my eye
like this, and I go like that.

776
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:08,856
- Okay, we're gonna take a quick meeting.
- That was the light.

777
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:10,227
- A quick producers' meeting.
- It's the light.

778
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,995
- You got it.
- She's horrible.

779
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:14,472
- What's the matter? She's...
- She's the worst actress I've ever seen.

780
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:15,976
Listen to me, I know a woman...

781
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,378
...who works across the street
at the diner, she's per...

782
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:21,819
Are you gonna kiss her or Wilson?
Because that's what it is at this point.

783
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:24,053
- You gonna kiss her?
- I hate you right now.

784
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:26,027
Okay, we did it.

785
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:28,301
- Guess what, we just had a meeting.
- Yeah?

786
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:30,270
- You got the part.
- I got the part?

787
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:32,379
- Oh, yeah.
- So we should... We should go now...

788
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:33,605
...because we're actually...

789
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:34,806
- We're shooting right now.
- Thank you so much.

790
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,420
It's gonna be fun.
We're gonna makes some movies.

791
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,149
I'm sorry, can...? Can...? Can...?

792
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:40,351
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

793
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:42,829
- Can we use this just really quickly?
- No, no, no.

794
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,870
- She just dropped this off to be cleaned.
- Just really, really quickly.

795
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,509
- It'll be all right.
- You don't have to do that.

796
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:49,909
We'll bring it back.
We'll make sure it's in fine condition.

797
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,174
- What's your name?
- Ann.

798
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,546
Ann. Miss Ann. Thank you so much.

799
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,451
We gotta make sure
she gets a wardrobe credit.

800
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:57,026
She will get a credit for sure,
and then some.

801
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:58,288
- I'm gonna be thinking about...
- thank you.

802
00:42:58,465 --> 00:43:00,093
...parts for you in the future
of our films.

803
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:01,635
Not you, however. You blew it.

804
00:43:01,805 --> 00:43:03,398
I wanted to make you Marilyn Monroe.

805
00:43:03,574 --> 00:43:05,271
- Now you're just gonna be the cleaner.
- Okay, let's go. Thank you.

806
00:43:05,446 --> 00:43:09,147
- Thank you for letting us use your sister.
- Alma, keep your tongue in your mouth.

807
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,050
- We're gonna go down here.
- It's Rush Hour 2...

808
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:12,817
...and you're gonna play the girl.

809
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:14,759
Action, guys.

810
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,502
What...?

811
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:20,307
- Oh, damn. Damn.
- What was that?

812
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:22,910
Hold still.

813
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:24,745
- Stop.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

814
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:28,950
He got exposed to radioactive waves.

815
00:43:29,127 --> 00:43:30,756
Are you radioactive?

816
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:32,924
Ls it contagious?
Am I gonna be radioactive now?

817
00:43:33,101 --> 00:43:36,939
Not radioactive! Magnetized!

818
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:38,134
Give me my bottle.

819
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:42,876
I'm sorry, we didn't have a chance to...
It's not contagious.

820
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:46,086
I'm just gonna check...
Sorry. You're fine.

821
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:47,993
- This came out pretty good.
- I'm fine?

822
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,930
- Not magnetized.
- Uh-huh, yeah. Okay, good.

823
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:52,630
- Not magnetized.
- What about your friend?

824
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:53,901
Huh?

825
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,516
Hey, Jerry. I'm really sorry
about hurting your feelings.

826
00:43:57,684 --> 00:44:00,247
I just, like... I got really scared
about the radioactive stuff.

827
00:44:00,424 --> 00:44:03,021
Yeah, I know.
It's my fault, I should've warned you.

828
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:04,596
Yeah.

829
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:09,067
Is that you?

830
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:12,311
- I took the whole bottle.
- Why would you do that, Jerry?

831
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:15,078
I just wanted to go to sleep.
Am I gonna die?

832
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:19,158
Yeah, it's aspirin, not sleeping pills,
you dummy. Why be a dummy?

833
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:21,764
You are not going to die, okay?

834
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:23,801
- Lf you do what I say, okay?
- What's happening?

835
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:25,372
I need you to go to the bathroom...

836
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,442
...get me a bucket full of salt and water,
right now.

837
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:30,344
- Salt, salt.
- Okay?

838
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:32,111
Just sit down, relax.

839
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:34,983
- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not gonna die, I promise.

840
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,891
- I've done it before.
- I have a good future.

841
00:44:37,064 --> 00:44:40,367
Here, here. Drink it, drink it.

842
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:44,400
Good.

843
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:48,214
- You okay?
- That was good.

844
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:51,484
Hey, look at me, I'm doing good.

845
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,923
Oh, that's me.

846
00:44:55,535 --> 00:44:58,097
Oh, not again.

847
00:44:58,941 --> 00:45:01,846
Why does he have to puke
outside of the shop every time?

848
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:03,951
Oh, good, now he's gonna
puke out all the bad stuff.

849
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,589
- You see?
- But in front of the shop?

850
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:09,355
Hi. Sorry.

851
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,893
Wait, what's he doing now?

852
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:18,910
Oh, nice, nice. Pee.

853
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:21,075
- You guys are so weird.
- It all came out in my pee.

854
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:22,619
Yeah.

855
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:25,157
Is his pee making it do that?

856
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,032
Thank God for my bladder.

857
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:31,297
Okay, good. Would you just finish
and come inside?

858
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:33,774
Alma, I owe you one.

859
00:45:33,945 --> 00:45:36,575
Let's test it out. Let's test it out.

860
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:38,948
Let's test it out.
Is it warping the image still?

861
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:40,990
- No. No.
- No? No?

862
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,824
- It worked. It's working.
- I'm demagnetized, you're a genius.

863
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:45,332
- Thanks to me.
- You saved my life.

864
00:45:45,502 --> 00:45:48,167
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mr. Jack.

865
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:50,333
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, nothing.

866
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:53,005
We were just closing up, actually.

867
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,654
Yeah, so there it is.

868
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:58,885
I have to pay in mostly pennies.
That's okay?

869
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:00,725
- Fine. That's... that's okay.
- Thank you.

870
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:02,061
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the movie.

871
00:46:02,236 --> 00:46:03,671
Your pennies are always good here.

872
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,705
I'm gonna enjoy it, thank you.

873
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:06,935
Good night.

874
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:09,275
- Enjoy the movie?
- Yeah, enjoy the movie.

875
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,044
We worked hard on it.
It's gonna be good.

876
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,124
Yo, we gotta find new tapes.
We're gonna get caught.

877
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:15,591
- We can't keep doing this.
- What are you talking about?

878
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:16,856
Lt's going fine. So far, so good.

879
00:46:17,032 --> 00:46:20,801
What? When Miss Falewicz
sees "Ghostbusters"?

880
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:23,774
- Our version is better than the original.
- She's gonna say something...

881
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:27,579
...to Mr. Fletcher. First of all,
our version is only 20 minutes.

882
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,624
Yeah, but 20 minutes,
it's all the brain can concentrate for.

883
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:32,956
It's the perfect duration.
It's a biological fact.

884
00:46:33,132 --> 00:46:34,395
- I study this, I know.
- Yeah.

885
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:37,836
And besides, Miss Falewicz has never seen
a science-fiction movie before.

886
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:41,310
She might think all of them are 20 minutes
long. And isn't she a little kooky?

887
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:43,577
She probably won't even recognize us.

888
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:49,695
Y'all need to chill out, all right?

889
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:52,394
Craig?

890
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:55,441
- What's up, old lady?
- Yo, come on in, guys.

891
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,774
Yo, Craig. What's up, man?

892
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,525
Dude, you gotta check this out, man.

893
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:08,190
My auntie got this
from Fats' video store.

894
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:09,804
This is Ghostbusters.

895
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:11,771
- Roshambo.
- Water.

896
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:13,435
- Laser.
- Water.

897
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:16,277
- Whoa. Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

898
00:47:16,452 --> 00:47:18,753
Miss Falewicz gave it to her nephew.

899
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:21,853
It looks like they were disappointed
with the video.

900
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,897
- Come on, guys.
- Do they have guns?

901
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:27,370
I can clearly see you
hiding behind the counter.

902
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:32,407
We was closed,
something's wrong with these lights.

903
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:33,610
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

904
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:36,281
Y'all open now.

905
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:44,870
That wasn't bad. What else y'all got?

906
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,240
- The whole store.
- No. No.

907
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:50,386
We actually...
We only have Rush Hour 2.

908
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:53,390
No, man, he said the whole store.

909
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,393
- Why you lie to me, man?
- I'm not lying.

910
00:47:55,564 --> 00:47:57,056
Guys, make your choice.

911
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:02,674
- What is wrong with you?
- It just came out.

912
00:48:05,418 --> 00:48:07,148
What you got?

913
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,950
Right. Yeah, that's for...

914
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:12,360
Hey, man, hand me one of them
little mint jump off, right there.

915
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:15,332
We'd love to rent you out
these videos today...

916
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:18,203
...but Mr. Fletcher, right, he called.

917
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:20,313
- Oh, yeah.
- We got the new policy.

918
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,885
Two videos per day, per account, so...

919
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:26,025
All right then,
let me open an account right now.

920
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:27,889
Yeah, man. Sign away.

921
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:31,901
We're gonna need your picture I D,
your phone bill...

922
00:48:32,071 --> 00:48:34,269
...your last three rent receipts,
your grades...

923
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:36,345
...a letter from your mother
if you're a minor...

924
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,915
...the last three countries
you visited prior to this trip...

925
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,352
...your 10 favorite films
and your blood type.

926
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:43,721
You know, you're real lucky
we don't beat up girls.

927
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:45,591
- Word.
- For real.

928
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:47,860
Except Craig's aunt.

929
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:49,836
Shut up, stupid.

930
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:52,240
We'll be back
with all the necessary documents.

931
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:55,183
We still have two to choose, right?

932
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:57,788
Here you go,
you pick two of those and we'll be...

933
00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:59,358
that's my choice.

934
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:01,155
- You guys pick the other one.
- No, no, no.

935
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,563
You get to pick your choice,
and we gotta fight over ours?

936
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:05,169
- Yeah.
- What kind of democracy is that?

937
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:08,003
Man, who told you
this was a democracy?

938
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,942
Hey, hey, you guys, you guys.

939
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,451
You guys, listen. You guys!

940
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,952
Life without civilization is brutal...

941
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,572
...nasty and short.

942
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:24,140
If you're gonna come around here...

943
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:29,014
...and spread pizza
all over the walls with gats...

944
00:49:29,187 --> 00:49:31,088
...you're gonna miss out
on some good movies.

945
00:49:31,256 --> 00:49:33,159
So this is what I'm saying.

946
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:35,423
I'm gonna put all of these videos
into this bag.

947
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:39,566
Alma, you're gonna pick out
two of these videos at random.

948
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:42,235
Totally random.
It's the only way to do it civilized.

949
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:47,145
And everyone will survive. Pick it out.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

950
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,258
- Here they are.
- These are your choices.

951
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:51,898
Done.

952
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:53,467
How the hell?

953
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:57,268
Okay, who's the baby
that picked The Lion King? Hm?

954
00:49:57,677 --> 00:49:59,271
Someone did.

955
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:04,380
- What?
- Yeah.

956
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:07,553
But we will have them for you
at 4 p.m. Tomorrow...

957
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:10,293
...as long as you give us
$20 right now.

958
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:12,770
Twenty dollars?
Yo, that's a complete rip-off.

959
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:15,880
No, no, no.
These are custom made. Sweded.

960
00:50:16,048 --> 00:50:20,148
- Sweded.
- It's a very rare type of video.

961
00:50:20,323 --> 00:50:22,350
- Swede? Like Sweden?
- Yeah, Sweded.

962
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:26,467
- It's a country, not a verb.
- Exactly. That's why it's expensive.

963
00:50:26,635 --> 00:50:29,870
Because it's a faraway,
expensive country.

964
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:31,341
- It's imported.
- Sweded.

965
00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:37,920
A toast. Twenty bucks in one day.
That's never happened at Be Kind Rewind.

966
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:39,185
- That's never happened. Never.
- Never happened at all?

967
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:41,855
- Nice with the civilization theory.
- Right?

968
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:43,467
- I gotta say, that was nice.
- I pulled that out.

969
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:45,766
I do some thinking at night.

970
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:48,503
If I can't sleep,
I'm just thinking about stuff.

971
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,150
- Who picked The Lion King?
- That's what I was wondering.

972
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:54,586
The big guy, maybe.
One of those guys picked The Lion King.

973
00:50:54,758 --> 00:50:55,988
It was me.

974
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:57,790
- You snuck it in there?
- Yeah.

975
00:50:57,965 --> 00:50:59,264
You're a badass.

976
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:01,963
See, well, Pocahontas used to be,
like, my favorite movie, right?

977
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,372
But then I couldn't find it
when you got the bag idea...

978
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,242
...so I just picked Lion King instead.

979
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:11,358
It is such a good movie too.
I cry every time when the father dies.

980
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,623
Oh, man, I love The Lion King too.
It's my favorite picture, man.

981
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:16,997
My mom loved it.

982
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:18,639
- It's awesome.
- You like it too?

983
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,709
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- It's deeply deep.

984
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,438
- Oh, yeah.
- Because the uncle...

985
00:51:22,615 --> 00:51:25,382
...kills the nephew's father.
- His father...

986
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:27,353
...which is his brother.
- That's his brother.

987
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:31,056
He kills his own brother, right?
That's some heavy, Shapeskearian shit.

988
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:32,764
What's funny?

989
00:51:32,935 --> 00:51:34,598
- Shape... Nothing.
- Well, you know...

990
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:38,075
Does anybody have any ideas,
Lion King lady...

991
00:51:38,246 --> 00:51:41,845
...about how we're supposed to shoot
an animated film?

992
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:46,292
Roar! I am the king!

993
00:51:46,464 --> 00:51:49,196
Roar! Jerry, I kind of see your head.

994
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:50,565
- What?
- It doesn't look real.

995
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:52,709
Well, Alma, stay on the voices.

996
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,607
We'll be in charge
of the bodies and motion.

997
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,043
- Okay.
- I need you to say this

998
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:59,587
"I'm gonna piss on the graves
of your ancestors."

999
00:51:59,757 --> 00:52:01,317
- It's important in the story, Alma.
- Don't say that.

1000
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,690
Roar!

1001
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:05,926
I'm going to piss
on the heads of your ancestors!

1002
00:52:06,102 --> 00:52:08,005
No, wait. Hold on.
This is a children's movie.

1003
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:11,374
This is the sequel.
We're doing part two.

1004
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,288
Less choice...

1005
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:23,335
...more copies of the same movie.

1006
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:28,078
Simplified categorization of genre.

1007
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:29,340
Sir?

1008
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:30,542
Hi.

1009
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,456
Noticeable outfit
and big badge on employee.

1010
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:37,531
Sir, are you sure I can't help you?

1011
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,639
You've been here for the last two hours,
you can't seem to make up your mind.

1012
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,144
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1013
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:47,377
Do you carry a copy
of Stormy Weather?

1014
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:49,785
- What?
- No specific...

1015
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,901
...knowledge required.

1016
00:52:55,669 --> 00:52:56,694
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1017
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:58,501
Okay. V ery helpful.

1018
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:01,907
- That's it.
- Shoot him, Robo.

1019
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:04,177
I'm taking you downtown.

1020
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:06,688
- I'm coming to get you now...
- Well, you're gonna get shot.

1021
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:08,829
...with my gun.

1022
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:10,591
And there's more
where that came from...

1023
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:12,360
- No!
...for you, cop lady.

1024
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:15,969
Y'all still shooting, man?

1025
00:53:16,144 --> 00:53:17,169
- Yeah, we...
- Four o' clock.

1026
00:53:17,346 --> 00:53:20,147
Y'all were supposed to be done.
I've been out there for 20 minutes.

1027
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,619
- Don't worry. I can handle this guy.
- No, no, I got it, man.

1028
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:24,488
- Let me show you how to do this, man.
- We almost done.

1029
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:28,465
I will shoot you
and I know robot karate.

1030
00:53:28,635 --> 00:53:29,968
I got something for you, man.

1031
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:32,303
What do you think you're...?
L'll take you to the...

1032
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:34,676
- Robo!
- Yeah.

1033
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:37,250
- You want some? Yeah, you want some?
- No.

1034
00:53:37,854 --> 00:53:39,653
- Stay back.
- I'm wounded!

1035
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,419
I'm giving you
till the count of three...

1036
00:53:41,596 --> 00:53:43,258
...to drop your weapon.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

1037
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,974
That's not funny, y'all.

1038
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:51,375
- Cut.
- Whatever, y'all.

1039
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:54,453
- It's kind of funny.
- No, it's part of the movie.

1040
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,057
- That was good.
- It went really well.

1041
00:53:56,225 --> 00:53:58,194
- I like your badge.
- Thanks, I made it myself.

1042
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,426
Great. Just... Who are these people?

1043
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:03,766
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

1044
00:54:10,053 --> 00:54:11,146
Let's go before they see us.

1045
00:54:11,322 --> 00:54:13,815
Mike! Mike! Over here!

1046
00:54:13,994 --> 00:54:16,557
Lookit, okay? You're gonna smile.

1047
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:18,930
Pretend like you know
what you're doing, okay?

1048
00:54:19,104 --> 00:54:20,834
- I'm gonna take care of the rest. Yes.
- No.

1049
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,442
This was really great...

1050
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:24,844
...but it's too short.
It's so good, it should be longer.

1051
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:27,484
Anyway, I told all my friends,
and they're excited.

1052
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:29,852
- They want to join the store.
- Bring them in.

1053
00:54:30,026 --> 00:54:31,255
Okay.

1054
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,457
Okay, it's open!

1055
00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:35,069
Form two lines.

1056
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:38,676
Rentals on the right
and returns on the left.

1057
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:40,074
The store policy is also...

1058
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:42,274
...two rentals per customer.

1059
00:54:42,452 --> 00:54:44,615
Maybe you'd like to get a film
you didn't know about.

1060
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:48,360
Okay, guys, I'm accepting applications
in this line right here.

1061
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,863
- Hi.
- Hi.

1062
00:54:50,034 --> 00:54:52,060
- What would you like?
- This one Sweded, please.

1063
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,903
Okay. Let me just check to see
if you have the proper documents.

1064
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,844
It seems like you have a lot of Cs.

1065
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:01,078
I don't even think
you really should have passed.

1066
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,228
So we're gonna need a $20
supplement fee for averageness.

1067
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:05,659
- Are you insane? Twenty dollars?
- I'm sorry.

1068
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:07,130
I don't make the rules,
I just have to enforce them.

1069
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:08,667
You're crazy. You're insane.

1070
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,569
- I'm leaving.
- You can bend a rule a little.

1071
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:13,304
- Your movies suck anyway!
- No.

1072
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,915
Next!

1073
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:17,521
- Excuse me.
- Jerry.

1074
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,386
I am RoboCop.

1075
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:22,128
I heard there was a disturbance...

1076
00:55:22,298 --> 00:55:25,294
...at Be Kind Rewind video store.

1077
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:27,704
Mr. RoboCop,
may I have an autograph, please?

1078
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:29,401
- For my grandson?
- Me too, me too.

1079
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:34,579
Anything you say
can and will be held against you...

1080
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:37,222
...in a court of RoboCop.

1081
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:38,788
Miss Falewicz.

1082
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,568
- Hi, Miss Falewicz.
- Yeah.

1083
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:47,340
- Can you Swede this for me?
- Oh, Driving Miss Daisy.

1084
00:55:47,516 --> 00:55:49,145
I'd really rather not do this one.

1085
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,315
I really never really got this movie.

1086
00:55:52,493 --> 00:55:54,122
I thought it was a little condescending.

1087
00:55:54,296 --> 00:55:57,268
It's... It's a lovely movie.
Full of generosity and giving.

1088
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,372
- She teaches him to read.
- I know, ma'am.

1089
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,137
How many movies
have that kind of heart?

1090
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:03,645
Okay.

1091
00:56:03,816 --> 00:56:06,753
Hoke, that's the spot.
Pull over the car.

1092
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:08,983
- Stop the car right... Hoke!
- This is not the spot.

1093
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:10,320
Are you...? Are you deaf?

1094
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:11,930
- I wish I was deaf.
- This is the spot.

1095
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:14,160
Who is that hussy chasing after us?

1096
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:17,776
- Be gone, hussy. Hoke...
- You know we're not filming any of it?

1097
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:19,743
- We're just scouting.
- I know, I'm just practicing.

1098
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,747
I'm staying in character.
Come on, dude.

1099
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:23,582
Let's keep in character, okay?

1100
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:26,159
- All right. Mm-hm.
- Come around the side and help me.

1101
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:27,854
Help me get out of the car.

1102
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:29,294
- Hoke!
- Yes, ma'am.

1103
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:31,197
- Jerry, have you ever seen the movie?
- Hoke.

1104
00:56:31,371 --> 00:56:32,430
She doesn't act like that.

1105
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:34,076
Don't you talk to me like that,
young missy.

1106
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:35,770
- She doesn't act like that.
- You stay over there.

1107
00:56:35,948 --> 00:56:38,783
Hoke, go and find me the grave
that says Werthan on it.

1108
00:56:38,953 --> 00:56:40,388
Go like the wind, run.

1109
00:56:40,556 --> 00:56:42,857
Run, Hoke. Please.

1110
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:46,991
W-E-R-t-H-E-N.

1111
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,698
Hoke, can you hear me?

1112
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,811
Oh, no, Hoke.

1113
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,608
You're illiterate, aren't you?

1114
00:56:53,782 --> 00:56:56,584
- Jerry.
- L'll teach you how to read.

1115
00:56:56,756 --> 00:57:00,661
A W is like a mountain upside down.

1116
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,197
Isn't that clever?

1117
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:04,600
Now, what happens
if you add an "er"...

1118
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:06,264
...to the W?
- Mike!

1119
00:57:06,442 --> 00:57:07,602
- What do you think?
- You get...

1120
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:08,973
- Wer.
- Wer!

1121
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:10,810
Add a "then," what do you get?

1122
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:14,014
- Okay, Jerry, stop.
- Wer...

1123
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:15,750
- Would you stop?
- No.

1124
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,022
- Wer...
- Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

1125
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:19,633
Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

1126
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:21,237
- Mike.
- Knock it off.

1127
00:57:21,406 --> 00:57:22,499
Mike, what are you doing?

1128
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:26,045
- Are we shooting?
- Jerry, come back.

1129
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,548
Jerry.

1130
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:36,060
- Hey.
- Don't mess around. I'm not in the mood.

1131
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,463
You know, I was in character.

1132
00:57:39,642 --> 00:57:41,612
- I know.
- He didn't have to take it so personally.

1133
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:45,776
Well, apparently he did. Jerry, like,
you crossed the line a little bit.

1134
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:47,855
Don't you think
I have my share of humiliation?

1135
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:50,258
Who keeps on giving
the orders all day? He does.

1136
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,660
- Uh-huh.
- Who keeps taking them?

1137
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:53,462
- Well, I kind of do all the time.
- No, no, no, no.

1138
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,162
Me. And why should I?

1139
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,501
- Things have changed.
- Uh-huh.

1140
00:57:56,677 --> 00:57:58,168
People recognize me in the street.

1141
00:57:58,347 --> 00:57:59,645
- Right, Simon?
- Yeah.

1142
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:00,875
Yeah. Yup.

1143
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:02,954
- Yeah.
- They love me. I want my own trailer.

1144
00:58:03,123 --> 00:58:04,649
You have a trailer, okay?

1145
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:05,919
That is where you live.

1146
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:07,462
- Is that spit on there?
- Yes.

1147
00:58:07,632 --> 00:58:09,795
- Come on.
- Everybody does know you on the street...

1148
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,771
...because all you do is go from your shop
to Mr. Fletcher's and back.

1149
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:14,138
- It's true.
- No, you don't get it.

1150
00:58:14,312 --> 00:58:17,283
They look at me in a different way,
with love and resp...

1151
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,183
- I'm a star.
- You are a star.

1152
00:58:19,356 --> 00:58:21,189
I want my own trailer
next to my trailer.

1153
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,830
A movie trailer.
That trailer doesn't count.

1154
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,635
Get up, Jerry.

1155
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:29,537
- Everybody's ready.
- It's my time!

1156
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,804
Ali's the man!

1157
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:40,195
Ali! Ali! Ali!

1158
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:41,833
Lt's okay. We're not suggesting...

1159
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:45,771
As far as Foreman goes,
he was devastating that punching bag...

1160
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:48,881
...and we writers
were so frightened for Ali...

1161
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:50,609
...that we were...
- It's incredible.

1162
00:58:50,786 --> 00:58:54,316
The pilots are black, I'm black,
the whole plane is black...

1163
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:56,554
...and we're not crashing.

1164
00:59:00,472 --> 00:59:03,535
Dave, it's me, HAL.

1165
00:59:03,712 --> 00:59:07,208
I'm afraid I can't open
the pod doors, Dave.

1166
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:10,552
Why don't you take a jog
around the space capsule?

1167
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:13,893
Okay, I'm ready. Go.

1168
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,368
Alma! This is ketchup.

1169
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:54,776
- You said you were gonna use Kool-Aid!
- Sorry.

1170
00:59:54,948 --> 00:59:56,941
God, Alma.

1171
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:00,154
Oh, where's the driver?

1172
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:02,086
All right.

1173
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:04,392
We gotta stop off
and pick up an Enquirer.

1174
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,205
Find out what the aliens are doing.

1175
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:10,174
We're upside down!
Look, I'm upside down.

1176
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:14,582
The whole universe is in a marble!

1177
01:00:35,462 --> 01:00:38,229
I'm glad you have come to your senses.

1178
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:40,304
I have a list of addresses here
for you to visit.

1179
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:41,839
Hey, hey. No, no, no.

1180
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:45,414
Tomorrow, I am starting
a progressive transition...

1181
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:49,022
...to a modern medium the D vD.

1182
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,220
You see, I've found
these affordable D vD players...

1183
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:54,891
...that I'm going to recommend
to my customers.

1184
01:00:55,103 --> 01:00:57,072
Within a couple of months,
half of my catalogue...

1185
01:00:57,239 --> 01:00:59,301
...will be digital.
The rest, by the end of the year.

1186
01:00:59,478 --> 01:01:02,645
Which means more titles
in the same space...

1187
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:04,080
...and more business.

1188
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:06,281
Listen, if you don't want
the building demolished...

1189
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,861
...then you're going to have to
make these renovations...

1190
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:11,695
...with one of the city's
licensed contractors.

1191
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:15,070
Do you have any idea of the kind of costs
we're talking about here?

1192
01:01:15,243 --> 01:01:18,307
Here's an estimate
of the cost to repair the roof.

1193
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:21,922
And that's the bare minimum
of work needed. I...

1194
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,653
- I just don't see it happening.
- Okay.

1195
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:26,422
Okay, what?

1196
01:01:27,835 --> 01:01:28,928
L'll fix the roof.

1197
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:31,339
Fine.

1198
01:01:31,643 --> 01:01:34,705
You now have six weeks before
Mr. Baker brings the demolition crew...

1199
01:01:34,882 --> 01:01:38,617
...then you're going to have to
relocate yourself at your own expense.

1200
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:48,667
Next!

1201
01:01:51,549 --> 01:01:52,778
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1202
01:01:52,952 --> 01:01:54,285
Whoa, he cut the line!

1203
01:01:54,455 --> 01:01:56,288
- Hey, gramps.
- Hey.

1204
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,691
Back of the line.
I've been waiting an hour out there.

1205
01:01:58,864 --> 01:02:00,493
- Yeah.
- I came all the way from New York.

1206
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:01,897
New York, for real?

1207
01:02:02,071 --> 01:02:03,700
- Mike and Jerry are famous there?
- No.

1208
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,400
- Hey, back out.
- My... My shop.

1209
01:02:05,577 --> 01:02:08,914
I'm really sorry, sir, but you're going
to have to go to the back of the line.

1210
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:11,522
- I can't afford a riot in the shop.
- No, this is my business.

1211
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:13,784
Can somebody explain to me
what's going on here?

1212
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:16,329
- Hey, Mike! Where's Mikey? Mike!
- Mr. Fletcher.

1213
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,128
- What's going on, man?
- Oh, hey.

1214
01:02:18,304 --> 01:02:20,136
I can... I can explain everything.

1215
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:22,938
Something terrible happened
with the tapes.

1216
01:02:23,113 --> 01:02:24,980
They all got erased.

1217
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:27,951
I know you didn't want Jerry
to come into the store...

1218
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:29,386
...but...
- Jerry?

1219
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,760
All right, this is the last autograph.
My fingers are getting tired. I'm serious.

1220
01:02:32,933 --> 01:02:34,424
- Oh, man.
- L'll see you guys tomorrow.

1221
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:36,732
Let me take your bag for you,
then I can explain...

1222
01:02:36,907 --> 01:02:39,845
Uh-oh, who's back? Mr. Fletchy.
Hey, welcome home, man.

1223
01:02:40,014 --> 01:02:41,505
I got the slogan. Check it out

1224
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:44,918
"Be Kind Rewind, videos a la Carte.

1225
01:02:45,191 --> 01:02:46,557
You name it, we shoot it.

1226
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:48,560
Be Kind Rewind, videos a la Carte."

1227
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:50,564
- Jerry.
- That's great. I think he gets it.

1228
01:02:50,735 --> 01:02:53,571
- Thanks, Jerry.
- It's snappy. Just put a little drums under it.

1229
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:55,574
- We'll just...
- I didn't mean to scream at you.

1230
01:02:55,746 --> 01:02:58,045
- I didn't know that you were the boss.
- You know what I mean?

1231
01:02:58,216 --> 01:03:00,653
Listen, kids.
I appreciate your creativity...

1232
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:03,157
...but let's be realistic for a second.

1233
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:07,165
We will never hit that number,
and the building will be gone.

1234
01:03:07,335 --> 01:03:08,964
Oh, no, Mr. Fletcher. We can do it.

1235
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:10,972
We've... We've been doing really,
really good.

1236
01:03:11,143 --> 01:03:13,113
You know, we've been working hard.
We grow every day.

1237
01:03:13,281 --> 01:03:16,378
It's far from enough.
We need to adapt to the market.

1238
01:03:16,555 --> 01:03:19,186
So to hell with documentaries...

1239
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,556
...oldies, cult movies.

1240
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,860
We need to simplify.

1241
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:25,300
Two sections.

1242
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:28,409
Action-adventures, comedies.
That's it.

1243
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:30,981
We got to keep the silent movies,
the Fats movies.

1244
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,713
No, no. Quiet. I don't wanna hear
any more about Fats Waller.

1245
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:37,227
New rules apply
from tomorrow morning.

1246
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,971
Oh, and I forgot.

1247
01:03:44,176 --> 01:03:46,443
D vDs.

1248
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,084
D vD, what?

1249
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,945
No more tapes.

1250
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:53,561
The entire catalogue has to be on D vD
by the end of the year.

1251
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:54,959
And our films?

1252
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:57,068
Yours and whatever we rent
from my store.

1253
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:09,794
I don't know why he's doing this.

1254
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:13,230
It's like everything
that we've been doing...

1255
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:16,374
...is just nothing? Lt's... Just like...

1256
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:18,846
- We can't keep doing this.
- No way.

1257
01:04:19,013 --> 01:04:23,044
We are doing better business
than this store has ever done.

1258
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:24,850
We're... We're celebrities now.

1259
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:27,292
We're on the power list.
He has to listen to us.

1260
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:30,230
No. No, he don't.
I should've known.

1261
01:04:30,403 --> 01:04:34,002
It's my fault. I should've known.
He don't like... He don't like remakes.

1262
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,074
It's worthless to him.

1263
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:39,345
It's like I'm nothing to him.
I just... I just work here.

1264
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:46,358
Filthy little punk.

1265
01:04:51,245 --> 01:04:54,342
No way this punk kid
gonna put his filth on my piano.

1266
01:05:01,432 --> 01:05:04,428
No. I erased all the tapes.

1267
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,406
I'm the little punk.

1268
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,081
Why is it always about you guys?

1269
01:05:11,253 --> 01:05:12,687
What about me?

1270
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:14,687
What about Alma?

1271
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:18,724
I wanna be a filthy punk too,
you know?

1272
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:23,272
These are not just simple remakes.

1273
01:05:23,443 --> 01:05:25,640
They are way more creative.

1274
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:28,286
Of course, if the business
maintains its current progress...

1275
01:05:28,453 --> 01:05:30,480
...we won't hit the objective.

1276
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:33,061
But if we shorten
the length of the films...

1277
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,893
...we can shoot more of them.

1278
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:39,029
And we will incrementally increase
the increase of the income.

1279
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:41,737
- Can you repeat the last...?
- No, Alma.

1280
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:45,353
- People will feel swindled.
- Not if we include them in the films.

1281
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:46,922
We'll give them parts to play.

1282
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:50,120
This way A, with their help,
we can make more movies...

1283
01:05:50,297 --> 01:05:52,927
...B, the films can be shorter
and they won't feel swindled.

1284
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:56,269
They're not gonna feel cheated,
they won't feel swindled...

1285
01:05:56,443 --> 01:05:58,539
...and they'll see their selves as a part...
- Yes.

1286
01:05:58,715 --> 01:06:00,081
...of the neighborhood.
- They'll become the stockholders...

1287
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,549
...of their own happiness.

1288
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:04,318
You guys, this is something
we can build on.

1289
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,397
If we do more movies
in a shorter time, we can...

1290
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:09,398
- We can rent more movies.
- That's what I'm saying.

1291
01:06:09,603 --> 01:06:12,166
- Wait, that's what I just said.
- I thought it before you said it.

1292
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:13,971
- Doesn't matter who said it first.
- No... Jerry.

1293
01:06:14,146 --> 01:06:15,739
We're all saying...
We're all on the same page.

1294
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,547
- I agree, I agree.
- I wanna be a part of this team officially.

1295
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:20,384
It's like... What do you call that,
when snow falls...?

1296
01:06:20,558 --> 01:06:22,960
- Avalanche.
- No, when... Snowballing.

1297
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:25,931
- Snowballing. Getting bigger and bigger.
- That's an avalanche.

1298
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:29,166
And it incrementally increases
the snowball size.

1299
01:06:29,343 --> 01:06:32,440
- Come on. Right here. I can feel this.
- We need to do this.

1300
01:06:32,616 --> 01:06:34,711
- Go.
- Explode! Big success.

1301
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:43,769
Do you really wanna buy these expensive
and overly complicated D VD players?

1302
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:46,168
No. No way.

1303
01:06:46,344 --> 01:06:49,909
So for only $ 20.
You can purchase this digital unit...

1304
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:53,058
...you can simply tape or glue
into your VCR...

1305
01:06:53,558 --> 01:06:57,191
...and then it upgrades
into our Be Kind Rewind D VD player.

1306
01:06:57,367 --> 01:07:00,339
And only then is when
you can play our Be Kind Rewind...

1307
01:07:00,506 --> 01:07:03,204
- That is good.
...D VDs.

1308
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:05,542
Vacation with Chevy Chase.
Comedy, please.

1309
01:07:05,716 --> 01:07:07,208
- That's not Sweded yet. Sorry.
- Comedy.

1310
01:07:07,387 --> 01:07:10,017
- Comedy.
- The Jerk, action.

1311
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:12,628
Wrong genre. That is a comedy.

1312
01:07:12,797 --> 01:07:14,734
I must exclude you for the day.

1313
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:16,996
You can come back tomorrow.
That's the new system.

1314
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:18,436
You have to say the right thing.

1315
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:20,306
Man, the new system sucks, man.

1316
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:22,244
I'm sick and tired of all these rules.

1317
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:25,218
- Hey, Lord of the Rings is not a comedy.
- We didn't insult your new rules.

1318
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:27,860
Now, listen. I want The Jerk...

1319
01:07:28,195 --> 01:07:30,666
...Sweden by tomorrow.
- Sweded, Sweded.

1320
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:32,462
- Sweded.
- Sweded by tomorrow...

1321
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:35,234
...or this little thing that's in your...

1322
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:37,346
Let me see, let me see.

1323
01:07:37,815 --> 01:07:40,878
I'd be lying if I said
I was not waiting for this opportunity...

1324
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:42,249
...to teach you a lesson.

1325
01:07:42,423 --> 01:07:44,860
Mr. Fletcher,
this is really hurting my arm, okay?

1326
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:46,999
Listen, I apologize, okay?

1327
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:50,070
- Good, good.
- L... I will follow the new rules.

1328
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:51,674
Good. But more importantly...

1329
01:07:51,843 --> 01:07:54,245
...you should never
threaten your auntie again.

1330
01:07:54,414 --> 01:07:56,885
She works very hard
to keep a roof over your head.

1331
01:07:57,053 --> 01:07:58,352
And these guys...

1332
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:01,017
...are working very hard to save ours.

1333
01:08:01,195 --> 01:08:02,595
- You get my drift?
- Yeah, I got it.

1334
01:08:03,065 --> 01:08:05,058
Thank you for the lesson.

1335
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:10,137
Sounds like Fats Waller's
back in the house.

1336
01:08:10,312 --> 01:08:11,576
It's... It's his house.

1337
01:08:13,486 --> 01:08:16,981
Now. My boy. Do you know where
our Fats...

1338
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,222
...did record most of his tunes
and why?

1339
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:21,095
- I know that one.
- I'm not sure.

1340
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:22,670
- I know the answer.
- Mike?

1341
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:24,703
At RC A Studios in Camden.

1342
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:28,337
They liked to drive there on the train on the
way to the studio so they can get drunk.

1343
01:08:28,516 --> 01:08:30,145
Sometimes they didn 't
even get to the studio...

1344
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,552
...because they would get in a fight
or they'd get arrested.

1345
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:35,697
Mr. Fletcher. I don 't really see
the connection with my lesson.

1346
01:08:35,865 --> 01:08:38,837
There is none.
We changed the subject.

1347
01:08:42,377 --> 01:08:43,676
Set up the cameras over there.

1348
01:08:43,847 --> 01:08:46,284
We wanna get in the red car
to do a little make-out session.

1349
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,961
We're walking in the rain.
It's kind of warm and fuzzy, and I kiss you.

1350
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,095
And we're like young lovers.

1351
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:58,976
Wow, these guys are good.

1352
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:01,741
They can shoot any style.

1353
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:03,546
We cast Jack and his friends.

1354
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,084
- Whatever, man.
- You hear what he's saying, man?

1355
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,957
Yo, see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,122
Come on.
You want some of this, buddy?

1357
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,203
I'm shooting him.

1358
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:14,809
Oh, no. Derek!

1359
01:09:15,344 --> 01:09:16,369
Why?

1360
01:09:16,547 --> 01:09:18,812
Look at the pool of blood around him.

1361
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:20,146
He's with Jesus.

1362
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:23,350
What's happening to our 'hood?
Lt's no good.

1363
01:09:23,528 --> 01:09:26,989
It's senseless. The violence.

1364
01:09:40,262 --> 01:09:42,960
Kids, I have to admit...

1365
01:09:45,372 --> 01:09:46,499
...I was wrong.

1366
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:49,474
To movies with heart.

1367
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,178
- And soul.
- I remember the sandwiches too.

1368
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:54,323
- We had pig ears.
- Just look at Mr. Fletcher there.

1369
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,423
- Pig ears and white bread.
- I smell elephant.

1370
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:00,258
You're the number one hunter
in the world.

1371
01:10:00,435 --> 01:10:02,166
When you see that elephant,
you know that you have to kill it.

1372
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:04,907
- That's great. We did it.
- And cut.

1373
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:06,103
Now we're like animals.

1374
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:09,551
I love you, I love you.
I'm having sex with you.

1375
01:10:14,497 --> 01:10:17,196
We're nearly there. One more week.

1376
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,170
"Jerry and Alma in..."
"Jerry and Alma in..."

1377
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:25,709
Jerry and Alma, Jerry and Alma,
Jerry and Alma.

1378
01:10:26,821 --> 01:10:28,792
Are you jealous or something?

1379
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,020
No. No, I'm not.

1380
01:10:31,197 --> 01:10:33,793
Forget about what I even said.
Don't... I'm sorry.

1381
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:35,939
Well... Well, really. I mean...

1382
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:39,569
...how come he's always
the one with you in the movies?

1383
01:10:39,748 --> 01:10:41,217
Lt's always him.

1384
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:45,257
Well, Jerry said
that you complained about my...

1385
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:46,519
that is a dirty lie.

1386
01:10:46,695 --> 01:10:50,533
I never said a word about your mustache.
I didn't say anything about it.

1387
01:10:52,005 --> 01:10:54,944
I never said my mustache.

1388
01:10:55,379 --> 01:10:56,972
Okay, so Jerry was telling the truth.

1389
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:59,143
And that's why you never wanted
to kiss me or anything.

1390
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,382
No, no. I never complained about that.

1391
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,461
Mike, I never said the word,
and you did.

1392
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,790
So how would you know, huh?

1393
01:11:04,965 --> 01:11:07,459
Because he complains about it
all the time, to tell you the truth.

1394
01:11:07,637 --> 01:11:08,731
What's the difference?

1395
01:11:08,907 --> 01:11:11,173
- You think I have one, right?
- No. Really, to be perfectly honest...

1396
01:11:11,346 --> 01:11:13,440
...I don't even think you have one.
- I wish I was dead right now.

1397
01:11:13,616 --> 01:11:15,678
Just really quick. Let me see.

1398
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,862
You know what? I don't see anything.

1399
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:24,264
- I don't see anything.
- You don't see it?

1400
01:11:24,438 --> 01:11:25,929
No.

1401
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,235
Thanks.

1402
01:11:28,412 --> 01:11:30,349
Maybe I should give you a blind test.

1403
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:32,077
Yeah, I think we need a blind test.

1404
01:11:36,863 --> 01:11:38,389
So?

1405
01:11:39,402 --> 01:11:42,202
Hey! You're trying to kiss me.

1406
01:11:42,373 --> 01:11:44,104
- Why not?
- "Why not"?

1407
01:11:44,278 --> 01:11:46,305
- Are you in love with me?
- Huh?

1408
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:48,076
Mm-hm.

1409
01:11:48,253 --> 01:11:49,380
Well, how do I know that?

1410
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,148
You know you're in love
with a person...

1411
01:11:51,326 --> 01:11:54,321
...when you talk to them for a minimum
of 20 minutes a day in your head.

1412
01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:57,493
What if I talk to a guy in my head
for 20 minutes? What would that mean?

1413
01:11:57,671 --> 01:11:59,265
You're in love with Jerry.

1414
01:11:59,442 --> 01:12:01,743
- Huh? Ew, no. We're closed.
- Yes, you are in love with Jerry.

1415
01:12:01,914 --> 01:12:03,645
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, Mike, you hear the door?

1416
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:05,650
Not at all. No, that's not... It c...

1417
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,313
Listen, it could be anybody.

1418
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:10,156
- Mr. T, Fats.
- You are in love with him.

1419
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:12,233
- I know it.
- Mr. Elroy Fletcher.

1420
01:12:12,402 --> 01:12:14,234
Yes.

1421
01:12:14,405 --> 01:12:15,532
To whom it may concern...

1422
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:19,512
...copyright infringement is punishable
by state and federal law.

1423
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:22,449
Now, I hold in my hand a restraining order
from trenton...

1424
01:12:22,622 --> 01:12:27,530
...and, actually, a warrant of seizure
from Washington D.C.

1425
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:29,292
- So you, the defendant...
- What's up?

1426
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:32,134
...have declined to attend
the judgment proceedings...

1427
01:12:32,308 --> 01:12:35,576
...so the studios are coordinating
to assess...

1428
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:38,549
...the damages from...
How many titles is it?

1429
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,623
- Approximately 200.
- Okay. So...

1430
01:12:40,793 --> 01:12:42,352
Oh, what do we have here?

1431
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,362
- A record of rental.
- Oh.

1432
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:47,300
- What?
- Two hundred titles times...

1433
01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:48,634
...how many average viewings?

1434
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:50,335
Sixty-three times per tape.

1435
01:12:50,512 --> 01:12:54,383
Times 250,000 maximum in damages...

1436
01:12:54,553 --> 01:12:58,823
...and/or up to five years in prison...

1437
01:12:58,994 --> 01:13:01,762
...per offense.
- Which adds up to...

1438
01:13:01,935 --> 01:13:05,568
...3. 15 billion dollars in fines...

1439
01:13:05,743 --> 01:13:07,405
...which would need to be paid back
to the studios...

1440
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:10,210
- l'll write you a check.
...and/or...

1441
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,184
...63,000 years in prison.

1442
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,801
Which, of course, would have to be served
before you could reopen the store.

1443
01:13:18,969 --> 01:13:21,439
But we made the movies ourselves.

1444
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:23,008
- They're our...
- And people like them.

1445
01:13:23,177 --> 01:13:26,207
You're... You're right. But technically,
you're wrong. You see, these tapes...

1446
01:13:26,384 --> 01:13:27,613
...belong to the studios.

1447
01:13:27,788 --> 01:13:30,953
Look, it's written.
FBI warning, right there.

1448
01:13:31,126 --> 01:13:32,459
It's at the beginning of the tape
as well.

1449
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:36,627
- But we erased that, so...
- I think it's...

1450
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:39,002
People come here because
they want to see these movies.

1451
01:13:39,177 --> 01:13:42,810
That's why they come here. They're not
interested in those formulaic big movies.

1452
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:44,714
They're not interested in them.
They don't wanna see them.

1453
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,186
Sir. Sir.
Taste has nothing to do with this.

1454
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:47,917
Don't listen to them.
Mr. Fletcher, you can kick them out.

1455
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:49,654
- The entire film industry is crumbling...
- they're trespassing.

1456
01:13:49,832 --> 01:13:50,959
...because of pirates and bootleggers.

1457
01:13:51,134 --> 01:13:53,604
And we intend to stop it.
Right now, right here.

1458
01:13:53,772 --> 01:13:56,802
We're not selling boots,
and we're not... We're not pirates.

1459
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,347
- And we don't have viruses.
- I'm sorry, Mr...

1460
01:13:59,517 --> 01:14:01,077
- Fletcher.
- Mr. Fletcher.

1461
01:14:01,254 --> 01:14:03,053
I mean, look.
I have a family too, okay?

1462
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:05,822
I didn't say I do. I mean,
what has this got to do about a family?

1463
01:14:05,998 --> 01:14:09,094
Nevertheless,
this writ gives us permission...

1464
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:12,835
...to destroy all your black-market tapes
by the end of the day...

1465
01:14:13,012 --> 01:14:16,108
...and all of these assets
in the store...

1466
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:19,257
...are hereby seized
to pay these penalties to the studios.

1467
01:14:19,424 --> 01:14:21,485
No, no, no. These are... No, no, no.
Not the...

1468
01:14:21,663 --> 01:14:23,096
We just want to get in and out...

1469
01:14:23,265 --> 01:14:25,668
...as painlessly as possible.
- Those are Sweded!

1470
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:26,999
Hey, let him go.

1471
01:14:33,085 --> 01:14:34,485
Mr. Fletcher?

1472
01:14:34,655 --> 01:14:36,090
Mr. Fletcher.

1473
01:14:36,258 --> 01:14:38,056
I could save the building.
I got a plan B.

1474
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:41,862
This is a application to make it
a historical landmark.

1475
01:14:42,037 --> 01:14:44,440
I can't believe
that I didn't remember it before.

1476
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:46,977
It's gonna be easy,
because Fats was born here.

1477
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:50,418
No, Mike, it's not so simple.

1478
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:52,647
Why not?
You can go get his birth certificate.

1479
01:14:52,824 --> 01:14:55,455
The address has got to be on the birth
certificate. Go check the public records.

1480
01:14:55,631 --> 01:14:58,101
No, Mike,
we can't provide any documents...

1481
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:01,105
...to prove that Fats lived here.

1482
01:15:01,275 --> 01:15:03,245
You wanna know why?

1483
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:05,416
Huh? You wanna know why?

1484
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:08,714
- Because...
- No, no.

1485
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:10,153
- No, no, listen.
- I don't wanna...

1486
01:15:10,327 --> 01:15:12,160
Now you don't want
to finish my sentences, huh?

1487
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:13,765
Boy, look here. L'll finish it.

1488
01:15:13,935 --> 01:15:17,499
We can't prove
Fats Waller lived here...

1489
01:15:17,675 --> 01:15:19,873
...because he never did.

1490
01:15:32,705 --> 01:15:34,699
I think you should come one more time.

1491
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:40,476
Just tell me why.

1492
01:15:44,095 --> 01:15:46,965
Well, they started as bedtime stories.

1493
01:15:47,134 --> 01:15:49,229
I was trying to make this place
bearable for you.

1494
01:15:50,909 --> 01:15:53,938
And then I could never bring myself
to tell you the truth.

1495
01:15:54,115 --> 01:15:56,552
Well, why Fats Waller?

1496
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,086
You could have picked anybody.

1497
01:15:59,326 --> 01:16:02,628
I mean, Duke Ellington
or Louis Armstrong or...

1498
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:04,564
Fats was a happy man.

1499
01:16:04,736 --> 01:16:07,401
And I thought
it would make you happy.

1500
01:16:07,844 --> 01:16:10,679
And it's true, I lied.

1501
01:16:10,915 --> 01:16:14,047
Now I'm going to hell, upstairs.

1502
01:16:22,305 --> 01:16:25,300
Here we are, we're the villains, right?

1503
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:00,978
Hold that.

1504
01:17:16,448 --> 01:17:18,383
Mike!

1505
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:20,785
We want more movies.

1506
01:17:20,957 --> 01:17:22,790
We want more movies!

1507
01:17:22,961 --> 01:17:24,793
Come on, baby.

1508
01:17:24,964 --> 01:17:27,869
Mike, wake up, baby.
We need to make more movies.

1509
01:17:28,038 --> 01:17:30,305
- What are you doing?
- Look at all these people here.

1510
01:17:30,476 --> 01:17:32,274
- We want more movies, man.
- Yeah.

1511
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:36,113
We cannot do these movies anymore.
It's illegal.

1512
01:17:36,287 --> 01:17:37,551
You can make your own.

1513
01:17:37,724 --> 01:17:41,493
- I don't have ideas for movies, Jerry.
- Oh, bullpucky.

1514
01:17:41,665 --> 01:17:44,796
You have got tons of ideas.
Brilliant ideas.

1515
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:47,034
I hear them,
you mumble them in your sleep.

1516
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:50,649
Mike, we can make
any movie we want.

1517
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:53,984
We don't have to make one... they can't
sue us if we're making new ones.

1518
01:17:54,524 --> 01:17:58,157
Make whatever you want.
Make Rush Hour 6. whatever.

1519
01:17:58,332 --> 01:17:59,800
You know what I mean?

1520
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:03,168
Let's make Scary Town 5000.

1521
01:18:03,342 --> 01:18:05,107
We make it up, baby.

1522
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,079
- You're the best director I know.
- Wait a minute.

1523
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,275
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm the best actor...

1524
01:18:08,452 --> 01:18:10,046
...that I know.
- I have an idea.

1525
01:18:10,222 --> 01:18:12,990
And together we're a team
that can't be stopped!

1526
01:18:13,162 --> 01:18:16,533
Mike. Where did you go? Come back.

1527
01:18:16,703 --> 01:18:17,762
Come on, Mike.

1528
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:19,908
I want Mr. Fletcher to see.

1529
01:18:20,076 --> 01:18:22,410
Mr. Fletcher.

1530
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,851
Mr. Fletcher!

1531
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:27,421
What do you need me for?

1532
01:18:28,025 --> 01:18:29,494
To hell with them, Mr. Fletcher.

1533
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:32,759
We don't have to move to the projects
if we don't want, we can stay right here.

1534
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:35,201
How do we do that, exactly?

1535
01:18:35,373 --> 01:18:37,241
We're gonna make a movie, all of us.

1536
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:39,244
All of these people
came out to support us.

1537
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,974
We're gonna make a movie together.

1538
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,414
Like the city that saves itself?

1539
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:45,024
No, no. Check it, check it.

1540
01:18:45,194 --> 01:18:48,564
We're gonna do a movie
about Fats Waller's life.

1541
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,795
Your hero, my hero.

1542
01:18:50,971 --> 01:18:54,742
And we don't need permission
to make movies on our own.

1543
01:18:54,913 --> 01:18:56,404
This is for us to watch.

1544
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,453
- The whole town is participating.
- It'll be ours.

1545
01:18:59,622 --> 01:19:02,618
The movie could be called
Fats Was Born in Passaic.

1546
01:19:02,796 --> 01:19:05,562
- Yeah!
- Everybody knows I was lying.

1547
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:08,969
- You gonna humiliate me again?
- No. No, Mr. Fletcher.

1548
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:11,305
No, he's trying to prove you were right.

1549
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:15,317
Our past belongs to us,
we can change it if we want.

1550
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:18,483
Sure. My mom...

1551
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:22,829
My mom saw Fats Waller playing...

1552
01:19:23,003 --> 01:19:26,271
Playing the piano right here
in the Passaic theater.

1553
01:19:26,443 --> 01:19:29,905
Sure. Anybody wanna
say anything about that?

1554
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:31,245
Yes, me.

1555
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:35,884
My grandfather used to watch him
play Bach every night in the church.

1556
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:39,126
- There you go.
- My great-uncle saved his life.

1557
01:19:39,303 --> 01:19:43,573
He took the train to Camden
to record in the RCA studios.

1558
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:46,181
He really did take the train to Camden.

1559
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,613
That's right!

1560
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:50,018
Mike. We only have a week
before the demolition.

1561
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,557
It's not a problem. That's okay.

1562
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:53,720
We'll shoot the whole thing in a week.

1563
01:19:53,899 --> 01:19:55,892
And we could take donations
to see the movie...

1564
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,732
...and use the money
to save the building.

1565
01:19:57,906 --> 01:20:00,811
- L'll play Fats.
- No, no. You're not. I'm gonna play Fats.

1566
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,039
We'll see who plays Fats.

1567
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:04,151
- You're not gonna play Fats.
- We'll see. There'll be an audition process.

1568
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:05,719
No, there's not.
You're not gonna play Fats.

1569
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:07,449
- May the best man play Fats.
- Okay.

1570
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:08,890
Anyway, we should do it.

1571
01:20:10,499 --> 01:20:11,966
Good idea.

1572
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:23,385
- Test, test, test.
- It looks like it's working.

1573
01:20:23,559 --> 01:20:24,754
- I can't tell if it's working.
- I think it's working...

1574
01:20:24,928 --> 01:20:25,988
...because this is pressed down.
- All right.

1575
01:20:26,164 --> 01:20:28,030
- Test. I can 't tell.
- It's working.

1576
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,897
- Yeah, that's... Okay.
- It's working.

1577
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:33,807
But it all started right here
at 261 Main Street.

1578
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,182
Miss Falewicz, can you tell us
some of the true history of Fats Waller?

1579
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:41,624
Fats was born
in Mr. Fletcher's video store.

1580
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:44,266
He was the youngest
of seven children...

1581
01:20:44,434 --> 01:20:48,876
...and all of them died
before they even got to be 5.

1582
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:50,341
- Gangsters killed them all.
- Yep.

1583
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:54,008
- They came low-riding.
- Yup, they just shot them. They were like

1584
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:55,622
- they were like ninjas.
- Yeah.

1585
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:57,384
But, boys, there's nothing fun about it.

1586
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,462
- They were awful.
- It was kind of fun, though...

1587
01:20:59,631 --> 01:21:00,656
...if you think about it.

1588
01:21:00,834 --> 01:21:04,034
What is the first instrument
that Fats learned to play?

1589
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:08,643
- From what I recall it was the piano.
- I think it was the harmonium, actually.

1590
01:21:08,816 --> 01:21:11,048
Yes, she's correct.

1591
01:21:11,222 --> 01:21:16,220
And he moved on to play one of the
biggest instruments in the music business.

1592
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:17,424
And that's the organ.

1593
01:21:17,601 --> 01:21:21,370
He would spend nights here
playing, like, Bach.

1594
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:24,207
You know, here at the great organ here.
Right here.

1595
01:21:26,085 --> 01:21:29,352
You guys, listen. There's a lot of
different ways we can start the movie...

1596
01:21:29,525 --> 01:21:33,465
...but I'm just putting my vote in,
we start at Fats' birth.

1597
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:34,727
Boring.

1598
01:21:35,336 --> 01:21:38,103
Hey, man. I think we should have the
gangsters. You know what I'm saying?

1599
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:41,271
- With the
- I like that.

1600
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:44,421
Everybody, listen, listen.
Start with the death.

1601
01:21:44,588 --> 01:21:46,923
- But that's backwards.
- No, it's not backwards at all.

1602
01:21:47,094 --> 01:21:49,360
That is like Citizen Kane.
You are an original.

1603
01:21:49,532 --> 01:21:50,863
If you're going backwards...

1604
01:21:51,034 --> 01:21:54,634
...then do the people talk, like,
backwards in the scene?

1605
01:22:09,672 --> 01:22:15,274
Ain 't misbehavin '
Saving all my lovin ' for you

1606
01:22:18,857 --> 01:22:21,124
You know... I'm fat. Fats is fat.

1607
01:22:21,295 --> 01:22:23,858
That's his name.
So I thought I could...

1608
01:22:24,034 --> 01:22:28,874
You thought wrong.
But let's have a conversation about this.

1609
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,536
Just a brief conversation.

1610
01:22:30,714 --> 01:22:33,379
He's not even fat.
I don't even think he looks like him at all.

1611
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:35,319
- Be quiet.
- Go outside.

1612
01:22:36,059 --> 01:22:39,122
Somebody's about to get knocked out.

1613
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:42,368
Kansas City, the train station,
the death scene.

1614
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:44,667
Mr. Jack, Mr. Jack. It's going.

1615
01:22:44,843 --> 01:22:47,280
It's good. It's good.
Thank you, Andrea.

1616
01:22:47,448 --> 01:22:49,612
- What the hell is a "harmoninium" anyway?
- Harmonium.

1617
01:22:49,787 --> 01:22:52,314
Okay, what is it, just a weird thing
that makes harmonies?

1618
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:53,550
- It's fine.
- I give up.

1619
01:22:53,728 --> 01:22:55,094
You got the keyboard here already.

1620
01:22:55,264 --> 01:22:56,756
Fats liked to tickle the piano, right?

1621
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:58,904
So my hand touches
the black keys, the white keys.

1622
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:00,404
- It's wrong.
- And then we tickle.

1623
01:23:00,574 --> 01:23:02,704
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Fats played a piano, not a finger machine.

1624
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,873
- You gotta put something there with keys.
- It's funny.

1625
01:23:05,051 --> 01:23:07,817
It's cheating. You're just lazy.
You gotta put something in there.

1626
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,257
Doesn't look very much like the '20s.

1627
01:23:10,428 --> 01:23:11,919
- It's clearly a bathtub.
- This goes?

1628
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:14,500
No, forget it. You know what?
Forget it. I got a better idea.

1629
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:17,072
We gotta have a bunch of them anyway.
You know what I'm thinking?

1630
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,337
- What?
- Get me some cardboard.

1631
01:23:22,886 --> 01:23:25,357
Hey, look, this is how
you make it look old.

1632
01:23:25,525 --> 01:23:28,258
The fan give the impression
that it's a old film.

1633
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:30,298
And the string is for the scratches.
See?

1634
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:31,936
This is for the voice-over.

1635
01:23:32,105 --> 01:23:34,633
Miss Falewicz. Can you tell us
some of the true history...?

1636
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:36,838
And also this is for the music.

1637
01:23:37,015 --> 01:23:40,545
Fats was born
in Mr. Fletcher's video store.

1638
01:23:42,593 --> 01:23:44,392
And push and breathe.

1639
01:23:44,564 --> 01:23:48,333
And make a groaning sound like,
"Oh, there's a baby coming out of me."

1640
01:23:48,505 --> 01:23:50,975
Wilson, send the kids.

1641
01:23:51,144 --> 01:23:52,839
- Some gangsters killed them all.
- Yep.

1642
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:56,111
- They came low-riding.
- They were like ninjas.

1643
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:02,263
And I heard
that there was glass everywhere.

1644
01:24:02,433 --> 01:24:04,426
The gang was like a pizza gang.

1645
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:07,542
And when they killed you. There was
always a pizza behind you on the wall.

1646
01:24:07,711 --> 01:24:09,942
Fall, fall. Mr. Jack, fall.

1647
01:24:10,883 --> 01:24:13,684
When he was young he used to follow
his father around the streets...

1648
01:24:13,857 --> 01:24:16,088
...because his father
was a street minister.

1649
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:20,497
Even if I ascended to heaven,
thou art there.

1650
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:22,537
Clap your hands.

1651
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:24,404
- Does it look good or what?
- Yeah.

1652
01:24:24,577 --> 01:24:26,240
Continue to jiggle.

1653
01:24:26,415 --> 01:24:28,317
- Tickle the keys, Mike.
- I'm doing it.

1654
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:30,079
I can clearly see
that you're not doing it.

1655
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:32,249
- I barely can see...
- I'm clearly doing it.

1656
01:24:33,328 --> 01:24:35,458
Yeah. Okay.

1657
01:24:36,669 --> 01:24:39,162
Wilson, how do you drive a train?

1658
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,934
Push up the switches
on the generator.

1659
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:42,478
Okay. I got it.

1660
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,485
Yeah!

1661
01:24:55,474 --> 01:24:56,942
Alma, you in position?

1662
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,240
We're just crossing the river now.
You see us?

1663
01:24:59,415 --> 01:25:02,181
Yeah. I can see you.
I'm starting the camera.

1664
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,654
Come on, blow that trombone harder.
That is not a piccolo. Mike.

1665
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:12,205
You need to act more drunker.
Come on, you guys are better than that.

1666
01:25:12,374 --> 01:25:13,399
Action!

1667
01:25:21,526 --> 01:25:25,125
Let me tell you. Rent party
was the place to be in the '20s and '30s.

1668
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,535
Man. They were jumping.

1669
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:33,946
Clear out, clear out. Cops are coming.
Cops are coming, come on.

1670
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:45,497
Alma.

1671
01:25:46,243 --> 01:25:47,574
Go, go, go.

1672
01:25:47,745 --> 01:25:49,179
Aren't you guys being
a bit ambitious here?

1673
01:25:49,348 --> 01:25:50,817
No. This is what makes the movie.

1674
01:25:50,985 --> 01:25:52,853
All right, all right.
This is getting dangerous.

1675
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:57,259
- Promise me this is it.
- We promise, Mr. Fletcher.

1676
01:25:57,432 --> 01:25:59,835
Okay, go, go.

1677
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,904
Not the big one, not the big one.

1678
01:26:04,078 --> 01:26:06,641
- What's it matter?
- Do the little one, okay?

1679
01:26:06,818 --> 01:26:09,381
- No, no, no. It says use other door.
- Jeez.

1680
01:26:09,556 --> 01:26:12,824
- Okay, fine, just shield your...
- Just let the car go by.

1681
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:25,179
- What is this? What the crap?
- God dang it.

1682
01:26:25,354 --> 01:26:27,551
I told you I wanted
to break the big glass.

1683
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:38,304
Why? Lt's like a hall of mirrors.

1684
01:26:38,481 --> 01:26:40,883
- What the crap, what is this?
- That's it. I'm going home.

1685
01:26:44,827 --> 01:26:45,955
Come on, let's go.

1686
01:26:47,232 --> 01:26:51,366
- Be careful. It's over there.
- Shut up.

1687
01:26:52,676 --> 01:26:54,236
- You got it?
- Yep.

1688
01:26:54,413 --> 01:26:57,385
You got it?

1689
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,216
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1690
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:00,859
What...?

1691
01:27:01,027 --> 01:27:02,757
Mike?

1692
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:05,800
- Mike, what are you doing?
- Nothing. We were leaving, don't hurt us.

1693
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,806
- Of course I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Why do you got that knife then?

1694
01:27:08,976 --> 01:27:11,310
- I thought you were robbers, man.
- Jerry, help me.

1695
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:13,542
Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

1696
01:27:13,719 --> 01:27:15,689
Release.

1697
01:27:19,363 --> 01:27:23,201
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1698
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:25,637
Are you...? Are you sleeping here?

1699
01:27:25,809 --> 01:27:27,574
I n the hardcore-porn room?

1700
01:27:27,747 --> 01:27:31,243
Temporarily, yes,
I am sleeping here, okay?

1701
01:27:31,422 --> 01:27:33,357
I don't want anybody
to know this, all right, please?

1702
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:34,550
Fellas, I tell you what.

1703
01:27:34,728 --> 01:27:38,327
L'll fix the windows,
you keep that quiet.

1704
01:27:38,502 --> 01:27:39,527
- Okay.
- Please.

1705
01:27:39,704 --> 01:27:41,138
We just gonna go.

1706
01:27:41,307 --> 01:27:44,040
Okay, let's go. Stealth.

1707
01:27:53,466 --> 01:27:55,960
- Don't get involved. Don't get involved.
- Is that it?

1708
01:27:57,941 --> 01:27:59,740
I tried to hold them back
as best I could. Guys, we can't...

1709
01:27:59,912 --> 01:28:00,937
- We got a job to do.
- I know you do.

1710
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:03,084
- It's on. It's on.
- All right.

1711
01:28:04,454 --> 01:28:07,221
Come on in. Everybody, don't
forget to put money in the can.

1712
01:28:07,393 --> 01:28:09,762
- We're trying to raise money.
- Every dollar helps.

1713
01:28:09,932 --> 01:28:13,371
You know, if you got a 20, that's gonna
help even more. That's more valuable.

1714
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,372
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

1715
01:28:15,544 --> 01:28:16,807
Hey there. Yes, sir. Thank you.

1716
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,609
Make sure you have
a donation for church.

1717
01:28:18,783 --> 01:28:21,584
I will do. All right then. Thank you, sir.
The check will be fine.

1718
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:22,883
All right.

1719
01:28:23,058 --> 01:28:26,259
Can you put the tv a little bit higher?

1720
01:28:27,567 --> 01:28:28,593
All right.

1721
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,367
This is exciting. Oh, a 20.

1722
01:28:31,543 --> 01:28:33,137
It's gonna work, right?

1723
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:34,975
Well, I took the offer.

1724
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:37,245
It looks like we're gonna be
moving to the projects.

1725
01:28:37,421 --> 01:28:41,361
The money we collect tonight is not gonna
be enough to even start the work.

1726
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:45,492
So, what we gonna do is watch the movie.
And then we go.

1727
01:28:45,671 --> 01:28:47,402
- Come on. All right?
- She can't see the tv.

1728
01:28:47,575 --> 01:28:48,601
- Can you see it now?
- Yeah.

1729
01:28:48,778 --> 01:28:51,305
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Okay.

1730
01:28:51,482 --> 01:28:54,420
Have a little faith, you guys,
he's gonna be here.

1731
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:58,051
If you can just remain patient,
and don't forget to put money in the can.

1732
01:28:58,229 --> 01:29:01,760
- Mike. Mike. Mike!
- Everybody stay cool.

1733
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:06,503
Mike. Mike. Mike!

1734
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:20,201
Who would expect a simple influenza virus
would get him in his bed?

1735
01:29:20,374 --> 01:29:23,347
Mike. Mike, stop shooting now.

1736
01:29:23,514 --> 01:29:26,315
- What are you doing?
- I'm just getting the end shot.

1737
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:28,923
- I have to get the end titles.
- It doesn't have to be perfect.

1738
01:29:29,091 --> 01:29:32,827
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I've been looking... I've been here all day.

1739
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,404
Yeah. No, we... I didn't start the job.

1740
01:29:36,573 --> 01:29:41,311
I can't demolish a building
with a hundred people in it, that's why.

1741
01:29:41,483 --> 01:29:43,008
Right, good idea.

1742
01:29:43,186 --> 01:29:44,450
He's coming down.

1743
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:47,795
What is this?

1744
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:53,998
- Mike's here.
- Hey, look who's here.

1745
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,209
Oh, no.

1746
01:30:00,756 --> 01:30:04,058
No one could see it,
so I had to put it up on a higher thing.

1747
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:06,495
- You messed up the tv, man.
- I messed up the tv.

1748
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,831
So how we gonna watch it?

1749
01:30:10,976 --> 01:30:14,609
Yo, Fletcher.
What the hell's going on here?

1750
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:19,192
Well, right now, we need you, baby.
We need you.

1751
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,124
- Right here, right here.
- What is that?

1752
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:23,733
- Is this what you've been looking for?
- It's a projector?

1753
01:30:23,902 --> 01:30:26,669
- Where shall I put the monster?
- Right here, right here.

1754
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:28,936
Put this right here.
This is the finest machinery...

1755
01:30:29,112 --> 01:30:31,140
...made for mankind.
- Oh, my God.

1756
01:30:31,317 --> 01:30:32,809
- I saved the day.
- Yeah.

1757
01:30:32,988 --> 01:30:35,015
- Okay. That's good.
- It's dangerous in here.

1758
01:30:35,192 --> 01:30:37,788
To tell you the truth, I don't think people
could have seen the little tv...

1759
01:30:37,963 --> 01:30:39,592
...from the back anyway.
It would've been...

1760
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,327
I think everybody should turn around
and watch...

1761
01:30:41,505 --> 01:30:43,974
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everyone, turn your seats around.

1762
01:30:44,143 --> 01:30:46,409
We're gonna watch the movie
up on the wall now.

1763
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:48,141
- Yes, we are.
- And it's much better.

1764
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:50,221
It's actually... It's a blessing in disguise.

1765
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,188
Because the tv...
We were gonna watch it on a tv this big.

1766
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:53,520
You ain't gonna see an image
brighter than this.

1767
01:30:53,696 --> 01:30:55,289
You will never see an image
sharper than this.

1768
01:30:55,466 --> 01:30:58,699
Now, that's a premiere.
Make it as big as you can.

1769
01:30:58,872 --> 01:31:02,608
Make it as... Yeah.
Stretch it from there all the way to there.

1770
01:31:02,781 --> 01:31:04,683
Anything you need...

1771
01:31:04,852 --> 01:31:06,981
Just keep your hands off this.
This is fine machinery.

1772
01:31:07,156 --> 01:31:10,128
- I will. I promise.
- We did it!

1773
01:31:13,035 --> 01:31:15,402
All right, let's get it going.
Let's get this show on the road.

1774
01:31:15,573 --> 01:31:19,138
- Yeah!
- That's what we waiting for.

1775
01:31:38,185 --> 01:31:41,852
Well. It all began right here.
On this spot.

1776
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:43,587
It was a different neighborhood then.
But look here...

1777
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:45,699
...he was born in 261 Main Street.

1778
01:31:45,868 --> 01:31:47,997
It's a boy.

1779
01:31:52,848 --> 01:31:54,248
Here's our part. Here's our part.

1780
01:31:54,418 --> 01:31:57,015
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah!

1781
01:31:57,959 --> 01:32:00,624
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1782
01:32:21,106 --> 01:32:24,272
Yes. In the Century Theater.
Right here in Passaic.

1783
01:32:24,445 --> 01:32:26,381
Mr. Fletcher? What's going on?

1784
01:32:26,549 --> 01:32:28,986
Oh, hi, Mr. Baker.

1785
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:32,757
- Let's step outside.
- Wait, hold on a second, Mr. Fletcher.

1786
01:32:32,929 --> 01:32:34,694
I'm sorry, but time is up.
We agreed on this.

1787
01:32:34,867 --> 01:32:37,134
Now, you must evacuate the building
so we can start.

1788
01:32:37,305 --> 01:32:40,709
Okay. Mr. Baker, you're right.

1789
01:32:40,879 --> 01:32:43,213
We should've evacuated an hour ago.

1790
01:32:43,384 --> 01:32:47,586
But, please,
let us watch our film. Okay?

1791
01:32:47,759 --> 01:32:51,255
And if you give me just one hour,
I promise there won't be a riot.

1792
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:54,604
An empty building,
and you can pull it down.

1793
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:56,834
It's all yours.

1794
01:32:57,345 --> 01:33:00,578
- Please.
- You have one hour.

1795
01:33:01,754 --> 01:33:03,017
One hour.

1796
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:10,368
Fats' life was on a train.

1797
01:33:10,538 --> 01:33:11,836
He had given up flying.

1798
01:33:12,008 --> 01:33:16,175
He was tired of being refused entrance
to the plane because of his color.

1799
01:33:18,354 --> 01:33:21,589
Once. However.
Segregation saved his life.

1800
01:33:22,295 --> 01:33:27,135
The plane he had been rejected from
crashed in Kansas City.

1801
01:34:00,506 --> 01:34:02,942
Fats. Are you okay?

1802
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:04,511
Fats. You okay?

1803
01:34:05,449 --> 01:34:07,750
Oh. My God. You're... Fats. Wake up.

1804
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:10,255
Fats.

1805
01:34:10,426 --> 01:34:13,057
Is there a doctor on the train?

1806
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:18,671
Help! Help! Help!
Is there a doctor on the train?

1807
01:34:18,842 --> 01:34:20,141
We need a doctor!

1808
01:34:20,312 --> 01:34:22,647
He 's my friend!

1809
01:34:22,818 --> 01:34:26,918
Anybody? This train 's not leaving
until we get a doctor!

1810
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:10,791
Say up in Harlem at a table for two

1811
01:36:11,736 --> 01:36:15,438
There were four of us
Me. Your big feet and you

1812
01:36:16,112 --> 01:36:19,084
From your ankle up
l'll say you sure are sweet

1813
01:36:19,887 --> 01:36:22,791
From there down
There 's just too much feet

1814
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,397
Yes. Your feet's too big

1815

Don 't want ya 'cause your feet's too big

1816
01:36:30,642 --> 01:36:33,408
Can 't use you 'cause your feet's too big

1817
01:36:34,249 --> 01:36:37,814
I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big

1818
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:46,431

1819
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:52,042
Your girl. She likes you
She thinks you're nice

1820
01:36:52,754 --> 01:36:56,056
Got what it takes to be in paradise

1821
01:36:56,226 --> 01:36:58,129
She said she likes your face

1822
01:36:58,298 --> 01:37:00,097
She likes your rig

1823
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:03,706
Man. Oh. Man. Them things are too big

1824
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:06,312
Oh. Your feet's too big

1825
01:37:07,149 --> 01:37:10,384
Don 't want ya 'cause your feet's too big

1826
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:14,621
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big

1827
01:37:15,733 --> 01:37:18,034
I hate ya 'cause your feet's too big

1828
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:38,869
Are you good? Is that good?

1829
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:43,947
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

1830
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:48,429
Forget about the bamboo,
we gotta go solve a crime.

1831
01:37:57,006 --> 01:38:04,782

01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:12,545
There 's more to life
Than this old place. Hey

1833
01:38:12,948 --> 01:38:17,686
Put your dreams in suitcase

1834
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:26,539
Go to explore another land

1835
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:33,216
Stand in a spot you never planned

1836
01:38:34,058 --> 01:38:40,629
You can scoot
Or put down roots

And listen close

01:39:09,396 --> 01:39:13,837
This song hits brand-new notes

1842
01:39:16,443 --> 01:39:22,684
Our town 's not great
But nothin ' wrong

1843
01:39:23,657 --> 01:39:29,795
Far from the world where we belong

1844
01:39:30,638 --> 01:39:36,708
You can scoot
Or put down roots

Or put down roots
