1
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,590
Here it is!

2
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,120
Thanks.

3
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,630
Did you guys sign it?

4
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,050
Did you sign the card?

5
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,230
And five and four and...

6
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,160
Hey, girls, sign!

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,030
All right! Here you go!

8
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,870
-Elle's gonna love it!
-Thanks.

9
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,410
You go, girl!

10
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,470
Hi, girls! Here, sign!

11
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,910
Thanks!

12
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,350
There she is.

13
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,220
Thank you.

14
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,730
l love that restaurant!

15
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,530
l heard Madonna went into labor there.

16
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,330
Oh, gosh!
l have to go shopping!

17
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,140
l'll see you tonight. Bye.

18
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,230
Bruiser, what's this?
l'll see you tonight. Bye.

19
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,470
Bruiser, what's this?

20
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,850
Good luck tonight.
Elle and Warner forever.

21
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,780
Oh,that's so cute.

22
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh, my gosh!
You guys are so sweet!

23
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,970
But l'm not positive it'll happen tonight.

24
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,510
Hello! He just had lunch with his grandmother.

25
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,480
You know he got the rock.

26
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,840
Why else would she have flown in from Newport?
You know he got the rock.

27
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,540
Why else would she have flown in from Newport?

28
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,110
it's not like she'd Fed Ex a six-carat diamond.

29
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,180
Do you really think?

30
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,040
l can't believe you're getting engaged!

31
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,850
Oh, my gosh...

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,010
you guys have to help me
pick out the perfect outfit.

33
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,480
Come on!

34
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,760
l think you should go with the red.

35
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,330
it's the color of confidence.

36
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,550
l don't understand why you're disregarding...

37
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,360
your signature color.

38
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,860
He's proposing.
l can't look like l would on any other date.
your signature color.

39
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,460
He's proposing.
l can't look like l would on any other date.

40
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,770
This is the date...
the night l'll always remember.

41
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,930
l want to look special.

42
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,370
Bridal.

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,100
But not like l expect anything.

44
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,400
There's nothing l love more...

45
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,600
than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.

46
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,610
Did you see this one?
We just got it in yesterday.

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,210
ls this low-viscosity rayon?

48
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,450
Yes. Of course.

49
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:30,720
Absolutely. it's one of a kind.

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,590
With a half-loop top-stitching on the hem?
Absolutely. it's one of a kind.

51
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:32,820
Absolutely. it's one of a kind.

52
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,360
it's impossible to use
a half-loop top-stitching...

53
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,830
on low-viscosity rayon.
lt would snag the fabric.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
And you didn't just get it in.

55
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,700
l saw it in the June Vogue a year ago.

56
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,830
So if you're trying to sell it for full price...

57
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,410
you picked the wrong girl.

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,840
Girls, this is it.

59
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,380
in a few hours...

60
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,110
l'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington lll.

61
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,560
Wow. You look so beautiful.

62
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,420
So do you.

63
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,960
Let's get out of here.

64
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,020
Must be strange having such perfect eyes.

65
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,290
God, you're so wonderful.
Elle,thank you.

66
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,200
Here's to us.

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,930
To us.

68
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,410
One of the reasons l wanted
to come here tonight...

69
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,240
was to discuss our future.

70
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,580
And l am fully amenable to that discussion.

71
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,350
Good. You know how we've been having...

72
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,720
all kinds of fun lately?

73
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,790
Well, Harvard is gonna be different.

74
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,060
Law school is a completely different world...

75
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,930
and l need to be serious.

76
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,230
Of course.

77
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,470
My family expects a lot from me.

78
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,430
-Right.
-l expect a lot from me.

79
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,440
l plan on running for office someday.

80
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,910
l fully support that.
You know that.

81
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,000
Absolutely.
But the thing is...

82
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,840
if l'm going to be a senator
by the time l'm thirty...

83
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,280
l need to stop dicking around.

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,620
Warner, l completely agree.

85
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,350
That's why l think it's time for us...

86
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,490
Elle, pooh bear...

87
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,000
-l do.
-l think we should break up.

88
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,370
What?

89
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,030
l've been thinking,
and it's the right thing to do.

90
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,570
You're breaking up with me?

91
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,740
l thought you were proposing.

92
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,250
Proposing?

93
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,580
Elle, if l'm going to be a senator...

94
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,550
l need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.

95
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,150
You're breaking up with me
because l'm too blonde?

96
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,230
No. That's not entirely true.

97
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,550
Then what?
My boobs are too big?
No. That's not entirely true.

98
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,660
Then what?
My boobs are too big?

99
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,390
Elle, your boobs are fine.

100
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,060
So when you said
that you would always love me...

101
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,700
you were just dicking around?

102
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,730
Elle, l do love you.

103
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,700
l just can't marry you.

104
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,670
You have no idea
of the pressure that l am under.

105
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,180
My family has five generations of senators.

106
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,350
My brother's in the top three at Yale Law.

107
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,350
He just got engaged to a Vanderbilt,
for Christ's sake.

108
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,800
Bad salad.

109
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,490
Sweetie...

110
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,670
Pooh bear?

111
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,710
it's not like l have a choice here, sweetheart!

112
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,480
You get the car, l'll get the check.

113
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,240
l won't be having the salad.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,280
Let me take you home.

115
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,130
Elle, believe me.
l never expected to do this...

116
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,560
but l think it's the right thing.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,330
How can it be the right thing
when we're not together?

118
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,930
l have to think of my future...

119
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,770
and what my family expects of me.

120
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,670
So you're breaking up with me...

121
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,610
because you're afraid your family won't like me?

122
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,510
Everybody likes me.

123
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,710
East Coast people are different.

124
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,990
Because l'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly l'm white trash?

125
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,880
l grew up in Bel Air!
Because l'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly l'm white trash?

126
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,450
l grew up in Bel Air!

127
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,080
Across the street from Aaron Spelling!

128
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,120
Most people would agree that's a lot better...

129
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,920
than some stinky old Vanderbilt!

130
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,430
l told you.
l need someone serious.

131
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,870
But l'm seriously in love with you.

132
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,230
lsn't that enough?

133
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,310
Pooh bear, just get in the car.

134
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,440
You'll ruin your shoes.

135
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,160
Morning, Amy.

136
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,710
Elle, it's Amy.

137
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,180
l'm having trouble
with this whole lip-liner thing.

138
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,250
-Sweetie, didn't you hear?
-Hear what?

139
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,810
it's terrible.
He dumped her.

140
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,550
Why me?

141
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,290
Because you're not gonna
remember anything after tonight.

142
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh,you're wrong.

143
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,330
l will remember, no matter what.

144
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,100
And l'm never gonna lose you again.

145
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,430
You couldn't.

146
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,380
You're a part of me.

147
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,310
l love you.

148
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,480
Liar!

149
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,610
Honey, you have to leave this room.

150
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,310
it's been, like, a week.

151
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,090
-So?
-Drink this.

152
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,250
What always makes us feel better...
-So?
-Drink this.

153
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,390
What always makes us feel better...

154
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,790
no matter what?

155
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,600
She had eight grilled cheese sandwiches.

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,270
She stuffed them in her mouth all at once.

157
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,500
lt was so sad.

158
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,230
We thought she'd be the first
to walk down the aisle...

159
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,210
and now she's totally adrift.

160
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,810
Totally.

161
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,750
She hasn't conditioned her hair in a week.

162
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,920
Maybe she's going for the grunge look.

163
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,350
And her nails are full-on chipped.

164
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,990
So trailer park.

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,540
Oh, my God!
Do you know who this is?

166
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,010
-That's Warner's older brother!
-Who?

167
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,800
Third year Yale Law student
Putnam Bowes Huntington lll...
-That's Warner's older brother!
-Who?

168
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,940
Third year Yale Law student
Putnam Bowes Huntington lll...

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,740
and his fiancee Layne Walker Vanderbilt...

170
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,420
first year Yale Law.

171
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,450
This is the type of girl
that Warner wants to marry!

172
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,060
This is what l need to become to be serious!

173
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,760
What?
Practically deformed?

174
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,760
No. A law student.

175
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,330
Law school?

176
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,880
it's a perfectly respectable place, daddy.

177
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,910
Honey, you were first runner up...

178
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,070
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest.

179
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,280
Why are you gonna throw that all away?

180
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,080
Going to Harvard is the only way...

181
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,680
l'll get the love of my life back.

182
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,150
Sweetheart, you don't need law school.

183
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,760
Law school is for people...

184
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,390
who are boring and ugly and serious.

185
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,200
And you, Button, are none of those things.

186
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,460
Harvard Law School?

187
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,370
That's right.

188
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,530
But that's a top three school.

189
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,400
Oh, l have a 4.0.

190
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,610
Yes, but your major is fashion merchandising.

191
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,110
Harvard won't be impressed that
you aced History of Polka Dots.

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,990
What are your back-ups?

193
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,460
l don't need back-ups.
l'm going to Harvard.

194
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,000
Well,then,you'll need...

195
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,760
excellent recommendations
from your professors.

196
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,500
And a heck of an admissions essay.

197
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,960
Right.

198
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,740
And at least a 1 75 on your LSATs.

199
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,080
l once had to judge a tighty-whitey contest...

200
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,310
for Lambda Kappa Pi.

201
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,470
Trust me, l can handle anything.

202
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,620
Thanks!

203
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,050
You're welcome.

204
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,130
Because l have a metrabolism...

205
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,000
-l have a really high metrab...
-it's metabol...

206
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,140
Oh, my God.

207
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,970
What are you doing?

208
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,870
Reading about the LSATs.

209
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,270
My cousin had that.

210
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,380
Apparently, you get a really bad rash on your...

211
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,790
The LSATs are an exam.

212
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,980
Girls, l'm going to Harvard!

213
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,450
-You mean like on vay-kay?
-Let's all go!

214
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,990
Road trip!

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,120
No. l'm going to Harvard Law School.

216
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,870
Why?

217
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,870
Elle, now, l know you're upset about all this...

218
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,630
but can't you just take a Percoset?

219
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,280
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student...

220
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,910
he'll totally want me back.

221
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,540
it's a completely brilliant plan!

222
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,850
But isn't it hard to get into law school?

223
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,210
l had the highest GPA in Delta Nu.

224
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,190
Oh,well.
Here, you're gonna need this.

225
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,460
Your scrunchy?

226
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,160
My lucky scrunchy.
it helped me pass Spanish.

227
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,300
You passed Spanish because
you gave Professor Montoya...

228
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,170
a lap dance after the final.

229
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,960
Yeah...luckily.

230
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,120
My name is Elle Woods,
and for my admissions essay...

231
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,150
l'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard...

232
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,120
why l'm gonna make an amazing lawyer.

233
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,490
As president of my sorority...

234
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,790
l'm skilled at commanding
the attention of a room...

235
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,730
and discussing very important issues.

236
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,100
it has come to my attention
that the maintenance staff...

237
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,640
is switching our toilet paper from Charmin...

238
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,970
to generic.

239
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,300
All those opposed to chafing please say aye.

240
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,580
A...neither type of opera...

241
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,410
or neither type of rap is on sale.

242
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,180
B...neither type of jazz...

243
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,080
and neither type of opera is on sale.

244
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,150
C...neither type of opera
and neither type of soul...

245
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,120
Party!
Delta Nu,we love you!

246
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,470
l'm able to recall
hundreds of important details...

247
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,900
at the drop of a hat.

248
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,060
Hey, Elle, do you know what happened...

249
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,640
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

250
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,300
Why, yes, Margot, l do.

251
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,170
Once again,
we join Hope in the search for her identity.

252
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,210
As you know,
she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano.

253
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,480
Get set and go!

254
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,560
One forty-three.

255
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,070
l feel comfortable using
legal jargon in everyday life.

256
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,330
l object!

257
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,820
it's here!

258
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,290
-What?
-it's here!

259
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,320
The LSAT scores! it's here!

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,490
Open the scores!

261
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,990
What's the score?

262
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,190
-This is so exciting.
-Tell us!

263
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,370
What is it?

264
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,770
One seventy-nine!

265
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,180
One seventy-nine!

266
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,790
And that's why you should vote for me...

267
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,870
Elle Woods, future lawyer for the class of 2004.

268
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,480
She does have a 4.0 from CULA...

269
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,080
and she got a 1 79 on her LSATs.

270
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,250
A fashion major?

271
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,980
Well, sir, we've never had one before...

272
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,980
and aren't we always looking for diversity?

273
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,180
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

274
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,590
She was in a Ricky Martin video.

275
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,530
Clearly, she's interested in music.

276
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,370
She also designed a line of fauxfur panties...

277
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,640
for her sorority's charity project.

278
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,400
She's a friend to the animals
as well as a philanthropist.

279
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,040
Elle Woods...

280
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,180
welcome to Harvard.

281
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,970
Bruiser, it's so exciting!
Look! Harvard!

282
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,110
Are you excited?

283
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,450
This is our new house for the next three years.

284
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,060
Are you thirsty?

285
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,090
Let's get you some water.

286
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,060
Sweetheart, you just look parched.

287
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,740
Hey, Brad, check out Malibu Barbie!

288
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,470
Where's the beach, honey?

289
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,370
Here you go.

290
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,540
Good boy.
Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.

291
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,880
Guys, this way.

292
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,180
-This ain't L.A.!
-Come on, Bruiser.

293
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,120
Check her out.
Look at the way she walks.

294
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,550
it's gonna be so exciting.

295
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,320
Now, don't be scared.
Everyone will love you.

296
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,690
Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.

297
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,240
Class schedule, map, book list.

298
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,580
Wait a second.
My social events calendar is missing.

299
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,640
Your what?

300
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,120
Social events... you know, mixers, formals...

301
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,390
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

302
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,720
Has Warner Huntington lll checked in yet?

303
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,760
Maybe you should check
with the cruise director...

304
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,990
on the Lido deck.

305
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,000
Welcome to law school.

306
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,900
This is the part where
we go around in a circle...

307
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,010
and everyone says a little bit about themselves.

308
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,310
Let's start with you.

309
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,520
My name is David Kidney.

310
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,450
l have a masters in Russian literature...

311
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,680
a PhD in biochemistry...

312
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,650
and for the last eighteen months...

313
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,790
l've been deworming orphans in Somalia.

314
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,960
Awesome. What about you?

315
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,240
Hey. How you doing'?
l'm Enid Wexler.

316
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,130

318
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,140
and last year, l single-handedly organized...

319
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,540
the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.

320
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,870
-Killer.
-Thanks. Good times.

321
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,340
Aaron Mitchell.

322
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,420
l graduated first in my class from Princeton.

323
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,040
l have an l.Q. of 1 87...

324
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,080
and it's been suggested that Stephen Hawking...

325
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,060
stole his Brief History of Time...

326
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,060
from my fourth grade paper.

327
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,130
Cool.

328
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,750
-Me?
-Yeah.
Cool.

329
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,720
-Me?
-Yeah.

330
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,500
Hi. l'm Elle Woods and this is Bruiser Woods...

331
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,840
and we're both Gemini vegetarians.

332
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,070
l have a bachelor's degree
in fashion merchandising...
and we're both Gemini vegetarians.

333
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,110
l have a bachelor's degree
in fashion merchandising...

334
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,410
from CULA,
and l was a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart...

335
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,880
president of my sorority, Delta Nu...

336
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,180
and last year, l was homecoming queen.

337
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,050
Two weeks ago l saw
Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal...

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,320
and l talked her out of buying...

339
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,520
this truly heinous angora sweater.

340
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,150
Whoever said orange was the new
pink was seriously disturbed.

341
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,330
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

342
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,800
This is my first class as a serious law student.

343
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,370
l totally look the part.

344
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,350
There is no way she got in here on her own.

345
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,210
l totally forgot you go here.

346
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,110
What are you talking about?

347
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,220
l'm sorry.
Are you here to see me?

348
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,590
No, silly. l go here.

349
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,550
You go where?

350
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,060
Harvard. Law school.

351
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,330
You got into Harvard Law?

352
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,530
What, like it's hard?

353
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,660
Oh, my gosh, Warner, it'll be so great.

354
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,070
l'm planning this great mixer.
You have to help me.

355
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,970
l'm thinking like a luau or casino night.

356
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,570
it'll be just like senior year except funner.

357
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,880
Time to go.
l have to go to class...

358
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,650
but meet me after on the benches.

359
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,190
All right, bye!

360
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,530
A legal education means you will learn...

361
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,970
to speak in a new language.

362
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,740
You will be taught to achieve insight...

363
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,710
into the world around you...

364
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,420
and to sharply question what you know.

365
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,520
The seat you have picked will be yours...

366
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,560
for the next nine months of your life.

367
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,790
And those of you in the front row...

368
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,030
beware.

369
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,170
The law is reason free from passion.

370
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,610
Does anyone know
who spoke those immortal words?

371
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,840
-Yes?
-Aristotle.

372
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,350
Are you sure?

373
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,750
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

374
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,000
l think so.

375
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,130
What about his life?

376
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,540
l don't know.

377
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,150
Well, l recommend knowing before speaking.

378
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,140
The law leaves much room for interpretation...

379
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,490
but very little for self-doubt.

380
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,660
And you were right.

381
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,900
lt was Aristotle.

382
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,730
Good job.

383
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,330
Now, l assume all of you have read pages 1-48...

384
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,140
and are now well-versed
in subject matter jurisdiction.

385
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,200
Who can tell us about Gordon vs. Steele?
and are now well-versed
in subject matter jurisdiction.

386
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,410
Who can tell us about Gordon vs. Steele?

387
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,070
Let's call on someone from the hot zone.

388
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,490
Elle Woods?

389
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,170
Actually, l wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

390
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,650
Vivian Kensington.

391
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,030
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

392
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,600
l don't.

393
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,470
Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave class...

394
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,370
and to return only when she is prepared?

395
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,560
Absolutely.

396
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,960
Now, Ms. Kensington...

397
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,890
did diversity jurisdiction exist in this case?

398
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,230
No, it did not.

399
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,770
Good. How about in the case
of Owens vs. McCullough?

400
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,480
l can't believe that girl.

401
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,920
So stupid!

402
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,110
Who does she think she is?

403
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,910
Excuse me. Are you OK?

404
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,590
Do they put you on the spot
like that all the time?

405
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,290
The professors?

406
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,170
They tend to do that.
Socratic method.

407
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,890
lf you don't know the answers,
they just kick you out?
They tend to do that.
Socratic method.

408
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,860
lf you don't know the answers,
they just kick you out?

409
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,370
You have Strom well, huh?

410
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,900
Yes!
Did she do that to you, too?

411
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,030
No.
But she did make me cry once.

412
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,300
Not in class.
l waited till l got back to my room...

413
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,970
but she'll kick you right in the ball...

414
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,820
Or wherever,you know.

415
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,310
She's really tough.

416
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,280
Great.

417
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,380
Don't worry, it gets better.
Who else do you have?

418
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,820
l have Callahan, Royalton, and Levinthal.

419
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,690
Let's see, speak up in Callahan's class.

420
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,700
He really likes people that are opinionated.

421
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,370
And in Royalton's class...

422
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,630
try to get a seat in the back.

423
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,570
He spits when he talks
about products liability.

424
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,880
And for Levinthal,
make sure you read the footnotes.

425
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,150
That's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions.

426
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,210
Right.
That's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions.

427
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,380
Right.

428
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,020
Wow.
l'm really glad l met you.

429
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,230
Are you a third year?

430
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,990
-Well...
-Hey, Elle.

431
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,960
Hi!
Thanks for all your help.

432
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,160
Good luck.

433
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,300
So...

434
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,810
how was your first class?

435
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,440
lt was good,
except for this horrible preppy girl...

436
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,240
who made me look bad
in front of the professor.

437
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,740
But no biggie.

438
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,240
You're here now.
So, how was your summer?

439
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,580
Good. lt was good.

440
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,880
Did you do anything exciting?

441
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:37,920
Have you met Vivian?

442
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,630
Hi. Vivian Kensington.

443
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,430
Do you know her?

444
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,470
-She's...
-l'm his fiancee.

445
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,140
l'm sorry.
l just hallucinated. What?

446
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,190
She was my girlfriend in prep school.

447
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,690
And,well,we got back together this summer...

448
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,880
at my grandmother's birthday party.

449
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,720
Warner told me all about you.

450
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,560
You're famous at our club.

451
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,120
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

452
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,360
Pooh bear, l didn't know she would be here.

453
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
Excuse me.

454
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,990
Oh,thank God!

455
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,310
Are you free?
it's an emergency.

456
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,040
Bad day?

457
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,550
You can't even imagine.

458
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,120
Spill.

459
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,760
l worked so hard to get into law school.

460
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,150
l blew off Greek week to study for the LSATs.

461
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,760
l even hired a Coppola
to direct my admissions video.

462
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,930
All to get my boyfriend Warner back.

463
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,500
And now he's engaged to this awful girl Vivian...

464
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,290
so it was all for nothing, and l...

465
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,830
l just wish...

466
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,840
l just wish l had never gone to Harvard.

467
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,910
After you went to all that trouble.

468
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,650
He's engaged!

469
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,010
She's got the six-carat Harry Winston...

470
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,090
on her bony, unpolished finger.

471
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,260
What am l supposed to do?

472
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,320
You're asking the wrong girl.
What am l supposed to do?

473
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,660
You're asking the wrong girl.

474
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,360
l mean, l'm with my guy eight years...

475
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,430
and then one day, it's...

476
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,790
l met someone else.
Move out.
and then one day, it's...

477
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,460
l met someone else.
Move out.

478
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,300
Oh, no. That's awful.

479
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,970
Dewey kept the trailer
and my precious baby Rufus.

480
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,810
l didn't even get to throw him a birthday party.

481
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,040
What's a girl to do?

482
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,320
He's a guy who followed his pecker...

483
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,720
to greener pastures...

484
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,820
and l'm a middle-aged high-school dropout...

485
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,930
who's got stretch marks and a fat ass.

486
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,120
That's terrible.

487
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,790
Yep. Happens every day.

488
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,870
So what's this Vivian got that you don't have?

489
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,370
Three tits?

490
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,710
She's from Connecticut.

491
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,440
She belongs to his stupid country club.

492
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,510
ls she as pretty as you?

493
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,670
She could use some mascara
and some serious highlights...

494
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,080
but she's not completely unfortunate looking.

495
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,950
Hello, ladies.

496
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,850
-Hey,there.
-How you doing? Sign here.

497
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,430
Oh,jeez.

498
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,130
Look what l did.

499
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,460
-See you later.
-Bye-bye, sugar.

500
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,870
Aw, shit.

501
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,930
Could l have been any more goddamn spastic?

502
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,870
it's OK.

503
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,910
Are you sure this Warner guy is, like, the one?

504
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,350
Definitely. l love him.

505
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,630
Well, if a girl like you
can't hold on to her man...

506
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,320
then there sure as hell isn't
any hope for the rest of us.
Well, if a girl like you
can't hold on to her man...

507
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,660
then there sure as hell isn't
any hope for the rest of us.

508
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,030
What are you waiting for?

509
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,230
Steal the bastard back.

510
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,980
l should warn you...

511
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,050
l should warn you...

512
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,440
that in addition to competing
against each other...

513
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,110
for the top grade in this class...

514
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,150
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's...

515
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,880
highly coveted four
internship spots next year...

516
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,220
where you will get to assist on actual cases.

517
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,490
Let he bloodbath begin.

518
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,660
Now, let's commence with our usual torture.

519
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,290
Ms. Woods...

520
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,630
would you rather have a client
who committed a crime...

521
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,740
malum in se or malum prohibitum?

522
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,800
Neither.

523
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,120
And why is that?

524
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,140
l would rather have a client who's innocent.
And why is that?

525
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,090
l would rather have a client who's innocent.

526
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,860
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

527
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,620
Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?

528
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,590
Malum prohibitum.

529
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
Because then the client
would have committed...

530
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,600
a regulatory infraction as
opposed to a dangerous crime.

531
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,830
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

532
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,470
You've obviously done your homework.

533
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,880
Now let us look at malum prohibitum...

534
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,480
a little more closely.

535
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,180
it has been said...
Yes, Ms. Woods?

536
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,680
l changed my mind.
l'd pick the dangerous one...

537
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,750
'cause l'm not afraid of a challenge.

538
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,200
Who is that?

539
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,310
Wow.

540
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,770
Guys.

541
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,850
-Can she play?
-Hi!

542
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,020
Get outta here.

543
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,960
-Hi, everybody.
-Elle, what are you doing here?

544
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,670
l've come to join your study group.

545
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,870
Look, l brought sustenance.
Who's first?

546
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,140
Our group is full.

547
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,610
ls this like an RSVP thing?

548
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,650
No. it's like a smart people thing.

549
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,540
And as Viv said, we're full.

550
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,520
Come on, we can make room for one more.

551
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,750
We've already assigned the outlines.

552
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,950
The answer is no.

553
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,230
Oh, OK.
l'll just leave, then.

554
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,670
Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority...

555
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,340
you could, like, join instead, like?

556
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,710
lf you had come to a rush party...

557
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,340
l would have at least been nice to you.

558
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,610
ls that before you voted against me...

559
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,480
and then called me a dyke behind my back?

560
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,350
l don't use that word.

561
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,220
You must have heard it from Vivian.

562
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,820
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

563
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,890
it's Elle!
Guess what l'm doing right this second!

564
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,430
l don't know. What?

565
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,220
l'm picking out my wedding dress!

566
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,990
-What?
-Josh proposed!

567
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,030
Did you get the rock yet?

568
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,140
Almost.

569
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,480
Well, hurry up, so you can come home!

570
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,700
We miss you!

571
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,910
l miss you guys, too.
The people here are so vile.

572
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,710
Hardly anybody speaks to me...

573
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,180
Oh, my God!
l almost forgot to tell you!

574
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,740
What?

575
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,480
l got bangs!
My hair is so now.

576
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,380
Really?

577
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,890
OK, so just listen to me.

578
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,820
Keep June 1 st open,
you're one of my bridesmaids...

579
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,190
and give Warner our love...

580
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,430
because l'm getting married!

581
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,410
So don't forget.
Eight o'clock at 45 Duns tn Street.

582
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,880
-it'll be a really nice party.
-We'll be there.

583
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,280
And don't forget to bring your own merlot!

584
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,890
No way! ls somebody at this
school actually having a party?

585
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,960
Yes...

586
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,360
But it's a costume party.

587
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,260
You probably wouldn't want to come.
But it's a costume party.

588
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,590
You probably wouldn't want to come.

589
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,160
l love costume parties.

590
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,370
Well, then l guess we'll see you there.

591
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,100
Oh, at 45 Duns ton Street.

592
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,590
Oh, my God!

593
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,650
Thanks for inviting me, girls.
This party is super fun.

594
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,760
Nice outfit.

595
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,050
l like your outfit, too.

596
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,990
Except when l dress up as a frigid bitch...

597
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,850
l try not to look so constipated.

598
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,530
Oh, she's horrible.

599
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,670
You've got the ring, sweetie.

600
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,700
-Nice ears.
-How you doing'?

601
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,570
Warner, the English language...

602
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,870
is all about subliminal domination.

603
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,610
Take the word semester.

604
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,110
A perfect example of this school's...

605
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,050
discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries.

606
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,210
That's why l'm petitioning to have next term...

607
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,530
be referred to as the winter ovester.

608
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,150
-Excuse me. Hey,Warner.
-Wow!
be referred to as the winter ovester.

609
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,090
-Excuse me. Hey,Warner.
-Wow!

610
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,990
Don't you look like a walking felony?

611
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,390
Thank you. You're so sweet.

612
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,290
Are you having fun?

613
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,930
l am now.
What's with the costume?

614
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,070
l just decided to dress up.

615
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,480
Really.

616
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,830
l feel like we barely get to see each other...
Really.

617
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,670
l feel like we barely get to see each other...

618
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,800
since we've been here.

619
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,940
l know.
l'm so busy with these case studies and hypos.

620
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,180
l know what you mean.
l can't imagine doing...

621
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,510
all this and Callahan's internship next year.

622
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,880
That's gonna be so much.

623
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,620
Elle, come on, you'll never get the grades...

624
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,420
to qualify for one of those spots.

625
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,930
You're not smart enough, sweetie.

626
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,020
Wait, am l on glue...

627
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,860
or did we not get into the same law school?

628
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
Yeah, but...

629
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,270
But what?
We took the same LSATs...

630
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,630
and we're taking the same classes.

631
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,870
l know, but come on,
Elle, be serious.

632
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,610
You can do something
more valuable with your time.

633
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,050
l'm never going to be good enough for you, am l?

634
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,920
-Oh, come on.
-Just forget it!

635
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,470
l'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!

636
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,970
-Don't ask.
-Wasn't gonna.

637
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,350
l love that sweater.
it's Chanel.

638
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,620
Look.

639
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,860
Was she carrying books?

640
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,710
Thanks.

641
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,140
So,you've filed a claim.

642
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,680
What next?

643
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,390
Ms. Woods?

644
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,890
Don't you need to have evidence?

645
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,790
Meaning?

646
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,330
Meaning you need reasonable belief...

647
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,400
that your claim should have,
like, evidenciary support?

648
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,840
And what kind of evidenciary support...

649
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,570
does this case require?

650
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,150
All sorts of things...

651
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:27,960
corrupt cops who are wheeling and dealing...

652
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,510
And the purpose of diminished capacity is?

653
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,680
To negate mens rea?

654
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,960
Are you ready?

655
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,540
Yes, you are!

656
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,170
Go. You can do this.

657
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,500
Listen to me, Dewey.
You shut your mouth.

658
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,540
No, you shut your big mouth.

659
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,050
l'm doing all the talking.

660
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,460
What the hell do you want?

661
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,460
We're eating lunch.

662
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,830
l just thought that...

663
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,070
You just thought you could come here...

664
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,540
and show me what l'm definitely not missing?

665
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,610
That's not why l came by.

666
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:46,870
How many times you gonna come over here...
That's not why l came by.

667
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,140
How many times you gonna come over here...

668
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,010
begging me to take you back, huh?

669
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,120
l was...

670
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,180
Dewey New combe?

671
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,880
Who's asking?

672
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,350
l'm Elle Woods.
Miss Bonifante's attorney.

673
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,660
And l'm here to discuss
the legal situation at hand.

674
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,920
Come again?

675
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:09,530
Do you understand what
subject matter jurisdiction is?

676
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,530
-No.
-l didn't think so.

677
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,170
Well, due to habeas corpus...

678
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,970
you and Miss Bonifante
had a common law marriage...

679
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:22,310
which here to fore entitles her...

680
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,280
to what is legally referred to...

681
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,390
as equitable division of the assets.

682
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,110
Come again?

683
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,720
Due to the fact that you've
retained this residence...

684
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,290
Miss Bonifante is entitled...

685
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,420
to full canine property ownership...

686
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,120
and will be enforcing said ownership right now.

687
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,560
Tell him, Paulette.

688
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,010
l'm taking the dog, dumbass!

689
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,740
That's awesome! We did it!

690
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,250
Come here.

691
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,880
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?

692
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,550
He's probably still scratching his head.

693
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,750
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls.

694
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,340
Thank you.

695
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,580
According to Swinney vs. Neubert...

696
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,780
Swinney,who was also a private sperm donor...

697
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,350
was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms...

698
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,680
with the hours set forth by the parents.

699
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,760
So, if we're sticking to past precedent...

700
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,590
Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

701
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,360
He was clearly within his
rights to ask for visitation.

702
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,930
But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor...

703
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,230
and our defendant was an habitual sperm donor...

704
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,170
who also happens to be harassing the parents...

705
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,570
in his quest for visitation.

706
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,340
But without this man's sperm...

707
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,570
the child in question wouldn't exist.

708
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,470
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

709
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,060
Yes, Ms. Woods?

710
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,390
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point...

711
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,400
l have to wonder if the defendant...

712
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,860
kept a thorough record of every sperm emission...

713
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
made throughout his life.

714
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,870
interesting. Why do you ask?

715
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,940
Unless the defendant attempted to contact...

716
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,980
every single one-night stand to determine...

717
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,880
if a child resulted in those unions...

718
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,170
he has no parental claim
over this child whatsoever.

719
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,010
Why now? Why this sperm?

720
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:35,590
l see your point.

721
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,480
And for that matter,
all masturbatory emissions...
l see your point.

722
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,960
And for that matter,
all masturbatory emissions...

723
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,720
where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg...

724
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,190
could be termed reckless abandonment.

725
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,330
l believe you've just won your case.

726
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,040
Ms. Woods, you did well today.

727
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:53,770
Really?

728
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,270
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?

729
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,180
l don't know.

730
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,170
You should.
Do you have a resume?

731
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,250
Yes, l do.

732
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,980
Here it is.

733
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,820
it's pink.

734
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,990
And it's scented.

735
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,330
l think it gives it a little something extra.

736
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:13,720
See you next class.
l think it gives it a little something extra.

737
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,590
See you next class.

738
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,060
Do you think she woke up
one morning and said...

739
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,160
l think l'll go to law school today.

740
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,040
That lapse in judgment aside...

741
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,440
l think she's got a lot of potential.

742
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,080
Here's the Wind hamfile.

743
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,080
Smell this.

744
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,810
What's that?

745
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,150
it's her resume.

746
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,250
Smells good.

747
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,780
What's going on?

748
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,210
Callahan's firm is defending a murder trial.

749
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,580
His case load is so big,
he's taking first year interns.

750
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,280
He picked them already?

751
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,360
My God, l can't believe it, Warner!

752
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,120
We got it!

753
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,420
That only leaves one for...

754
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,630
Me!

755
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,710
Yes!

756
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:45,610
Remember when we spent
those four amazing hours...

757
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,620
in the hot tub after winter formal?

758
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,760
Yeah...No.

759
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,420
This is so much better than that!

760
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,860
Excuse me.
l have some shopping to do.

761
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,400
Four hours?

762
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,050
You look very nice today, Vivian.

763
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,660
Thank you.

764
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,590
You're welcome.

765
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,670
We're defending Brooke Windham...

766
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,280
whose very wealthy husband
was found shot to death...

767
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,710
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

768
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,010
Gold digger?

769
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,980
You'd think so since the stiff was 60...

770
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,110
but she was rich on her own.

771
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,840
Some kind of fitness empire.

772
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,080
You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.

773
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,690
Are you talking about Brooke Taylor?

774
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,920
Maiden name...Taylor.

775
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,800
You know her?

776
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:58,990
She's a Delta Nu!
You know her?

777
00:49:58,990 --> 00:49:59,820
She's a Delta Nu!

778
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,100
She wasn't in my pledge class.

779
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,500
She graduated four years before me.
She wasn't in my pledge class.

780
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,200
She graduated four years before me.

781
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,840
But l used to take her class
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

782
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,370
She's amazing!

783
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,400
Amazing? How?

784
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,040
She can make you lose
three pounds in one class.

785
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,910
She's completely gifted.

786
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,340
in all likelihood, she's completely guilty.

787
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,910
She was seen standing over
her husband's dead body.

788
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,090
By who?

789
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:21,350
His 26-year-old daughter and the pool boy.
By who?

790
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,420
His 26-year-old daughter and the pool boy.

791
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,560
Sorry, l'm late.
Excuse me.

792
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,530
This is Emmett Richmond, another associate...

793
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,560
top three in his class...

794
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,290
and former editor of Harvard Law Review.

795
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,930
You've probably seen him...

796
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,470
lurking around campus doing my research.

797
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:35,560
Thanks for the introduction.
lurking around campus doing my research.

798
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,730
Thanks for the introduction.

799
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,970
What about the murder weapon?

800
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,740
The gun is missing.

801
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,500
The coroner said he'd been dead 30 minutes...

802
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,700
when the cops arrived.

803
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,750
Giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.

804
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,970
l just don't think Brooke could have done this.

805
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,280
Exercise gives you endorphins.

806
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,080
Endorphins make you happy.

807
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,160
Happy people don't shoot their husbands.

808
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,850
They just don't.

809
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,960
l didn't do it.

810
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,820
l walked in...

811
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,130
l saw my husband lying on the floor...

812
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,200
l bent down to check his heart,
screamed my head off...

813
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,560
then Enrique and Chutney ran inside.

814
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,070
Your step-daughter and the pool boy came in...

815
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,730
where they saw you standing over the body...

816
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,570
covered in his blood.

817
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,510
Why would l kill my husband?

818
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,880
insurance, a love affair,
pure unadulterated hatred.

819
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,250
The D.A. will come up with plenty of reasons.

820
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,480
l loved him.

821
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,390
He was 34 years older than you.

822
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,020
That doesn't look so good to a jury.

823
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,990
Then show them a picture of his dick.

824
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,830
That might clear a few things up.

825
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,340
Brooke, l believe you...

826
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:44,310
but a jury is going to want an alibi.

827
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,170
l can't give you that...

828
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,980
and if you put me on the stand, l'll lie.

829
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,050
Then l guess we're done for today.

830
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,060
l know you.

831
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,590
l'm a Delta Nu, and l'm a huge fan of yours.
l know you.

832
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,790
l'm a Delta Nu, and l'm a huge fan of yours.

833
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,090
You took my class in L.A.

834
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,790
You took my class in L.A.

835
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,730
You had the best high-kick l've ever seen.

836
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,030
Are you one of my lawyers?

837
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,200
Sort of.

838
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,070
Well, thank God one of you has a brain.

839
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,200
Let's go.

840
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,480
l'm the only one that believes her.

841
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,380
Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.

842
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,790
That's because men are
big fat retards who don't...

843
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,290
Afternoon, ladies.

844
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,730
it's him.

845
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,030
Paulette Bonifante.

846
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,050
Oh, my God.

847
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,960
He's coming over here.

848
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,630
l've got a package.

849
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,680
He's got a package.

850
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,050
How you doing today?

851
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,090
Fine.

852
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,800
Take it easy.

853
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,430
See you later.

854
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,240
That's great, Paulette.

855
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,840
ls this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

856
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,680
No. Sometimes l say OK instead of fine.

857
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,480
Why don't you offer him a cold beverage...

858
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,920
or a neck massage or something?

859
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,320
What's the point?

860
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,420
Trust me, Paulette.
You have all the equipment...

861
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,720
you just need to read the manual.

862
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,360
Do you know what l'm saying?

863
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,290
l'll show you a little maneuver...

864
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,670
my mother taught me in junior high.

865
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:46,990
in my experience, it has a 98% success rate...
my mother taught me in junior high.

866
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,570
in my experience, it has a 98% success rate...

867
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,500
of getting a man's attention...

868
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,870
and when used appropriately...

869
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,010
it has an 83% rate of return
on a dinner invitation.

870
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:56,280
Wow!
it has an 83% rate of return
on a dinner invitation.

871
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,980
Wow!

872
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,450
it's called the bend and snap.

873
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,640
Watch this.

874
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,120
Oh! l think l dropped something on the floor.

875
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:11,060
So you bend...and snap!

876
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,320
See?

877
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,790
Come on. You try it.

878
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,000
Bend...and snap!

879
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,270
OK...

880
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,970
a little less bend, a little more snap.

881
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,840
Like this?

882
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,310
Good snap.

883
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,710
Come on.

884
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,050
You! Come on, you can do it.

885
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,820
Bend...and snap.

886
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,690
Very, very good.

887
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:41,790
We can all do it!

888
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:42,190
-Come on, guys.
-l can't do that.
We can all do it!

889
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:43,320
-Come on, guys.
-l can't do that.

890
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,030
You're gonna bend...

891
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,570
and snap!

892
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,670
Now put your head into it.

893
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:49,030
Bend...and snap!
Now put your head into it.

894
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,930
Bend...and snap!

895
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,730
Bend...and snap! Good job!

896
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,200
A little attitude, please.

897
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,900
Now, everybody smile.
That's very important.

898
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,780
Pump! Pump! Pump!

899
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,350
Bend...and snap!

900
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,090
Good job, everybody!

901
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,380
Work it out! Work it out!

902
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,480
That's it! Wow!

903
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,620
Come on, Paulette!

904
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,470
Bend and snap!

905
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,430
Oh, my God! The bend and snap!
Works every time!

906
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,140
lf Brooke didn't kill the guy, then who did?

907
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,110
My money is on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

908
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,770
Chutney has a trust fund.

909
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,010
She didn't need the insurance
payoff or the inheritance.

910
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,440
What about the mother?

911
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,050
Covered.
She was in Aspen at the time.

912
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,550
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

913
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:41,360
Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans...

914
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,020
at the Caribou Club.
Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans...

915
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:42,820
at the Caribou Club.

916
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:43,910
All l know is it's not Brooke.

917
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,360
That's touching, but we need an alibi.

918
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,460
l brought you some necessities...

919
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,590
some Calvin Klein 720-count sheets...

920
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,340
the entire Clinique skin care line...

921
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,010
some aromatherapy candles, a loofah...

922
00:55:59,010 --> 00:55:59,610
And the Bible.
some aromatherapy candles, a loofah...

923
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,310
And the Bible.

924
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,870
You're an angel.

925
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,070
So how are you?
Are you all right?

926
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:10,840
You look so...orange.

927
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,250
l'm just glad it's you and not Callahan.

928
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,490
He means well.
He's very brilliant.

929
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,620
He better befor what l'm paying for him.

930
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,360
l have to tell you the real reason l came here.

931
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,200
Professor Callahan says
we really need your alibi.

932
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,970
Elle, l can't.

933
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,770
You don't understand.

934
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,830
Who could understand better than me?

935
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,810
it's so shameful.

936
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,750
Whatever it is, Brooke, it could save you.

937
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,120
That's just it. lt would ruin me.

938
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:44,710
How?

939
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,020
l've made my fortune on the ability...

940
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:53,100
to perfect women's bodies with
Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.

941
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,160
You helped me go from a six to a four.

942
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,700
That's great!

943
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:02,370
On the day of Heyworth's murder...

944
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,840
l was getting...

945
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,750
What?

946
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,980
l was getting liposuction.

947
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:16,420
Liposuction!

948
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,420
Oh, God!

949
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,990
l know! l'm a fraud!

950
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:21,480
it's not like normal women can have this ass!
l know! l'm a fraud!

951
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,590
it's not like normal women can have this ass!

952
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,490
lf my fans knew that l bought it...

953
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,000
l would lose everything!

954
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,960
l've already lost my husband.

955
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,270
l'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

956
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:41,270
Brooke... your secret's safe with me.

957
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,380
Thank you.

958
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,410
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

959
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,690
We got two interviews tomorrow...

960
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,260
that Gerard and Bobby will handle.

961
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,590
The ex-wife in an hour.

962
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,820
According to this communique from the prison...

963
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,760
our client apparently had a visit from her
sister...

964
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,140
a Miss Delta Nu.

965
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,580
Anyone you know?

966
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:07,870
Yes. l went to visit her.
Anyone you know?

967
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,040
Yes. l went to visit her.

968
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,370
What the hell do you mean you went to visit her?

969
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,670
l went to get her alibi.

970
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,010
Did you get it?

971
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,850
it's really good.

972
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,290
Great. What is it?

973
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,380
l can't tell you.

974
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,350
Why the hell not?

975
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,460
Because l promised her l'd keep it a secret...

976
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,390
and l can't break the bonds of sisterhood.

977
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,020
Screw sisterhood!
This is a murder trial...

978
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,430
not some scandal at the sorority house.

979
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,960
l want the alibi!

980
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,300
l can't give it to you...

981
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,760
but l can tell you she is innocent.

982
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,170
Mrs. Windham Vander mark
is on line two for you.

983
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,240
Someone reason with her while l take this.

984
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:47,410
Are you crazy?
Just tell him the alibi.

985
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,940
We'll lose this case if you don't.

986
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,610
Then we're not very good lawyers.

987
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,660
lf you tell him, he'll probably
hire you as a summer associate.

988
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,420
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

989
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,220
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

990
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,800
l gave her my word, Warner.

991
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,220
So what?

992
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,170
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned...

993
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,070
with the fact that her interview is today.

994
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,070
She's at a spa in the Berkshires.

995
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:15,150
A spa? lsn't that like your mother ship?

996
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,500
l could go if you want me to.

997
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,050
Emmett? Go with her.

998
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,900
She seems completely untrustworthy to me.

999
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,290
Why?
She seems completely untrustworthy to me.

1000
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:34,960
Why?

1001
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,230
This is a person who's made her living...

1002
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,060
by telling women that they're too fat.

1003
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,670
Brooke would never tell a woman she was too fat.

1004
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:44,070
And she seems like she's hiding something.

1005
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,700
Maybe it's not what you think.

1006
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,470
Maybe it's exactly what l think.

1007
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,320
You're really being a butthead.

1008
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:53,710
A butthead?

1009
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,010
Why would you call me that?

1010
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,160
You need to have a little more faith in people.

1011
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:57,550
You might be surprised.
You need to have a little more faith in people.

1012
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,250
You might be surprised.

1013
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,660
l can't believe you called me a butthead.

1014
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,820
No one's called me that since the ninth grade.

1015
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,500
Maybe not to your face.

1016
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,040
So this is what a spa looks like. Wow.

1017
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,530
How do we find her?

1018
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,040
l called ahead. She's in the mud room.

1019
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,440
She's not naked, is she?

1020
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,110
Mrs. Windham Vander mark?

1021
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,750
So you found me.

1022
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,650
We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret, and Callahan...

1023
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,120
and we're here to ask you a few questions.

1024
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,260
So l hear that little tart from California...

1025
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,690
shot poor Heyworth.

1026
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:40,790
That's what we're trying
to prove didn't happen.

1027
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,870
Do you have any reason to believe that it did?

1028
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,530
l've never actually met the woman...

1029
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,100
but my daughter tells me...

1030
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,900
she can be quite the little bitch.

1031
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,050
Did your daughter ever mention anything...

1032
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,670
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

1033
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:59,310
She did say that they humped like gorillas.

1034
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,060
l guess it wasn't enough, though, for Brooke.

1035
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,550
Why do you say that?

1036
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,280
Well...

1037
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,790
haven't you seen the cabana boy?

1038
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:11,990
She's lying.

1039
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,030
And you know this for a fact?

1040
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,710
Did you see the icky brown color of her hair?

1041
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,570
So? Now you discriminate against brunettes?
Did you see the icky brown color of her hair?

1042
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:18,610
So? Now you discriminate against brunettes?

1043
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,140
Why not? l'm discriminated against as a blonde.

1044
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,840
Being a blonde is actually
a pretty powerful thing.

1045
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,470
You hold more cards than you think you do.

1046
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,880
l personally would like
to see you take that power...

1047
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,980
and channel it towards the greater good.

1048
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,980
Thanks.
l'll see you tomorrow.

1049
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,250
All right.

1050
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,690
How do you think l'd look as a blonde?

1051
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,130
l'm not sure you could handle it.

1052
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,360
-Good night.
-Bye.

1053
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,370
So, l called your room last night.

1054
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,410
l heard.

1055
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,520
l was thinking maybe we could go out sometime.

1056
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,120
No. You're a dork.

1057
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,290
l'm in law school.

1058
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,480
Look, l'm not going out with you.

1059
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,190
l can't believe you'd even ask.

1060
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,060
Girls like me don't go out
with losers like you.

1061
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,620
Let's get out of here.

1062
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,960
Excuse me.

1063
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,500
Why didn't you call me?

1064
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,900
What?

1065
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,160
We spent a beautiful night together...

1066
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,580
and l never hear from you again?

1067
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:23,640
l...
and l never hear from you again?

1068
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,740
l...

1069
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,540
l'm sorry?

1070
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,240
Sorry for what?
For breaking my heart...

1071
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,750
or for giving me the greatest pleasure...

1072
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:34,410
l've ever known and then just taking it away?

1073
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,980
Both?

1074
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,150
Well, forget it.

1075
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,230
l've spent too many hours crying over you.

1076
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,430
So...when did you want to go out?

1077
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,430
Come in.

1078
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,510
Are you done with that deposition yet?

1079
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,740
Yeah. Here, take it.

1080
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,350
l've read it 20 times.

1081
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,530
You know, Elle, l still can't believe...

1082
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,570
you didn't tell Callahan the alibi.

1083
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,360
it's not my alibi to tell.

1084
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,300
l know.

1085
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,330
And l thought that was very classy of you.

1086
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,670
Really?

1087
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,270
Sure.

1088
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:37,750
Thanks.

1089
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:49,260
Did you ever notice how
Callahan never asks Warner...

1090
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,350
to bring him his coffee?

1091
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:53,200
He's asked me at least ten times.

1092
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,900
Men are helpless.
You know that.

1093
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,700
l know. Warner doesn't even do his own laundry.

1094
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,430
He has to have it sent out.

1095
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,370
l know.

1096
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,880
Did you know when he first applied...

1097
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,620
he got wait-listed.

1098
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,610
What?

1099
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,120
His father had to make a call.

1100
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,450
You're kidding.

1101
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,560
No way!

1102
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,600
God, that is such a precious dog.

1103
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,840
His name is Bruiser.
Do you want to hold him?

1104
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,970
-He's very friendly.
-Sure.

1105
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,940
Look, he likes you.

1106
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,540
He's giving me kisses.

1107
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:44,940
Thanks, Jeff.

1108
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,890
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

1109
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:47,550
She's charged with the murder of her husband...
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

1110
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,520
She's charged with the murder of her husband...

1111
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,690
Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham.

1112
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,170
First to testify are the
victim's daughter and ex-wife.

1113
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,060
The Superior Court of Suffolk
County is now in session.

1114
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,500
The Honorable Judge
Marina R. Bickford presiding.

1115
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,530
You may be seated.

1116
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,580
And where was she exactly?

1117
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,080
Standing over my father's dead body.

1118
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,880
And what was the defendant doing?

1119
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,950
She was sitting next to the pool, topless...

1120
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,720
while the Latin boy handed her a drink.

1121
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:30,870
Mr. Salvatore, can you tell us what this is?

1122
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,770
My uniform.

1123
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,410
This is the uniform...

1124
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,200
Mrs. Windham asked you to wear
while cleaning her pool?
This is the uniform...

1125
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,940
Mrs. Windham asked you to wear
while cleaning her pool?

1126
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,450
Are you having an affair with Brooke Windham?

1127
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,390
Define affair.

1128
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,990
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

1129
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,190
Yes. OK?
Yes.

1130
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
court will reconvene...

1131
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,970
tomorrow morning at 9 A.M.

1132
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,740
We're adjourned.

1133
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,610
A Delta Nu would never sleep
with a man who wears a thong.

1134
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,680
Never!

1135
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,550
l just liked watching him clean the filter.

1136
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,090
l believe you, Brooke.

1137
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:24,860
-Take care of me, Elle.
-l will.

1138
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,440
l got a big one for you.

1139
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,710
Can you sign?

1140
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,060
l got it.

1141
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,060
You broke his nose?

1142
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,600
l blew it, Elle.

1143
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,790
My snap was all over the place.

1144
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,500
l'll be there as soon as court is out.

1145
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:41,940
We have to cross-examine Enrique.

1146
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,470
But don't worry.
My girlfriend Serena...

1147
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,600
barfed on a guy during
The Blair Witch Project...

1148
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,970
and they ended up dating for three months.

1149
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,080
Really?
All right. Bye-bye.

1150
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,380
OK. Bye.

1151
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:04,220
Don't stomp your little
last-season Prada shoes at me.

1152
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,130
These aren't last season.

1153
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:18,850
-He's gay! Enrique's gay!
-What?

1154
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:19,140
What kind of shoes are these?
-He's gay! Enrique's gay!
-What?

1155
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,470
What kind of shoes are these?

1156
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,680
Black ones.

1157
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:24,680
-See!
-What are you talking about?

1158
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,250
He isn't Brooke's lover.
He's making it up.

1159
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,650
Back up.
How do you know he's gay?

1160
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,650
Gay men know designers.
Straight men don't.

1161
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,100
Know what?

1162
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,430
He left a Chertape in the pool house one time.

1163
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,860
While l appreciate your masterful legal theory...

1164
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,800
l have a murder trial to attend to.

1165
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:50,710
l'll take care of it.
Thanks.

1166
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,510
The court will come to order.

1167
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,720
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof...

1168
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:06,320
that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?

1169
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,020
Only the love in my heart.

1170
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,460
lf that's all the proof that he has, Your Honor...

1171
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,760
l think l'm done here.

1172
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:15,630
You may step down.

1173
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,000
l'd like to ask a couple of questions, Your Honor.

1174
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,180
Just give me a couple minutes.

1175
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,140
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?

1176
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,340
-Yes.
-Where?

1177
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,810
A restaurant where no one could recognize us.

1178
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,190
How long have you been
sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

1179
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:32,910
Three months.

1180
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,510
-And your boyfriend's name is...
-Chuck.

1181
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,690
Silence!

1182
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,020
Pardon me!

1183
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,160
Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1184
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:44,790
l was confused.

1185
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,700
l thought you said friend.
Chuck is just a friend.

1186
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,200
You bitch!

1187
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,640
Chuck, wait!

1188
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,710
Silence in my court!
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1189
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,580
Silence in my courtroom!

1190
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,220
How did l miss that?
You were great.

1191
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,010
Silence in my courtroom!

1192
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:09,890
Thanks.

1193
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,890
-Good night.
-Good night.

1194
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,900
Callahan asked to see you before you leave.

1195
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:21,830
Really?

1196
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,410
He already has coffee, but maybe
he needs a doughnut.

1197
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,410
-Do you need any help?
-No. l'm fine.

1198
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,740
OK. Bye.

1199
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:35,040
Come on in.

1200
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,320
Sit down.

1201
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:49,100
ls everything all right?

1202
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,230
You followed your intuition today...

1203
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,100
and you were right on target.

1204
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,740
l should have listened.

1205
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:58,640
Thank you.

1206
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,470
About the alibi...

1207
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:02,610
l'm sorry...

1208
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,310
l'm impressed you took
the initiative to go get it.

1209
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,420
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1210
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,550
On top of that, you gained the client's trust...

1211
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,690
and kept it...that's what makes a great lawyer.

1212
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:15,690
You're smart, Elle.

1213
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,630
Smarter than most of the guys on my payroll.

1214
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,330
Wow.

1215
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:23,900
l think it's time to discuss your career path.

1216
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,700
Have you thought about where
you might be a summer associate?

1217
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,470
Not really.

1218
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,740
l know it's very competitive.

1219
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,110
You know what competition's really about?

1220
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:41,050
it's about ferocity, carnage.

1221
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,520
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

1222
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,500
Knowing exactly what you want...

1223
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,220
and how far you'll go to get it.

1224
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:56,330
How far will Elle go?

1225
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,440
Are you hitting on me?

1226
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:03,040
You're a beautiful girl.

1227
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,850
So everything you just said...

1228
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,620
l'm a man who knows what he wants.

1229
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,120
And l'm a law student who just realized...

1230
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,850
her professor is a pathetic asshole.

1231
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,390
Too bad. l thought you were a law student...

1232
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:17,620
who wanted to be a lawyer!

1233
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,640
You almost had me fooled.

1234
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,340
What?

1235
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,650
Maybe you should sleep with the jury, too.

1236
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,050
Then we can win the case.

1237
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,700
l'm quitting.

1238
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,400
Why?

1239
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,340
Law school was a mistake.
This internship was a mistake.

1240
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:03,700
What are you talking about?
You earned it.
Law school was a mistake.
This internship was a mistake.

1241
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,140
What are you talking about?
You earned it.

1242
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,270
l didn't earn anything.

1243
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:09,510
Callahan only gave me that internship...

1244
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:10,980
because he liked the way l looked.

1245
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,880
Which he made clear tonight
when he tried to feel me up.

1246
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,940
Callahan did what?

1247
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,360
Just forget about it.
l'm going back to L.A.

1248
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,560
No more boring suits.
No more pantyhose.

1249
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,530
No more trying to be something that l'm just...

1250
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,030
l'm just not.

1251
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,490
What if you're trying to be somebody you are?

1252
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,160
The hell with Callahan.

1253
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,570
Stay.

1254
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:42,280
Call me if you're ever in California.

1255
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,730
What's the point in staying, Paulette?

1256
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:05,040
All people see when they look at me...

1257
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,570
is blond hair and big boobs.

1258
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,400
No one's ever gonna take me seriously.

1259
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,270
The people at law school don't.
Warner doesn't.

1260
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,780
l don't think my own parents take me seriously.

1261
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,890
l just felt, like, for the first time...

1262
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,690
that someone expected me to...

1263
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,980
to do something more with my life...

1264
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,250
than become a Victoria's Secret model.

1265
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,220
But l was just kidding myself.

1266
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,530
Callahan never saw me as a lawyer...

1267
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,000
just as a piece of ass.

1268
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,200
Just like everybody else.

1269
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,110
Turns out l am a joke.

1270
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,910
No, you're not a joke.

1271
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,350
The hell with law school.

1272
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,230
l just wanted to say good-bye.

1273
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:02,830
lf you're going to let one
stupid prick ruin your life...

1274
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,340
you're not the girl l thought you were.

1275
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,030
Did you go in there knowing
how to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

1276
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:31,930
Absolutely.

1277
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,500
it's a little thing l'd like to call strategy.

1278
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:39,200
l had a feeling about Mr. Salvatore...

1279
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,900
ls he always such an ass?

1280
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,160
He's the top defense attorney in the state.

1281
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,470
Of course he's an ass.

1282
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:46,840
Fine. ls he an ass that'll win my case?

1283
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,510
He's an ass that'll try.

1284
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:50,880
He thinks l'm guilty.

1285
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,220
That's not what's important.

1286
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:52,880
lf he doesn't trust me,
why should l trust him?
That's not what's important.

1287
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,310
lf he doesn't trust me,
why should l trust him?

1288
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,480
Ask Elle.
She looked pretty cozy with him last night.

1289
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,590
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1290
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,150
What's going on here?

1291
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,190
-Elle quit.
-What?

1292
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,170
Callahan hit on her, so she quit.

1293
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,000
My God. Scumbag.

1294
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,900
-Oh, God.
-What?

1295
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,980
l feel terrible.
l made a huge mistake.

1296
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,350
Maybe there's something we can do about it.

1297
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,190
Thank you.

1298
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,630
What are you so happy about?
You're on trial for murder.

1299
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,570
Get up.

1300
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,300
What?

1301
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:49,380
You're fired.
l have new representation.

1302
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:51,740
Who?

1303
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,890
Excuse you, you're in my way.

1304
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
She's a law student.
She can't defend you.

1305
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:22,340
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruling 3.03.

1306
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,680
See? Thank you, David.

1307
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,110
Counselors, approach the bench.

1308
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,520
-You're not going up there.
-Yes, l am.

1309
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,250
Maybe you didn't hear me.
You're fired.

1310
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:38,220
Counselors, now.
All of you.

1311
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,330
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1312
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:47,130
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court...

1313
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,260
states that a law student may appear on behalf...

1314
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,900
of a defendant in criminal proceedings.

1315
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,230
Your Honor, l have no problem with this.

1316
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,900
l do.
l'm not allowing it.

1317
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,640
But you agreed last night.
in your office...

1318
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,440
when we were discussing my career.

1319
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,010
The ruling also states...

1320
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:05,120
that you need a licensed
attorney to supervise you.

1321
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,320
-Mr. Callahan?
-That l won't agree to.

1322
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,790
l'll supervise, Your Honor.

1323
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:13,060
Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1324
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,520
Thank you,Your Honor.

1325
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,340
Enjoy prison.

1326
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,250
Mrs. Windham,you do realize what you're doing?

1327
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,150
Absolutely.

1328
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,950
Oh, my God! There she is!

1329
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,580
We came to see your trial!

1330
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,560
Look how cute.
There's a judge and everything.

1331
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,740
-And jury people.
-Vote for Elle!

1332
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:50,530
Ladies, take a seat.
-And jury people.
-Vote for Elle!

1333
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:50,960
Ladies, take a seat.

1334
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,540
Go, girl.

1335
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,080
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...

1336
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,510
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1337
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,780
-l do.
-Be seated.

1338
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,680
Ms. Woods, you may begin your questioning.

1339
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:14,660
First of all l would like to point out...

1340
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,630
that not only is there no proof in this case...

1341
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:21,100
but there is a complete lack of mens rea...

1342
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:25,570
which by definition tells us
there can be no crime...

1343
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,870
without a vicious will.

1344
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,610
l am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

1345
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:31,870
What l'm unaware of...

1346
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,510
is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson...

1347
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,910
when you should be questioning your witness.

1348
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,310
Yes, Your Honor.

1349
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:44,720
Miss Windham...

1350
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,100
when you arrived back at the house...

1351
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,860
was your father there?

1352
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,560
Not that l saw, but like l said...

1353
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:54,570
l went straight upstairs to take a shower.

1354
01:19:56,310 --> 01:20:00,470
And when you came downstairs, what happened?

1355
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,600
l saw Brooke standing over his body...

1356
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,340
drenched in his blood.

1357
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,150
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

1358
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:15,360
No. She'd stashed it by then.

1359
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,490
Move to strike that from the record, Your Honor.

1360
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:19,120
-it's speculation.
-So stricken.

1361
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,430
Go ahead.

1362
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,240
Miss Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

1363
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,470
No. l was in the shower.

1364
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,840
So, sometime in the 20 minutes...

1365
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:43,420
that you were in the shower,
your father was shot.

1366
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,220
l guess.

1367
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,650
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

1368
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,330
but you didn't hear the shot because...

1369
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:58,690
because you were in the shower?

1370
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,110
l was washing my hair.

1371
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,570
Where is she going with this?

1372
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,540
Have a little faith, Gerard.

1373
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,280
Miss Windham...

1374
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:20,660
what had you done earlier that day?

1375
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,890
l got up...

1376
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,530
got a latte, went to the gym...

1377
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,230
got a perm, and came home.

1378
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,660
Where you got in the shower?

1379
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:35,010
l believe the witness has made it clear...

1380
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,100
that she was in the shower.

1381
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:44,740
Yes, Your Honor.

1382
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,920
Miss Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before?

1383
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:51,180
How many would you say?

1384
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,080
Two a year since l was 1 2.

1385
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,460
You do the math.

1386
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:00,490
A girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1387
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:02,200
We all tried to talk her out of it.

1388
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:03,800
Curls weren't a good look for her.

1389
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,870
She didn't have your bone structure.

1390
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,410
But, thankfully, that same day...

1391
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,570
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wett-shirt contest...

1392
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,810
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

1393
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,720
Objection!
Why is this relevant?

1394
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:16,820
l have a point, l promise.
Objection!
Why is this relevant?

1395
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:17,950
l have a point, l promise.

1396
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,410
Then make it.

1397
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,320
Yes, ma'am.

1398
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,150
Chutney, why were
Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined...

1399
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,630
when she got hosed down?

1400
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,530
Because they got wet?

1401
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,790
Exactly. isn't it the first cardinal rule...

1402
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,370
of perm maintenance that you're
forbidden to wet your hair...

1403
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,870
for at least 24 hours after getting a perm...

1404
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,840
at the risk of deactivating
the ammonium thioglycolate?

1405
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,010
And wouldn't somebody
who's had, say,30 perms...

1406
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:45,820
in their life be well aware of this rule?

1407
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:46,740
And if in fact you weren't washing your hair...
in their life be well aware of this rule?

1408
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,750
And if in fact you weren't washing your hair...

1409
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,180
as l suspect,
because your curls are still intact...

1410
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:51,690
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1411
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:52,050
And if in fact you had heard the gunshot...
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1412
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,920
And if in fact you had heard the gunshot...

1413
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,990
Brooke Windham wouldn't have
had time to hide the gun...

1414
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:57,680
before you got downstairs...

1415
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,890
which would mean you would
have had to have found...

1416
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,760
Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand...

1417
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:04,430
to make your story plausible.
lsn't that right?

1418
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:06,760
She's my age!
Did she tell you that?

1419
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:09,460
How would you feel if your
father married someone your age?

1420
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,130
You, however, had time to hide the gun...

1421
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,400
after you shot your father.

1422
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,600
l didn't mean to shoot him.

1423
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,940
l thought it was you walking through the door!

1424
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,220
Order! Order!

1425
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,290
Order!

1426
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,680
Oh, my God.

1427
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,420
Oh, my God.

1428
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:27,990
Oh, my God.

1429
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,920
Bailiff, take the witness into custody...

1430
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:35,400
where she will be charged for
the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1431
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:38,160
in the matter of The State vs. Brooke Windham...

1432
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,470
this case is dismissed.

1433
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:42,760
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

1434
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,290
Thank you!

1435
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,590
Elle, how did you know Chutney was lying?

1436
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,230
Because she's brilliant, of course.

1437
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,160
The rules of hair care are simple and finite.

1438
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,850
Any Cosmo Girl would have known.

1439
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,430
What?

1440
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,600
l just wanted to say...

1441
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:17,110
that you were so brilliant in there.

1442
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,380
And that l was wrong.

1443
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:24,950
And you are the girl for me.

1444
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,750
Really?

1445
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,610
Pooh bear...l love you.

1446
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:37,860
l've waited so long to hear you say that.

1447
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:42,160
But if l'm gonna be a partner at
a law firm by the time l'm 30...

1448
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,600
l need a boyfriend who's not
such a complete bonehead.

1449
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,830
Thank you, boys.

1450
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,180
Ladies and gentlemen...

1451
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,820
l present the graduates of Harvard Law School...

1452
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:04,550
Class of 2004.

1453
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,020
l am personally very honored to introduce...

1454
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:12,620
this year's class-elected speaker.

1455
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,700
After getting off to a quite interesting start...

1456
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:17,810
here at Harvard...

1457
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:18,170

here at Harvard...

1458
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:20,970
she graduates today with an invitation to join...

1459
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:24,140
one of Boston's most prestigious law firms.

1460
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:28,720
l'm sure we are going to see
great things from her.

1461
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:33,550
Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.

1462
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:54,970
On our very first day at Harvard...

1463
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,310
a very wise professor quoted Aristotle.

1464
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,210
The law is reason free from passion.

1465
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,280
Well, no offense to Aristotle...

1466
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,180
but in my three years at Harvard...

1467
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,560
l have come to find that
passion is a key ingredient...

1468
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:14,730
to the study and practice of law and of life.

1469
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,200
it is with passion, courage of conviction...

1470
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:18,460
and strong sense of self...
it is with passion, courage of conviction...

1471
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,730
and strong sense of self...

1472
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,070
that we take our next steps into the world...

1473
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,700
remembering that first impressions...

1474
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,170
are not always correct...

1475
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,740
you must always have faith in people...

1476
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,440
and most importantly...

1477
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,150
you must always have faith in yourself.

1478
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,490
Congratulations, Class of 2004.

1479
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,690
We did it!
