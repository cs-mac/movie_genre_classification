1
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,078
My name is Will,

2
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,347
and this... is my office.

3
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,094
You've seen us before.

4
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,262
A sea of glowing screens

5
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,498
attached to your
coffee shop like barnacles.

6
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,535
Or... maybe you're one
of us, and you understand

7
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,104
we're not here to be
different

8
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,706
we're here to survive.

9
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,509
I manage a website
for an electronics company.

10
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,778
Mainly updating
driver downloads,

11
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,480
integrating advertising
revenue

12
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,948
with product-specific pla-

13
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,018
But, I do have a job,
so...

14
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,020
I guess I shouldn't
complain.

15
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:05,424
When I got laid off from
my office job a year ago,

16
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,825
I tried working at home...

17
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,262
But roommates can make that
difficult.

18
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,799
-I have fucking aids!

19
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,667
Aaaiiiddss!

20
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,304
- So, I come here...
Coffee Town.

21
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,440
Though, it wasn't always
called that.

22
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,343
A local businessman,
Morris Brown,

23
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,845
wanted to starts a chain
of coffee stores

24
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,882
and since coffee is
brown...

25
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,850
he came up with the
ingenious name

26
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,851
Brown Town,

27
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,187
which some took the wrong
way.

28
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,424
So, it became...
Coffee Town.

29
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,926
And it works for me
because,

30
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,361
unlike some people in this
world...

31
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,530
- Do you have another card,
maybe?

32
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,831
- I live within my means.

33
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,832
- Next?

34
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,201
I drive a 1998 Saturn.

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,812
I used to have one of these.

36
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,514
I buy clothes at estate
sales.

37
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:08,754
- That was his church...
coat...

38
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,023
- I get my hair cut at a
cosmetology school.

39
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:11,823
- No...

40
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,894
...lose yourself. Don't be
afraid to fail.

41
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,332
-Uuh...

42
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,535
And... I use a coffee shop
as my office,

43
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,170
which I love.

44
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,806
It's three blocks from my
house, has comfortable chairs,

45
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,341
and, most importantly,..

46
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,476
people that are bigger
losers than me.

47
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,011
- Where's your dial-up
connection?

48
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,514
- But, like any office,
there are rules to surviving

49
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,649
and they have to be
followed.

50
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,419
The main rule? Always be
drinking.

51
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,156
If you stop drinking, you
stop being a customer.

52
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,960
And the reason I have to
play by the rules... is this
guy.

53
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:48,860
Sam.

54
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,097
He sees people me as
parasites,

55
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,100
squatters in his house of
free wi-fi.

56
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,368
- What'll it be, sir?

57
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,337
- He knows.

58
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,373
Medium drip... lightly
sweetened...

59
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,276
Sometimes I let him write
it all down.

60
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,611
Then I change it up.

61
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,879
With whole... milk.

62
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,858
I win.

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,427
Now I just have to find a
way to drink milk

64
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,429
without shitting my pants.

65
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,767
Another up-side of having
a coffee shop as your office

66
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,903
is your friends can drop
by and hang out whenever they
want.

67
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,444
This is Chad.

68
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,713
We've been friends since
high school.

69
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,685
- Mmm... mmm, cawamel...

70
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,954
I like... cawamel.

71
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,423
Mmmh... mmm

72
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,526
mmh...

73
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,128
- He works in the building
across the street

74
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,032
and visits during his
company-sanctioned smoke
breaks...

75
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,566
even though he doesn't
smoke.

76
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,539
- Coffee Town...

77
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,841
It's amazing that black
people got mad about Brown
Town.

78
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:15,447
I mean, if 'brown town' meant
them, that would mean it's
they're town.

79
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,015
Right? Isn't that what you
want?

80
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,483
Your own town? Just for you?

81
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,519
I mean, that's like havin'
a... a...

82
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,921
- Water fountain? Just for
you?

83
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,490
-You're making fun of me.

84
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,993
- Oh no, no, no. You pretty
much take care of that on your
own.

85
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,361
- Well, guess what.

86
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,430
I don't think that whole
water fountain thing is racist
either.

87
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,497
- See?

88
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,000
- You have a water fountain
just for yourself.

89
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,302
Everywhere you go, there's
two water fountains.

90
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:41,006
Now, sure, it's wrong if,
like, the black person water
fountain is like...

91
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,674
rusty, or something like
that.

92
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,377
But if it's just
as good as the white person
water fountain...

93
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,280
That's
more water fountains.

94
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,048
It keeps the crowds down!

95
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,850
- The water fountain crowds?

96
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,719
- I've stood in line at a
water fountain before.

97
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,021
- No you haven't.
- I know.

98
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,357
Because black people don't
like water fountains.

99
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,091
- What?

100
00:05:59,093 --> 00:05:59,925
- Africa...

101
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,728
... is a desert continent.

102
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,031
- That's crazy... it's...
crazy.

103
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:10,035
- I am all for civil rights.
I'm like the number one civil
rights guy.

104
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,270
But, let's be real.

105
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,373
Since the civil rights era...

106
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,042
there's half as many water
fountains.

107
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:17,976
Fact.

108
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,980
- More often than not,
we're joined by our friend,
Gino.

109
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,982
- Gino

110
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,385
- Who became a police
officer solely to hook up with
women.

111
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,821
Which he's far more
skilled at than, you know,
stopping crime.

112
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,989
-Can I get a coffee?
-Sure.

113
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,024
- Hey, you're new here, huh?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,359
- Yeah, well, keep your head
down.

115
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,994
There've been some drive-by
shootings in the area

116
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,330
and I'd hate to see that
pretty face of yours gettin'
blown off.

117
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,365
- Oh my god.

118
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,169
- Gino's theory is that
fear stimulates women more
than flirtation.

119
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,204
- It's on the house.
- Look me in the eyes.

120
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,939
You're welcome.

121
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,009
- You're welcome.

122
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,779
- And as far as I can
tell... he seems to be right.

123
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,013
- You guys saw that, right?

124
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,548
Cop talk never fails.

125
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,049
- Aw yeah!

126
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,119
- I'm just glad you didn't
use the serial rapist on the
loose story.

127
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,487
- What, are you nuts? That's
my closer.

128
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,090
You open with that and they
associate you with rape.

129
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,425
And not the good kind.

130
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,660
- What?
- What?

131
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,663
- Hey, so was that drive-by
shooting thing bullshit?

132
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,365
- That actually was real,
my friend.

133
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,767
Guy got plugged over in
Norwich outta nowhere.

134
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,436
This whole town is going to
shit.

135
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,538
- Yeah, because you're in
charge of protecting it.

136
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,542
You know, at the academy,
when they asked me if I ever
did drugs

137
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:28,380
I said "no" to a detective,
and he took my word for it!

138
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,215
I've sold drugs.

139
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,518
- I can't believe you can
shoot people.

140
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,519
- Oh, I can, Will.

141
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,855
I could shoot anybody I want.
- Oh!

142
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,857
All units,
all units.

143
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,760
Possible break-in at
Beatty Towers. Back-up units
requested.

144
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,195
- One sugar's never enough.

145
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,463
You know what I mean? They
should make the packets huge.

146
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,164
Officer
down! Officer down!

147
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,602
- You gonna get that?
- No, it's so far away.

148
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,270
- Is the volume bothering you?

149
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,775
I should have been a cop.
There's literally no
down-side.

150
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,010
- Yeah, totally. I mean,
except dying.

151
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,680
- I'd welcome that...

152
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,348
Chad works for an
industrial lighting company

153
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,685
where employees sell
expensive L.E.D. lighting
systems

154
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,287
while sitting underneath
the cheap fluorescent bulbs

155
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,655
they're competing against.

156
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,324
- Fuuuck you!

157
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,829
- That happens about once
a week.

158
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,464
- You lose a sale, Roger?

159
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,034
- Hey, check this guy out
right here.

160
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,803
He comes in here every single
day

161
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,271
and he wants to tip Sam,

162
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,340
but Sam doesn't wanna
acknowledge the tip.

163
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,342
Okay, watch. He's gonna go to
give Sam a tip and

164
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,144
no, no. See Sam doesn't want
to acknowledge the tip!

165
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,313
But this guy wants him to
acknowledge the tip.

166
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,315
Sam will probably look back
at- yep, see.

167
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,017
And Sam turns around again.

168
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,052
And the other guy just walks
off, he doesn't tip Sam,

169
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,022
and then Sam looks at the
jar, and he can tell by sight

170
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,590
that nothing's been put in
there.

171
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,259
- Asshole.

172
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,461
- It's like a tiny little
ballet.
- Mm hmm.

173
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,430
- He should do those
jellybean in a jar contests

174
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,532
and get rich!

175
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,200
- I wouldn't acknowledge a
tip either.

176
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,036
Someone throwing their spare
change at you like you're a
hobo?

177
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,371
How humiliating is that?

178
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,040
- Whoa! Here comes your girl!

179
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,748
- She stops by every day
after the gym.

180
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,385
Stunning, graceful.

181
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,421
A perfect, sweaty angel.

182
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,095
- Hi.
- Hey.

183
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,164
- What can I get you?
- Soy latte, please.

184
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,536
Hey!
- What?

185
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,972
- Shit.
- He works in a coffee shop.

186
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,507
Not a threat.

187
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,108
- He's in a band.
- Threat.

188
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,777
- Daily grind of coffee,
daily grind of rock 'n' roll.

189
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,644
You know what I mean?

190
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,246
- What's her name?

191
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,380
- Becca.

192
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,516
Oh...

193
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,618
She just saw me mouth her
name.

194
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,519
- Yeah, that's a tell.

195
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,553
- Soy latte?

196
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,789
- Oh.
- Hey, I got that.

197
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,290
Yyeaah!

198
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,159
That is for you.

199
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,427
- Just go over there and talk
to her.

200
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,461
I'm sick of watching you
drool over her every day.

201
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,530
- I would love to talk to
her, Chad,

202
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,299
but she always comes in here
wearing work-out clothes.

203
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,134
You can't make a move on a
girl in work-out clothes

204
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,136
without comin' off like a
douche.

205
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,506
Hey there, I could not help
but notice your body being
displayed

206
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:13,345
and I was wondering...
if I could have sex with it.

207
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,147
Aaah!

208
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,716
- Alright... I'm givin' her a
brush-by.

209
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:18,617
Police privilege.

210
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,884
- Oh no, please don't do
that.

211
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,886
- Oh please, I will do that.
It's for you, okay?

212
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,989
Athletic wear is very
misleading.

213
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,323
You don't know what's firm
underneath that.

214
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,191
- I don't need to know.

215
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,692
- Yeah, well no I need to
know.

216
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,929
Excuse me.

217
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,165
- Oh... Thanks for all your
hard work.

218
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,434
- Just tryin' to keep you
safe.

219
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,641
- No, plea- please d- plea-

220
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,242
- So firm!

221
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,679
- Why are we friends with
him?

222
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,780
- He's got a good heart.

223
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,183
Is he parked in two
handicapped spots?

224
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,455
I should get back to the
office.

225
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,423
- Yep.

226
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,592
Me too.

227
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,428
I wouldn't say a coffee
shop is the perfect office...

228
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,364
but I'll admit, it means
something to me.

229
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,537
In a world that lets me
feel joy just long enough to
taste it

230
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,711
then somehow finds a way
to cruelly yank it away,

231
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,384
So, I continue to go
there, even though my
apartment

232
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,919
is now mine, alone...

233
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,655
shared only by the
belongings

234
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,691
of my recently deceased
roommate,

235
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,293
whom I think about a lot.

236
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,929
Sometimes too much.

237
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,000
I thought his family would
come and collect his things,

238
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,269
but I think after the
funeral...

239
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,904
...they preferred to avoid
me.

240
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,907
I just feel th-

241
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,846
...um...

242
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,417
C'mon.

243
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,754
Come on...

244
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,656
Come,

245
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,872
I guess the sad truth is

246
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,208
Coffee Town is the only
place I really feel
comfortable.

247
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,942
- Enjoy.

248
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,779
- Medium drip, lightly
sweetened, light soy.

249
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,382
- Name?

250
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:40,525
- Willllinton
Zegonda-Georgington Zybl-

251
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,995
Junior.

252
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,707
- Did I spell that right?

253
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,776
- You just drew a penis.

254
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,580
- Next in line?

255
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,519
- Another attempt to
squeeze people like me out

256
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,355
Tryin' to make every piss
cost a quarter.

257
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,024
But, as it doesn't specify
'quarter'

258
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,928
there's no reason I can't
use Pizza Castle tokens...

259
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,530
Turn over. Oh yeah.

260
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,532
... which I harvest by the
hundreds.

261
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:21,966
That is what I need!

262
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:22,867
Oh yeah!

263
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,736
- You here with a kid?

264
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,972
- Yeah... yes.

265
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,641
- Gary, why don't you, uh,
meet me down at the ball pit.

266
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,509
We've a pervert situation
here.

267
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,878
Gary, the pervert's on the
run. The pervert's on the run,
he's--

268
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,746
- move!

269
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,117
- Green tea for Molly.

270
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,355
Medium drip for... Penis
Drawing

271
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,328
- Hey.
- Hey!

272
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,364
- So, you didn't get in early
enough for the big table, huh?

273
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,367
- No, I did. It's just
technically for the disabled,

274
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,670
so sometimes you gotta give
it up.

275
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,873
Lucky bastard... Right near
an outlet.

276
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,009
-So get this. Yesterday, my
boss says to me

277
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,947
that my teeth don't look like
any smoker he's ever seen...
Huh?

278
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,782
Hey... Are you listening?

279
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,183
- Yes, I'm listening.

280
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,185
It's weird that your boss was
looking at your teeth.

281
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,653
-Wait, no, he's not a homo.

282
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,790
He just thinks I'm full of
shit and he's tryin' to flush
me out.

283
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,059
- Technically, Chad, you are
full of shit.

284
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,527
- Yeah, I know.

285
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,696
But we're talking about five
ten-minute breaks every day

286
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,465
sanctioned by the boss,
because he smokes, alright?

287
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,801
I'm not gonna miss out on
that.

288
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,436
So...

289
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,539
I've gotta start smoking

290
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,340
- Ooh...
- For real.

291
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,941
- You know, they say

292
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,777
starting smoking is one of
the toughest things you can
do.

293
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,213
- You know what the worst
part's gonna be?

294
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,448
- Cancer?

295
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,449
- Buying the things.

296
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,018
It's worse than buying
condoms, alright?

297
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,655
You can't turn a cigarette
inside-out and smoke it again.

298
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,522
- Wait, what?

299
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,558
- I r- I rinse it out!

300
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
- Chad, I'll give you
condoms.

301
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,662
- Ooooh boy.

302
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,163
- Yo.
- Hey, what's goin' on?

303
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,331
- I dunno.

304
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,000
- Check this out. Ah you're
gonna love this.

305
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,268
- What do we got?

306
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,470
- Oh, what do I got... what
don't I got? Boom!

307
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,939
- Oh!
- The evidence room is a
joke.

308
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,441
That, my friends, is an ivory
handle.

309
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,343
- Does that have... blood on
the blade?

310
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,945
- Probably.

311
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,847
- They're gonna think there's
a murder going on in here.

312
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,783
- Because of that little
amount of blood? Chad...

313
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,485
- Forensics?
- You're an idiot.

314
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,719
- Let me show you, over here,

315
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,655
is where I'm thinkin' we can
put the taps.

316
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,290
- Hey, guys,
guys guys...

317
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,524
That's Morris Brown.

318
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,959
He owns this entire chain.

319
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,227
- Oh, wow!

320
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,529
- Droppin' by to get his ass
kissed, I like that.

321
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,998
- I- I really think that this
is your best bet.

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,935
I mean, they might call it
Coffee Town, but I call it...

323
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,269
... Coffee Home.

324
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,471
- I don't... think they're
just here for a visit.

325
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,539
They're checkin' everything
out.

326
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,308
- Ah! And here's my coffee
wife,

327
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,276
hehe, right over here.

328
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,844
Not... not really,

329
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,346
I mean, I don't have sex with
her... or anything.

330
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,181
I mean not that... you don't
deserve it, but..

331
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,149
- Ugh.
- Alright...

332
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,216
uh, let me show you the
bathroom.

333
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,451
- It's awesome.

334
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,787
- You think this place is up
for remodel?

335
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,121
- Maybe...

336
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,489
- You think they're gonna get
rid of these chairs?

337
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,391
I'm sick of having all
beanbags.

338
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,627
- Told you you'd regret that.
- I do.

339
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,330
Biggest mistake of my life.

340
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,664
- Even bigger than that
haircut?

341
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,434
- Oh, hey, Sam, Sam, Sam,

342
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,437
c'mere... C'mon, dude,
c'mere.

343
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,604
Come here.

344
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,274
What's the owner doing here?

345
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,476
- Ah, well, see, they are...

346
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,212
converting one of the
locations to a bistro lounge.

347
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,447
Serve alcohol and stuff.

348
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,350
More of a social atmosphere
as opposed to a place where

349
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,285
dick-heads can leech off
our resources

350
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,586
for six dollars a day.

351
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,094
- Fuck.

352
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,729
- I like the idea!

353
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,796
- What do you mean you like
the idea?

354
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,698
This is my office! I have to
work here!

355
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,200
- You don't have to work
here.

356
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,869
- Yes I do. This is the only
place within walking distance,

357
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,637
has free wireless, outdoor
seating...

358
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,772
... printing station...

359
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,207
- There's a printing station?

360
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,842
- Yeah, you get Nathan a
muffin

361
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,445
- I would never give that guy
a muffin.

362
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,546
- This place is like my home!

363
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,615
- Calm down, there's a
million Coffee Towns.

364
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,017
How do you know they're gonna
pick this place?

365
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,485
- Because this is the best
one, Gino.

366
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,619
They're gonna see that.

367
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,722
- The one in Albertson's is
nice!

368
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,290
- You know, I don't think
they're gonna pick one

369
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,526
that's in a grocery store,
Chad.

370
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,861
- They probably won't.
- Yeah.

371
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,129
- Ah, dammit.

372
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,098
They're gonna turn my office
into a T.G.I. Fridays.

373
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,103
Oh god.

374
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,105
- Oh ho, that's not gonna
help your cause.

375
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,140
- Becca!

376
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,208
Beautiful Becca.

377
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,810
Nice to see you... as always!
Always great, uh...

378
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,678
- Morris Brown is totally
checking her out.

379
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,014
- Uh, I can get that kinda
clientele here.

380
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,217
- Morris is gonna think this
is the place for the bistro.

381
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,120
Cuz you got a--
- We got it, Chad.

382
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,889
- I'm just explaining...
- Yeah, a lot.

383
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,658
- Ah, what is that? Oh hey!
Wait a minute.

384
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,728
We have, uh... we meaning my
band Mr. and Mrs. Williams...

385
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,229
- Oh no.

386
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,330
- What is that?

387
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,365
- His demo CD.

388
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,001
- Aw, shit just got real, my
friend.

389
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,836
- It's what I do, I put my
heart into the... into the...

390
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,105
the stories are- are where it
comes from.

391
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,374
- He's going in via the
artist's entrance. And do you
see this?

392
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,675
Do you see this right now?

393
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,344
He is pointing to the song
that she'll think is about
her.

394
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,346
This dude is good. That is a
veteran move.

395
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,182
- I'm not gonna say it's
about you,

396
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,818
and I'm not gonna say that it
is not about you... cuz...

397
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,319
- Aw, Sam.
- That's how I work.

398
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,787
- Nobody's ever written a
song about me before.

399
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,923
- I mean it's- it- may not
be...

400
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,293
- Thanks.

401
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,461
- He's a dick.

402
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,496
- I got news for you, friend.
He's not.

403
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,664
- What do you mean? You don't
know him.

404
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,099
- This is what I do know,
okay?

405
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,000
I went into that bathroom
right there a couple days ago

406
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:26,370
and took a very adult shit.
Laid some very heavy
skid-marks.

407
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,307
When he leaves, I go back in
to wash my hands.

408
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,475
- Wait, wait wait.

409
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,509
You don't wash your hands the
first time?

410
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,543
- Of course not.

411
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,545
Dries out my skin... But...

412
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,713
my thumb stunk a lot...

413
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,048
I think I clipped asshole.

414
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,016
Regardless, I get back in
there,

415
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,152
all of the streaks... totally
off.

416
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,789
That guy pissed em off the
porcelain.

417
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,457
That says a lot about a man.

418
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,793
- You know what he is? He's a
poop-chipper.

419
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,661
- Chad, you nailed it, dude.

420
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,030
Dude is a poop-chipper.
- A what?

421
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,699
- What? He just said 'what'.
- What.

422
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,433
- Tell him what it is.

423
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,767
I'll take it from here.

424
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,870
There are two types of guys
in this world, right?

425
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,639
Those who use their own urine
to chip away someone else's
poop,

426
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,374
for the greater good,

427
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,709
and those who do not.

428
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,444
- I don't even chip my own
poop at home.

429
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,179
- It's weird to say that.
Okay?

430
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,348
And that, my friend, right
there, we are looking at

431
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,449
is a poop-chipper...

432
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,884
... who is in a band...

433
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:14,719
You should be nervous.

434
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,521
- I gotta make my move!
- You sure do.

435
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,957
- Yeah, especially before
they turn this place into a
bistro lounge,

436
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,393
because a girl like that,
she's not gonna come in here,

437
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,495
all sweaty and naked,

438
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,465
when people are, you know,
sittin' in tuxedos, sippin'
wine.

439
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,499
Uh uh uh.

440
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,667
- Have you ever been to a
bistro before?

441
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,802
- No. I'm gonna go to this
one, though.
- Right.

442
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,538
- Do you think the cover
charge is gonna be high?

443
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,872
- Aw man.

444
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,541
- God, if this place converts

445
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:37,608
I'm gonna lose everything...

446
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,710
my office, my girl...

447
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,479
- All the things you don't
actually have?

448
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,446
- Heh heh.

449
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,484
If you want to approach a
girl who's not on your playing
field,

450
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,120
you have to meet her on hers.
Look at that.

451
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,821
You gotta get yourself some
work-out wear.

452
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:51,989
- Or be super sweaty.

453
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,124
- I'd stick with the work-out
wear.

454
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:55,126
- Either way works.
- Except one of em.

455
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,529
- Okay. No, you're right. I
gotta try that.

456
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,198
I'm gonna try that.

457
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,300
- Fuck!

458
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,709
- Hey, Matthews!

459
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,278
- Hey Mr. Ryan. Just comin'
here to get my fix.

460
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,846
- No wonder I never see you
in the courtyard,

461
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:16,881
you sneak over here for a
smoke.

462
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,050
- Yeah, I just find it more
peaceful.

463
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,051
- Hey.

464
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,455
- I'll- I'll see you back at
the office.

465
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,389
- Yeah.

466
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,793
- It's on the house, right?
Yeah.

467
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,297
- C'mon Phil. You don't even
have a cord.

468
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,799
- Phil, get outta here.

469
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,033
- This guy...
- Phil!

470
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,471
- Oh, ooh, ooh!

471
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,372
Fish on!

472
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,174
Seems like a nice dude,
right?

473
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,976
I think I could live
with this guy.

474
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,211
- Okay, calm down, he hasn't
even taken a tab yet.

475
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,546
- Yeah, no, you're right,
you're right.

476
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,381
He might just be lookin' at
the missing dog flyer.

477
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,882
- He'd be wasting his time.

478
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,351
I found that dog last week.

479
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,056
- Come on... c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon.

480
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,026
Oh, wait.
- Look at this! Boom!

481
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,495
- I got him. He's mine.

482
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,397
- I think... is he- is he
dialing now?

483
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,399
Oh shit.
- Oh.

484
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,535
- Hello?

485
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,039
- Hi, I was just calling
about the room for rent.

486
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,975
- Yes, uh, the room is
available and--
- Mm hmm?

487
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,811
- Uuuuuh... you can have it,
if you want to,

488
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,147
because... I mean...

489
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,349
Yes, I'm sitting right here.
Hehehe...

490
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,552
- I'm standing right here.

491
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,956
- That's the living room.
- Okay.

492
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,158
- And uh, your bedroom's
gonna be right through here,

493
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,193
and this is gonna be the...
bath... room...

494
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,362
You know what? Actually, I
will meet you in there.

495
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,964
Uh, and I'm just gonna do...
something.

496
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,369
Something being removing
the last traces of my previous
roommate.

497
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:57,148
So... yeah. It's just a futon
in here right now,

498
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,150
but you're welcome to move a
bed in if you'd like.

499
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,320
- Naw, it's okay, I don't
even sleep.

500
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,556
- You... you don't... sleep?
- Mm mm...

501
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,226
I have a neurological
disorder that prevents me from
sleeping.

502
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,661
- Really? Wow.

503
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,563
How do you deal with
something like that?

504
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:16,667
- I do exercises to simulate
rapid eye movement.

505
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,302
Sort-of like this guy.

506
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,274
This kinda reminds me of me.

507
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:24,842
Thank you...

508
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,346
... It's gonna be fun staying
awake here.

509
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,947
- Nice.

510
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,884
Well, what are you doin' now?

511
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,386
- Exercising.

512
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,268
- Oh no, no, no!

513
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,038
- What?

514
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,774
- Are you serious!?
- What?

515
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,708
- What are you wea- w- what
is this!?

516
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,876
- Work-out clothes!

517
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,678
- Work-out clothes!?
- This was your idea!

518
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,679
- But sleeveless!?

519
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,546
- Oh, c--
- You're not Rafael Nadal,

520
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,714
you're barely Jim Courier!

521
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,549
- Hey, hey, man, this is all
I have, okay?

522
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,650
- Aw hey, ya know, maybe you
should open up the arm holes a
little bit,

523
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,452
show off those sweet nipples
ya got.

524
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,121
- Hey, you said, you said
make it look like we have
something in common,

525
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:11,122
and this is what I'm--

526
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:12,523
- Not that you wear the same
size!

527
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,192
- Ey, I've seen you shirtless
too, everything's drooping
down.

528
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,328
It's like the Earth is trying
to suck you back in.

529
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,196
- I'm a cop, I don't have to
be in shape.

530
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,065
I'm never gonna run faster
than a bullet.

531
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,467
Get me somethin'.

532
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,269
- After you.
- Thanks.

533
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:29,940
- Really?

534
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,209
- Hi.
- Hey.

535
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,377
- Okay...

536
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,414
- Sam, we've got an office
list.

537
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,049
- Okay, you ready?

538
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,453
- Bring it.
- Kyle, iced large chai.

539
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,021
- Kyle, iced large.

540
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,189
- Yep. Uh, chai.

541
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,058
But leave room for, um...

542
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,127
...leave room for the...

543
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,462
- Just- just leave the room,
and then, uh...

544
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,532
they can figure out what to
put in that room.

545
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,900
- Cream! It's cream.

546
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,301
Leave room for the cream.
- Got it.

547
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,969
- Oh my God.
- Medium iced cog.

548
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,805
- Everybody loves
the iced cog!

549
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,373
- Eric, white chocolate
mocha. Whoa.

550
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,140
- White chocca
mocha chocca!

551
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,475
- That was really bad.

552
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,544
- That's like, a lot of
complicated drinks, huh...

553
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,212
... in the office... that's
great.

554
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,714
- What's up with concentrated
detergent?

555
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,349
One teaspoon does an entire
load.

556
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,486
How did they figure out how
to get more soap into soap?

557
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,455
- Didn't seem like soap was
somethin' needed fixin'.

558
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,622
- Yeah, I've never done my
laundry and thought,

559
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,559
"Jesus, I wish I could pour
less soap in here".

560
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:25,095
- They should figure out a
way to put more porn... in
porn.

561
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:31,168
- Midgets...
- No, that would be less
porn, don't you think?

562
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,471
- Sometimes... less is more.

563
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,339
- No, not in this case.

564
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,841
- Oh, you know what? That
would be a great name

565
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,510
for a midget porn star. Less
Ismore.

566
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:42,179
- Yeah. And featuring Less
Ismore

567
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,548
- Featuring Less Is More...

568
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,852
- His tag line should be '"one
teaspoon equals an entire
load".

569
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,087
- I'd watch that. I'd watch
it anyway.

570
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,556
- Unbelievable.

571
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,991
- What is this?

572
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,827
- Just... people. I open the
door for them and then they...

573
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,563
got in line in front of me. I
just don't understand that.

574
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,198
You do a good deed and you
get punished for it?

575
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,534
- Well isn't opening the door
saying "you go first"?

576
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,337
- No, Chad. Opening the door
is saying "you go first into
the building",

577
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,806
not "you go first into the
line where I have to wait 20
minutes

578
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,876
while you make extremely
complicated coffee drink
orders

579
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,378
for your stupid... office...
coworkers".

580
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,814
- Well, you do a good deed,
it always comes back to you.

581
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,550
- Really? Because right now I
feel like jack shit comes back
to me.

582
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,385
I mean wh- when was the last
time anything went my way?

583
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,387
- Well you got that awesome
shirt.

584
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,689
- The...

585
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,359
The shirt's for Becca.
-Oh.

586
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,196
Well, should you be wearing
it before you give it to her?

587
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,368
- Relax! Who cares man? Look
at this guy over here.

588
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,503
What is that a Dave Matthews
shirt?

589
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:43,374
- Hm... You think that means
he's gay, or just a douche?

590
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,442
- It's a tough call with, uh,
guys that like Dave Matthews.

591
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,378
I mean, is he just a guy that
likes to smoke weed

592
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,113
and listen to shitty music?

593
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,848
Cuz nobody seems to mind when
you do that to the Grateful
Dead,

594
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,550
or... Phish.

595
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:56,220
- Which makes it more about
Dave, who is both likable and
good-looking,

596
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,955
which pushes it right on
over...

597
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,623
... to the gay column.
- Oooh.

598
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,458
- You know what I was
thinking about last night?

599
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,461
When you think about it,
being straight is gay.

600
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:07,398
I mean, how gay is it being
attracted to a woman...

601
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,000
all pink... and perfumey.

602
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,570
You know, it's like "ooh, I
like girls.

603
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,805
I wanna rub up against
girls".

604
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,473
Fag.

605
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,343
But... If you wanna be
straight...

606
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,979
... shove it up another guy's
ass.

607
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,113
That's straight.

608
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,518
You see what I'm saying?

609
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,055
- Are you gay?

610
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,456
-No, no no no no. I'm just
saying,

611
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:36,527
what's straighter than having
sex with another guy?

612
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,029
- Everything.
- Literally everything.

613
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,565
- No, you guys... are
homophobes.

614
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,967
- Of straight people?

615
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,368
- Yeah, well I call them gay
people.

616
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:49,873
- I'm lost...
I don't know what you're...

617
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,642
- Are you enjoying that
coffee?

618
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,477
- Sam's newest tactic.

619
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:56,013
He does nothing to the
drink, but asks me how it is,

620
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,515
to make me question that
he might have.

621
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,886
- Medium drip... for Will.

622
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,224
- But the best retaliation
for psychological warfare

623
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,527
is more psychological
warfare.

624
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,429
It's delicious... thanks.

625
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,335
- Jesus fucking Christ, Will!
C'mon, man!

626
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,236
- Sorry I thought that was a
coaster.

627
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,504
- No!
- That's not a coaster...

628
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:21,872
- This right here is my life,
okay?

629
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,874
This is like my little baby
child.

630
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,376
Not a fuckin' coaster.

631
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,044
Phil!

632
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,546
Oh, c- Phil, no no no, that's
not a coaster, man.

633
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,748
- I gave them to everybody.

634
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,783
- You're a genius.

635
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,385
- God dammit. These are not
coasters, okay?

636
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:36,787
I don't care what the
fuckin'--Jesus Christ- sign
says.

637
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,455
This is a- a CD that I
made.

638
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:41,358
Concrete Angst. Give it a
listen, you might like it.
Okay?

639
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,326
Let me know what you think.

640
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,527
- It's still free, right?

641
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,565
- Alright, time to go...
light up.

642
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,501
My boss saw me in here
yesterday,

643
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,404
it's gettin' too risky, not
smoking.

644
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,371
- Newports?

645
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,908
- ... Yeah, why? What's wrong
with Newports?

646
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,344
- ... Well...

647
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,447
... Nothin'.

648
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,615
- Menthol, too, huh?

649
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,350
- Yeah, I thought it would
make it taste better.

650
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,719
- Yeah... probably would.
That's a good choice.

651
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,922
- Okay... Time to kick the
not smoking habit.

652
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,460
I'm really gonna do it this
time.

653
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,667
- What's a non-racist way to
tell Chad that he's smoking...

654
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,904
- Cigarettes that mostly
black people smoke?

655
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,539
- Yes.
- Right... right.

656
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,942
There's no non-racist way to
say something racist, Will.

657
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,378
- Okay.
- Oh... Listen up.

658
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,013
I've got some bad news on the
whole Coffee Town front.

659
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,181
- What?

660
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,382
- Some exec called the
department yesterday

661
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,384
to check up on the crime
history of this place...

662
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,686
Check over any felony
reports, stuff like that.

663
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,620
- Why?

664
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,456
- Because whatever store they
choose,

665
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,357
they're gonna convert into
their flagship store.

666
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,394
They gotta make sure there's
absolutely no risk.

667
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,229
- Well, so what did they find
out?
- Nothing.

668
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,397
Place is clean.

669
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,565
The whole neighborhood is,
honestly.

670
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,066
- No! No no no!

671
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,469
What about the drive-by shooting
you were telling me about?

672
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,371
- ... I didn't file a report
on that.

673
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,174
- What do you mean you didn't
file a report?

674
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,876
Guy fired a gun out of a
moving car!

675
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:09,613
- Nobody got shot. I didn't
solve it. Seemed like a waste
of time.

676
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,015
- W- you can't just not file
reports, can you?

677
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,551
- I rarely file reports...

678
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,020
- Jesus Chr- You are the
worst cop in the world.

679
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,389
- Well fuck off, dude!
Honestly, I try my hardest,

680
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,558
and if you think about what I
do every day, it's insane.

681
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360
- Aah!
- Aw, the safety's on!

682
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,495
Calm down!

683
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,963
The safety's on!

684
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,732
Oh god, the safety's off.

685
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,868
I gotta snap it in.

686
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,036
It's such an easy thing and I
forget to do it.

687
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,442
- This is unbelievable.

688
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,544
Seriously, you know, this is
what I get for being a good
guy.

689
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,379
It's what I get for opening
the doors for people

690
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,548
and living a moral life.

691
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,849
I get shit on.

692
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,484
Get- I get the only place
that feels like home

693
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,086
taken away from me.

694
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,356
Thanks world! Thanks a whole
fucking lot!

695
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,193
- Are you talking to me?

696
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,728
- I was talking to the world!

697
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,930
- World, yeah... just, yep. I
get it now.

698
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,636
Becca's here.

699
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,006
- Okay... okay. If she's
gonna see you in that thing

700
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,275
you might as well get pumped
up. Get some veins showin',
alright?

701
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,342
- Oh make myself look bigger?

702
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,710
- Yes! Go!
- Okay.

703
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,917
Alright... Come on, baby.

704
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,092
What am I doin'? That's not
gonna do anything.

705
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,446
That's it. That's it.

706
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,982
- Aah! Ah!

707
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:52,950
Aagh!

708
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,852
Son of a... stop
spraying!

709
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,019
Aaah!

710
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,021
Come on! You- you kidding
me!?

711
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,456
Agh, come on.

712
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,724
Oh fuck!

713
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:01,859
Ugh.

714
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,794
Jesus Christ.

715
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,101
... One paper...

716
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,543
- Oh!
- Oh god... really?

717
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,013
- Jesus, are you- are you
okay?

718
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,014
- Ey... yeah.

719
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,352
This... yeah, yeah. W- I was
just, um...

720
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,555
I should probably go... tell
em.

721
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:32,956
- Yeah, it's probably a-
probably a good idea.

722
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,058
- Uh, the pizza place has a
bathroom next door.

723
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,294
- No, it's fine, I just
wanted to wash my hands.

724
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,496
- Oh, cool. The sink still
works.

725
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,898
- Actually I do have to go...

726
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,499
I just said I didn't cuz I
don't like guys to know

727
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,501
that
pee comes out of me.

728
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,603
But it does... all the
time...

729
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,072
In fact, that's a lot of
information. I'm sorry.

730
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,842
- No, that's healthy. Pee
should always c- I'm totally
cool

731
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:53,510
with anything that c-...
that- that comes outta you.

732
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,178
- Okay, I just said pee,
let's not go crazy.

733
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,348
- I'm sorry... I just worked
out so my head get a little
blblblble.

734
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,851
- Yeah? You work out near
here?

735
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:03,053
- Uh, yeah, yeah, it's- it's
right on the corner actually.

736
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,721
Yeah, the... my gym.

737
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,258
- Wait... Isn't that a place
for toddlers?

738
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,295
- ... yep.

739
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,131
And that's where I work out.

740
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,300
- That's sweet.

741
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,502
- Here take this key, okay?
It's for the pizza place
bathroom.

742
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,338
They always keep theirs
locked to a deep-dish pan

743
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,372
cuz people keep stealing it.

744
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,874
- Like yourself.

745
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,542
- Yeah, I guess I'm one of
those people.

746
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,544
- Well, thanks. This is very
sweet.

747
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,180
- Any- any time, though.

748
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,215
- Alright...
- Okay.

749
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,117
See ya, have fun!

750
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,387
What does have fun mean?

751
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,190
- Brilliant... Okay?

752
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,559
Now, when she returns the
key... you make your move.

753
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,527
- Yep!

754
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:44,528
- Hey, you wanna hold my gun?

755
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,495
- I'm not gonna shoot her.

756
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,465
It's to create a subliminal
feeling of fear,

757
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,366
moisten her up a little bit.

758
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,735
- I'm good.
- Oh, are you?

759
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,404
Okay, so you're gonna stick
with the old soaked in toilet
water method?

760
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,173
- Yeah, I'm gonna ride that
one out.

761
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,374
- Okay, saddle up.

762
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,343
- What the hell?

763
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,344
Where's she goin'?

764
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,445
Is she stealing my key?

765
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,313
- I can go arrest her for it,

766
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,616
but she's gonna wanna fuck me
the second I slam her face on
that hood.

767
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,918
- Yeah. Who wouldn't?

768
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,288
She's stealing my stolen key!

769
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,856
- Definitely not a
poop-chipper.

770
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,062
- I don't know if it was
my fear of losing Coffee Town,

771
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,465
or finding out my dream
girl was a thief

772
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,233
with pee coming out of
her...

773
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,402
... or that my new roommate
thought it would be okay

774
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:29,673
to decorate my apartment like
Lord of the Rings exploded
in it.

775
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,443
- Hey! Can you cook game in
this fireplace?

776
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,650
- But it was starting to
feel like everything was
slipping away.

777
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,486
Like all my years of
responsible living

778
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:46,490
had earned me nothing but
fate's cold hands around my
neck.

779
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,125
- Join me!

780
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,566
- And you wanna do
something dramatic...

781
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,801
...and Elvis-y...

782
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,270
like shooting out your
T.V. screen.

783
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,478
But... you settle for
something far less cool.

784
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,847
Like... turkey Lunchables.

785
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,549
- Hey Will.

786
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,151
- What the fuck!

787
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,018
What the fuck?

788
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:19,022
- I told you... I don't
sleep.

789
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,527
- Ugh!

790
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,897
Then... you decide to do
something to change it.

791
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,409
-Hey...

792
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,211
What's with all the medicine?

793
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,647
- Oh! ... I have AIDS.

794
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,615
Yeah... I hope that's cool.

795
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,586
Oh! Aw shit, that's gonna
bleed.

796
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,222
- You can keep it.

797
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,861
- And when it works... You
don't wanna stop.

798
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,362
I'm gonna rob this place.

799
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,733
- What?

800
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,872
- If I created a crime
that scared the executives
away

801
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,841
from converting this store...

802
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,209
I'm gonna plan a robbery.

803
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:15,145
- Hey. Are you serious? I'm a
cop!

804
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,615
If anyone's gonna plan a
robbery it should be me.

805
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,118
I have studied this shit.

806
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,453
- Okay.
- Alright, but I only wanna
cause a crime.

807
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,122
I don't wanna take any money

808
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,523
- I am in...

809
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,724
But let's take some money.

810
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,460
- Then we're literally
robbing it...

811
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,661
- We'll just take a little.

812
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,530
- Still robbing.

813
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,132
- You're right. We'll just
take some merchandise and
shit.

814
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:38,502
I have had my eyes on one of
those hoodies.

815
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:39,703
- Do you know what robbing
is?

816
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,973
- Yeah! Charging 35 dollars
for a hoodie.

817
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,407
- I'm gonna tell you your
biggest issue right off the
bat,

818
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,676
this place is all glass. It's
like we're in a fishbowl,

819
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:49,045
and there's constant traffic
on that street.

820
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,313
- Okay, true.

821
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,681
- So let's brainstorm about
that tonight.

822
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,717
We'll have our first planning
session tomorrow.

823
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,886
- Okay, where are we gonna
go?

824
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,488
- Here...
- You son of a bitch

825
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,690
- We're planning
a robbery of Coffee Town

826
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,360
inside Coffee Town.

827
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,095
- This is my office.

828
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,383
- Tomorrow.

829
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,186
- Okay.

830
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,188
Time to smoke.

831
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,324
- What's that do?

832
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,525
- I dunno.

833
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,361
- Yes, yes, yes... yes, yes.

834
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,363
- Hey.

835
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,465
I, uh, I forgot to give this
back to you yesterday.

836
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:46,169
- Oh! Wow, I didn't even
realize.

837
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:47,204
- You didn't?

838
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,641
- No... no, I did... I lied
just then.

839
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,143
I don't know why.

840
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:54,344
- Okay.

841
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,879
Well, um...

842
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,250
Thanks again.

843
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,553
- No, thank you

844
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,023
- Okay.

845
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,728
- No, thank you!?

846
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,398
You're trying to bone her,
not get her to join your youth
group.

847
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,300
- Why did you shove me?
You threw me off!

848
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,002
- You gotta get in her space,
threaten her a little bit.

849
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,537
Do you know anything about
women?

850
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,673
- Apparently not is right.
I'm sorry I yelled.

851
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,508
Listen... When she's done
ordering,

852
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,410
she's gonna be standing right
there, totally bored.

853
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,713
That's when you go up and you
ask her out.

854
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:30,814
- Okay.
- Okay.

855
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,916
- That sounds doable.
- Yeah, it's good.

856
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,620
But don't stare at her. Now
you look like a serial killer.

857
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:37,887
-R- right.

858
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,557
- And don't look in my eyes.
Why would you do that?

859
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,625
That's so weird.

860
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,392
-What do... What am I
supposed to--

861
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,360
- What you normally do.

862
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,761
Look at your computer.

863
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,464
Open your computer.
- Open the computer.

864
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,366
- Why would you look at a
closed computer?

865
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,469
- You don't mind if I smoke,
do you?

866
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,470
- No.

867
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,410
Newports, huh?

868
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,978
- Mm hmm.

869
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,814
Menthol.

870
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,287
I can feel these turning my
insides black.

871
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,523
Blacky black black.

872
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,459
It's worth it, though...

873
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,961
...don't have to work as
hard.

874
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,199
You know this used to be
Brown Town.

875
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,368
- Okay okay okay, now's your
time. Ready?

876
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,803
- Now?
- Go get her, this is big.

877
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,570
Go baby, you got this. Go get
her.

878
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:31,241
- Okay...
- Okay.

879
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,176
- Hello again.
- Hey.

880
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,579
- Hey. Uuh... So, I was just
wondering...

881
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,849
- Sorry, I forgot, did you
want, uh, whipped cream?

882
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,217
- Yeah, sure, thanks.

883
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,728
- There you go.
- Wow... thank you.

884
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,163
- Hey, before I forget, um,

885
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,998
my band and I are playing at
the Vanguard tonight,

886
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,466
and it is going to rock.

887
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,369
- Yeah, I'm gonna be there.
I'm gonna bring some old
college friends.

888
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,870
- Nice!

889
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,073
- you know, you guys don't
freak out or anything, but...

890
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:05,208
... I may dedicate a song to
you tonight.

891
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,443
- Oh!

892
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,080
♪ The way a little
kitten purrs

893
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,816
♪ that's the way my
passion stirs

894
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:17,454
♪ stirs for you, stirs
for me, that's all that I
can--

895
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,388
No?
- Uh...

896
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,557
♪ Stirs my soul

897
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,359
♪ as far as I can see

898
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,863
Stir. It's track three. It's
from the... it's... I gave it
to you.

899
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,298
- Ah... Right.

900
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,499
- You may not have heard-
maybe you didn't hear it yet.

901
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:30,533
- Not yet.
- It's alright.

902
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,135
You will, I mean- hopefully,
maybe.

903
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:36,373
That was just a little
amuse-bouche to the main
course later.

904
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,941
- Alright.

905
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,844
I'm sorry, what were you
saying?

906
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,479
- Was I... say- ...

907
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:45,281
Oh... No, no no no no... No.

908
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,152
- You know, I... I have to
go.

909
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:50,053
- Yeah!
- Alright.

910
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,388
- I was just gettin' a straw.

911
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,960
- What'd she say?

912
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,462
- You got up from our table?
- Yeah.

913
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,400
- Mother fucker!

914
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,835
It's amazing how much
disdain you can have

915
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,337
for people hogging the
tables

916
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:09,739
when your intention is to
do the same.

917
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,976
And since the outside
tables smell like Chad's
cigarettes,

918
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:16,513
the couch is the only
remaining option.

919
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,383
The problem with that is
my laptop seems to be powered

920
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,352
by some type of car
engine,

921
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,121
burning the ever-loving
hell out of my lap.

922
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,466
- Did you see the newspaper?

923
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,205
- Nope.

924
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,523
- Get on the ground and put
your hands on your head

925
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,893
or I'll shoot you in your
face, mother fucker!

926
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,028
- Hey.
- Hey.

927
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,363
- I'm not talking to you on
that thing.

928
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,499
- C'mon man it's like you're
talking to lightning mcqueen.

929
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,201
- Lightning McQueen was not a
police car.

930
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,502
- Are you sure? Which one was
the police car?

931
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:13,369
- I don't know.

932
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,838
- Neither do I. All I
remember

933
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,573
is that hillbilly tow truck
with the fucked up teeth.

934
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:19,042
And he'd be like "hey y'all!"

935
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:19,976
- Hey, I'm gonna go.

936
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,744
- No no no, stop.
- C'mon, man.

937
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,079
- Stop.

938
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,581
Look at me...

939
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,883
Where ya headed?

940
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,384
- I'm gonna go home, I'm
gonna eat some hot pockets,

941
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,385
and I'm gonna drink a
six-pack of beer.

942
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,387
- You're not gonna do that,
okay?

943
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,655
Cuz we're going to the
Vanguard.

944
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,890
- What?

945
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,492
- Yeah, Sam might be in a
band, who cares?

946
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:39,028
He's on stage, you're not,
giving you full access to
Becca.

947
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,333
And you can draft off the
very horniness his rock 'n' roll
creates.

948
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,502
Ride that airstream, just
slingshot by!

949
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:49,138
Right up into her cooch...
and stay there.

950
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,474
- You think?
- I never lie when I'm on
duty.

951
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,843
Alright? Pick up those beers,
we'll bang em off in the car.

952
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,011
Ready?
- Okay.

953
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,246
You know you hit that wall,
right?

954
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:57,580
- Let's move it! Let's Go!

955
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,302
- There's something about
being in a rock band...

956
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,471
It doesn't matter how good
the music sounds...

957
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,707
You still look like a
total pussy playing the piano.

958
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,075
- Ladies and gentlemen!

959
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:29,612
Clap your hands for Mr. and
Mrs. Williams!

960
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,583
- Whoa... there she is.

961
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:34,651
- Where is this?

962
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,121
Woof!
- Hehe, woof.

963
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,525
Why is she talking to that
guy?

964
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,726
- It's perfect.

965
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,795
Get ready to bat some
cleanup.

966
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:46,829
- What?

967
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,364
- I dunno, it sounded like
something.

968
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,799
- There's some old
baseball a--

969
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,200
- I just went for it, who
cares,

970
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,536
I made a mistake. Go go go
go! Go go go.

971
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,852
Hey.

972
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:11,454
- Hey.
- Hey, stop it.

973
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:12,355
Let me get you a drink.

974
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:13,790
- Sure!
- Yeah?

975
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,292
Alright. Let me get a rum and
diet coke for the lady.

976
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,894
- Gino's move when he's
not in uniform...

977
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:21,364
subtly lower the girl's
self esteem to make her an
easier target.

978
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,633
- Do you want me to get you a
sturdier stool?

979
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,335
- Uh, No, this one's fine.

980
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,537
- This one can hold you? You
sure?

981
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,038
- Yeah, I think, it's okay.
- Yeah yeah yeah, go go go.

982
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,940
Please, please.

983
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,409
So, what happened to your
face?

984
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:42,652
- Hey!
- Ah, Hi! Hey!

985
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,387
- Hi!
- How are you?

986
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,389
- I'm good... Good. How are
you?

987
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,292
- Uh.. uh... I don't wanna be
weird or anything,

988
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,127
but that guy that you were
just making out with

989
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,363
is now... kissing your
friends.

990
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,232
- That guy? ...Oh,
no... no.

991
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:59,502
I was, um... I was taking E.

992
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,237
You know, ecstasy.

993
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,305
- Yeah...
- Yeah yeah.

994
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,373
He puts it on his tongue.

995
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,409
- Oh! That... that's clever.

996
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:07,543
- I'm not a drug person.

997
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,980
My girlfriend convinced me of
it, you know, and...

998
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,182
I'm usually really really
boring...

999
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,318
But... ahem...

1000
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,387
This is great!

1001
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,055
Like, WOW!

1002
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:20,390
You know, I'm really starting
to feel it!

1003
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:22,325
- Really?
- Yeah! Yeah.

1004
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,160
You should totally take a
hit.

1005
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,329
- Uh, no.. no no.
- Yes!

1006
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,864
Have you ever done it?

1007
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,200
- No, no, I- I- I'm really
more of a heroine guy.

1008
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:32,802
But I get mine in the
chewables...

1009
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:35,405
that looks like little, uh..
Kurt Cobains.

1010
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,407
- Come on, you gotta try
it... Come on.

1011
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,575
Can I get another one for my
friend?

1012
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,411
- Uh... yeah...

1013
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,346
Okay, so...

1014
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,415
- No, no... it's too risky.

1015
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,917
Oh, what the fff-

1016
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:51,654
- C'mon! Quick! Quick! C'mon!
You can do it. C'mon.

1017
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,423
- Shit, alright.

1018
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,471
Ugh! There's nothing in
there!

1019
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,474
I can't believe you went for
it, man.

1020
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,510
Mmyeah... you give great
mouth.

1021
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,412
Here ya go, huh?

1022
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,614
It's on the house.
- Come on

1023
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,054
- You know that guy has
AIDS...

1024
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,756
- Can't get it twice.

1025
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,161
- Okay, I hope this is worth
it.

1026
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,963
- Oh, it's totally worth it.

1027
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,199
- Is memory loss a
side-effect?

1028
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,935
- Nope... just death...

1029
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,410
- Turns out, except for
the moments

1030
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,545
when your heart feels like
it's gonna explode,

1031
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:53,182
Ecstasy is awesome.

1032
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:57,186
I don't know what it
looked like on that dance
floor...

1033
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,355
but I know what it felt
like...

1034
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,023
♪ Do you believe in
heaven above ♪

1035
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:04,527
Like the dance scene in
the 1986 movie "Rad".

1036
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,696
♪ Do you believe in

♪ Don't tell a lie, don't

1038
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,570
When love can only be
expressed with BMX freestyle.

1039
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:18,474

- And I actually do know
what it looked like...

1051
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,853
But who cares?

1052
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,087
It worked.

1053
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,530
Oh! Ooh, wait wait wait wait.

1054
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,399
- I know, I know it's crazy.
But I really want a memory.

1055
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:19,869
- Oh, I know, I know. I do
too. No no! Oh...

1056
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,738
-... Oh...

1057
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,241
Um...

1058
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,678
- It's from my laptop...
- It's okay.

1059
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,013
- It's a lap... top... burn.

1060
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,149
- Yep... I just, um...

1061
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:36,085
I don't think I'm in any
condition to do this anyway,

1062
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:37,520
I should- I should go.

1063
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,322
- Okay, wait, wait. It's not
what you think it is!

1064
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,356
No, look, listen listen
listen...

1065
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,290
I wanna- I wanna do this
again.

1066
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,458
- Totally, yeah, I'll call
you.

1067
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,093
- You don't have my number!

1068
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,563
- You're asleep.

1069
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,298
- No I'm not...

1070
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,366
I'm awake.

1071
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:55,004
Uugh, totally awake! I was
thinkin' about some stuff.

1072
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:56,906
Sleeping can get you
kicked out.

1073
00:47:56,908 --> 00:48:00,509
Being awake is the only
thing that separates us table
squatters

1074
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,478
from the homeless people
out front.

1075
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,648
That's good... good roast.

1076
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,185
- You know you ruined our gig
last night...

1077
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,722
with your little dance of the
drugged-out idiots.

1078
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,457
And now the club doesn't want
us back.

1079
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:15,625
- The reason the club doesn't
want you back

1080
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:17,493
is cuz your band sucks, Sam.

1081
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,961
I'm serious.

1082
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:21,297
Really, you're not Coldplay.
The whole tape on the fingers
thing?

1083
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:22,365
You look like gymnasts.

1084
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:23,699
- We're still finding our
sound, man.

1085
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,134
- Yeah, I saw you looking for
it.

1086
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,703
- And one, two

1087
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,472
No, no! God dammit, Devin!
Who comes in on three. man!?

1088
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:32,708
- I said what fucking
professional drummer comes in
on three!

1089
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,076
- What fucking professional
piano player

1090
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,578
wears a marching band jacket?
That's my question!

1091
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,747
- It's progressive, you
idiot!
- Asshole!

1092
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,148
- Whatever!

1093
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,218
- Alright, alright.

1094
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,019
We're done then!

1095
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,520
- Fuck you!

1096
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,589
- By the way, who's Mrs.
Williams?

1097
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,525
- Yeah yeah yeah, go refill
the half and half.

1098
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,060
- Why don't you go refill the
half and half.

1099
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:54,397
- I don't think I'm allowed
to refill the half and half,
am I?

1100
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,036
- Are you seriously saying
the half and half is empty?

1101
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:03,072
- Yeah.. the half and half is
empty.

1102
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,073
- Fuck!

1103
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:09,879
- Aaah, look at you!
Did you hook up last night?

1104
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:10,980
- I don't wanna talk about
it.

1105
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,848
- Okay, that's fine... can ya
mime it?

1106
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,350
- No.

1107
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,219
- Okay. you know, I could
beat it out of you. I'm a cop.

1108
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,554
- In a lethal weapon movie?

1109
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,122
- Fuck, I wish.

1110
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,458
- Where's Chad?

1111
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,260
- He's in line at the
bathroom.

1112
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,066
- It's been ten minutes, who
is this idiot?

1113
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,236
Oh...
- Retard.

1114
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,606
- What? ... Dammit.

1115
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,376
Anyone got a quarter?

1116
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:42,378
Pizza Castle token?

1117
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,213
- They let you drive that car
when you're off duty?

1118
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,514
- Only car I got, kid.

1119
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,416
- Yeah, but you don't got
it...

1120
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:48,517
It's owned by the city.

1121
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,488
- You totally struck out last
night, didn't you.

1122
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,991
- Yeah  look...

1123
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,561
My laptop burned
my dick.

1124
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:03,466
- I'm so sorry, I thought you
said that your laptop burned
your dick.

1125
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,301
- My laptop burned my dick.

1126
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:08,471
And I think she thought I
had, like a, sexual disease,
or...

1127
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:10,673
- That's a thing? Laptops can
burn dicks?

1128
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,541
- Yeah, apparently.
- Can I see it real quick?

1129
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,010
- No, you can't see it. What
are you doing, man?

1130
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,511
- I'll show you mine, it'll
be totally cool.

1131
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,346
- Oh, you show- Oh! that
changes everything.

1132
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,048
Yeah yeah yeah, let's do
that.

1133
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,182
Ow!

1134
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,650
Jesus Christ, dude. What are
you doing?

1135
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,252
- You really toasted that
thing, huh?

1136
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,987
- Yes, I really burned it.

1137
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,722
Stay away!

1138
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:30,693
- Think that Down syndrome
guy... just called me a
retard.

1139
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,862
- Are you serious? That's
messed up.

1140
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,897
- I think they're the only
ones who should be allowed to
say it.

1141
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,400
- I think I should be allowed
to say it, too.

1142
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:38,868
- I don't disagree.

1143
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,737
- Wait, are you calling me a
retard?

1144
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:44,040
- I'm not allowed to.

1145
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,876
- Guys? If you still wanna
hit this place,

1146
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,310
I think I figured out an
opening.

1147
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,645
- Yes, of course I do. Yes, I
do wanna hit it.

1148
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,547
What's- what's the deal?

1149
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:55,051
- This Friday night, the
street is being closed down
for traffic light repair,

1150
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,986
they're switchin' em over to
L.E.D. or some shit.

1151
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:57,720
- What?

1152
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,422
Who got that contract?

1153
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:01,657
Fucking G.E... Bob Horsewood,
I bet.

1154
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,526
- Who the fuck is Bob
Horsewood?

1155
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:04,693
- Fucking Bob Horsewood.

1156
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,662
- What the f--
- My nemesis, Bob Horsewood.

1157
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,564
- Would you shut up about Bob
Horsewood! Nobody--

1158
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,533
Just... Anyway.

1159
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,535
- Listen up. Utility
company's gonna be done with
the job

1160
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:13,836
by around midnight,

1161
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,372
but the barricades won't be
removed 'til 4 a.m.

1162
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:18,541
and that should give you guys
plenty of time to get in
there.

1163
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:21,744
- No no no, I can't. I have
to be on call.

1164
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,313
That way, if someone figures
it out and calls it in,

1165
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:27,383
I will be the first to
respond and you guys can just
bolt.

1166
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:28,517
- So how are we gonna do it?

1167
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,519
Just kick open the door,
grab all the cash?

1168
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:33,489
-Nobody's- We're not taking
any money, Chad.

1169
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,891
- I wanna take something. I
want a souvenir!

1170
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,059
- Are you a serial killer?

1171
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:38,627
- I'll serial kill Bob
Horsewood.

1172
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,963
- Chad, nobody's taking
anything, do you hear me?

1173
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,631
- Nobody's taking anything,
you just rough the place up
enough

1174
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,133
for someone to file a report.

1175
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:47,703
Anything more, some assholes
gonna wanna solve it. Also...

1176
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,673
You can't go in through the
front door cuz there's an
alarm on that thing.

1177
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:51,974
I'm trying to think of
different options in there.

1178
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,542
I'm looking at ceilings, I'm
looking at windows,

1179
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:55,644
I don't know yet, I'm gonna
report back tomorrow.

1180
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,814
- Good stuff, Gino, good
stuff. Very cool.

1181
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,484
- Hey, do you know what I was
just thinkin'?

1182
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:03,486
The Special Olympics are
great, right?

1183
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:04,854
- Yeah they are.
- I like em.

1184
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,489
- You know what would be even
more amazing?

1185
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:08,591
An ultimate fighting league
where challenged people

1186
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:09,825
fought non-challenged people.

1187
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,661
Because they're so strong, I
feel like it would be equal.

1188
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,397
-They are often very strong,
you're right about that.

1189
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:16,665
And if just one could win...

1190
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,534
- It'd be like Seabiscuit.

1191
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:22,037
- It wouldn't work. The
non-challenged person would
always win.

1192
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,506
- You don't know that, Chad.
You don't know that, K?

1193
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:25,708
So, don't say that, because
think about if it was even,

1194
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,376
how amazing that would be! A
level playing field!

1195
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:31,914
We have more speed, more
coordination, more agility.

1196
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,415
- Can I ask you a question
real quick, buddy?

1197
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,484
- Oooh geez...

1198
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,721
- Me?
- Yeah, you have
Down syndrome right?

1199
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:41,390
- Yes I do!

1200
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,159
- Hehe, okay, sure.

1201
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:45,528
Do you think a fight between
someone with Down syndrome

1202
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,729
and someone without Down
syndrome...

1203
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,630
Do you think that'd be fair?

1204
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:48,964
- Someone without?

1205
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,533
- Yeah, like, I dunno. Some
shmoe schmuck stupid ass

1206
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,834
like this guy.

1207
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,069
Like we're lookin' at this
guy, right over here.

1208
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:55,471
- I thought you said someone
without.

1209
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:59,008
- I don't have Down
syndrome... Just, F.Y.I.

1210
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,745
- Between you guys, do you
think that would be a fair
fight?

1211
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:05,047
- I could beat the living
shit out of this guy.

1212
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,416
- Yeah, sure you could, mm
hmm.

1213
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:11,086
- No, I think you could
too... I think you could too.

1214
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:14,256
- You honestly don't think I
could beat up a... a...

1215
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,293
- Say it.

1216
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,962
Say it!

1217
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,697
- Nevermind.

1218
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,732
- That's what I thought...
Retard!

1219
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,501
- Hey you're a retard!

1220
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,906
- You want a piece of me!?
- Is that what you want!?

1221
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:34,710
- C'mon... We're not really
gonna do this are we?

1222
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,912
- Yeah... I'm sick of people
like him.

1223
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,982
- I'm sick of people like
you!

1224
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,452
That sounded awful.

1225
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:44,887
I didn't mean that.

1226
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,355
- I'm going to kick your ass!

1227
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,891
- Oh yeah!? You gonna kick my
ass? Well bring it, bitch!

1228
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,392
- Hold on. hold on, hold on!
- Bring it bitch!

1229
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,860
- Hold on, hold on.

1230
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:55,364
Okay...
-Thank god, the police.

1231
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,366
- I just wanna say
congratulations, okay,

1232
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,667
on being the very first match

1233
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,803
of the special people versus
non-special people

1234
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,471
ultimate fighting
championship.

1235
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:03,839
Thank you guys so much, okay?

1236
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,007
Here are the ground rules,

1237
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,543
no punching, no eye-gouging,
no kicking...

1238
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:08,510
Just wresting.

1239
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,479
- Wait, I can't roundhouse
him?

1240
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,480
- You can't roundhouse
anybody, dude.

1241
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,982
You don't know how to
roundhouse.

1242
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:14,049
- I know how to roundhouse!

1243
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,751
- Fantastic. Roundhouse like
crazy.

1244
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,653
- What?
- He gets one special, okay?

1245
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,088
- This isn't Mortal Kombat.

1246
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,156
- Okay. You don't want a
special?

1247
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,692
- Uh...

1248
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,461
I indian burn.

1249
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,130
- You indian burn?
- Yeah.

1250
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,499
- You sure do.
Okay, you guys ready!?

1251
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,668
This is it! This is huge!

1252
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,469
Fight!

1253
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,571
- Ooh! Guess what!

1254
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:39,808
Regular people rule and
special people suck,
mother fucker!

1255
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,443
- Aaaah!!

1256
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,320
- Oh, OH!

1257
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,496
- Aaahh!
- Whoa!

1258
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,465
Oh my god!

1259
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,802
- Aaaahh!

1260
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,038
- Oh! Indian burn!

1261
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,406
- This is not funny.

1262
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:11,674
- No no no no no, it's
kinda...
- This is terrible.

1263
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:13,309
- Give it a second.

1264
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,477
- I gotta- I gotta stop this.
- No no no, sit down, sit
down.

1265
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,246
- Tap out! Tap out!

1266
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,715
- Yyeeaahh!
- That's a tap out!

1267
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,418
- Boom! That's, it bitch!

1268
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,090
- He's got Down syndrome
asshole!

1269
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,629
- Bitch.

1270
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:35,731
- See you guys.

1271
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:37,566
- Alright, buddy, be good.
- Later.

1272
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,401
- Chad, I'll give you a ride.

1273
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,441
- Can I smoke back here?
- Yeah, I don't care.

1274
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,150
- Wait, hey! Hey, gimme that!

1275
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:56,752
- There you go, you earned
it.
- Thanks.

1276
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:58,053
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1277
00:55:58,055 --> 00:55:59,588
- Thank you so much Mr.
Brown.

1278
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,157
That- that's great. Okay,
bye-bye.

1279
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,495
Okay, it is down to us and
the Coffee Town in Fullerton.

1280
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,130
We got this!

1281
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:11,066
- It was happening. You
could see it on their faces.

1282
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,535
- DJ station back here maybe?
I dunno if these people--

1283
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,238
- And Coffee Town wasn't
the only thing slipping away.

1284
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,076
Oh.
- What?

1285
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,712
- She's gonna stop coming in
here.

1286
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,414
I don't have her phone
number, I don't know her last
name,

1287
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,449
I don't know anything about
her.

1288
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,485
I gotta catch her.

1289
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:32,921
- You can use my bike!
- Okay, thanks!

- Hey.. hi... hey.

1301
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:27,376
- I'm sorry, did you just
chase me down on an adult
tricycle?

1302
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:32,314
- Listen... that was a laptop
burn! Okay?

1303
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,585
Hey.
- Hey.

1304
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:37,653
- Sorry...

1305
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:44,159
- I know... I asked a doctor
in the E.R. this morning.

1306
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,929
Apparently it's fairly
common.

1307
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,197
- e.r.?

1308
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:49,665
- I'm a- I'm a trauma nurse.

1309
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:55,337
-Oh you're... a trauma
nurse... Cool.

1310
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:56,371
- Okay.
- Oh, wait wait wait,

1311
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:59,107
Becca Becca Becca... Let me
j--

1312
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,544
It's... it's okay if you're
not into me.

1313
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:05,514
Really... I wouldn't be into
me either.

1314
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:07,382
I just don't want you to feel
weird about coming into Coffee
Town.

1315
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:10,786
I mean... you've been going
there longer than I have.

1316
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,024
- Last night... that wasn't
me...

1317
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:18,494
Yeah, the- the drugs...

1318
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:21,997
Almost having sex with
somebody I barely know.

1319
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,298
It's just not who I am.

1320
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,535
- No, no no. Listen, that's
not me either.

1321
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:29,671
Seriously I don't just... go
out to clubs and take ecstasy,
and...

1322
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:34,409
kiss guys, and, you know,
show women my blistered penis.

1323
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:36,512
Seriously, I- I don't do that
stuff, okay?

1324
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,380
I'm a nice guy... really...

1325
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:40,849
Sometimes I think I'm too
nice.

1326
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,419
- You son of a bitch!

1327
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:48,056
You think it's funny to steal
an old man's bike!?

1328
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:51,627
I fought a fucking war for
you!

1329
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,633
- Sorry... sorry...

1330
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:02,538
I thought it was, uh...
different...

1331
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,307
Can I get a ride?

1332
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,543
- Yeah, get in.

1333
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,553
- Thanks for the ride.
- Of course.

1334
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:20,556
- Hey... That one's mine.

1335
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,724
- Got it.
- Cool.

1336
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,795
Later homesnap.
- Okay, bye.

1337
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,265
Do you have time for a
coffee?

1338
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1339
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:35,404
- I think I have a second.
- Ah, good.

1340
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,405
- I'll get my own, though.

1341
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:40,742
- Uh, no, actually, here. Let
me get it.

1342
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,477
I need this.

1343
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,582
-Hey...

1344
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,917
- Yup?
- Yeah, um,

1345
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,587
let me get a soy latte...
uuh...

1346
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,823
and why don't you go ahead
and add a bunch of extra whip
to that.

1347
00:59:58,695 --> 00:59:59,895
- Name?

1348
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,465
- Becca.

1349
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,303
-No.

1350
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,943
- Why don't you write a
shitty song about that.

1351
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:19,047
So... trauma nurse.

1352
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,483
- Yep!
- Wow. That's gotta be tough.

1353
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:23,885
- Hell, I love it. I mean...

1354
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,253
the thing about trauma...

1355
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,889
is that... it's always total
chaos.

1356
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,592
So, I mean, you get to be a
doctor half the time.

1357
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:35,063
The lines really get blurred,
which, I mean, I love.

1358
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:35,931
- I never thought about it
that way.

1359
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,833
- Yeah. It's a total rush.

1360
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:40,902
What about you? I mean you-
you really work out of this
place?

1361
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:44,406
- Yeah, it's- it's not saving
lives without a medical
degree, but-

1362
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,541
- I don't usually save them.

1363
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,377
- Are you serious?

1364
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,914
- I mean why- why work here?

1365
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,084
- Look, honestly, um...

1366
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,456
I think I just... like being
part of the world.

1367
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,628
Feeling like I exist
somewhere.

1368
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,732
This is gonna sound really
stupid, but...

1369
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,937
I think if I worked out of my
apartment...

1370
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,776
The world might forget
who I am.

1371
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,648
- Doesn't sound stupid at
all.

1372
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:29,184
- That's what I was about
to lose.

1373
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:34,389
Not a place for free
wi-fi, or to meet friends, or
outwit the economy.

1374
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:37,526
Coffee Town was a place to
belong.

1375
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:41,063
That's something everybody
needs in life.

1376
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:42,831
An intersection.

1377
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,566
A place to meet with the
rest of the world

1378
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,501
on the way to wherever
you're headed.

1379
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:50,972
Because let's face it,
we're all headed the same
place.

1380
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,547
So they're closing the street
tonight?

1381
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:00,515
- I'm sorry, dude, I tried my
hardest, okay?

1382
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,384
They must have moved the work
order up.

1383
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,387
Traffic is back in the street
at 9 p.m. tonight.

1384
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,492
- Do we still have a window
at midnight?

1385
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:12,561
- I don't think it's a good
idea.
- Why?

1386
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,329
- Because before we were
doing a Friday night, right?

1387
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:17,265
Cops would be busier all over
the place, busting drunk
drivers and shit.

1388
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:19,868
This is Tuesday.
Cops are bored on Tuesday.

1389
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,004
Someone calls this thing in,
the entire force is gonna show
up.

1390
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:27,709
- I don't care... I'm goin'
in. Are you gonna be on shift?

1391
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,344
- Yeah.

1392
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:31,646
- I'm in too. I could really
use the cash.

1393
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,849
- Chad...
- Chad, god dammit...

1394
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,917
- You have any idea how
expensive cigarettes are?

1395
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:36,918
- We are not taking any cash.

1396
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,720
- Nobody's taking fucking
money!

1397
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,390
- Just... Did you come up
with a plan?

1398
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:43,558
- Are we really doing this?

1399
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,093
- Yes, we're doing this.
- We're doing this.

1400
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,094
- Stop it.

1401
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,396
Alright guys.

1402
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:49,731
- Whoa whoa whoa. Hey, just
be careful.

1403
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:50,832
- Best way to stay under the
radar

1404
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:52,501
is to shut the shit off in
plain sight.

1405
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:53,702
- But how did you do that?

1406
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:55,670
- I got some guys at the
crime unit to draw it up.

1407
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:58,173
They thought it was for a
drug raid. Fuckin' idiots.

1408
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,477
Alright. You guys'll be these
sugars right here.

1409
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,546
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa, can I
be the Sugar in the Raw,

1410
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:07,015
because I'm sort of the
badass of the group.

1411
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,216
- Says who?

1412
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,484
- Well, you're not the badass
of the group.

1413
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,319
- I didn't say I was the
badass.

1414
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:12,387
- Then that's a weak group.

1415
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:13,655
- You guys are both creamers.

1416
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:14,723
- Now we're both creamers.

1417
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:16,191
- Yeah, well, cuz you
wouldn't shut up.

1418
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:16,992
- One of us could have been
the Sugar in the Raw--

1419
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,426
- Stop it!

1420
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,028
- I don't care if I'm a
creamer. Why are we talking
about this?

1421
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,329
What's the plan?

1422
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,999
- First, we prep the target
for a 1 a.m. strike.

1423
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,403
Which means you gotta get
that homeless guy at 10 p.m.

1424
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,939
Throw him a tall boy with
roofies in it.

1425
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,409
That'll knock him the fuck
out.

1426
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,645
That takes care of the only
witness.

1427
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:39,347
After that both of you guys,
at 1 a.m.,

1428
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,384
will go across to the back of
the store.

1429
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:43,819
You'll find a utility ladder,

1430
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,987
and that will give you access
to the roof.

1431
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,232
That is where you will wait
for my radio confirmation.

1432
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:58,600
Chad, what did I just say?

1433
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,535
- I- I wasn't listening.

1434
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:01,837
- You weren't li--

1435
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,071
- I was playing with the
Sugar in the Raw.

1436
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:05,407
- Stop.
- I'm gonna move all the
sugars away.

1437
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,541
All the sugars are away from
you now, okay?

1438
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:09,010
- This- this is important. We
could go to jail.

1439
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,580
- Okay, sorry. I'll- I'll
close my eyes and just
concentrate.

1440
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:12,547
- That's fine. Can you hear
me better now?

1441
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:13,982
- Mm hmm.
- Fantastic.

1442
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:16,885
- It's like Stevie Wonder,
how he- he has dog hearing.

1443
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,186
- He doesn't have dog
hearing. Dog hearing--

1444
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,921
- Stevie Wonder does have dog
hearing.

1445
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,056
- What?

1446
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:22,057
- Are you gonna close your
eyes too, or--

1447
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:22,858
- No, he doesn't have to.
- Okay.

1448
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,492
- Chad?
- Go.

1449
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,228
- That's when you're gonna
wait for my radio
confirmation.

1450
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,362
What are you gonna do?

1451
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,396
- Wait for your radio
confirmation.

1452
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,498
All clear.

1453
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,733
Next you're gonna take the
bolt cutter.

1454
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:33,902
Cut that padlock that's on
the hatch.

1455
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:37,505
There is absolutely no alarm
on it. You'll be safe.

1456
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,841
Once you're down, you have
about five minutes.

1457
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,710
Open the cash, like, throw it
around a little bit.

1458
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,246
Rough the place up enough to
look like you were doing a
robbery,

1459
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:47,048
but you got interrupted in
the process, and you had to
jet.

1460
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:53,321
That's when you go right back
up through that hatch. K?

1461
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:54,356
That's the plan.

1462
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:56,391
- OK, I'm gonna open my eyes
now.

1463
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,193
- Nice.
- Nice.

1464
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:00,595
- So when we're finished we
just split the money, 33, 33--

1465
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:02,330
- Oh my god!
- Holy shit, Chad.

1466
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:03,431
Holy shit, Chad.

1467
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,400
-Chad, if you take something
from this place,

1468
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,601
I'll kill you.

1469
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,970
- Oh that's... very Sugar in
the Raw of you.

1470
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:10,906
- Chad, stop, stop.

1471
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:13,041
You're not gonna take any
money, right Chad?

1472
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:14,075
- My lips are zipped.

1473
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,977
- You said this whole thing
is a secret!

1474
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:17,212
It's out in the open, it's
a secret--

1475
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:18,246
- That's fine, that's fine.

1476
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:21,516
Just tell me you're not gonna
take any money.

1477
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:22,918
Don't cover your eyes! Don't
cover your eyes.

1478
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,920
- It's got nothing to do with
that.
- Don't cover your eyes.

1479
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:26,421
Just say you're not gonna ta-
Watch this.

1480
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,722
Will, are you gonna take any
money?

1481
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,491
- I promise I'm not taking
any money.

1482
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:30,558
- Chad, are you gonna take
any money?

1483
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,826
- Okay, whatever.
- Don't take your hands.

1484
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:32,928
Promise you're not gonna take
any money.

1485
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:33,828
- I promise I
won't take any money.

1486
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,397
- Thank you. Do you swear?

1487
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,598
- I- I swear.

1488
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,532
- Okay, that's it.

1489
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:42,103
which I will fax over to
Coffee Town corporate office.

1490
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,471
We did it, guys.

1491
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,974
- Alright, so, we'll meet
here at 1 a.m.

1492
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,976
Alright, got it? 1 a.m.!
- Mm hmm.

1493
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:51,746
- 1 a.m.? That's late. You
guys stay up that late?

1494
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,882
- Hey!
- Hey, buddy! What's up?

1495
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:55,083
- Oh!

1496
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:57,385
- Okay, yeah. We reuse paper
at the station.

1497
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:58,420
- Good, good.

1498
01:05:58,422 --> 01:05:59,754
- I don't stay up that late.

1499
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,656
- No, normally we don't
either, it's just a...

1500
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:03,258
special occasion.

1501
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,493
Special occasion comin' up.
- We're havin' a party.

1502
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,795
- Chad.
- Chad, yeah.

1503
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:08,663
- It's your birthday?
- No.

1504
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,332
- Yep!
- Yes.

1505
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:11,700
- Yeah yeah. I'm 56.

1506
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:12,767
- 56.
- How 'bout that.

1507
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:15,537
- 56 already 56.
- You wouldn't think.

1508
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,372

1516
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:51,139

1517
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:52,240
- 56.

1518
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,547
- I left Coffee Town
early.

1519
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,317
Too nervous about that
night to let Becca see me.

1520
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,321
Instead, I sat at the
park.

1521
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,923
The thought of a future in
prison

1522
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:12,227
made an afternoon with
nature seem pretty nice.

1523
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:18,433
But, it turned out to be
more like prison than nature.

1524
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:24,472
And finally... the time
had come to put our plan in
motion.

1525
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,650
And things started off
flawlessly.

1526
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,754
Shit.

1527
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,058
Hey pal... hey buddy...

1528
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,627
Wake up, I got some beer for
ya. Want some beer?

1529
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,166
- Ya! Don't kill me! Don't
kill me!
- Oh, whoa whoa.

1530
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,867
Hey, I was just trying to
give you some beer.

1531
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:55,403
Hey hey! Calm down, calm
down, man. Shh shhhh.

1532
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,504
Just trying to give you some
beer, man.

1533
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:57,672
You look thirsty... oh...

1534
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,510
Okay, ok ok ok,
listen, I'll make it up to
you, um...

1535
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,079
Let me put you up in a hotel
for the night.

1536
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:06,481
- Naw, I don't sleep in
hotels.

1537
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,249
Bed bugs.

1538
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,190
- Okay, so, here we are. Um.

1539
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:18,860
I've got some plans tonight,
but you can sleep on the
couch.

1540
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:22,697
- I don't sleep on couches...
couch bugs.

1541
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:25,400
- Couch bugs? What the hell's
a couch bug?

1542
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,434
Where ya goin'?

1543
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,269
Oh come on, man.

1544
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,705
Dude, oh...

1545
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:33,508
No no, c'mon, that's my bed!

1546
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,311
Aw fuck!

1547
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:37,979
Chad.

1548
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,218
Chad!

1549
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:46,087
- I'm gonna kill you mother
fucker!

1550
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:48,189
- Shut the fuck up! Shut the
fuck up.

1551
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:49,757
Don't do that, man. That's
not cool.

1552
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,060
- Look, it's me. It's Chad!

1553
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:54,596
- Yeah, I know it's you. Nice
kitty shirt.

1554
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,064
- I look awesome, huh?
- Yeah.

1555
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:58,600
- I just wish I had some
black paint around my eyes,

1556
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:00,502
you know, like, uh, like
Batman.

1557
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:04,072
Isn't that weird...that
Batman wears makeup?

1558
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:06,207
You know, like, you go out
and you kick ass all night.

1559
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:07,542
You come home, take off your
cowl,

1560
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,077
and you're just a dude in
eyeshadow.

1561
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:10,578
- This is a very interesting
conversation, Chad,

1562
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,813
can we have it later?

1563
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,915
- Okay, like, tomorrow?

1564
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,684
- Yeah, tomorrow. We'll have
it tomorrow.

1565
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:17,685
Where's my mask? C'mon.

1566
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:19,654
- Ah, I only had one, dude.

1567
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,357
- You were supposed to bring
the disguises.

1568
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,159
- I made you this!

1569
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:26,394
- That's a sock.

1570
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:27,695
- It'll stretch.

1571
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,397
- I'm not concerned about the
fit!

1572
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,733
- This is not a fashion show,
mother fucker!

1573
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:33,668
We are knockin' over a coffee
store!

1574
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,036
- Alright alright, don't say
"knocking over"

1575
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:37,071
or you make us sound like thugs.
- I wanna be a thug!

1576
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:40,308
I didn't load up my iPhone
with Kanye just so I could go
jogging.

1577
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,810
Oh crap, the one with
Rihanna's on.

1578
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,379
- Oh, fuck.
- That one is for jogging.

1579
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:47,515
Okay, great. You know what?
I'm doing this by myself.

1580
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:50,919
- No! We are in this
together.

1581
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,888
Now put your sock on.

1582
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:00,662
- It's a sock.

1583
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:03,898
- It's just a sock.
- Really.... god.

1584
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,000
Jesus Christ.

1585
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,238
You didn't make me a mouth
hole?

1586
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,406
- You're not gonna eat in it!

1587
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,543
- Oh, you look like that
rabbit from "Life in Hell".

1588
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,179
You know, the- the rabbit...
from the Simpsons guy.

1589
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:20,748
- Will you just shut the fuck
up!? Just shut the fuck up.

1590
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,483
- I'm just sayin' who you
look like.

1591
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,604
- Are you guys in
position yet?

1592
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:44,105
- What the fuck is that?

1593
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,507
- It's Gino, we only had
Spiderman walkie talkies

1594
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,209
so he sounds like the Green
Goblin.

1595
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:50,511
-So, we gotta talk to each
other like Green Goblin all
night?

1596
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:51,579
- No. Just him.

1597
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,548
- You guys sound like
Spiderman.

1598
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,483
- Why aren't we just using
our cellphones?

1599
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:59,220
- Why don't we just use our
cellphones?

1600
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,760
- Hello?
- Yeah, this is way better.

1601
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,495
Keep it on vibrate, though.

1602
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:08,563
- Okay, fine.

1603
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:09,897
- Why do you sound so weird?

1604
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,766
- Chad didn't cut me out a
mouth hole.

1605
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,435
- Why do you need a mouth
hole? You're not gonna eat in
it.

1606
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,504
- Oh come- come on, what's
the deal?

1607
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:17,705
- The street is clear.

1608
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:18,940
You guys can go in.

1609
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,008
- Copy that. Goin' in.

1610
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,342
- Goin' in?
- Goin' in!

1611
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:23,745
- Okay, wait. I'm gonna put
on the 8 Mile soundtrack.

1612
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:25,079
- Don't put anything on,
Chad!

1613
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,814
- Those are- what are you- oh
fuck!

1614
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,416
Those are my headphones!

1615
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:30,985
- I need you listening! Now
go! you've got the rope, so
go.

1616
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:33,087
- Okay. Go time.

1617
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,958
Oh... What the hell?

1618
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:42,096
God dammit... ugh!

1619
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:45,600
- Why aren't you wearing...
This was on your foot!?

1620
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,502
- It's clean!
- No it's not clean, Chad,

1621
01:11:47,504 --> 01:11:49,837
if it came off your foot.
Because it was on your foot!

1622
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:52,206
- I barely walked anywhere
today.

1623
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:55,910
- You wore it all day!?
Jesus Christ!

1624
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,979
- Now this other sock is
worthless!

1625
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:01,349
- I'm wearin' this.
-No.

1626
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:02,717
- Come here you mother
fucker.

1627
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,153
- You mother fucker!
- You mother fucker!

1628
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:06,487
- Get back here!
- You asshole!

1629
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,189
- We shouldn't me fighting
amongst ourselves!

1630
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,525
This is what they want! This
is what they want!

1631
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,500
- Sorry.

1632
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,246
- What the fuck are you
doing? Just go around!

1633
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,157
- Dude!

1634
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,595
It's just a bear.

1635
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:48,996
- Sorry, okay.

1636
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:53,601
- What?

1637
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,937
- The cash register's open
and empty!

1638
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:56,804
- What!?

1639
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,546
- Holy shit!

1640
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,582
- We gotta go, we gotta go!

1641
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:26,167
- We're gonna go to prison!
Fuck.

1642
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:28,569
- Please stop holding my
hand.

1643
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:45,586
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

1644
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,494
- Aaaah!
- Aah! Aah! Aah!!

1645
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:55,430
- Don't hit us! it's us!

1646
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:58,399
Please Sam, Sam, Sam! It's
us! It's us! It's us.

1647
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:03,404
- What are you- what are you
doing?

1648
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:04,739
- What are you do--

1649
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:06,741
You're robbing the store?

1650
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:08,075
- So are you!

1651
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,645
- No no no, we were just
pretending to rob the store.

1652
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:11,979
- What!?
- It's complicated.

1653
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:14,315
Look look look, let's just
split the cash.

1654
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:16,484
- We're not taking any cash!

1655
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:17,685
- He's taking cash!

1656
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:20,221
- I have to, okay? Thanks to
dick-head here,

1657
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:21,589
my band lost our gig.
- Oh pff.

1658
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,724
- You think I could survive
on shitty Coffee Town tips
alone?

1659
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:25,993
- Well, you would be able to
if you'd stop looking away

1660
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,495
every single time somebody
tries to tip you!

1661
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,897
- It's cuz it makes me feel
like a whore!

1662
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:31,399
- Well then, get a different
job!

1663
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,234
- I had another job. You made
me lose it!

1664
01:14:33,236 --> 01:14:36,170
- Oh psh, yeah right. You
think U2 would lose a gig

1665
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:37,538
just because somebody danced
weird?

1666
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,208
No. Because they're a good
band, Sam.

1667
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,277
You wrote a fuckin' song
about cappuccino foam.

1668
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,580
- It's about Becca!

1669
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:47,181
- How is that about Becca?

1670
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:51,652
- She's the stirrer... and my
heart is the foam...

1671
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,387
Whatever, man, you know what,
let's just get out of here.

1672
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:54,755
Okay? I'll put the money
back.

1673
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,094
- Hey!

1674
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:01,429
- Oh no, he's gonna set off
the alarm.

1675
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:02,597
- No no, Toby! No no!

1676
01:15:03,533 --> 01:15:05,099
- Run!
- Oh fuck fuck!

1677
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:07,535
What are you doing? What are
you doing!?

1678
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:08,569
- Fuck!

1679
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:12,473
Just use the front door, the
alarm's already going off!

1680
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:17,678
Get the fucking key!

1681
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,381
- I don't know where it is!
Get it! Get it!

1682
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,517
- Where's the fucking key?
Where's the fucking key!?

1683
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:24,352
- It's a cargo jacket! I
don't know!

1684
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:26,420
Alarm reported at
225 Boyer.

1685
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:28,389
- Unit 69 responding.

1686
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,925
84 responding. 57 en route.

1687
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:32,760
Unit 33 on the way.
42 responding.

1688
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:34,428
- Fucking Tuesdays!

1689
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,835
-Okay, Toby, we're gonna move
the party somewhere else,
alright pal?

1690
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:42,203
- Why is that alarm going
off?

1691
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,639
- No time to talk about that,
we gotta go. Oh shit!

1692
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,243
- On the ground!

1693
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:51,345
Everybody on the ground!

1694
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,516
Now put your right hand
behind your back!

1695
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:57,218
Left hand, back!

1696
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,252
- Do it! Do what he says!

1697
01:15:58,254 --> 01:15:59,153
- I am doing it, I am doing
it!

1698
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:00,488
- Don't move!

1699
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,557
- I don't wanna go to prison!

1700
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,399
- Listen up.

1701
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:14,335
I'm gonna ask you this
once...

1702
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,303
What happened here?

1703
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,373
- I'll admit... I'm one of
those guys who only prays

1704
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:22,410
at football games and
craps tables.

1705
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:27,315
But right then... I was
asking for any help I could
get.

1706
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:29,850
And then the strangest
thing happened...

1707
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:34,422
A savior appeared. And he had
Down syndrome.

1708
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:36,891
- I wanted my chocolate milk!

1709
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:39,794
They tried to stop me from
getting my chocolate milk!

1710
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,711
- But like every silver
lining,

1711
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:59,814
it only frames a cloud
full of lightning that kills
people.

1712
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:03,384
- Okay guys, I see no reason
to file a report on this.

1713
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:04,518
- No report?

1714
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,887
- Nah. They're actually
trying to convert this place

1715
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,323
into some kind of bistro
lounge.

1716
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:10,858
Gotta admit, it would be
pretty sweet to have a place

1717
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,661
to go grab a drink with the
guys after our shift.

1718
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,432
- Yeah...

1719
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:21,902
- Well, I'll swing by in the
morning and explain it all to
the manager.

1720
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,671
Get this kid home safe.

1721
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:25,973
And uh, get him some
chocolate milk.

1722
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,511
- Retard.

1723
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:35,182
- And something they don't
tell you when you get struck
by lightning...

1724
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:37,952
you also shit your pants.

1725
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,455
And that's life.

1726
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:43,991
You lose.

1727
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:50,998
The world evolves...

1728
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,568
and you can't stop it.

1729
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,508
You're just a passenger
like everybody else...

1730
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:04,512
sitting on a rock,
spinning through space,

1731
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:08,516
watching everything around
you change.

1732
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,788
No matter how much you
wish it would stay the same.

1733
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:21,762
- When you think about it...
being straight is gay.

1734
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:25,433
- What did you say?

1735
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:30,571
- I said, do you wanna play
chase?

1736
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,777
- So you accept it.

1737
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,887
Because there's no
karma...

1738
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:50,591
No reason to be a good
person and play by the rules.

1739
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:52,693
Hey, look guys. I opened the
door for you,

1740
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:54,995
so really I should be ahead
of you in the line.

1741
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:58,232
Just take what's yours and
fuck what people think.

1742
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,868
Because no fictional force
is gonna punish you--

1743
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,507
I guess this is the point
where you realize

1744
01:19:39,509 --> 01:19:41,142
I've been narrating this
from the dead.

1745
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,146
And your friend acts like
he knew it all along.

1746
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,015
Well...

1747
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:49,150
Your friend is an idiot.

1748
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:50,217
- Hey.

1749
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,720
- Because dead people
can't talk.

1750
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:54,455
- Welcome back.

1751
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,260
- Hey...

1752
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:04,064
- I called your parents, and,
uh, they're flying in.

1753
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,469
- Was it a drive-by?
- Yes.

1754
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,672
Doctors say you're gonna be
okay.

1755
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:13,507
I made sure one worked on
you,

1756
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:16,343
even though a trauma nurse
called dibs.

1757
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,345
Wanda... she's...

1758
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:19,213
It's like a death sentence,

1759
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:21,015
she mainly just kills people.

1760
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,721
- Is there a catheter in me?

1761
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:29,824
- I used the smallest size...

1762
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,561
because it's the least
painful.

1763
01:20:33,563 --> 01:20:35,095
It has nothing to do with
penis size,

1764
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:36,430
you have a normal penis...

1765
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:40,401
when it's... you know, not...
burned by a laptop.

1766
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:43,904
- I mean, I can always jam
the big one in there

1767
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:45,406
if it'll make you feel
better.

1768
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:47,575
- I will stick with the small
one, okay?

1769
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:50,244
- You sure?
- Yeah, please.

1770
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,947
Thanks, though.
- Any time.

1771
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:54,949
- Heeeeey!

1772
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:57,151
- I can't believe you are not
dead. You were on the news.

1773
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:58,519
You're like a celebrity.

1774
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:02,323
There was blood all the way
to the muffin counter, man.

1775
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:04,458
- That's kinda cool.

1776
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,929
- I'll check back in on ya in
a bit, okay?

1777
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:11,532
- Okay, yeah.

1778
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,835
- Hey! No, no.
- Yeah, I was gonna just--

1779
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:19,240
- Hey, look what I got for
you. A little memento.

1780
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,577
- Um, I think I was only shot
once.

1781
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:24,879
- Oh no, these aren't from
you.

1782
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:26,714
These are from the kid who
shot you.

1783
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:28,515
A couple minutes later, we
all catch up to him.

1784
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:30,017
The entire department just
unloads on him,

1785
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:31,986
takes out their gun, emptying
clips like the wild west,

1786
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:32,987
like Brrragagagaga!

1787
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:35,923
Smoke all over the place.
- Helicopters.

1788
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:39,226
- Wh- wait, no. I don't think
it was a kid.

1789
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:44,498
I feel like I saw... like...
an older Latina lady.

1790
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,507
- You know, they said, uh,
technically you were dead for
a minute.

1791
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,409
- What are you doing?

1792
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,044
- You- you don't need that..

1793
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:58,512
So, what did you see when you
died?

1794
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:01,715
- Hmm... just a long hallway.

1795
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:04,285
- How long we talkin'?
- Yeah, like 50 feet?

1796
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,854
- I didn't measure it.
- Do you think it was heaven?

1797
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:08,989
- Aw, you think? Why would
God put in a hallway?

1798
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,357
It's kinda shitty
architecture

1799
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,326
for the most powerful being
in the universe, right?

1800
01:22:12,328 --> 01:22:14,728
- Yeah, heaven should have
looked at least as good as the
Bellagio, right?

1801
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:18,565
- I agree, which makes me
think... you think it was
hell?

1802
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:21,402
- Ooh, but would hell have a
hallway?

1803
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,404
- I think hell would.
Absolutely.

1804
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:24,605
Just to fuck with you.

1805
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:25,940
- How long do you think that
hallway would be?

1806
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:27,207
Like, 50 feet?

1807
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:28,842
- No, why do you keep
thinking it's 50 feet?

1808
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:31,045
- I just think that's enough
time for you to anticipate

1809
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:33,113
what's gonna happen when you
open the door.

1810
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,581
- And what happens when you
open the door?

1811
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,550
- The Devil--
- Stop, it's not the D--

1812
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,519
- Did you see the Devil?
- No.

1813
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:40,721
- Will, did you see the
Devil?

1814
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:42,890
- So, maybe karma is
real...

1815
01:22:42,892 --> 01:22:44,425
Maybe if you cut in front
of a line,

1816
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:46,527
you get shot in the chest.

1817
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:49,063
Or maybe bad things happen
randomly.

1818
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,399
Just like good things do.

1819
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,340
- I really wish you would
reconsider.

1820
01:22:59,342 --> 01:23:02,576
A- a drive-by could happen at
any location.

1821
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:11,085
- But either way... I
think it's better to just
focus

1822
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,954
on the things we can change
ourselves.

1823
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,424
- It's gonna be so weird
operating on cadavers

1824
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:18,592
instead of real people.

1825
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,160
So much less resistance.

1826
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,531
- Hey can I have your muffin?

1827
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:25,566
I need to print this.

1828
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,368
- Of course.

1829
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:30,504
- And let karma deal with
everybody else.

1830
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,609
- Get out.

1831
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:39,913
- No.

1832
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:17,551
- Less... Is More... shoots
more.

1833
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,353
- Yeah, with less.
- Yeah.

1834
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:21,155
- Oh you know what, you can
get them to be dressed up

1835
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:22,489
like a regular heighted
person.

1836
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,524
So you have five of them in
one trench coat,

1837
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:24,825
and them just going to town.

1838
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:26,693
But then their dicks are just
hitting, like, belly buttons,

1839
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:29,329
and nipples, and faces, and
stuff like that.

1840
01:24:29,331 --> 01:24:30,497
- Oh...

1841
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:31,432
- Would you watch midget
porn?

1842
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,901
- Oh... Would I? I do.
