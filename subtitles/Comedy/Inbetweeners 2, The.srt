00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,217
Is this really all we have?

160
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:01,885
Simon.

161
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:02,602
What?

162
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:03,470
Do you have any money?

163
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,355
Mm...No.

164
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:06,172
He's got money!

165
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:06,973
He's got money!

166
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,342
I do! I do!

167
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:10,610
$100?

168
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,444
Whoa!

169
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,912
Did your grandma die again?

170
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:13,730
No.

171
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:17,183
My dad pads my allowance
for every golf match.

172
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,852
We're playing for $10 a hole, so--
Hmm, no, he'll want it back.

173
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:20,854
'Cause you throw every hole.

174
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,405
'Cause he's a golf psychopath.

175
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,741
I saw him kill a turtle
once for distracting him.

176
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:25,859
He killed a turtle!

177
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:27,911
Oh, God, no!

178
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,546
[Laughs]

179
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,030
Simon, you're a great golfer.

180
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:33,667
You don't need to hide that from
a dad who can't handle losing.

181
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,252
If I beat him, he will lose his mind.

182
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,887
I'll come with you and absorb it.

183
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,589
[Sighs]

184
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:40,256
Please, Simon.

185
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,559
I need this.

186
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,044
Looks like we're buying a girl.

187
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:47,046
Here you go.

188
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:51,067
The next morning, I was ready for
the auction and all the benefits

189
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,018
it would provide.

190
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,186
Need me to pick you up today?

191
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:53,853
Nope.

192
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,824
There's a very special someone who
will be happy to give me a lift.

193
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:58,575
You don't mean Simon?

194
00:05:58,577 --> 00:05:59,442
Nope.

195
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,261
About a million times hotter, mom.

196
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:03,246
A million times hotter.

197
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,839
And with $100 of Simon's money
in my pocket, I was ready to

198
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,774
rent the girl of my dreams.

199
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,712
All right!

200
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:22,966
Welcome to the senior slave auction.

201
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,467
[Cheers and applause]

202
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,353
Yay!

203
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:30,256
All right.

204
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,392
You all know him from
the football field.

205
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:36,529
Trevor Smith.

206
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,699
[Cheers and applause]

207
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:40,600
Okay.

208
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:45,205
Can we start the bidding off for
this future nothing at $10?

209
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,656
Do I hear $10?

210
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:47,707
$10.

211
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,459
Do I hear $20?

212
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,376
Hey, Simon.

213
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:51,961
Carly, hi.

214
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,546
You guys here to bid?

215
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,799
No, we're just here to
hang out with you guys.

216
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:56,800
Awesome.

217
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:59,586
Bobby's up for auction, so I have to make
sure he doesn't go to some lame girl

218
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:00,420
with a crush on him.

219
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:01,921
Psht, yeah, it's pathetic.

220
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:02,806
People do that?

221
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,174
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

222
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:05,141
Who are you bidding on?

223
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,427
We'll probably just raise our
hand randomly at one moment.

224
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,562
You know, get swept up
in the moment of giving.

225
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,264
40. $40.

226
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:11,931
Nope.

227
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:12,965
That's sweet, you guys.

228
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,400
We're all here to support the cause.

229
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:15,735
And if you're ever up for auction.

230
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:16,569
I'm not a senior.

231
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,839
I know, but if you ever just
wanted to make money for yourself.

232
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:21,074
[Snickers]

233
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,276
Did you just call me a whore?

234
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,194
No.

235
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,078
[Scoffs]

236
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,997
$80. Do I hear 85?

237
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,998
Keep swinging, Simon.

238
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,868
85.

239
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,169
I'm gonna cry.

240
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:33,837
It's okay.

241
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,038
I'm about ready to cry.

242
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,326
Going once, going twice... sold for $80

243
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:44,798
to the beautiful girl, the, uh...
She's beautiful.

244
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,600
All right, come up here
and claim your senior.

245
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:48,268
Damn it.

246
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,102
Carly was right.

247
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,019
We can't bid on Charlotte.

248
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:50,887
She'll see right through it.

249
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:51,805
Carly's with Bobby.

250
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,472
Who cares what she thinks?

251
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,139
I do.

252
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:53,807
We have to abort.

253
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:54,474
Wait.

254
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:55,859
What if we bid on a guy first?

255
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:57,527
We come in low, and then we get outbid.

256
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,029
That way, it looks less calculated
when we bid on Charlotte.

257
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,865
Then she'll be the one
who has to abort.

258
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:02,816
Good plan. Let's do that.

259
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,284
I'm not bidding on a dude.

260
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:04,951
Neither am I.

261
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:05,819
I came up with the plan.

262
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:06,536
It's not a big deal.

263
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:07,954
I'll do it.

264
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,489
Okay.

265
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:14,727
Our next senior has set records
in track, has a 4.0 grade

266
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:19,916
average, and played a half-eaten
torso in MTV's <i>Teen Wolf.</i>

267
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,419
<i>Let's hear it for Darius hill.</i>

268
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,438
<i>$20!</i>

269
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,641
<i>Oh, [bleep].</i>

270
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:33,763
<i>What just happened?</i>

271
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:36,816
<i>Uh... okay.</i>

272
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,351
<i>It's because he's black.</i>

273
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,054
<i>We just bid on a black
guy at a slave auction.</i>

274
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:41,921
<i>Oh, [bleep].</i>

275
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:42,689
<i>Why does it matter?</i>

276
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:43,656
<i>We're gonna return him.</i>

277
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,575
<i>Damn it, I'd rather be a
pervert than a racist.</i>

278
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:46,359
<i>Why'd you bid on him, will?</i>

279
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>Because I'm not a racist, ironically.</i>

280
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,363
<i>Okay, uh... I hear $20.</i>

281
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,465
<i>Do I hear 25?</i>

282
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:58,905
<i>Anybody want to bid on this very fine...
mm--slave?</i>

283
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:00,006
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

284
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:00,840
<i>Someone bid on him.</i>

285
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:01,958
<i>Someone bid on him.</i>

286
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,476
<i>We were in trouble.</i>

287
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:04,844
<i>We needed somebody to bid.</i>

288
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:05,678
<i>Anybody.</i>

289
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,930
<i>$100!</i>

00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:07,797
<i>Oh, God.</i>

291
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,599
<i>Anybody but him.</i>

292
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:10,800
<i>Thank God.</i>

293
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:14,854
<i>Sold to Neil Sutherland and,

00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,035
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>

301
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:41,407
The rest of the day was
an utter disaster.

302
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,448
If the point of having a slave
was to make your life easier,

303
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,450
we had clearly missed the boat.

304
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:52,739
So come on, fellows.

305
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:53,540
Can I get you guys some food?

306
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,524
Soda or something?

307
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,191
No.

308
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:56,576
Can we get you anything, Darius?

309
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:57,244
You want a fry?

310
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:58,695
You guys haven't had me
do anything all day.

311
00:09:58,697 --> 00:09:59,796
We're very self-sufficient.

312
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,881
Look. I get it.

313
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:01,915
I'm black.

314
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,750
You feel awkward having a black slave.

315
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:04,468
What?

316
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,218
Black?

317
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,202
We don't see color.

318
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,004
You're white to us.

319
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:07,704
Simon.

320
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:10,507
Okay, the senior slave auction
is like a rite of passage.

321
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,209
And you guys are making me look bad
in front of the other seniors.

322
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,878
I don't want this to be
some kind of charity case.

323
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,379

489
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,557
<i>[Applause]</i>

490
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,775
<i>Help me.</i>

491
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,360
<i>I don't even know where to start.</i>

492
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:52,530
<i>Start by getting my
[bleep] out of this hole.</i>

493
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:55,533
<i>[Whimpering]</i>

494
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:56,200
<i>[Straining]</i>

495
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:57,201
<i>Pull. Push.</i>

496
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:57,968
<i>No, I can't.</i>

497
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,786
<i>Ugh.</i>

498
00:16:58,788 --> 00:16:59,870
<i>It's like Taffy, I bet.</i>

499
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,104
<i>Oh, it's in there.</i>

500
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:02,272
<i>It's in there for good.</i>

501
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:04,441
<i>And I have to live here.</i>

502
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:05,743
<i>Hey.</i>

503
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:06,627
<i>Hey, dude.</i>

504
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,278
<i>What's going on over there?</i>

505
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,713
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

506
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:12,716
<i>But Jay has been in there a
long time, and he keeps waving,</i>

507
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:14,718
<i>so I'm sure he's fine.</i>

508
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:19,156
<i>Oh, hell no.</i>

509
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:22,142
<i>Meanwhile, I had managed to
lose every hole of golf and was</i>

510
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,978
<i>now severely in debt to Simon's dad.</i>

511
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,346
<i>Mr. Cooper.</i>

512
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:26,347
<i>Mr. Cooper.</i>

513
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,431
<i>Yeah?</i>

514
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,232
<i>Hi.</i>

515
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:29,800
<i>I was just wondering if,
uh, maybe I could pay you</i>

516
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:30,467
<i>in installments?</i>

517
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:31,485
<i>Perhaps some yard work?</i>

518
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:32,770
<i>Come on, will.</i>

519
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:34,471
<i>You think I'm gonna
take money from you?</i>

520
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,690
<i>You played your heart out today.</i>

521
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:39,410
<i>Not your fault I'm a natural.</i>

522
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:40,327
<i>You keep your money.</i>

523
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,362
<i>Spend it on a girl.</i>

524
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,530
<i>Good-looking kid like you is
gonna have plenty of chances</i>

525
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:44,331
<i>to do that.</i>

526
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,983
<i>You think I'm good-looking?</i>

527
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:46,700
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

528
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,153
<i>You got a whole Eric Bana thing going.</i>

529
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:52,206
<i>I would have killed for your
looks when I was younger.</i>

530
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,192
<i>My whole life would
have been different.</i>

531
00:17:55,194 --> 00:18:00,431
<i>I was attractive.</i>

532
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,832
<i>Somebody finally saw it.</i>

533
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:05,185
<i>And maybe it was only a matter of
time before Charlotte did too.</i>

534
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,188
<i>I had wit, charm, and,
most importantly,</i>

535
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,340
<i>a penis that wasn't stuck in a jacuzzi.</i>

536
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,142
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

537
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:14,144
<i>Your penis is engorged
inside of the jet,</i>

538
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:16,347
<i>because of the water pressure,
but we can't turn the jets off,</i>

539
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,449
<i>because then everyone in here
would see that you are, in fact,</i>

540
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,650
<i>making love to a jacuzzi.</i>

541
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:20,484
<i>Did I get that right?</i>

542
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:21,986
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

543
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:22,903
<i>Catch-22.</i>

544
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:25,923
<i>I swear to God the next time I
bang a pool, the pool's gonna</i>

545
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,791
<i>be a person.</i>

546
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:28,709
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

547
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,661
<i>You guys should try these piña coladas.</i>

548
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:31,912
<i>I've had, like, 20.</i>

549
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:33,063
<i>What?</i>

550
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:33,998
<i>How did you pay for them?</i>

551
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,636
<i>I said to charge it to Mr. Rusakov,
like the guy in front of me.</i>

552
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:39,336
<i>Neil!</i>

553
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:40,804
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

554
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:42,272
<i>I'm all out of love.</i>

555
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:43,590
<i>We got to get him out of here.</i>

556
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:44,258
<i>Come on.</i>

557
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,478
<i>I can't live like this, not like this.</i>

558
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,813
<i>[Sighs]</i>

559
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:53,233
<i>Oh... [ladies gasping]</i>

560
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:56,570
<i>His [bleep] was stuck in the hole.</i>

561
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:57,788
<i>Oh!</i>

562
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,889
<i>'Cause he was [bleep] it.</i>

563
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:00,024
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

564
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,075
<i>Ew.</i>

565
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:03,077
<i>Come on. Go.</i>

566
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,028
<i>Come on.</i>

567
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,079
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

568
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:07,081
<i>No more!</i>

569
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:14,905
<i>In his final act of servitude,
Darius drove each of us home.</i>

570
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:17,141
<i>First Neil, who was finally
feeling the effect of</i>

571
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:18,792
<i>20 piña coladas.</i>

572
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:22,880
<i>♪ Once you get the feeling ♪
it wants you back for more</i>

573
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:24,848
<i>♪ says it's gonna heal it but ♪</i>

574
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,184
<i>♪ you won't make the call ♪</i>

575
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:31,105
<i>Then Jay, who was also
in a state of recovery.</i>

576
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:36,160
<i>I free you.</i>

577
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:40,263
<i>Then Simon, whose dad's victory over me</i>

578
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:42,116
<i>had erased his anger at Simon.</i>

579
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:45,652
<i>Gave will here an old-fashioned
Cooper beat-down.</i>

580
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,622
<i>Unfortunately, Simon's victory
over him erased that.</i>

581
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:51,208
<i>Maybe you can win a hole
against me next time.</i>

582
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,878
<i>Why don't you go [bleep] yourself!</i>

583
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:56,446
<i>And finally me, the
only one who had gotten</i>

584
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:59,416
<i>through the day completely unscathed.</i>

585
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,286
<i>Or so I had thought.</i>

586
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:06,428
<i>Hmm.</i>

587
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:09,676
<i>He is a million times
hotter than Simon.</i>

588
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:23,357
