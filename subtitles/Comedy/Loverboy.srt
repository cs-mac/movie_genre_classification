1
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,961
That's good.

2
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,115
Jenny?

3
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,619
Jenny's gonna come any second!

4
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:40,091
Hey, how you doing?

5
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:47,364
Yeah, I was gonna spend the night
alone with Jenny tonight.

6
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,198
Pussy whipped!

7
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,771
All right, maybe one beer.
That's it.

8
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,309
The party's on!

9
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:03,516
You know, hey, I cleaned earlier.
Yeah, thank you.

10
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,880
Jenny.

11
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,785
Some of the guys dropped by.

12
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:42,515
Hug me?

13
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:43,952
Will you?

14
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,326
Party's over.

15
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,913
What's the matter, no-dick?
Jen throw you out?

16
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,150
No.

17
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,483
Yeah, well, tell her I'm available,
huh?

18
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:17,892
- Why don't you go home, Jory.
- You wanna make me?

19
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,489
Hey, God...

20
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,120
Goddamn shit!

21
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:24,595
Come on, Jenny, open up.

22
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:28,625
Come on, Jen, my dad's coming.
Look, at least let me get my stuff.

23
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:31,800
- You're kept.
- I'm what?

24
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,173
You cleaned?

25
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:38,541
Look, Jenny, I know it's
hard to explain, but-

26
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,182
Seems simple. It's our last night
before break.

27
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,784
You'd rather be barfing
with your beer buddies.

28
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,215
- I get the hint, Randy.
- No, I wasn't- Okay, you're pissed?

29
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,887
No, I'm not. I am not.

30
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,719
You know, I should thank you.

31
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,761
You finally made it very clear to me
where I stand.

32
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,792
Jenny.

33
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,796
I don't want to break up with you.
Look, I got you a present.

34
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:06,135
I know the wrapping's a little primitive,
but it's nice. Go ahead, open it.

35
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,638
I'll open it, I'll help.

36
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,941
Okay. There.
What do you think?

37
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:16,982
- A football jersey?
- Yeah. Looks great, doesn't it?

38
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:22,184
Jenny, I wanted to be
with you last night.

39
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,825
The guys, they just pushed
their way in, and-

40
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,257
Then why didn't you stand up
for yourself?

41
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,961
And why don't you ever
stand up for me?

42
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:31,827
- Well, I do.
- Yeah?

43
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,567
- Yeah.
- Like you do with your parents?

44
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,972
- What?
- You hide me from your parents.

45
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,904
You told them
your roommate's name was Vic.

46
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,307
- Randy, you did.
- Jenny, look.

47
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,674
My dad's gonna be pissed
with my grades.

48
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,612
It's not good to tell him
I'm living with a girl.

49
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,887
So I'm just supposed to be
your secret little boy-toy?

50
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,285
You're not my boy-toy.
I'm gonna tell them.

51
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,587
- When?
- As soon as I see them.

52
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,595
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,893
Really?

54
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,501
Really.

55
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:26,679
Son, sorry I'm late, but the traffic
was hell out there.

56
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,550
You ready to go?
It's good to...

57
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,787
- Dad. Dad!
- ... see you.

58
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,951
Good to see you. You look great.
How you been?

59
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,962
Oh, excuse me. I'm Randy's dad.
Nice to meet you.

60
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,124
So? What's going on?

61
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:42,628
- So where's Vic?
- Vic...

62
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:45,130
- Your roommate-
- You missed him.

63
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:48,140
His dad was here.
No, you missed him.

64
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:52,012
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll call you, Jenny.

65
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,472
Well, hey. Okay.

66
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,145
- Yeah.
- Who was that?

67
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,311
What? Oh, she's my bio tutor.

68
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,283
She thought she left a book here.

69
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,591
- Maybe I better give you a hand.
- No, no, that's not- Okay, yeah.

70
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:16,029
Your mom would've come,
but she had a final today.

71
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,728
Final? Final for what?

72
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:20,901
She's taking a
landscape-architecture class.

73
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:24,010
- She's doing real well too.
- That's good, Dad.

74
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,146
Hey, you got a problem?

75
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,746
No, bad latch, Dad.
Bad latch.

76
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,749
- So how'd you do?
- Do?

77
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:37,056
- Grades, son. How were the grades?
- Oh, well, Dad. That's kind of a...

78
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,749
...subjective thing.

79
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,923
Subjective, huh?

80
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,232
F in geometry. Now, what the hell's
so subjective about that?

81
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,803
See, everybody flunks that
the first time, Dad.

82
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,409
And this D here,
what's that for?

83
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,635
That teacher hates my guts, Dad.

84
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,442
And these "Incs"?

85
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,480
What are these "Incs"?

86
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,846
"Incomplete." It's cool.
I can make it up.

87
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:12,682
Look, Dad, I tried to study.
I really did, but things came up.

88
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,196
I'm sorry about school.
I won't do it again.

89
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,855
Damn right, you won't.
I'm not sending you back.

90
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,433
And no more free ride!

91
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,628
Joe, we agreed for him to have
opportunities we never had.

92
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:25,932
The first Bodek to graduate
from college.

93
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,269
People who look like that
don't graduate.

94
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,345
I don't think I'm out of line. He's
been in school, what, two years?

95
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:35,142
He does not have a clue
what he's doing there!

96
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:38,809
- He can't declare a, what's it called?
- Major.

97
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,614
Major, right. I'll be damned...

98
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:45,317
...if I'll keep throwing good money after
bad money while he's looking like this.

99
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,619
Oh, that's great!

100
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,955
- Don't think this changes a thing!
- Don't send me back.

101
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,034
Well, I mean, look.

102
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,135
I mean, you're right.

103
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,773
Okay?

104
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:05,343
I don't know what I'm doing in school.
So I don't go back.

105
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:10,010
Well, I'll start my real life.

106
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,219
How bad could it be?

107
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:15,120
Yeah, what kind of cheese
you want on that?

108
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,121
- Extra gooey.
- No, extra tangy.

109
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,690
- Tangy...
- Gooey.

110
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,926
Right.

111
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,496
That's...

112
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:27,498
...22.

113
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,129
I gotta get back to school.

114
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,366
It's a summer job.
What'd you expect?

115
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,170
It's a summer job for you.

116
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,411
This is life for me.

117
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:43,209
$4.80 an hour. You know, people here
from Mexico make more than that.

118
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:46,013
Yeah. Well, we pay Juan $5.10.

119
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:48,086
He's got more experience.

120
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:51,752
I gotta get some training in something.

121
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,260
I wanna work triple shifts. I need
to make 9 grand by September.

122
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,228
Oh, 9 grand? Okay, let's see.
$4.80 an hour.

123
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,097
Sixteen-hour days, two and a half
months, no spending money.

124
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,932
We're looking at about
half of what you need.

125
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,742
I think you just better start enjoying
the one perk we got here.

126
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,137
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

127
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,608
Can I help you?

128
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,147
Oh, we're thinking.

129
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:22,817
- We'd like a large Italian.
- What?

130
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,785
- A large vegetarian.
- Okay.

131
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:28,862
- And...
- And two Diet Cokes, no ice.

132
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,123
Two Diet- No ice.

133
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,897
Here's your number, number 16.
We'll be with you in a moment.

134
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,935
Tell me, tell me.
Who is that guy?

135
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,770
He's an exchange student from Italy.

136
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:45,810
- Really?
- Oh, really.

137
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:49,207
Man, I can't believe they go for
that Pepé Le Pew shit.

138
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:51,577
So cute.

139
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,378
Think he's taken?

140
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:02,720
- Hey, man, that shit works for you.
- No.

141
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:04,759
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not interested.

142
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,992
- Oh, come on. Yes!
- No. No!

143
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:11,662
Jenny is 150 miles away. She won't
even return your calls. Give it up.

144
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,671
Look alive out here, will you?

145
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:17,005
- Say you love delivery, right here.
- Caught a bad pepperoni.

146
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,543
Such a wise guy.

147
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:23,875
Okay, Bodek. You're up.
Take off.

148
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:42,895
Hi.

149
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,929
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Randy.

150
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,064
- Robin.
- Hi.

151
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,465
What can I do for you?

152
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,039
I was wondering...

153
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:58,269
- You wanna go out with me sometime?
- What?

154
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,004
Well, you know, outside.

155
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,139
I was in the van.

156
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,242
I smiled.

157
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,887
You smiled.

158
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:10,455
Wait a minute.
The guy in the van had a mustache.

159
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,153
Right.

160
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,256
What happened, I...

161
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,258
See, I wear this for my job.

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,228
Oh, my God.

163
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:23,136
You're just a boy.

164
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,807
I'm sorry. I don't date boys.

165
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:48,229
For what it's worth, I think
she made a big mistake.

166
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,368
Took a lot of nerve to go up to
a complete stranger and ask her out.

167
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,995
I admire that.

168
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:58,828
Thanks.

169
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:02,007
I have to go kill myself now.
Excuse me.

170
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:04,270
Don't take it so personally.

171
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,515
Some women just have
limited perspective, that's all.

172
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,980
She didn't even give me
a chance to talk.

173
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,517
It was like I was younger,
so forget it.

174
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:15,415
- Well, I know that was unfair.
- Yeah.

175
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,617
You know, I've never met a man who
shied away from 20-year-old girls.

176
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,197
I don't see the difference, a few years.
It's no big deal.

177
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,065
She's just kind of bitchy, that's all.

178
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:28,701
Do you like clothes?

179
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,502
Yes, yeah.

180
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,098
Here.

181
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,570
Oh, excuse me. It's okay.

182
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,647
- Did that hurt?
- No, I'm hardheaded.

183
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,546
Oh, dear. Here. Now, wait, look.

184
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,847
These pads are very important
in this jacket.

185
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,455
- All right.
- You see?

186
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,023
- Yeah.
- Now.

187
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,687
Yeah.

188
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:54,192
There we are.

189
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,086
Now.

190
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,034
Okay, hold on.

191
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:16,082
- Oh, that looks wonderful.
- Think so? No, that's it.

192
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,410
- Think that's okay?
- I think like this.

193
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:22,283
- Oh, like that?
- There, you see? It should be like that.

194
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:27,557
Oh, you look wonderful. Good enough
to go and have some cappuccino.

195
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:31,028
- Cappuccino?
- Would you like some cappuccino?

196
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,191
Me?

197
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,696
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite you.

198
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,770
Not over coffee anyway.

199
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:40,372
Are you-? Are you sure?

200
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,372
Okay. Yeah, okay.

201
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,770
Oh, shit! I'm in a red zone.

202
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,384
Look, I really- See, I wanna-
Look, I gotta get back to work.

203
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:56,217
See, I'm the only driver right now.
Well, thanks. Will I-?

204
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,788
Will you-? Okay, bye.
Nice meeting you.

205
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,026
Bye.

206
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,427
Hey, look, look. I'll move it.
I'll move it.

207
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,366
Look. I got- Look. See,
I got a delivery. Come on.

208
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:14,130
I had a letter to Penthouse staring me
right in the face, and I let it go.

209
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,777
I mean, this was an incredibly
gorgeous woman.

210
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:21,109
Not a girl, Sal, a woman.
A Chanel No. 5 woman-

211
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:22,510
- Bodek!
- Yes.

212
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:25,482
Got a delivery for Beverly Hills,
and the rest go...

213
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,553
...to a stag party in Costa Mesa.

214
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:31,783
- Extra anchovies?
- Costa Mesa? Why from here?

215
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,258
All I know is they did,
so move your tail.

216
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,329
I'm here to serve!

217
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,642
Any luggage, sir?

218
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,482
No, pizza.

219
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:01,281
- Pizza.
- What's this?

220
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:09,254
Excuse me.

221
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,378
Oh, excuse me.

222
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,991
Señor Pizza.

223
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:50,729
Come in.

224
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,766
Can you put it on the table, please?

225
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:01,681
Hi.

226
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,351
Hi.

227
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,754
I hope you didn't leave your car
in the red zone.

228
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,923
No.

229
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,794
- Please sit down.
- Yes, definitely.

230
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:18,288
Oh, except, see, I got this
big delivery to make.

231
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,535
In Costa Mesa?

232
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,749
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

233
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:44,221
I'm at a friend's house, and I'm gonna
spend the night, okay?

234
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,792
What? Whose?

235
00:19:47,662 --> 00:19:50,130
Just a guy from work, Dad.

236
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,531
- What was that?
- What?

237
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,432
- What was that?
- Nothing.

238
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,239
- Randy?
- Yeah.

239
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,168
Dad, look, I'll see you
in the morning, okay?

240
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:03,674
Yeah, sure, son.

241
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,088
Randy's spending the night
at a friend's house.

242
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:19,284
Well, he's not gonna come here.
He's miserable here.

243
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:25,291
Diane, it's been over two weeks.
How long are you gonna keep this up?

244
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:29,266
Joe, I don't know why you won't give
him one more chance at school.

245
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,633
He's had all the chances
he's gonna get.

246
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:37,105
I think he's really sorry.
Doesn't look like he's slept in days.

247
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,071
So, Alex...?

248
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,075
Yes, Randy?

249
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:44,010
You work at Avedon?

250
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:47,420
I own Avedon, darling.

251
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:51,923
- Actually, I own all 11 stores.
- Wow.

252
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,992
Does that bother you?

253
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,187
No, not at all.

254
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,095
I'm glad, because it bothers
some people.

255
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:04,499
Oh, like who?

256
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:09,106
Some men find it very wilting.

257
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:11,644
Not me.

258
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:15,974
Can I ask you something?

259
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:20,954
Now, you could just snap your fingers
and get any guy you wanted.

260
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:24,387
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

261
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:26,583
I mean, you're just so...

262
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:33,690
I came into town for a few days,
and when I saw you in the store...

263
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:38,536
...I just thought you would be open.

264
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,735
Open?

265
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:43,638
Yes, I felt you knew
how to enjoy yourself.

266
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,728
- Seven times?
- Yeah.

267
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:11,196
Man, that is like wild boars
or something.

268
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,500
Well... I mean,
that wasn't all we did.

269
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:16,341
We talked about stuff.

270
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,274
Yeah, right. I mean,
I don't believe this.

271
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:23,144
I mean, I come on to every girl
that walks, and they throw up.

272
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:25,114
You do absolutely nothing...

273
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:28,221
...and you get Miss "Take Me
From Behind on a Trapeze."

274
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,721
Oh, no, no, no.
It was nothing like that.

275
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:34,794
Oh, yeah, right. So you think you're
gonna hear from her again?

276
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:39,092
Yeah.

277
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:52,145
- Hi, what can I do for you?
- I come to see Randy.

278
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:54,070
Randy. Really?

279
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,242
Somebody here to see you, son.

280
00:22:57,785 --> 00:23:00,845
- Thanks. Yeah, what's up?
- It's...

281
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,259
Excuse me.

282
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:11,289
These are beautiful, no?
It make you look very handsome.

283
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,296
This is for me?

284
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,459
It came to you at work,
so I bring it myself here.

285
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,566
Is that the fourth one
this week, Tony?

286
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:23,805
These American women, so
cheap and easy. All they say is:

287
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,809
"Yes, Tony. Yes, Tony."

288
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:28,976
You would rather have them say no?

289
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:30,946
This I would respect.

290
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,349
Well, thanks a lot.

291
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:40,985
So...

292
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,423
...who was that?

293
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,192
Guy I work with.

294
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,663
- The guy you were with last night?
- Yeah.

295
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,096
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

296
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,564
What's the story with the coat here?

297
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:54,333
Oh, he outgrew it
and thought I might like it.

298
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,339
Looks brand-new to me.

299
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:59,874
Well, see, what happened was...

300
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,608
What happened was that
he bought it on sale...

301
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:06,014
...and it was the wrong size.

302
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:07,953
Oh, I'll get it.

303
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,847
You dropped a...

304
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:14,661
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

305
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,626
- Sal, what's up?
- Listen.

306
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:18,321
I just took a delivery order.

307
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,458
Some woman asked for a large
Pizza Loco with extra anchovies...

308
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:25,036
- ... and she wanted you personally.
- No!

309
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,673
You're kidding.

310
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,603
"Dear Randy...

311
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:32,902
...of course, I prefer you naked...

312
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,808
...but if you must wear something,
it should be the best.

313
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,076
Love...

314
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,582
...Alex."

315
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,813
- Diane?
- Yeah.

316
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,220
- Yeah.
- Diane...

317
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:50,830
...our son...

318
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,362
...is a fruit!

319
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,761
Yeah?

320
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:56,425
All right, I'll be right there.
Thanks a lot.

321
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:59,598
Mom! They need me at work.

322
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,174
Oh, I thought you had
the afternoon off!

323
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:06,002
- What's this?
- A guy shows up at the door...

324
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,978
...wearing enough cologne
to make me puke.

325
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,217
He gives our son a coat that
must cost 500 bucks-

326
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,321
No, no, wait, don't-
Joe, don't jump to conclusions.

327
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:17,548
See, the other driver called in sick.

328
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,193
And they're already swamped
with deliveries.

329
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,829
- Don't hold dinner, I might be late.
- Okay.

330
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:24,396
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

331
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,738
He never brings girls home
to meet us.

332
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:36,370
He never even talks
about girls anymore.

333
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:40,807
- You think it happens to the other guy.
- Joe. Joe.

334
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,318
I could get used to this.

335
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,282
Oh, shit. Sorry.

336
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,457
- That's all right.
- Okay.

337
00:25:56,897 --> 00:26:00,025
What I could do with you in Rome
in two months, Randy.

338
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,331
What's wrong, darling?

339
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,967
I think you should
know that-

340
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:11,043
Alex, I love being with you
and everything. It's just...

341
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,011
...I don't love you.

342
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:16,380
- You don't?
- No. See, I've got this girl, Jenny.

343
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,347
- Yeah?
- Back at school.

344
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:21,249
And we sort of broke up
and everything.

345
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:23,286
But see, I'm gonna...

346
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:26,619
- But I think I'm gonna-
- Randy?

347
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,623
It's okay.

348
00:26:29,263 --> 00:26:31,163
I think I can handle it.

349
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,169
Thanks, Alex.

350
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:52,549
What's this?

351
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:56,784
That's the Randy Bodek
Scholarship Fund.

352
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:00,254
Oh, no. Alex.

353
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,585
- I can't.
- Why not?

354
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:05,288
Because it makes me feel...

355
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,989
Randy.

356
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:10,968
If I was the one who needed money...

357
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,806
...and you had it to give...

358
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:16,941
- ... would you give it to me?
- Yes.

359
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:19,179
Of course you would.

360
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:22,077
So, what's the difference?

361
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:38,029
I'm never gonna see you again,
am I?

362
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,267
Be on the lookout for extra anchovies.

363
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,079
Randy?

364
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:14,261
Joe.

365
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,528
Jumping to conclusions,
am I, Diane?

366
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:19,400
How dare you sneak home
in the middle of the day...

367
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,041
- ... to invade your son's privacy.
- His privacy?

368
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:25,508
- His sex life is his own business-
- Come on, Diane.

369
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,239
Our son is dressing up
in ladies' underwear.

370
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,145
- He needs professional help.
- No, he needs...

371
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,752
...sympathetic parents who say
they love him.

372
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,481
Let's see your sympathy when
he borrows makeup.

373
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:38,420
- Oh, Joe.
- "Oh, Joe."

374
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,184
Oh, God.

375
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:44,123
Okay. Take the moon.

376
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:45,856
It's a chunk of rock.

377
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:48,092
Why does it spin around the Earth?

378
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,703
Why doesn't it just bolt off into space?

379
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:55,199
Smartest scientists don't understand
a billionth of what's going on.

380
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:58,470
Why should I feel stupid
because I don't understand women?

381
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,841
You get all that from
a cold pizza, man?

382
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:06,112
- You're in worse shape than I thought.
- I'm serious. So I've saved 270 bucks?

383
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,288
I'm never gonna get Jenny back.

384
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,221
- See, I don't know what to do.
- I do. Move your butt.

385
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,625
Says "extra anchovies."
Who called it in?

386
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,095
- What do you mean, who? Some lady.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

387
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:20,494
- Hold it.
- What?

388
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:23,193
Where's your mustache?
I want mustaches worn.

389
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,895
- Sal said I didn't have to wear it.
- Sal.

390
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:28,200
Mustaches, mustaches.

391
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,366
You're bumming me out, man.

392
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:32,139
Señor Pizza.

393
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,690
Alex?

394
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:13,219
- Hello.
- Hi.

395
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,914
I'm a friend of Alexandra.

396
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,625
It's okay.

397
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,292
What?

398
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:29,901
Oh, no.

399
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,562
I- No.

400
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,179
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

401
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,014
It's nothing personal.

402
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:54,988
- I want to die!
- Now, come on. Don't talk like that.

403
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:58,154
Look, it's just been one giant mistake.

404
00:30:58,332 --> 00:31:01,699
Yes, my marriage.
Fourteen years of a big mistake.

405
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:05,566
Hey, come on. It can't be that bad.
I mean, look at this house.

406
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,138
What? It's great.

407
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:09,137
It's a prison.

408
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,072
Okay, why don't you
sit down here.

409
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,907
You know, I hope everything
works out.

410
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:16,916
No. No. No!

411
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,283
When I was younger in Japan,
I had many boyfriends.

412
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:26,324
Many proposals of marriage. But no,
I wanted to marry American.

413
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,154
Be American woman with
American freedom and opportunity.

414
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,356
But my husband, he treats me
like a geisha.

415
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,126
Well, I'm not a geisha!

416
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:39,535
I'm a computer analyst!

417
00:31:39,706 --> 00:31:42,004
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gotta get going here.

418
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,007
He treats me like his slave.

419
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,644
And now...

420
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:50,944
...when I finally get the courage
to do something for myself...

421
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,981
...even you, professional,
you refuse me.

422
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:56,782
- No, see, I'm not a professional.
- I want to die.

423
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,424
Stop it.

424
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,727
- No, no, no, no. Not like that.
- What?

425
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:06,093
- That's my husband's way.
- I'm sorry, I thought that-

426
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,503
I have a fantasy.

427
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,237
Take me.

428
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,016
Take me.

429
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:35,989
- Take me!
- Yes, okay.

430
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:55,406
Okay. It's all right.

431
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,797
Yes, ma'am. Absolutely.
And thank you very much.

432
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:23,241
Hey, Bodek, you are really quite
the popular guy, aren't you?

433
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,244
Look at this. Look at this.
You got a bunch of deliveries here.

434
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:32,647
Hey, Juan! Break me out one of those
big cans of anchovies, will you?

435
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:36,884
Oh, my goodness.

436
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:40,424
- What the hell is going on?
- That last delivery wasn't Alex.

437
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:44,997
I figured so. You got five more calls,
all women, all extra anchovies.

438
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:48,862
Four of them scheduled deliveries
for later this week!

439
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:58,375
I just couldn't say no.
Alex? She just insisted.

440
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:01,446
And then Kyoko.
Kyoko, it was like...

441
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:04,413
...I was defending the American way.

442
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,519
It's taking me a second to get this.

443
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:10,123
Beautiful women actually pay you
$200 apiece to sleep with them?

444
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,588
Yeah! I didn't want
to take their money.

445
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,853
They were nice people.
They wouldn't take no for an answer.

446
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:18,054
Okay, well, what about the others?

447
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:20,927
Call them back and say
there are no more anchovies.

448
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,628
I can't! They didn't leave names
or numbers, only addresses.

449
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:26,966
Three of them are motels
in the Valley.

450
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,574
I cannot believe Alex
would do this to me.

451
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:33,577
Who knows? Right now your name
and number could be on every wall...

452
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:36,841
...of every ladies' room
from Chinoise to Le Dôme, man.

453
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,414
You could be the love doctor
of Beverly Hills!

454
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:43,784
I don't wanna be the love doctor
of Beverly Hills!

455
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,517
- You're going.
- I am not going.

456
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,828
No.

457
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:54,797
What do you think, Joe?
Portable home-security systems.

458
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:59,234
I pick them up in Tokyo for a buck
and a quarter, sell them here for $40.

459
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,237
Ain't that something?

460
00:35:01,842 --> 00:35:04,174
It's great. It's really great.

461
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:09,338
I got 20,000 of these waiting to go into
the warehouse as soon as you build it.

462
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:11,746
- Right. Right.
- Excuse me, Mr. Bodek.

463
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:14,148
- Yes, Linda?
- Mr. Rubelinski's calling.

464
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,380
Tell him I'll call him back.

465
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:20,219
Excuse me. Do you mind if I spend
the night in your trailer tonight?

466
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:23,295
They're painting my apartment,
and the fumes are-

467
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:25,130
No problem.

468
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:29,335
Look, Linda, you sure
you'll be safe down here?

469
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,994
Yeah. I can take care of myself.

470
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,008
Hey, that's not bad. Porking her?

471
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:41,509
I'm a happily married man, Harry.

472
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,374
At least, I used to be.

473
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:48,112
Does this kid look like a fruit to you?

474
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:52,283
You can't tell these days.

475
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,320
I think I'm entitled to be
a little concerned here.

476
00:35:56,496 --> 00:35:59,226
I've tried to talk to the wife.
She won't listen.

477
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:03,927
Shit. You never get treated
that way with an Oriental woman.

478
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:06,129
Great sex.

479
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:07,637
No lip.

480
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,207
I'm married to one.

481
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,139
- Yeah?
- Damn right.

482
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:15,274
I heard this story once
from this guy back in New York.

483
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:19,180
This guy was late for work,
and he sees his bus leaving the stop.

484
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:21,786
His Oriental wife runs
into the street...

485
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:25,288
...jumps right in front of it
and stops it for him.

486
00:36:26,526 --> 00:36:30,087
That's what marriage is all about,
you ask me.

487
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,726
What happened to the wife?

488
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:38,231
What?

489
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,533
The wife.
When she jumped in front of the bus.

490
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:47,139
You're never gonna get it, are you?

491
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:57,917
I want another chance.
My life is a mess without you.

492
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,854
Yeah, I know.

493
00:37:00,193 --> 00:37:02,525
I'm not ashamed of you.

494
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:04,860
I'm proud.

495
00:37:05,332 --> 00:37:07,300
I'm gonna tell my parents about you.

496
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:12,530
I want them to meet you. Their 20th
anniversary is at the end of the month.

497
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:14,640
And what about your father?

498
00:37:14,808 --> 00:37:19,268
I don't care what my father thinks.
I know my mom's gonna love you.

499
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:26,382
Look, just don't say no
until you think about it.

500
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,084
Oh, no.

501
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,582
Mr. Bodek.

502
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,752
Mr. Bodek?

503
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:16,124
Mr. Bodek, you can't stay here.
You've gotta go.

504
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:17,793
Oh, God.

505
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:20,606
Please? Please wake up.

506
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,075
Mom?

507
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:28,876
What are you doing up?
Where's Dad?

508
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:32,849
- I don't know. We had a fight.
- About me?

509
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,884
Mom, I'm sorry.

510
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,793
Don't worry.

511
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:45,625
You know, I bet he just crashed out
on the sofa bed at the office.

512
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,928
Yeah, you're probably right.

513
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:56,406
- Good night.
- Okay, good night.

514
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,349
Oh, Diane...

515
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:11,420
- Linda!
- Mr. Bodek?

516
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:12,922
What are you doing here?

517
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:15,527
I told you they're painting
my place, remember?

518
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:20,655
- No! Oh, my head. It's killing-
- I'm sorry.

519
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:24,793
- Linda, we didn't, you know-?
- No, you came in here.

520
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:27,462
- I couldn't even move you.
- Thank God!

521
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:31,470
Listen, nobody will believe
that we just slept here.

522
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:33,806
- Yeah, no-
- No, it's okay.

523
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,345
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

524
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:38,245
There's nobody here yet.
We're safe. We're safe.

525
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,819
We're safe as long as we don't
ever let anybody know about this.

526
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,319
- I won't.
- Ever. Okay?

527
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,550
- Okay, I won't say a word. I promise.
- Okay.

528
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:48,761
- No! Don't!
- Mr. Bodek's office.

529
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,188
Linda?

530
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:54,391
It's your wife!

531
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,204
Hey, Bodek!

532
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:06,269
Look who's here.

533
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:09,240
Goofing off on the job, huh?

534
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:14,242
- What do you want, Jory?
- I wanna give you my order, Rander.

535
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:20,859
I'll have a Taco Macho.

536
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:24,955
Extra lettuce. Extra cheese.

537
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,962
A large Coke.

538
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,499
And Jenny's phone number.

539
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:34,034
You'll never get back to school.
I might as well get a hop on it.

540
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:38,576
- Listen, asshole, stay away from her.
- Go ahead, no-dick. Take a shot.

541
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:41,976
Come on, mellow out.
Take a number and sit down.

542
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,616
- You just lost your tip.
- Geek.

543
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,980
Let's see, 9000 plus the 400
you just made, divided by 200...

544
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:56,094
- What are you doing?
- Let's see, that's only 43 women.

545
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,569
- Señor Pizza.
- It's about time.

546
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:51,450
Sorry.

547
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:53,776
Put it down.

548
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,216
Not on the plant.

549
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,729
So?

550
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,157
So...

551
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:16,935
You want me to fix you a drink
or something?

552
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,375
If I wanted a drink,
I would have hired a bartender.

553
00:42:20,547 --> 00:42:22,674
- Could you help me with this?
- Sure.

554
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,680
- Shit.
- What's the matter?

555
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:33,155
Hang on.

556
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:39,193
Don't move.
My lip is caught in the zipper.

557
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:42,266
- What?
- My lip is caught in the zipper.

558
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,494
I don't believe this.

559
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:50,842
Good God! What kind
of a professional lover are you?

560
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:56,375
Just- Just take your clothes off.

561
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:45,364
- Are you crazy? People can see!
- Fine. I want them to.

562
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:49,298
Look, if something's bothering you,
maybe this isn't the best time.

563
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:53,633
If something's bothering me?
Of course something's bothering me!

564
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:55,671
- Do you know what this is?
- Looks-

565
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,833
Wrong! It's my husband's beeper.

566
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:01,604
Have you heard of him?
Dr. Reed Palmer?

567
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:06,741
I thought the son of a bitch was a saint
with all his late-night emergency calls.

568
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,857
I found out he's been screwing some
nympho RN on the graveyard shift!

569
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:16,452
Hey, hey, come on. Calm down.

570
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,697
You know, two can play at this game.

571
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,563
- You wait till I tell my husband.
- Your husband?

572
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:25,567
- Come on.
- You can't do it.

573
00:44:44,857 --> 00:44:46,085
Oh, God.

574
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:51,527
- Is this okay?
- Oh, good. It's really good.

575
00:44:51,698 --> 00:44:54,826
- Oh, it feels weird.
- Doesn't feel weird to me.

576
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:57,868
- You sure?
- You're great at this.

577
00:44:58,037 --> 00:44:59,436
Thanks.

578
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:03,266
- Joyce?
- Yes?

579
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:06,606
Now, how did you get my number?

580
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:10,180
- Oh, at my salon, why?
- Your sal-?

581
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:13,917
I'm sorry.

582
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,920
It's all right.
I'm a little rusty myself.

583
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:23,461
- You really like dancing to this stuff?
- Yeah, sure. A lot of women do.

584
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,364
You know, if you learned, I bet
your clients would really appreciate it.

585
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:31,332
You know, Reed hasn't
taken me dancing-

586
00:45:31,971 --> 00:45:34,235
Since we were in med school.

587
00:45:35,241 --> 00:45:38,210
I know this is probably
against your professional code...

588
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:40,278
...but can I ask
a personal question?

589
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,674
Sure.

590
00:45:41,848 --> 00:45:44,840
It's just that this isn't
what I imagined.

591
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:47,782
I was angry, and I wanted
to get back at my husband.

592
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,149
And I guess I kind of expected
a sort of:

593
00:45:50,323 --> 00:45:52,883
"Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am."

594
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:55,118
- But you're not like that at all.
- No.

595
00:45:57,597 --> 00:46:00,191
Hey, I'm having a great time!

596
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:03,260
You're worth every penny.

597
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:26,152
Honey!

598
00:46:27,126 --> 00:46:28,855
I'm home!

599
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,997
We really need to talk, son.

600
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:37,492
Hi, sweetheart.

601
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:41,703
Honey, I got you some flowers,
and I just thought we could talk-

602
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:45,573
Two, three, four.

603
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,382
Six, seven, eight.

604
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:04,156
One, two, three, four.

605
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:08,400
Five, six, seven.

606
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:14,230
Hey, son!

607
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:18,400
Thought you might want to check out
the annual football issue.

608
00:47:21,013 --> 00:47:22,571
Look, smell.

609
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,573
No, smell it.

610
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:28,551
It's got a nice smell to it.
I kind of like it.

611
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,446
Hey, catch!

612
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:33,155
Hey, you still got it.

613
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:39,923
Sad.

614
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,067
Really, very sad.

615
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:44,832
Jen? Yeah.

616
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:51,337
Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said back at school.

617
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:54,808
About how I don't know how
to treat a woman.

618
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:57,038
Well...

619
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,178
...you're right.

620
00:48:00,987 --> 00:48:02,784
But I am working on it.

621
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:05,115
Okay, I got it.

622
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:20,497
Oh, man!

623
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:23,369
Excuse me.

624
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:36,921
So how have you been?
It's good to see you. Okay...

625
00:48:41,194 --> 00:48:42,491
Sorry.

626
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:44,758
Excuse me.

627
00:49:14,126 --> 00:49:18,119
This is the best part right here.
Get ready for this.

628
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:15,679
I tried EST,
and I shared all that I could.

629
00:50:15,855 --> 00:50:17,413
Then I bought the crystals.

630
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,583
Finally, I tried channeling,
so I find out who I am 1000 years ago.

631
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:24,093
But I need to know who I am today.

632
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:50,417
And don't forget to order
extra anchovy.

633
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:14,537
Please think about coming over
to my parents'...

634
00:52:14,707 --> 00:52:16,800
...for the anniversary next week.

635
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,644
Come on.
At least pick up the phone.

636
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,047
Okay.

637
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,484
But I still love you.

638
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:27,251
Bye-bye.

639
00:52:37,563 --> 00:52:39,793
So how are we doing?

640
00:52:39,965 --> 00:52:43,332
Well, less expenses, which is...

641
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:46,596
- ... $6879.32.
- Hey, that's not bad.

642
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:50,469
It's gonna get a lot better too.
We now take all major credit cards.

643
00:52:50,643 --> 00:52:51,940
- What?
- Oh, come on.

644
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:54,272
These women haven't touched cash
in years.

645
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:58,781
Now they don't have to go to the bank
or explain mysterious withdrawals.

646
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:00,179
There'll be a record.

647
00:53:00,352 --> 00:53:03,014
Charged to Señor Pizza.
The bridge club ordered in.

648
00:53:03,189 --> 00:53:05,623
- I don't like it.
- I do the books at the store.

649
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:06,815
Who's gonna know?

650
00:53:06,992 --> 00:53:09,586
Hold on, let me just get-

651
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:11,662
Looks good.

652
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,734
Stop it.

653
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,546
Don't stop.

654
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,682
- Hi.
- Hi.

655
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:16,555
Señor Pizza, with extra anchovies.

656
00:54:16,729 --> 00:54:19,197
Great. Right here is fine.

657
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:22,800
Right here?

658
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:27,301
Well, sure.

659
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,672
Leslie! Julie!

660
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:35,676
Come on, kids! Pizza's here.

661
00:54:35,848 --> 00:54:37,406
Get the extra anchovies, Mom?

662
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,778
Well, I sure did. Come on.

663
00:54:45,224 --> 00:54:46,919
So you did these, huh?

664
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:50,422
- What are they, mountains?
- Anatomical landscapes.

665
00:54:50,596 --> 00:54:53,531
That one's a shoulder.
That one is a neck.

666
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:56,497
That's a bicep,
the one with the egg there.

667
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:58,032
Another shoulder.

668
00:54:58,204 --> 00:55:01,332
- So these are all parts of a guy?
- They're my husband.

669
00:55:01,574 --> 00:55:05,806
He's a bodybuilder.
Mr. California Olympian '84.

670
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:12,180
So does he still look like that?

671
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:16,019
No. He's much bigger now.

672
00:55:17,656 --> 00:55:19,419
Look, maybe I shouldn't be here.

673
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:24,894
Don't worry. He won't be home
for hours. He's into private instruction.

674
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,696
Very private.

675
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:32,130
I'm sorry.

676
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:36,706
All day, he works on starlets
with little Barbie-doll hard bodies.

677
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:39,140
Why should he want to
come home to this?

678
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:41,006
I would come home.

679
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:46,982
No, you should see these girls. All
they do is eat kelp and drink spritzers.

680
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:49,810
And here I am
with my cigarette and my drink.

681
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:53,389
I can't help it if I like a shot
of tequila once in a while.

682
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,494
I like actual food, not fiber.

683
00:55:56,662 --> 00:56:01,861
Fuck fiber. I want grease, red meat.
I got pork chops hidden in the freezer.

684
00:56:03,002 --> 00:56:08,099
And my husband's in the perfect-body
business. It's like a joke.

685
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:11,269
- Maybe he likes you the way you are.
- Yeah, right.

686
00:56:11,443 --> 00:56:14,935
Wanna see what he got me
for my birthday?

687
00:56:19,184 --> 00:56:20,811
Is that, like, a hint or what?

688
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:24,747
Well, I don't think that was a hint.

689
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:30,757
- Okay, smile.
- Oh, no. Please. Please.

690
00:56:31,297 --> 00:56:34,494
National Cellulite Contest
isn't until next week, okay?

691
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,130
That's good.

692
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:40,136
Smile. Oh, so sexy.

693
00:56:46,412 --> 00:56:48,437
- Yes. And how foolish-
- Great.

694
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:51,343
Okay, relax and releasing
into the photo experience.

695
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:54,543
And breathe and say yes
to the photo experience.

696
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:59,722
Don't make me look vulnerable.
Forbidden quality.

697
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:01,723
Certain dignity. Anything?

698
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:10,658
- A pastrami burrito, nachos alfredo-
- Hey!

699
00:57:10,836 --> 00:57:12,701
A Diet Coke.

700
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:18,400
Randy Bodek?

701
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:22,738
You been messing with my wife?

702
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,551
Multiple fractures,
internal hemorrhaging.

703
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:36,752
- We need immediate x-rays.
- It's too late for that!

704
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:48,366
We've got to open him right up.

705
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,805
Whatever you say, Dr. Palmer.

706
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:56,277
- Dr. Palmer. Dr. Reed Palmer?
- That's right, Randy.

707
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:00,775
I believe you know my wife.

708
00:58:01,954 --> 00:58:03,421
No anesthetic!

709
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:13,758
- We need 12 units of BHT.
- And we need a bucket for the blood.

710
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:19,226
- All right, flash cards, everybody.
- Flash cards in place.

711
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,579
- Hello?
- Hi, honey!

712
00:58:36,822 --> 00:58:38,187
Joe.

713
00:58:39,091 --> 00:58:43,050
- Is it raining?
- Yeah, we got a shower going here.

714
00:58:45,764 --> 00:58:47,061
Joe, who was that?

715
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:51,625
- Think you could foot the bill?
- He couldn't handle the two of us.

716
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:53,465
Oh, just a couple of hookers.

717
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:56,106
Look, I don't know what time-

718
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:16,087
Well, I can't find anything
physically wrong.

719
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,788
Joyce, I'm not making this up.
I have pains in my chest.

720
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:21,762
I know you're not making this up.

721
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:23,992
I think it's caused from stress.

722
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:27,866
Have you been upset or had
emotional problems lately?

723
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:33,809
I can't believe it, right before
our 20th anniversary.

724
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:37,039
How am I going to get through
that party when I know?

725
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:41,375
And it isn't just his secretary.

726
00:59:41,553 --> 00:59:44,147
This time, he admitted
he was with hookers.

727
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:47,517
And I swear, the son of a bitch
called from a shower stall.

728
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,287
Well, at least my husband has
the brains to invent some excuse.

729
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,432
I mean, we had
our ups and downs...

730
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,795
...just like everybody else.

731
00:59:58,003 --> 01:00:01,131
But we were happy.
I know we were.

732
01:00:01,773 --> 01:00:03,638
How about sexually?

733
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:08,109
Great. Great, you know,
until recently.

734
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:10,838
Oh, God, it's all my fault.

735
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:13,849
That your husband is having affairs?
Diane.

736
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:17,011
Joyce!
What am I gonna do?

737
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:19,318
I know what you're going through.

738
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,823
Believe me,
I know what you're going through.

739
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,955
What is that? A prescription?

740
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:27,255
Kind of.

741
01:00:33,438 --> 01:00:35,235
Penny for them?

742
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:36,871
Nothing.

743
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:42,046
- I've been having nightmares.
- About what?

744
01:00:42,214 --> 01:00:44,774
- Husbands.
- Me too.

745
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,477
No. I mean, like,
maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

746
01:00:48,787 --> 01:00:50,311
Randy.

747
01:00:50,756 --> 01:00:53,725
- Nobody's going to find out.
- Yeah, well.

748
01:00:53,992 --> 01:00:55,960
- You parked in the back, right?
- Yeah.

749
01:00:56,128 --> 01:01:00,758
Besides, Harry never comes home.
He's downtown all day. Every day.

750
01:01:02,968 --> 01:01:04,560
Kyoko?

751
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:07,539
God, it's Harry!

752
01:01:12,678 --> 01:01:14,145
Pumpkin!

753
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,374
Where you at?

754
01:01:17,182 --> 01:01:18,774
- Harry.
- I don't believe it.

755
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:23,752
I got 1000 crates of those
talking robots, sitting on the dock!

756
01:01:25,657 --> 01:01:28,319
I just find out I lost a week
on the warehouse.

757
01:01:28,493 --> 01:01:29,755
Oh, no.

758
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,454
City forgot to inform us...

759
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:36,328
...there's a little water main that
goes right through my goddamn lot.

760
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,662
- I'm so sorry.
- That doesn't help.

761
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,179
I'll get you something to eat.
Are you hungry?

762
01:01:49,348 --> 01:01:52,511
Wish I could take a bath
in the middle of the afternoon.

763
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,393
Harry.

764
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,418
Harry.

765
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,668
I know something's wrong.

766
01:02:21,913 --> 01:02:24,404
You've been acting strange for weeks.

767
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:26,843
You've been too freaking cheerful.

768
01:02:34,192 --> 01:02:36,956
I always use rose petals in my bath.

769
01:02:37,229 --> 01:02:38,821
Since when?

770
01:02:43,168 --> 01:02:44,465
Harry.

771
01:02:45,003 --> 01:02:46,903
Let me fix you a drink.

772
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,611
Intruder! Intruder!

773
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:55,770
Trespasser! Trespasser!

774
01:02:55,947 --> 01:02:58,973
Bad boy! Bad boy!

775
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,346
Very bad! Very bad boy!

776
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,990
I'm pissed on you!

777
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:10,586
Pissed on you, boy!

778
01:03:10,762 --> 01:03:12,923
Hey, is somebody up there?

779
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:14,690
Of course not.

780
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,362
Don't you want your gin and tonic?

781
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,231
Harry.

782
01:03:19,404 --> 01:03:23,738
Baby, baby, baby. What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

783
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:47,856
Intruder alert! Trespasser!

784
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,391
Intruder alert!

785
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:52,730
Intruder alert! Trespasser!

786
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:58,709
Trespasser! Bad boy!

787
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,402
Bad dude! Bad dude!

788
01:04:05,016 --> 01:04:08,474
Those things go off all the time!
Face it, Harry. They're junk.

789
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:11,781
Junk! Harry Bruckner
does not buy junk!

790
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:15,259
Now, where is your guy?
He's in there, huh?

791
01:04:17,496 --> 01:04:19,293
Your storeroom.
How should I know?

792
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:21,159
Never mind.

793
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:24,302
There's other ways of finding out
who your guy is.

794
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:29,236
Probably one of your old boyfriends.
There's the one from Yokohama...

795
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,388
Harry!

796
01:04:45,123 --> 01:04:48,581
- You have no right!
- Right!

797
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,820
Well, he's not here now.
But he was here today, wasn't he?

798
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:55,433
Mr. Rose-on-the-Pillow.
Let me see that.

799
01:04:58,403 --> 01:05:02,840
Two-hour appointment with Dr. Palmer
this morning. House call. Right?

800
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:06,808
I knew that son of a bitch
was porking his patients. I knew it!

801
01:05:08,346 --> 01:05:10,007
Goodbye, Harry.

802
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,481
Relax, Mr. Chapman.

803
01:05:16,655 --> 01:05:19,215
You're in good hands
with Dr. Palmer.

804
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:21,916
Haven't had any complaints yet.

805
01:05:22,093 --> 01:05:23,321
Have we, Darlene?

806
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:26,289
Son of a bitch!

807
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,832
You son of a bitch!

808
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:35,966
Move it! Get out of my way!

809
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:39,599
I didn't know Darlene was married.
She never told me.

810
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,906
Who the hell is Darlene?

811
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:54,425
- Fred Astaire tipped me off.
- What?

812
01:05:54,759 --> 01:05:56,488
Joyce used to love to go dancing.

813
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,289
Something was up when
I saw those old records out.

814
01:05:59,464 --> 01:06:03,195
- The roses in her dresser were the-
- Roses. You too?

815
01:06:03,368 --> 01:06:05,336
This guy's got some line of bullshit.

816
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,563
How come you didn't
give it to her then?

817
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,572
I don't know. I'd been fooling
around with Darlene.

818
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:13,836
- I figured maybe it was only fair.
- Bullshit.

819
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:17,072
Right! Bullshit!

820
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,850
There. There it is. Right there.

821
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:24,352
See, I noticed she gets
these roses every Tuesday.

822
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:26,821
That's the day this joker comes by.

823
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:29,222
Personal fitness trainer.

824
01:06:30,128 --> 01:06:32,562
Let's get that bastard.

825
01:06:37,402 --> 01:06:40,166
Come on out here!

826
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:43,466
You have been porking my wife!

827
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,741
I see them moving around in there.
Come on out, little weasel!

828
01:06:56,521 --> 01:06:58,682
All right.

829
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:14,998
Great! This is all I need.

830
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,772
You guys are robbing my house.

831
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:20,275
My wife's having an affair.

832
01:07:21,146 --> 01:07:22,613
What the hell?

833
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:25,176
Go ahead.

834
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,783
Buddy?

835
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,179
Big, big buddy?

836
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,284
Your wife is having an affair?

837
01:07:54,379 --> 01:07:57,542
"Extra anchovies."

838
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:10,860
- Randy, what is wrong?
- Tony.

839
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:15,193
A lot of these girls you've been seeing,
they've got boyfriends, don't they?

840
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:18,996
- Of course. Husbands sometimes.
- Well, have any of them found out...

841
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,661
- ... and came after you or anything?
- Of course.

842
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,072
In Genova, a husband come
after me with a butcher knife.

843
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:31,238
We fight. We fight, and I hit him
to the ground. I bite his ear off.

844
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:33,145
He don't bother me no more.

845
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,649
Great.

846
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,583
Wilshire Motel? Extra anchovies?
No problem. Enjoy-

847
01:08:37,756 --> 01:08:41,817
No, no! There's a husband out there
who wants to kill me. I wanna retire!

848
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,460
- Hold it!
- What?

849
01:08:43,628 --> 01:08:48,088
Listen, you're exactly one romantic
interlude away from the jackpot.

850
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:51,565
- One?
- Do you have one left in you? One!

851
01:08:52,203 --> 01:08:53,795
One. One, yes.

852
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:56,099
Forty-three!
Seventy-six, hike. Go!

853
01:09:17,896 --> 01:09:21,593
Here you go, Mrs. Smith, Room 214.
Other side of the pool.

854
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:23,563
Thank you.

855
01:09:41,519 --> 01:09:42,747
Hello?

856
01:09:43,788 --> 01:09:45,756
Are you Sal?

857
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:49,422
- Yeah.
- I'm Jenny.

858
01:09:49,594 --> 01:09:52,757
Oh, Randy's Jenny?
I thought you were in Santa Barbara.

859
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:55,263
Randy invited me to his parents' party.

860
01:09:55,433 --> 01:09:58,834
- I thought you guys broke up.
- Well, we did but...

861
01:09:59,504 --> 01:10:01,938
He's not seeing anybody else, is he?

862
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:05,910
- Seeing? No.
- He's seeing somebody else.

863
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:09,171
No, he's not! Trust me.
He's gonna die when he sees you.

864
01:10:09,347 --> 01:10:11,212
Why don't you have
something to eat.

865
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:12,644
Fine. I'll...

866
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,443
I'll have a Pizza Loco.

867
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,315
Like extra anchovies on that?

868
01:10:17,856 --> 01:10:19,084
No. Does anybody?

869
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,624
Are you kidding? Oh, yeah.
It's the hottest item all summer.

870
01:10:22,794 --> 01:10:25,490
It's kind of a female thing around here.

871
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:43,206
555-8411.

872
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:49,013
Yeah, hello, look. I called earlier
to order the pizzas with extra anchovy.

873
01:10:50,388 --> 01:10:52,879
- Wilshire Motel?
- Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.

874
01:10:53,057 --> 01:10:54,957
I'm gonna have to cancel that order.

875
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,684
Too late. It's on its way.

876
01:11:00,031 --> 01:11:02,499
I'm afraid you don't understand.

877
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:06,262
You see, I don't think
I can eat the anchovies.

878
01:11:06,437 --> 01:11:07,961
I'm a married woman.

879
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,699
For all I care, you can throw
it out the window.

880
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,366
You order it, you pay!

881
01:11:13,545 --> 01:11:15,137
No! Hello!

882
01:11:25,356 --> 01:11:28,291
Ice. Get some ice.

883
01:11:46,211 --> 01:11:47,940
Hello?

884
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:04,325
Hello?

885
01:12:36,294 --> 01:12:38,262
Last one.

886
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:14,397
Hey, hey, come here.

887
01:13:20,705 --> 01:13:23,868
Bring the little fish. Okay.
Good, good. Come on! Come on!

888
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:27,534
Okay, okay. Look out!
Move over!

889
01:13:31,182 --> 01:13:34,777
- Mommy, can I have a piece of pizza?
- Maybe later.

890
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:37,978
Somebody in there?

891
01:13:40,425 --> 01:13:41,858
Hello?

892
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:56,831
Bye!

893
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:07,682
Hey, Jen. All right.

894
01:14:07,852 --> 01:14:09,843
Jory. How are you?

895
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:12,216
- You're looking good-
- Someone called.

896
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:15,223
- Your mom's been in an accident.
- Good.

897
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:16,690
She's in the hospital!

898
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:19,458
Get out of my face, will you?

899
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:22,190
Tell her why you don't
want me to talk to her.

900
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:23,925
Go ahead. Tell her.

901
01:14:24,102 --> 01:14:27,902
Tell her Randy's making it with some
lady old enough to be my mother.

902
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:30,905
Come on, Jen.
Let's get out of here.

903
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:40,541
Hey, Tony! I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need a really-

904
01:14:40,718 --> 01:14:42,618
I need a really big favor.

905
01:14:42,787 --> 01:14:44,482
Randy, what is wrong now?

906
01:14:44,655 --> 01:14:47,886
You gotta deliver this
to the Wilshire Motel, Room 214.

907
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:51,622
But it is all broken.
The tip will be very small.

908
01:14:51,796 --> 01:14:53,320
Don't worry about the tip.

909
01:14:53,498 --> 01:14:56,092
You gotta tell the woman
that you're very sorry.

910
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:59,862
There are no more anchovies. She
should go home and forget about it.

911
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:03,405
- But we have many anchovies.
- Yeah, I know. Just do it.

912
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:05,439
Okay.

913
01:15:11,349 --> 01:15:13,783
You son of a bitch!

914
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:17,178
Listen, man, I tried to tell her.
She wouldn't listen!

915
01:15:17,355 --> 01:15:19,983
How could you?
What kind of amoral chump are you?

916
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:23,992
- I wouldn't call it amoral.
- It's the sickest thing I've ever heard!

917
01:15:24,162 --> 01:15:27,029
Oh, come on. I tried
to cover for you. I honestly did.

918
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:29,632
Then Jory got to her.

919
01:15:30,601 --> 01:15:32,159
Jory got to my mother?

920
01:15:32,336 --> 01:15:33,860
- God! That is aw-
- No!

921
01:15:34,038 --> 01:15:35,801
- Jenny!
- Jenny?

922
01:15:35,973 --> 01:15:37,201
- She's here?
- Yes.

923
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:38,967
Where is she?
What did she say?

924
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:42,704
Does she want to get back together?
This is great.

925
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,440
Not, not really.

926
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,865
Hello, I-

927
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,936
If you say another word,
I swear to God, I'll lose my nerve.

928
01:16:18,182 --> 01:16:20,150
- Diane!
- No. Dad?

929
01:16:20,318 --> 01:16:22,445
- Did a girl named Jenny call?
- No.

930
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,613
Son, I think your mother
is gonna divorce me.

931
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,954
- What?
- I think your mother has left.

932
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:33,427
- You mean she's not back yet?
- Back from where?

933
01:16:34,365 --> 01:16:37,562
- From wherever she went.
- No.

934
01:16:37,735 --> 01:16:39,202
And tonight of all nights.

935
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:41,531
At a party where
every person we know...

936
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:44,971
...is gonna watch a marriage
of 20 years go down the tube.

937
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:47,077
- No!
- Yes.

938
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:49,475
- I bet she went to Tiki Joe's.
- Tiki Joe's?

939
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,707
To check on the last-minute details.
You know how she gets!

940
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:55,375
- I'm gonna stop her.
- What?

941
01:16:55,686 --> 01:16:59,588
Help her. While you get
ready to go. Okay! Oh, good.

942
01:17:01,559 --> 01:17:03,424
Get ready!

943
01:17:13,638 --> 01:17:15,902
You are very beautiful.

944
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:20,101
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

945
01:17:20,278 --> 01:17:21,939
I thought I could.

946
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:24,775
- But I just can't.
- I have respect for this.

947
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:27,850
Oh, well, thank you.
That's very nice of you.

948
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:32,080
- You are not cheap and easy.
- No. I tried, but it's just not me.

949
01:17:32,256 --> 01:17:34,918
- Forget pizza. I buy you real dinner.
- No.

950
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:36,753
Dinner and a movie.

951
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:39,123
- No. Thank you, no.
- I pay!

952
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:42,095
No! Look, I don't want
to sleep with you or date you.

953
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:44,291
I just want to leave now.

954
01:17:44,468 --> 01:17:48,234
- You mean, you say no to me?
- Yes, I say no and goodbye.

955
01:17:48,406 --> 01:17:51,807
- You cannot leave.
- Oh, $200 dollars, right?

956
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:55,137
No, it's $ 12.50.
I give you coupon discount.

957
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,810
You give coupons?

958
01:17:57,982 --> 01:18:00,177
Not for everyone. A privilege.

959
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:02,683
You are not the regular
American woman.

960
01:18:02,853 --> 01:18:05,253
And I am not the regular delivery boy.

961
01:18:05,423 --> 01:18:07,755
Oh, my God. You're not?

962
01:18:07,925 --> 01:18:09,984
No. He asked me to come here...

963
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:12,459
...and say we have
no more anchovies.

964
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,825
But I cannot lie to you, my darling.

965
01:18:14,999 --> 01:18:18,230
- I have many anchovies for you-
- Oh, no! No! Please!

966
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,461
Oh, this is a horrible mistake.
I'm so-

967
01:18:20,638 --> 01:18:23,732
Oh, my God! Oh, you're just some-
Oh, my God!

968
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:26,741
You cannot not leave. Wait!

969
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:30,142
My anniversary party.
Oh, Joe's already there.

970
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:32,908
Oh, God! All those people!

971
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:42,587
Wait!

972
01:18:47,665 --> 01:18:49,530
- I'm such a jerk.
- Come on, Jenny.

973
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,728
I was so stupid to come here without
calling first. What was I thinking?

974
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:57,635
I hate to say it,
but the guy never appreciated you.

975
01:18:57,808 --> 01:18:59,935
I was just starting
to get over him too.

976
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:02,602
Jen, don't be so hard on yourself.

977
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,613
I mean, so you made a mistake.
Big deal.

978
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,478
You're a terrific person.

979
01:19:07,652 --> 01:19:12,146
You have everything going for you.
Hey, come on.

980
01:19:12,323 --> 01:19:14,587
Onward and upward, right?

981
01:19:14,759 --> 01:19:16,124
Yeah.

982
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,990
Yeah, I guess, I-

983
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:21,290
- Jory!
- You know, we'd be good together.

984
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,228
- Get off me!
- We both need it.

985
01:19:23,401 --> 01:19:24,663
Get off!

986
01:19:25,236 --> 01:19:26,533
Stop!

987
01:19:34,578 --> 01:19:37,570
Stop! Stop!

988
01:19:37,748 --> 01:19:39,238
Thank you so much.

989
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:43,319
You have just saved my life.
This guy was...

990
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:48,848
- No funny cash withdrawals.
- Me neither.

991
01:19:49,026 --> 01:19:51,586
Sleazeball's a pro.
He's gotta be paid somehow.

992
01:19:51,762 --> 01:19:54,595
- Well, he wouldn't accept credit cards.
- Hold it.

993
01:19:54,765 --> 01:19:59,668
I've got three charges for deliveries
from someplace called Señor Pizza.

994
01:20:00,638 --> 01:20:01,866
So?

995
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:05,873
Sold for 200 bucks a pop.
And Monica hates pizza.

996
01:20:07,912 --> 01:20:09,971
Wait a minute.

997
01:20:10,147 --> 01:20:12,741
- I got five of those.
- Oh, no.

998
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:17,751
No, Jesus Christ!

999
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:37,740
- I love you!
- Go away!

1000
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:43,571
- Are you crazy? You'll be killed!
- I don't care.

1001
01:20:43,748 --> 01:20:46,148
- I will die for your love!
- Move your hand!

1002
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:48,478
- I love you!
- Move that hand!

1003
01:20:48,652 --> 01:20:50,142
I love you!

1004
01:20:57,928 --> 01:21:01,694
He's probably some young beach-boy
stud. With a name like Jason...

1005
01:21:01,866 --> 01:21:03,857
Yeah, some poetry-reading wimp.

1006
01:21:04,034 --> 01:21:07,333
Whoever he is, he's gonna
get his face stomped.

1007
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,817
- Where's Tony?
- Tony?

1008
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:28,720
He never came back from his break.
Sal's on delivery. I'm all alone.

1009
01:21:28,893 --> 01:21:32,158
- Randy?
- Jenny.

1010
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:36,664
You look different.

1011
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:39,160
Since when do you notice that?

1012
01:21:40,237 --> 01:21:42,535
I see you've changed your style.

1013
01:21:42,706 --> 01:21:45,971
Oh, yes, I have.

1014
01:21:52,817 --> 01:21:55,513
- I missed you.
- Did you?

1015
01:21:56,387 --> 01:21:58,252
Yes.

1016
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:01,454
You bitch! Nobody plays
with me like that-

1017
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,616
- Leave her alone!
- You and me, bozo!

1018
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,421
All right! Outside! Outside!

1019
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:07,689
Take it outside! Come on.
Come on.

1020
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:15,835
- Don't do this.
- Jenny, stay out of it.

1021
01:22:20,578 --> 01:22:23,741
- No watches and no rings.
- No chains.

1022
01:22:23,914 --> 01:22:27,475
It's got extra everything.
Sausages and the jalapeño peppers-

1023
01:22:27,918 --> 01:22:30,182
Where's your delivery guy?

1024
01:22:31,255 --> 01:22:33,723
Out...
Out back.

1025
01:22:33,891 --> 01:22:36,689
Where you going?
Hey, wait a minute. Where you-?

1026
01:22:36,861 --> 01:22:38,158
Come on, come on.

1027
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:41,890
- Randy, can we just get out of here?
- This is something I gotta do.

1028
01:22:42,066 --> 01:22:44,864
What are you, chicken?
What are you waiting for?

1029
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:47,465
Jeez!

1030
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:49,230
Hey, wait! Wait!

1031
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:51,636
You're Joe Bodek's son!

1032
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:53,706
Yeah.

1033
01:22:53,878 --> 01:22:55,937
Okay. All right.

1034
01:22:56,113 --> 01:22:58,206
I'm Randy Bodek.

1035
01:22:58,382 --> 01:23:01,545
Hey, what is this?
Leave him alone! It's not him.

1036
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,180
He's a homo!

1037
01:23:07,558 --> 01:23:10,220
All right, Bodek. You ready
to get your ass kicked?

1038
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,797
Oh, no.

1039
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:22,402
I'm talking to him.

1040
01:23:30,814 --> 01:23:34,807
Your stud days are over, pretty boy!

1041
01:23:42,693 --> 01:23:43,921
Right in the face!

1042
01:23:55,205 --> 01:23:57,196
Okay, let's go!

1043
01:24:01,512 --> 01:24:05,471
- What is going on?
- It's a long story.

1044
01:24:11,155 --> 01:24:13,988
Your luggage, pal. Luggage!

1045
01:24:17,361 --> 01:24:19,921
- Cocktail, Mr. Bodek?
- Yeah, why not?

1046
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:26,667
Hi. How y'all doing?

1047
01:24:32,843 --> 01:24:36,506
Hey, Joe, congratulations.
Where's the better half?

1048
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,409
Wish I knew.

1049
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:52,025
Oh, my God!

1050
01:25:36,774 --> 01:25:38,833
What do you think
of your lover-boy now?

1051
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:42,103
He's delivered
his last pizza around here.

1052
01:25:43,213 --> 01:25:44,646
Who is this?

1053
01:25:45,049 --> 01:25:48,246
Pizza? Looking for the guy
who delivers pizza?

1054
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:53,486
Well, it wasn't exactly how
I planned to spend my summer.

1055
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:55,619
Just happened.

1056
01:25:58,328 --> 01:25:59,920
You hate me?

1057
01:26:00,898 --> 01:26:04,698
How am I supposed to feel, knowing
that you slept with all those women?

1058
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:08,201
Well, see, the weird thing is,
I didn't sleep with all of them.

1059
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,966
They wanted somebody
to make them feel special.

1060
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:12,665
Come on.

1061
01:26:14,978 --> 01:26:18,607
There are a lot of women out there
who don't believe in love anymore.

1062
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:23,284
You know, all they wanted was
a little romance and a little respect.

1063
01:26:23,454 --> 01:26:26,048
So I tried to give
them what they missed.

1064
01:26:27,124 --> 01:26:28,716
You did all this for them?

1065
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,259
No! I did it because
I had to pay my own tuition.

1066
01:26:33,263 --> 01:26:34,855
You know.

1067
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,799
Because I had to get back to you.

1068
01:26:39,303 --> 01:26:42,898
And how would you feel if I said:

1069
01:26:43,774 --> 01:26:46,902
"I slept with all these guys
this summer, but, hey...

1070
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,512
...I did it for you"?

1071
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,308
I'd hate it.

1072
01:26:55,619 --> 01:26:58,315
Just take me to the bus station.

1073
01:26:59,356 --> 01:27:01,051
Okay.

1074
01:27:01,992 --> 01:27:04,654
- I just have to make one stop first.
- Where?

1075
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:07,854
Well, I gotta save
my parents' marriage.

1076
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:28,346
Hey!

1077
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:31,844
That woman nuts?

1078
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:33,785
That's my mother!

1079
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,822
- Hello. Diane?
- Hi, hi, hi.

1080
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,032
- Randy!
- Eyes front.

1081
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:50,633
Hey!

1082
01:27:53,744 --> 01:27:56,645
- Who was that?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

1083
01:28:01,718 --> 01:28:03,310
Joe!

1084
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,580
Oh, Joe! Oh, Joe!

1085
01:28:09,092 --> 01:28:11,652
- Joe, I'm so sorry.
- No, honey, I am so sorry.

1086
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:14,491
- I am so sorry.
- Later, Linda.

1087
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:17,259
- See, your husband-
- No problem, Linda. Okay?

1088
01:28:17,434 --> 01:28:19,868
- Go away. Go away! Go away!
- Joe.

1089
01:28:20,037 --> 01:28:22,835
Okay. Okay.

1090
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,670
Hi, I'm Brad.
Frosty beverage?

1091
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:27,174
No. No frosty beverage.

1092
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:28,606
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1093
01:28:29,746 --> 01:28:31,543
Look out!

1094
01:28:35,652 --> 01:28:38,052
So this is the man
who stands between us.

1095
01:28:38,222 --> 01:28:41,055
Tony! Tony!
What are you doing here?

1096
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:43,489
- I need to speak with you.
- But-

1097
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,719
Now look, I've been thinking this over.

1098
01:28:45,896 --> 01:28:47,261
- I'm your father.
- I know.

1099
01:28:47,431 --> 01:28:51,527
You're my son and I love you,
and it's really okay that you're gay.

1100
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,226
- Gay?
- What?

1101
01:28:53,403 --> 01:28:56,702
I don't think this is the place
for your lover to make a scene.

1102
01:28:56,874 --> 01:28:59,104
- Lover?
- What are you talking about?

1103
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:01,938
I know all about you
and this guy Alex, here.

1104
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:04,276
- But I'm Tony.
- You're who?

1105
01:29:04,448 --> 01:29:07,076
I meet this woman
when I deliver pizza for him.

1106
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,279
For you?

1107
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:12,386
- You're the regular delivery boy?
- Yeah, see-

1108
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,786
- So, what is this guy doing here?
- Well-

1109
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,222
- I love her.
- What did you say?

1110
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,157
- She needs a real man.
- Oh, no.

1111
01:29:19,329 --> 01:29:20,819
- Are you talking to me?
- Dad!

1112
01:29:20,998 --> 01:29:24,434
- No, no. Wait, Dad! Dad!
- No! No! No!

1113
01:29:25,168 --> 01:29:28,296
- He better be in there, kid.
- Yeah, he better.

1114
01:29:30,474 --> 01:29:32,442
Joe! Joe! Joe!

1115
01:29:32,609 --> 01:29:34,577
Come on. Come on.
Calm down.

1116
01:29:39,349 --> 01:29:41,408
There he is!
That's him!

1117
01:30:06,843 --> 01:30:08,310
- Randy!
- What?

1118
01:30:08,478 --> 01:30:10,810
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Come on.

1119
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:14,945
Come here. You come here.
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

1120
01:30:19,356 --> 01:30:21,187
No!

1121
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,653
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

1122
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:31,867
Oh, Felicia.

1123
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:46,146
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1124
01:30:46,616 --> 01:30:49,517
You son of a bitch!

1125
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:52,581
My favorite toupee!

1126
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:54,848
Mom!
Excuse me.

1127
01:31:10,707 --> 01:31:12,800
Let me in there.

1128
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:20,106
Kid, you're gone.
Your days are numbered.

1129
01:31:20,283 --> 01:31:22,046
He's getting away!

1130
01:31:40,737 --> 01:31:41,999
Come here.

1131
01:31:42,172 --> 01:31:44,072
All right.
What the hell is all this?

1132
01:31:44,241 --> 01:31:46,869
- Your son has been porking my wife!
- Mine too.

1133
01:31:47,044 --> 01:31:48,375
Same here.

1134
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,206
- I thought you were gay!
- No!

1135
01:31:51,515 --> 01:31:53,380
Mom!

1136
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:57,687
Mom, I don't believe this!

1137
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:05,422
Hold it, you three.
Hold it right there.

1138
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:11,031
- Oh, wait. Wait. Mom? Dad?
- Yes.

1139
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:12,998
Excuse me.

1140
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:16,967
This is Jenny. We've been living
together for two semesters.

1141
01:32:17,941 --> 01:32:20,034
And I'm in love with her.

1142
01:32:20,677 --> 01:32:23,510
You have no idea
how happy I am to meet you.

1143
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,477
- It's nice to meet you.
- Beautiful.

1144
01:32:25,649 --> 01:32:27,344
- How pretty you are.
- Thank you.

1145
01:32:27,517 --> 01:32:29,348
- This is great.
- This is beautiful.

1146
01:32:29,519 --> 01:32:30,884
- Come on, let's go.
- Go.

1147
01:32:31,054 --> 01:32:33,579
- Frosty beverage?
- Thank you.

1148
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:40,696
- So you're a friend of his?
- Best friend.

1149
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:44,463
There's this song.
It goes:

1150
01:32:50,407 --> 01:32:53,865
That's it!
Can you play that?

1151
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,589
- Come on.
- I don't know.

1152
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,352
Come on.

1153
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:16,231
Jenny, I'm gonna
give the money back.

1154
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:18,629
I don't want it.
I'm gonna keep my day job.

1155
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:20,793
I'm gonna come
and see you on weekends.

1156
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:23,701
Forget about it.
You're going back to college.

1157
01:33:23,874 --> 01:33:25,739
You got some idea
what you're doing.

1158
01:33:25,909 --> 01:33:28,377
Oh, I do.
I want to major in premed...

1159
01:33:28,545 --> 01:33:33,482
...minor in Japanese,
study some photography courses...

1160
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:37,477
- I think we'll talk about this tomorrow.
- Okay.

1161
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,383
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1162
01:33:39,556 --> 01:33:41,683
Where did you learn this?
Never mind.

1163
01:33:41,858 --> 01:33:44,156
I don't want to know.

1164
01:35:07,844 --> 01:35:10,005
Oh, by the way, the husbands?

1165
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,978
Their wives did show up
to bail them out.

1166
01:35:13,149 --> 01:35:17,916
Claude and Monica, they decided
to forget the whole thing.

1167
01:35:19,155 --> 01:35:23,387
Joyce and Reed, well,
they weren't gonna forget anything.

1168
01:35:26,463 --> 01:35:28,431
But they decided to make up anyway.

1169
01:35:29,032 --> 01:35:31,091
Kyoko was gonna bail out Harry.

1170
01:35:31,268 --> 01:35:33,930
Then it hit her,
"Why ruin a good thing?"

1171
01:35:34,738 --> 01:35:37,571
Hey, get your hands off of me!

1172
01:35:37,741 --> 01:35:39,709
I want to talk to my wife!
