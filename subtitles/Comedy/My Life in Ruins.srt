1
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,692
Let's go.

2
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,567
They're laughing at your name.

3
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,733
So what? Laughing is good.

4
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,148
Your elevator is broken.

5
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,882
Anthony Quinn.

6
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,540
You fat tourists.

7
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,939
I could give you idiots

8
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,484
authentic Greek items made
by my grandmother.

9
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,458
But you dummies
want this cheap crap.

10
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,063
This junk is made in Korea.

11
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,989
By prisoners.

12
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,829
For you, I'll double the price.

12
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,508
And to your guide, a kickback.

13
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:18,816
How much do you want for it?

14
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,144
Twenty Euros.

15
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,114
Orgy!

16
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,723
I get the tour guide!
