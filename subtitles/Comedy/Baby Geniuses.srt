1
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,523
He's out.

2
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:39,729
What do you mean?

3
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,322
Sylvester. He's escaped.

4
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:42,598
Impossible.

5
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,278
Maximum alert.

6
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,329
Damn it!

7
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,601
He's been spotted on the mezzanine.

8
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:55,605
Secure perimeters.

9
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,482
Alert topside. Initiate probers. Move!

10
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,117
Move! Move!

11
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,242
He's exiting the building. Move out.

12
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:14,528
There he is. Nail him.

13
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,440
He's heading for the maze.
We've got him.

14
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,845
Cut him off!

15
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,448
Toward the fountain.

16
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,325
There he goes. He's headed back.

17
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,967
Coming back, toward the fountain.

18
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:33,967
He's approaching the fountain.
Seal him off.

19
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,127
We've got him.

20
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,799
Be careful. He's dangerous.

21
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:45,128
There's nowhere to go, Sly.

22
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,522
Give it up.

23
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,729
Security.

24
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,369
Go.

25
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,207
The rest of you, come with me.

26
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:11,648
Check the perimeters.

27
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:37,888
Nice try, pal.

28
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,049
Take him.

29
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:58,689
Stop him!

30
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:27,202
That'll be quite enough, Sylvester.

31
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:28,764
There you are, doc.

32
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,727
He nearly made it this time.

33
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,279
Tomorrow you will explain how
a mere toddler manages to escape...

34
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,767
from a laboratory
25 stories below ground.

35
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,567
What kind of kids you breeding?

36
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,086
Nearly blew us away with karate.

37
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,048
Remarkable.

38
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:49,882
Once again we demonstrate
the superiority of the Kinder method.

39
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,367
Take him to the secret lab.

40
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,559
Operation Twincomp, access requested.

41
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,161
Analysing voiceprint.

42
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,001
Review proiect in summary form.

43
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,045
Twincomp...

44
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:19,686
is designed to prove the superiority
of the Kinder method of child rearing.

45
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,519
To accomplish this, two years ago,
twin brothers S ylvester and Whit...

46
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,488
were born to a specially selected
surrogate mother.

47
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,442
Director of operations,
Dr. E lena Kinder, arranged...

48
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,766
for Whit to be adopted
into the home of her niece...

49
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:37,120
and her niece's husband,
Dr. Dan Bobbins.

50
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,526
Sly was placed in the Babyco
Hyper-Developmental Habitat...

51
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:43,522
to be raised under the guidance
of the Kinder method.

52
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,886
Summarize operational protocol.

53
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,478
/t is imperative for the integrity
of this experiment...

54
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,926
that no one ever discover
that Sly and Whit are twins...

55
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,046
especially the boys themselves.

56
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,565
A comparative evaluation of the boys
will occur by age 6...

57
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:01,404
to establish conclusively the
superiority of the Kinder method.

58
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:03,368
Updating experiment log.

59
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:07,158
Last night, Baby Sylvester made his way
up 25 stories, undetected...

60
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,764
escaping from his habitat
in a secret lab.

61
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,848
Even though it now appears
that Sly cannot be controlled...

62
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:17,446
Dr. Kinder will be pleased by this
display of skill and intelligence.

63
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,369
I, however, remain apprehensive.

64
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,801
Under the guidance of its chairman,
Dr. E lena Kinder...

65
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:36,166
Baby Geniuses /nc.
And its parent company Babyco...

66
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,123
are the world's largest manufacturer
of products for the baby.

67
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,162
Babyco is also a vital
charitable organization...

68
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,964
which sponsors orphanages
in 10 countries around the globe.

69
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,481
The latest one dedicated iust a week
ago, right here in Pasadena.

70
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,124
Today we are deeper
in Dr. Kinder's debt...

71
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:58,167
for the extraordinary gift.

72
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:02,687
Joyworld, the world's largest
indoor amusement park.

73
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,957
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the founder and CEO of Babyco...

74
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,808
my friend, Dr. Elena Kinder.

75
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,244
Thank you.

76
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,489
Thank you.

77
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,527
I'm gonna break out.

78
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:24,082
You can't get hives just because
your aunt comes into the room.

79
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,042
I can't help it. She starts lying.
I start breaking out.

80
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:30,127
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all
for coming here today.

81
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,759
We at Babyco believe that babies
have a language of their own.

82
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,761
We're dedicated to proving it.

83
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,287
Our research in infant potentiality
is the model of the field.

84
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,561
But in the final analysis...

85
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,557
the simple answer as to
why we do what we do is...

86
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,327
we love babies.

87
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,243
Loves babies.

88
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:52,609
Loves money.

89
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,284
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's have a party.

90
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,323
Welcome to Joyworld.

91
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,041
Look, it's a roller coaster!

92
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,962
So the park, of course,
will be free for all children.

93
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,200
But the money collected
from adults...

94
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,640
will go to the Babyco
Worldwide Orphanage Foundation.

95
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,357
Is this a terrific lady, or what?

96
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,282
This is kind of great.

97
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:42,561
She does a lot of good.

98
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,845
She's good at stealing your ideas.

99
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,089
Attention!

100
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:47,887
Has anyone lost a baby?

101
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,120
A very big baby?

102
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,128
Ladies and gentlemen...

103
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:53,597
Baby Bunting!

104
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,160
That looks like your illustration.

105
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,088
That looks like Boo Boo Boy
from Baby's Good Day.

106
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,843
Bunting came into this world
just last week.

107
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,958
Now, everything is fully controlled...

108
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,598
by our computerized command centre.

109
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,204
Hiya, fellas.

110
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,080
And now go to crossover mode.

111
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,361
Okay, Richard.
Give me Baby Bunting vocal.

112
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,681
What's your name, little girl?

113
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,362
Erin. My name is Erin.

114
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,048
What a sweet name.

115
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,798
Give Baby Bunting a big hug.

116
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,242
And cue burp...

117
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:29,489
now.

118
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:34,323
Well! Think about changing his diaper.

119
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,721
Come on, honey. This way.

120
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,482
Kids, good news!

121
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,839
Robotic Santa and the robotic elves...

122
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,240
are waiting to greet you
at the robotic North Pole.

123
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:47,925
/n fact, we have robotic entertainers
located throughout the park...

124
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,206
all controlled from our
central command centre.

125
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,526
Okay, let's cue up for Robo-Zoo.

126
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,808
And here we have the world's
most unique animal farm.

127
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,488
We call it Robo-Zoo.

128
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,965
Each child gets a remote control...

129
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,484
to control
their own robotic animal.

130
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:06,163
Why wouldn't you have
real animals in your zoo?

131
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,639
Good heavens! Anybody could do that.

132
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,081
Plastic zoo.
That's definitely Aunt Elena's idea.

133
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,280
At least she could have introduced you.

134
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,163
She steals from your books,
from your research.

135
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:18,409
/'m flattered.

136
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,089
She knows about your breakthrough
in infant language.

137
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,399
She'll probably try to steal that too.

138
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,680
You make her sound
like Attila the Hun.

139
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:30,924
Honey, we're barely able to afford your
research facility and the preschool.

140
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,241
She does this all the time.
/t's iust not right.

141
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,519
I think she's just goal-oriented.

142
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,845
Her goal is to take
over the world. I know.

143
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,205
I lived with her
for more than half my life.

144
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,405
And look how great you turned out.

145
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,478
Lenny?

146
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,957
Where are you going
with those children?

147
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,966
What children? These are not children.

148
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,087
These are plumbers.
They're gonna help me fix the sink.

149
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,289
Good-luck kiss.

150
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,320
With this house, you need more than luck.

151
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:15,888
Okay, let's get to work.

152
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,399
Just as you thought, our line
of expandable infant clothing...

153
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:22,362
has elicited a tremendous
response in our first pass.

154
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:25,760
Huge numbers from the Kmart
and Wal-Mart shoppers.

155
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,921
That should increase our market share.
Put it in production.

156
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,399
Tell me of the new ones.
How many possibles?

157
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,765
- Eight show potential.
- Eight out of 500?

158
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,638
Elena, statistically, genius occurs
once in 10,000 individuals.

159
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:41,644
We expected only five geniuses
from the Pasadena Orphanage.

160
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:42,889
We've got eight.

161
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,609
Don't tell me how well we're doing.

162
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,648
Our orphanages and secret labs
are costing us 200 million a year.

163
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,440
The sole purpose of these orphanages is
to allow us to cull out the geniuses...

164
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:55,765
the natural leaders.
- We'll do better.

165
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,280
I'll settle for a few more
like Sylvester.

166
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:00,366
Look at what that crackerjack did.

167
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:04,164
All our emphasis has been on
keeping the world out of a secret lab.

168
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:07,321
No one ever considered
the possibility of a baby escaping.

169
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:11,801
Just look at this wonderful world we've
created for our babies to grow up in.

170
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:14,438
Why would anyone
want to escape from here?

171
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:19,285
The one who did is in the work station,
no doubt planning his next escape.

172
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:27,848
Hello, Sylvester.

173
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,525
- What's he constructing?
- We don't know.

174
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,725
He builds all kinds
of extraordinary things.

175
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,278
For all kinds of extraordinary purposes.

176
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,207
Just look at that intensity.

177
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,565
There's no other baby like Sylvester.

178
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,328
Well, maybe one.

179
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,918
His twin, Whit?

180
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,358
Whit!

181
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,049
Mayday!

182
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,085
Whitley, where is helper number one?

183
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,604
Give me the lug wrench. Whit, hurry up.

184
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,202
Go! On the double!

185
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,328
Oh, mama!

186
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:06,838
Mama.

187
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:09,688
Listen, you monkey.

188
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:11,447
This is a monkey wrench!

189
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,482
Plumber's helper number one,
you're fired. Get out of town.

190
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,405
What is that terrible noise?

191
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,009
Noise to us.

192
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:24,808
But the computers analyse
every possible permutation.

193
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,002
What we hear as incoherent noise
may actually be a musical masterpiece.

194
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,400
Listen to our computer's
interpretation of Basil's playing.

195
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,049
That's remarkable.

196
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:39,758
It has all the complexities
of a symphony by Haydn or Beethoven.

197
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,044
If that's the case...

198
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:45,761
it's possible that what we hear
as baby talk is actually conversation.

199
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:50,566
Exactly. And look at this.
A child writing on a pad, right? No.

200
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,681
After checking all languages...

201
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,608
we found out they're writing
the cuneiform language.

202
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,521
They speak their own language.

203
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,765
They understand all others.

204
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:01,402
Now watch this.

205
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,000
Subject One speaks, and we
immediately see activity here...

206
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:10,046
in the lower limbic region...

207
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,519
while Subject Two, as he listens...

208
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,760
is active in the forebrain.

209
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:18,678
These babies are having a conversation.
We just don't understand them.

210
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,767
The instant a child begins
to speak in any known language...

211
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,647
the limbic activity ceases.

212
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:24,889
As though they forget.

213
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,965
Exactly. Bobbins was right.

214
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:30,360
What if the limbic activity
is not merely speech?

215
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,367
What if it's stored knowledge...

216
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,679
from an early-parent gene pool?

217
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,278
Passed from generation to generation.

218
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,529
Amazing!

219
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,520
They may know
the secrets of the universe.

220
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,000
The greatest
breakthrough in history!

221
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,209
Change humanity!

222
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,524
If we find the key to the human mind...

223
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,158
every child will be
educated in my method.

224
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,203
Every great mind will be ours to mold.

225
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,798
Let's get them all
into the amphitheatre.

226
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,357
Hello, my little baby geniuses.

227
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,439
What are we discussing today?

228
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:25,000
Could it be postmodern
ethical construction?

229
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,489
How about...

230
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:29,803
the mechanics of human knowledge?

231
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,240
My little Sly one.

232
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,448
Sly, tell me...

233
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:40,366
what are you thinking?

234
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,200
Come on. You can look at me.

235
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,008
What are you thinking?

236
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,847
What are you saying?

237
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,728
Enlighten me, my little Einstein.

238
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,607
What do you think?
Should I enlighten her?

239
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,568
She won't understand.

240
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,845
She doesn't speak our language.

241
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,886
But go ahead. Have fun.

242
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:10,082
Lead us through the wilderness,
my little warrior.

243
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:13,527
All right, all right. That does it.

244
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,920
Doc, if you're gonna talk
out of your ass all the time...

245
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,399
maybe you should wear
a bow tie on your butt.

246
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,286
Bow tie? On her butt?

247
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:24,443
On her butt?

248
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,199
That's disgusting, Sylvester.

249
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:31,449
You know...

250
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:35,284
you think because I don't understand
you, I don't understand what's going on.

251
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,959
Don't be too sure about that, honey.

252
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,798
Yeah, right. And don't call me honey.

253
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:43,802
Okay, Sly man, one.

254
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,687
Dr. Kinder, zip.

255
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,007
You're always busting her chops.

256
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:52,288
Are you kidding? Give me a break.
She's Darth Vader in a skirt.

257
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,679
Dr. Kinder's our benefactor.

258
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,357
Because of her,
there will be a new order...

259
00:15:57,609 --> 00:15:59,679
and we will be its leaders.

260
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,682
Don't have a cow, Basil.

261
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,448
Why do you talk like that?

262
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:05,958
Your syntax is atrocious.

263
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,399
It's because he watches TV all the time.

264
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:09,923
How does he do that?

265
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,041
He converts the monitors.

266
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:13,927
You ought to all watch TV.

267
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:16,239
Check out the real world,
like Jerry Springer.

268
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,489
And have fun.

269
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,605
This is exactly what Dr. Kinder...

270
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,208
is trying to overcome.

271
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:22,843
Moral decay.

272
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,962
Now you sound like Heep.

273
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,758
Discipline, discipline, discipline.

274
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:29,518
Reward and deprive.

275
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:32,643
Give the babies a crumb. Take it away.

276
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,087
Like Pavlov's dogs. Hold up the bone,
the doggies salivate.

277
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,527
If they behave,
give them a little gristle.

278
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,124
If you don't like it...

279
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,087
why don't you just leave?

280
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,842
He'll just take the next bus.

281
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,887
You're such a weasel, Basil.

282
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,245
Nice face, weasel.

283
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,242
You fool. Dr. Heep is watching.

284
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,677
Don't mess with the Sly man, Heepster.

285
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,408
We're back!

286
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,597
Dickie?

287
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:23,963
Where is he?

288
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,801
Carrie? Whit?

289
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,888
The kids aren't here.

290
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,926
Wait a minute. Hello?

291
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,728
Anybody?

292
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,120
Whit? Is that you?

293
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,084
What's this mess? Look at this water.

294
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,286
No fraternizing with the help!

295
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,089
Carrie, look at you.
You are soaking wet.

296
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,162
You are soaking wet. And look at Whit.

297
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,799
You know what? You two go for a swim...

298
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,519
and Uncle Lenny and I
are gonna have a little talk, okay?

299
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:02,169
This water here on the floor.
Is it dangerous?

300
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,161
Please. The power's out, anyway.

301
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,409
The power's out?

302
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:07,207
Great. Where's Dickie?

303
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,598
I don't know.

304
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,162
Nice 'do, Dickie.

305
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,724
You look like Mount Pepto-Bismol
just erupted.

306
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,607
Pink is cosmic, all right?

307
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,840
For the last time, my name ain't Dickie.

308
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,728
It's Ice Pick.
Would you people get that straight?

309
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,197
Ice Pick...

310
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:29,283
I love the creativity and imagination
that you've displayed here...

311
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,202
but no matter how outrageous
you act or you dress...

312
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,519
I'm not gonna fire you.
So give it a rest.

313
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,163
Love you, pal. Grab a mop.

314
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,800
He could use that pink one
he's got on his head.

315
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:48,924
Don't worry. He's just acting out.
We'll bring him around.

316
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,120
Can you tell me why
we're doing this again?

317
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:56,045
I promised Dan's brother we'd get him
through one job without getting canned.

318
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,764
I wish I could afford
a makeover like that.

319
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:03,287
These are the bills
that have to be paid this month...

320
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,087
but this baby...

321
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:06,847
is actually a check...

322
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:10,161
made out to your business
for 34 big ones.

323
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:12,322
Dollars, that is.

324
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,564
Why don't you collect
from some of these stiffs?

325
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:18,602
Their kids spend more time here
than they do at home.

326
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,119
One ring off Elena's finger,
you could run this place forever.

327
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,048
That being said, I'm resigning.
Effective immediately.

328
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,962
"Ice Pick." I like that,
but it's a little commonplace.

329
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,168
What about " Ice Pick the Great"
or "Saint Ice Pick"?

330
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:35,526
Or "The Great and Powerful
Wizard of Ice Pick"?

331
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,681
Very funny.
Seven on a scale of a thousand.

332
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,647
Nose Pick, let me ask you a question.

333
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:43,165
Why cut new holes?
Why not close up some of the old ones...

334
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:44,888
like your mouth?

335
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,843
What is that, an old hippie joke?

336
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:50,677
Wrong answer.
Don't you kids try that at home.

337
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,807
Margo, don't pull
on Dickie's earring, okay? Grow up.

338
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,728
Ice Pick is right.
Auntie Elena should help.

339
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:59,880
You're not supposed
to call her "auntie."

340
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:01,767
- Just Elena.
- What's it matter?

341
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,806
They can't understand me.

342
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,159
He does so much good.
I wish we could help.

343
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,167
I tried. I gave him
that idea subliminally...

344
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:10,529
about a new wing.

345
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,088
What's that do?

346
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,759
Increase their disposable income
by a factor of four at least.

347
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,563
Honey! Honey.

348
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,039
Did you hear that?
Tell me you heard that.

349
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,001
Whit. He just said, clear as a bell...

350
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,200
" by a factor of four at least."

351
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,598
And I understood it.

352
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,920
This is so great.

353
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,763
It was in their language,
but that was the phrase.

354
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,000
Those were the words,
" by a factor of four."

355
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,887
Beats the hell out of "dada."

356
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,522
- You got it?
- Right here.

357
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,248
- He's got it.
- Let's see it.

358
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,559
Oh, boy, home movies.

359
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,368
He understood our language.

360
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:56,088
Is that all you have to say?

361
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,808
Okay. Let me think.

362
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,359
He's going to want us to explain
the secrets of the universe.

363
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,486
That could be a real problem.

364
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,877
Well, you're in trouble
again, Sylvester.

365
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,247
Now go to sleep,
or it's Valium for you, pal.

366
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:21,481
There you are. You got that lock?

367
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,765
I've got the security bonder.

368
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:26,204
Yeah, right. Okay, Sly man...

369
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,441
I've got that surprise I promised.

370
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,640
Let's see you get out
of this one, Houdini.

371
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:33,327
Dumb and Dumber.

372
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,247
Lock and load.

373
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,924
Say "cheese."

374
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,724
Cheese!

375
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:45,882
We're currently experiencing
technical difficulties.

376
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,043
What the hell?

377
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,960
It's too easy.

378
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,277
What do you got?

379
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:59,924
A temporary loss of transmission
in Quadrant 4.

380
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:04,958
Lexi?

381
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:09,838
You're out.

382
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:11,523
Come with me.

383
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:13,806
I want to, but I'm too scared.

384
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:15,682
I'll take you to a mall.

385
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:17,004
A mall?

386
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:18,809
Really?

387
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,043
I can't.

388
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:25,037
Wait a minute.

389
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,885
I heard something. You better go.

390
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:30,604
Bye.

391
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,767
Take care of yourself.

392
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:35,717
I'll miss you.

393
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,321
Quadrant 2's down now.

394
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:49,682
Don't be late, babe.

395
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,524
Five, four, three...

396
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:54,881
two, one.

397
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,961
Diaper Express. Right on time.

398
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:17,128
Diaper gravy.

399
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:22,487
Well, give me liberty or give me death.

400
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:28,525
Not exactly aromatherapy.

401
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,006
I should've taken death.

402
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:41,087
Yeah, well, there it is
in plain English.

403
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:47,485
It sounds like baby talk, but he's
saying, " by a factor of four at least."

404
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:48,957
How can you tell?

405
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:53,407
It's like this language that I used to
speak, and I've just forgotten it...

406
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:55,048
except for once in a while.

407
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,166
I believe you, honey. Really, I do.

408
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,728
Can I go home now?

409
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:00,920
Yeah, but remember one thing, Nosebleed.

410
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:03,199
Dennis Rodman can afford
to look like roadkill.

411
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:05,485
He gets 18 rebounds a game.

412
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:14,998
Sweet dreams, robo-entertainers.
I don't wanna hear any snoring.

413
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,249
How were the crowds?

414
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:20,004
20,000 maniacs disguised as kids.
How do you think they were?

415
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,207
We had some glitches with Bunting.
Bring up his schematic.

416
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,768
Coming up.

417
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,524
The world's biggest video game.

418
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,920
The tracking software
needs to be recompiled.

419
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:35,480
If you don't have any dirty diapers...

420
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:37,122
Dive, dive!

421
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,077
- Come on. I'm looking bad.
- He tries so hard.

422
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:44,168
I hope when I go over and speak their
language, I'll remember to thank him.

423
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,762
How could you thank him?

424
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:50,201
When you cross over, you won't remember
anything you know now.

425
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,358
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.

426
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:56,117
Have you said "dada" or "mama" yet?

427
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,803
No, that's so stupid. I've decided...

428
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:03,207
the first time I speak, I'm gonna
quote the Gettysburg Address. Flat out.

429
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,125
No, you gotta say "dada."
Say it. He'll go nuts!

430
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,038
He'll call Mom and they'll both go nuts.

431
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,438
I don't know.

432
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,839
You gotta say it. Come on, do it.

433
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:20,638
I'll do it.

434
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,562
Dada!

435
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:35,086
You said "dada."

436
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,967
She said "dada"! I got it on video.

437
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:42,080
I can't believe it! I missed it!

438
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:45,002
- Where is she?
- Come on, girl. Where is she?

439
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:47,401
My little sweetie.

440
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,718
My little doll.

441
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:50,482
- Told you.
- Say "dada."

442
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:53,402
- Can you say "mama"?
- Watch this. Mama!

443
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:55,364
She said it!

444
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:57,798
She did, she did.

445
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,645
What are you feeding those kids anyway?

446
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:08,004
Too much.

447
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:11,486
- Happy trails.
- Okay, take care.

448
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:19,728
Diaper gravy.

449
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,678
This is awesome!

450
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,522
Where are the chicks?

451
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:57,285
Hasta la vista, baby.

452
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:13,040
All right! Look out, world.

453
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,329
Sly man's here!

454
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:21,559
The night is young. And so am I.

455
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:28,522
Diaper gravy.

456
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:37,241
Having that strange feeling again?

457
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:39,559
Yeah. Like somebody's calling me.

458
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,202
It sure happens a lot.
What are they saying?

459
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:52,168
I don't know. But it sure is scary.

460
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:27,926
Whose little boy are you?

461
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,118
- Whit, what's wrong?
- What is it, sweetie?

462
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,369
Hey, come here.

463
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:36,648
Did something scare you?

464
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,118
Come on.

465
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:43,925
- Let's take you upstairs.
- It's almost bedtime. Let's go.

466
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:47,007
Down to the last
cleaning person, you have passed...

467
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,162
the most stringent
security check ever devised!

468
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,360
You each receive
salaries 10 times...

469
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,686
that of similar positions
in other companies.

470
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:56,964
Why?

471
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:59,769
You are part of the most
momentous experiment...

472
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,479
in the history of corporate
research and development!

473
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,158
You are entrusted...

474
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:06,643
with that knowledge...

475
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,484
and the responsibility
that goes with it.

476
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,488
And you have failed that responsibility.

477
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,447
Now I don't care how, or what you do.

478
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:20,199
Get Sylvester back.

479
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:23,799
Yes, sir, you're someone's
little boy, all right.

480
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:28,042
And there's going to be a reward,
and I'm going to be the rewardee.

481
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,962
I'm going to take real good care of you.

482
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,724
Reward? Hell, forget reward.

483
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:37,122
Let's talk ransom.
Yeah, that's what we'll do.

484
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,566
Ransom and easy street.

485
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,960
And if they don't come through...

486
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,404
Well, let's not think about that.

487
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:46,488
Looking good.

488
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,168
Come back when you're ready
to play in the bigs.

489
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,046
I gotta get a disguise.

490
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,282
Good evening.

491
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,318
Good evening.

492
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,245
What? This is a fashion statement.

493
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:21,489
You see that?

494
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:23,367
It looked like a kid.

495
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:25,088
That's a baby.

496
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,159
This disguise sucks.

497
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:30,362
Taxi!

498
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,169
Hey, babe.

499
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,005
Where are we going?

500
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:49,565
Since I can't walk, I guess we're
going wherever my mother's going.

501
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:50,998
Is that friendly?

502
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,677
What does this look like?
The welcome wagon?

503
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:55,038
Look, I got a problem.

504
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,324
Take off your clothes.

505
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:59,447
Okay, but at least you could
take me to dinner first.

506
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:01,162
Oy, a comedian.

507
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:02,409
Yikes!

508
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,441
Who designed this dress?
Larry, Moe and Curly?

509
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:36,889
Call me.

510
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,166
Oh, no. It's Elena's goons.

511
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,801
Don't forget, I'm listed.

512
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,642
Merry Christmas, Morty.
See you tomorrow.

513
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,209
Good night, boss.

514
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:56,318
Sure glad she wasn't wearing heels.

515
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,448
One umbrella one
Two umbrella two...

516
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,362
- Let's go upstairs to the zoo
- Good night, Amanda.

517
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,918
Good night, Rachel.

518
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:08,318
Sweet dreams.

519
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:12,801
That was beautiful.

520
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:14,678
Sleep tight, you guys.

521
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,526
Yeah, there we go.

522
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:20,047
We'll watch them till you come up.

523
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,400
- Why don't we have another?
- What?

524
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,758
Baby.

525
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,283
I tell you what.

526
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:30,039
You carry it for 41/2 months and
I'll carry it for 41/2 months.

527
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:32,280
Deal. Let's start now.

528
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:33,803
Honey...

529
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:37,321
Honey, we adopted Whit...

530
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,999
because we thought that we
couldn't have children of our own.

531
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:44,286
And then we had Carrie.
She was our little miracle baby.

532
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,281
And miracles can re-occur.

533
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:49,282
Well, let's not talk
about that right now, okay?

534
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,003
Maybe next year.

535
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:52,762
Now, sweetheart...

536
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:56,121
love of my life,
father of my children.

537
00:33:57,489 --> 00:34:01,084
Did you tell Mr. Wilson
that we wanted a $50,000 loan...

538
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,523
for a new wing?

539
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:03,963
Oh, yeah, that.

540
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,324
Oh, yeah, that.

541
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:08,521
- I meant to show you something.
- We're behind on the mortgage.

542
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,521
We have to go to the bank and beg.

543
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,840
I just want you to look at some numbers.

544
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:16,923
Right now we get $300 a month for each
baby in the research program, right?

545
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:19,524
Right. If we take in 10 more babies...

546
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:23,644
we qualify as a Chapter 40
research corporation...

547
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,607
and then we get $900 a baby.

548
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,123
Nine hundred?

549
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:28,369
So...

550
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,366
the 10 new babies, our six...

551
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:34,405
that's 14,400 a month,
2,000 a month for the loan.

552
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:37,561
Even with more help,
we'll still operate above break-even.

553
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,999
We can do more research,
take in more babies...

554
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:41,569
lose less money.

555
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:44,528
This is amazing.
This actually makes sense.

556
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:46,598
Wait a minute.

557
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:50,319
You don't have a single cell in your
entire brain devoted to business.

558
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:51,848
How did you come up with this?

559
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:55,845
Actually, I don't think I did.

560
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:57,802
I think it was...

561
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,049
Whit.

562
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:01,568
Whit told you this business plan?

563
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:05,882
Well, not tell exactly.
It was just... It came to me.

564
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:08,324
When I was working with him,
it kind of...

565
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,561
jumped out of his brain
and landed in mine.

566
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:13,880
I went to the pamphlets. It works.

567
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:17,086
Kid knows his business.

568
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,961
Got some better news.

569
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:22,129
What?

570
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,565
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house...

571
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:29,085
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

572
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,329
Or a kid.

573
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:32,559
Or a toddler.

574
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:48,524
Okay, Charlie, they're all out
for the night. Lock it up.

575
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:52,680
Sly's in the house!

576
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,248
King of the mall!

577
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:55,849
Macy's.

578
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:58,799
Damn! I didn't bring
my credit cards.

579
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:02,129
Shop till you drop.

580
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:11,525
Video games. My kingdom
for some video games.

581
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,208
What have / got?

582
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,729
Baby Guess.

583
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:30,487
I can get out of drag.

584
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,478
Smoking!

585
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,761
He shoots. He scores!

586
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,961
- World Facts for 800, please.
- Answer. * Daily Double.

587
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:50,883
You're close to the lead.

588
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:54,525
Donna moved ahead a while ago,
but you're iust $100 away.

589
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:56,088
/'ll wager 1, 100, please.

590
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:59,162
For a $1, 000 lead,
here's the clue in World Facts.

591
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:03,527
"Discovered by David Livingstone,
Botswana's Lake Ngami...

592
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:06,368
lies in the northern part
of this desert."

593
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:07,644
What is the Kalahari?

594
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:09,409
What is the Gobi?

595
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,167
No. Wrong part of the world.

596
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:12,888
What is the Kalahari?

597
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:15,842
All right, that takes you
to 4,800. Pick again.

598
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:19,522
Do you think we've lived before?

599
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,919
I don't know, honey. That's your area.

600
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:25,242
The Tibetans believe that
when we're born again...

601
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:28,401
we retain universal knowledge
for the first two years.

602
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:31,288
Then we learn to talk
and we forget it all.

603
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:32,848
They call it "crossing over."

604
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:35,887
I'm doing a crossword here.
Universal knowledge can wait.

605
00:38:36,129 --> 00:38:37,278
No, just think.

606
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,446
What if our babies
have all the answers to life?

607
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:45,568
I'd settle for 28 across. What was it
that Miss Muffet sat on again?

608
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,208
Her tuffet.

609
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:50,520
What the hell is a tuffet anyway?

610
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:52,277
You got me.

611
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:56,918
When you tap into universal knowledge,
you find out and let me know.

612
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:07,201
Lexi, you should've been here, kid.

613
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,887
What? You never heard
of Weight Watchers?

614
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:38,688
Diaper rodeo!

615
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:41,482
On your mark. Get set. Go!

616
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,484
- Here goes Old Faithful.
- Sprang a leak!

617
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,128
Come here, sweetie.

618
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:58,488
- A winner.
- Time!

619
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,597
Rotator cuff, rotator cuff injury.

620
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,127
May the wrath of Shiva descend upon you.

621
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:25,678
Stick to your rapping, Ice Shtick...

622
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:29,046
and leave the wisecracks
to the people with IQs over 40.

623
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:31,525
It's not rap. It's mantra.

624
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:35,444
Junior, I was chanting mantras
before you were born.

625
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:40,361
You were chanting mantras
before Buddha was born.

626
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:42,204
Pretty...

627
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,003
That's pretty good.

628
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,207
Christmas shopping. Pray for me.

629
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,007
Want me to take the kids?

630
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:50,809
You can leave Carrie.
I'm going to run some stats.

631
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,164
Okay, come here.

632
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,607
You're going to love it.

633
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,722
That's a car. You can't
have a car for Christmas.

634
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:05,848
It's a little too expensive. Well,
maybe a little dinky car would be good.

635
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:23,598
What the hell was that?
I think I just had a kid.

636
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:42,727
Babyco 1, he's been spotted.

637
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:44,528
He's heading your way.

638
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:48,763
Busted.

639
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:12,166
Right up to the tunnel.

640
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:13,409
Go on.

641
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:26,889
We're on him.

642
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,728
Hey, buddy.

643
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:48,448
Come on, kid.

644
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,923
Give it up.

645
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,925
I hope you got a kick out of that.

646
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:23,603
Whittie, you there?

647
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,043
Over here.

648
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:30,448
Sweetie?

649
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,567
You still in there?

650
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:34,364
Where'd he go?

651
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:47,924
What was that scream? Was that you?

652
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,446
Sweetie, what are you looking at?

653
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,647
I thought we dressed you in overalls.
That's strange.

654
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:59,168
My little sugar.

655
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:01,202
Were you scared again?

656
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:05,681
Come on. I know what's gonna
cheer you up. Mommy knows.

657
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:24,717
Tears?

658
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:28,246
Could this be guilt
for threatening our great work?

659
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,129
Put him down.

660
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:37,648
I want you to see this boy...

661
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,205
who has jeopardized
everything we've worked for.

662
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:45,163
Serves him right.

663
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:49,482
Why don't you go talk to your computers,
Basil? They understand you.

664
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:51,008
They don't like him either.

665
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:53,439
All right, Sylvester, go to your room.

666
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,207
We'll settle this later.

667
00:44:57,729 --> 00:45:01,039
For heaven's sakes,
someone get him out of my sight!

668
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:19,478
I've never seen him like this before.
Go run some of that off, honey.

669
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:21,043
Watch out for that rope.

670
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:25,567
You know, I gave him a couple of slurps
of my ice cream and he just went nuts.

671
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:29,518
Dan, come out here.

672
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:37,361
I don't know what you feed him,
but where can I get some?

673
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,444
How does he do that?

674
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:48,922
Sugar high. You should've seen him
at Baskin-Robbins.

675
00:45:49,169 --> 00:45:51,046
We've been banned for life.

676
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:59,086
Well, he seems okay.

677
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:01,881
I'll have a talk with him.

678
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:16,720
What is wrong with you?

679
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:20,082
I'm the executive director
of a madhouse.

680
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:30,477
What's wrong?

681
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:38,961
Nothing ever scares Sly.

682
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:42,200
I just want him to stop crying.

683
00:46:46,049 --> 00:46:48,119
She's still upset, honey.

684
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:51,042
It's all right.
Just go to sleep, Carrie.

685
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,127
You'll be all right.

686
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:55,878
- There we are.
- Okay, you sleep tight.

687
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:02,361
First Whit, and now Carrie.
Must be contagious.

688
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:06,808
Night, guys.

689
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:10,605
Had any of those weird feelings lately?

690
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:12,362
- What?
- You heard me.

691
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:14,327
Lighten up, will you?

692
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:15,678
You're not my brother.

693
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:18,244
You fooled my mom and dad,
but you don't fool me.

694
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:19,558
What do you mean?

695
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:22,319
- You're not my brother.
- Don't be dumb.

696
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:26,924
Jerk.

697
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:28,808
She's gonna be trouble.

698
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:41,039
Play. I'll be watching you.

699
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:44,800
Want to swing? I'll push you.

700
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:47,124
I don't want to.

701
00:47:47,649 --> 00:47:49,128
Tell us what happened.

702
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:52,689
I was at the playground with my mom...

703
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:53,929
With your what?

704
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,562
He's delusional.

705
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:57,839
You're such a putz, Basil.

706
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,169
Ignore him.

707
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:00,438
Go on.

708
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:04,802
And I climbed up the slide
and I bumped into this other kid...

709
00:48:05,169 --> 00:48:07,637
and when I got up, it was me.

710
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:09,641
What do you mean, it was you?

711
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,287
The other boy. He looked just like me.

712
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:15,769
What's your name?

713
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:17,728
Whit.

714
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:19,158
Oh, boy.

715
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:28,849
Don't worry, Whit.
It'll be all right.

716
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,649
Dr. Kinder will take you
back to your mother.

717
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:33,607
She'll do no such thing.

718
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:34,844
Don't you see?

719
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:38,280
Dr. Kinder arranged
for the Bobbins to adopt Whit...

720
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:39,882
for just this purpose.

721
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,643
A twin progressive,
comparative experimentation.

722
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,608
What's he talking about?

723
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:47,238
We don't know, and we're geniuses.

724
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:50,287
It means Dr. Kinder
let that quack, Bobbins...

725
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:52,957
raise Whit while
she raised Sylvester...

726
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:56,286
to demonstrate the superiority...

727
00:48:57,089 --> 00:48:58,363
of the Kinder method.

728
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:01,806
And wait till she finds out
the twins have been switched.

729
00:49:02,129 --> 00:49:06,884
She'll realize she has an opportunity
for a living cross-evaluation.

730
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:08,449
He's at it again.

731
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:11,882
Obviously Sly, swine though he is...

732
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:14,239
is superior to this Whit individual.

733
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:15,884
Gee, thanks.

734
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:18,400
- She wouldn't do that.
- Do what?

735
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:22,085
Keep a child from its mother
just to prove her theory.

736
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:23,961
Oh, really?

737
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:27,686
Get Dr. Kinder down here.

738
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:30,128
Tell me, who is this?

739
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:33,247
That's Sylvester.
His brain synapses fire at a rate...

740
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:35,087
of about 40@@@ above normal.

741
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:37,399
So that's Sly, right?

742
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:39,649
Look at this...

743
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:41,242
little person's voiceprint.

744
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:43,329
So?

745
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:47,724
Compare it to this voiceprint
taken from Sly last week.

746
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:50,237
Oh, my God!

747
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:52,683
Oh, my God, no.

748
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,487
Those imbeciles!

749
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:04,329
Sly?

750
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:08,443
Whit?

751
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:13,007
You idiots!

752
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:15,643
You imbeciles!

753
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:16,889
You morons!

754
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:19,205
- You cretins! You, you...
- Boring.

755
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:21,563
Traitors.

756
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:25,844
No, not...

757
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,283
idiots, no.

758
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,208
You wonderful...

759
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,879
brilliant assemblage.

760
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:38,358
You have given me the greatest gift
of my entire life...

761
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:41,567
our own living cross-evaluation!

762
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:43,478
Told you.

763
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:45,049
Brown nose.

764
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:48,197
Give them all a raise.

765
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:49,518
Brilliant.

766
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,441
I feel so warm and motherly.

767
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:53,999
I think I'll go visit my darling niece.

768
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:55,728
And the mother of the year is...

769
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:59,119
Start the comparative tests on Whit.

770
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:02,002
We'll see how Sylvester's
doing among the peasants.

771
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:03,841
How can she do this?

772
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:05,249
Don't you understand?

773
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:07,724
Dr. Kinder is acting
for the greater good.

774
00:51:08,169 --> 00:51:11,081
Maybe it's all right for us,
but Whit has a mom and dad.

775
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:12,438
What's wrong with you?

776
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:15,165
She's not going to keep Whit forever.

777
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:18,329
Yeah, sure, Basil.

778
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,238
This is Dr. Kinder
we're talking about...

779
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,805
not Dr. Frankenstein.

780
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:29,489
Teddie, what is it?

781
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:31,602
I feel funny.

782
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:33,928
What's wrong?

783
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:36,123
She's crossing over.

784
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:38,160
She's going to be one
of the grownups now.

785
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:41,003
Don't worry. This is the way
it's supposed to be.

786
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:42,728
You'll all cross over soon.

787
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:44,438
Bye.

788
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:46,363
Don't go, Teddie.

789
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:48,207
My God, look at that.

790
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:51,162
Two years old and the limbic activity
is slowing down.

791
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:54,606
The frontal lobes are taking over.
We were right.

792
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:56,767
Will she remember us?

793
00:51:58,089 --> 00:51:59,966
No, she's one of them now.

794
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:02,286
Dan, we can't be late.

795
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:05,521
They're late. They're late
for a very important date.

796
00:52:05,729 --> 00:52:09,404
Your mom and dad are off trying
to save the farm. Hip, hip, hooray!

797
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:11,958
Oh, you sweethearts. Thank you.

798
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,961
Thanks, all of you.

799
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:15,642
Here, you take her.

800
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:17,481
My little angel.

801
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:19,489
Who's there?

802
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:20,689
Let's go see.

803
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:28,399
Come on. I'll make you breakfast.
Pancakes in the shape of a witch.

804
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:31,840
Still getting your help
from the work-release program, I see.

805
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,361
Give Dr. Kinder a nice big kiss.

806
00:52:42,169 --> 00:52:43,522
Very nice.

807
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:48,440
I love coming to this house.

808
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:51,489
There's just something
about it that's so...

809
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,129
homey.

810
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:57,763
- We were just going out.
- You were going out?

811
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:02,561
Tell me, how is Whit?
Is he talking yet?

812
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:06,762
Actually, two days ago we had
some communication in pre-language talk.

813
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:08,329
Really?

814
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:10,328
We caught it on video.

815
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:11,848
On video?

816
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:14,925
I've translated several whole sentences.

817
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:18,322
Whole sentences?

818
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,448
I have a wonderful idea.

819
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:23,528
Why don't we take Whit to the lab?
With your gift...

820
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,401
for pre-language...

821
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:28,919
and our technology,
I'm sure we can skip a step or two.

822
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:30,969
What?

823
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:38,162
Slow down, pal. What?

824
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:39,609
Don't do it.

825
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:43,200
What? What'd he say?

826
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:44,884
" Don't do it."

827
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:46,518
That's ridiculous.

828
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:47,997
What are you saying?

829
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:49,528
They've got Whit.

830
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:52,042
Wait a minute.

831
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:54,558
Who's got Whit? You're Whit.

832
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:58,284
- Go on.
- Can't.

833
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,397
That's all I'm getting.

834
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:02,802
Isn't that amazing?

835
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:07,005
I must be running along. I have
some serious, important matters...

836
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:10,248
that I have to attend to.
Goodbye, Whit.

837
00:54:16,729 --> 00:54:19,163
Hives. She's up to something.

838
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:22,367
- What is going on with you today?
- We got to go.

839
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:24,680
You okay, sweetie?
You look a little sad.

840
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:26,004
We do have to go.

841
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,646
Carrie, go back with the babies.

842
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:34,364
Get me Dr. Heep
on the phone immediately.

843
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:37,646
/ don't care what he's doing.
Get him on the phone now!

844
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:43,046
Jonathan, / want two of our best men
sent down here now.

845
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:45,245
No! You idiot. No, listen to me.

846
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:47,844
Dan is beginning to understand
both of them.

847
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:50,040
And if he does, then we go to prison.

848
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,405
We have to have them both.
We can't switch them.

849
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:56,129
I want you to rest here
a little minute, okay?

850
00:54:57,489 --> 00:54:59,400
Here we go. There you go.

851
00:55:26,729 --> 00:55:28,321
Margo will be right back.

852
00:55:29,769 --> 00:55:31,839
Keep an eye on that boy now.

853
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,921
You want to tell us about it?

854
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:38,397
Yeah, I guess so.

855
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,169
What now?

856
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,728
You have to ask? It's the power.

857
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:44,961
If this house was a dog,
we'd have it put to sleep.

858
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:55,007
Well, would you look at that.
The sun is setting in that boy's pants.

859
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:56,523
He wishes.

860
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:00,241
Nice work there, Dickie.

861
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:01,769
Real classy.

862
00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:03,009
So I'm fired, right?

863
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:06,565
Fat chance. Change your shirt
and check on the babies.

864
00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:12,685
A lot of Van Gogh in that kid.

865
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,368
His ear is still intact.

866
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:16,804
- You're weird.
- Check on the power.

867
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:20,159
You just let them take your brother?

868
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,843
- It didn't even bother you?
- It bothered me.

869
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:26,686
There just wasn't anything
I could do to help him.

870
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:38,164
We're tracing the power outage,
and this property may be the source.

871
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:41,606
- What can we do to help?
- We need access to your hookup.

872
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:45,162
Ray, why don't you check the basement?
I'll look upstairs.

873
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:47,047
What's going on? Who is that?

874
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:49,280
It's Elena's goons. They're after me.

875
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,717
Into the bedroom. Hurry up.

876
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:52,203
What's a goon?

877
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,039
So how long have you been
into self-mutilation?

878
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:56,358
We all need a hobby.

879
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:58,400
How many bedrooms on this floor?

880
00:56:58,649 --> 00:56:59,968
- Four.
- And on the third floor?

881
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,005
Five.

882
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,679
I want you to go down, get my partner
and tell him I need a hand.

883
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:06,487
Keep an eye on the babies.

884
00:57:06,729 --> 00:57:07,729
My pleasure.

885
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:12,246
Brilliant, Dickie. Why didn't you
just stuff me in a suitcase for him?

886
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:13,717
Close the door.

887
00:57:55,049 --> 00:57:56,721
You must be Sylvester.

888
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:59,164
I heard about you and your karate.

889
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,842
I'm a black belt.

890
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:02,284
Care to try me, son?

891
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:06,600
I'd be too scared.

892
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:14,002
Now, I guess you expect me
to step over this ski...

893
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:17,685
and you'll jump on the end,
and the end will hit me in the gonads.

894
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:20,961
I'll scream and fall down the stairs.
Is that right?

895
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:26,281
I think you've been seeing
too many bad movies, pal.

896
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:29,123
Because I'm just going
to step around the ski.

897
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:32,324
Just how stupid do you think I am?

898
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,487
Pretty stupid.

899
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,845
Gee, I bet that felt good.

900
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,489
What happened?

901
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:58,523
Sly kicked him right
in the forbidden zone.

902
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:07,889
What's going on?

903
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:11,485
A work-related injury.
I better go up and see what happened.

904
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:23,649
Tough guy, eh?

905
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:25,969
Well...

906
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,245
you're about to meet
your worst nightmare.

907
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:30,684
Goon, that is some lame dialogue.

908
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,883
You really think I'm gonna
walk over that ski...

909
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:38,847
and you're gonna jump...

910
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:41,478
and that ski's gonna
hit me in the gonads...

911
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:44,960
and I'm gonna scream
and make a funny face and fall?

912
00:59:45,569 --> 00:59:46,569
I don't think so.

913
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,922
Cross your legs and smile.

914
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:12,404
You don't mess with the Sly man.

915
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:19,919
Driver! Babyco, right away.

916
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:25,237
Jonathan, I want the laboratory
stripped. Disappear. Understand?

917
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,763
I want bare walls.

918
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,604
You told me before that Whit
used to get weird feelings.

919
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:36,561
Like someone was calling him.

920
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:38,527
I think that was me.

921
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,244
All right, sit on the floor in a circle.

922
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:45,366
Sit on the floor? In a circle?

923
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:47,361
What part don't you understand?

924
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:50,481
Bare walls! I want this place
stripped in three hours.

925
01:00:50,729 --> 01:00:52,367
Suppose he does break through?

926
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:54,639
Nobody will be able
to understand Sylvester.

927
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:56,083
Who'll believe Bobbins?

928
01:00:56,329 --> 01:01:00,402
All he has to do is take Sylvester to
the hospital where the twins were born.

929
01:01:00,649 --> 01:01:03,607
Would you be careful?
And ask for a handprint validation.

930
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:06,124
After that, they'll know
they've got Sly.

931
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:10,328
And my darling niece will have
the police here in less than an hour!

932
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:13,208
Bare walls! Bare walls in three hours!

933
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:16,242
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get a move on!

934
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:17,649
What's he doing?

935
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:21,087
Dr. Kinder's not taking him
back to his parents.

936
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:23,288
I don't believe it.

937
01:01:24,169 --> 01:01:25,727
Not Dr. Frankenstein, huh?

938
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:30,886
She's gonna move him tonight.
We've got to help.

939
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:32,278
They're coming.

940
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:33,325
Who's coming?

941
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:36,601
Sly and the kids.
They're coming to break us out.

942
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:38,362
- When?
- Tonight.

943
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,367
We could cross over at any time,
and then she wins.

944
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:44,439
Either you're with her or with us.

945
01:01:44,689 --> 01:01:46,008
We're with you.

946
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:47,608
Basil, decide.

947
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:49,762
Decide now.

948
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:52,607
Let's kick butt!

949
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,528
He's with us.

950
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:06,485
I think we've got company.

951
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:19,118
Come on. The mind's
a terrible thing to waste.

952
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:25,487
Come on, troops. Move it.

953
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:29,157
What are we gonna do?

954
01:02:29,409 --> 01:02:32,526
- We're gonna train.
- We're going on a train!

955
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:35,803
Oy vey!

956
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:37,442
Up, down, up, down...

957
01:02:37,689 --> 01:02:38,689
This is pathetic.

958
01:02:38,849 --> 01:02:42,000
Hut, two, three, four...

959
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:46,844
You call those jumping jacks?
More like jumping jerks.

960
01:02:47,049 --> 01:02:48,323
Stop! Stop!

961
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:51,848
Stop!

962
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,003
Hold it!

963
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:57,603
This isn't working.

964
01:02:58,209 --> 01:02:59,358
What do you expect?

965
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,440
We're geniuses, not ninjas.

966
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:04,887
Dig deeper, guys.
I need warriors. Now move out.

967
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:09,446
Under the net. Under the net!

968
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:10,684
What?

969
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:22,167
Move! Move! Move!

970
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:27,603
Karate.

971
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:33,444
Hopeless.

972
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:45,567
Now let's concentrate.
Okay, one at a time.

973
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:48,118
One at a time! One at a time!

974
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:50,642
This is harder than I thought.

975
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,160
It's my turn.

976
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:06,929
Perfect.

977
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:10,560
Absolutely perfect.

978
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:14,527
All right, we have to use
our secret weapon.

979
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:16,887
And what's that?

980
01:04:17,209 --> 01:04:19,245
Duby, what is it adults fear most...

981
01:04:19,449 --> 01:04:21,121
about babies?
- Dirty diapers.

982
01:04:22,169 --> 01:04:23,169
You're wrong.

983
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:26,366
They make those stupid faces
when they change our diapers.

984
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,758
Dirty diapers. That's funny.

985
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:33,448
It's our intelligence.

986
01:04:33,649 --> 01:04:36,322
We have to use our intelligence.

987
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:39,169
That's it.

988
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:41,400
All right, everybody. Follow me.

989
01:04:58,129 --> 01:05:00,723
All right, everybody. Take your places.

990
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:02,078
Move it.

991
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:03,609
Malcolm, take the flank.

992
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:06,207
Joey, over here with us.

993
01:05:09,049 --> 01:05:11,324
- Sly, do I have time to go potty?
- The potty?

994
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:13,759
You're wearing the potty.

995
01:05:16,009 --> 01:05:18,682
Put it on hold.
This is much more important.

996
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:19,998
Easy for you to say.

997
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:23,527
You are in my power.

998
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:26,119
You will obey my commands.

999
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,361
What are you trying to do?

1000
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:31,879
I think grownups remember
our language in their subconscious.

1001
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:32,885
If I'm right...

1002
01:05:33,089 --> 01:05:34,522
I can hypnotize him.

1003
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:37,964
You are in my power.

1004
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:40,444
You will obey my commands.

1005
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:43,761
Before I take the babies home...

1006
01:05:44,049 --> 01:05:45,687
I will drive to Babyco.

1007
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:49,279
Everything depends
on my driving to Babyco.

1008
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:51,807
You are in my power.

1009
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:54,006
You will obey my commands.

1010
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:57,365
Let's see if we've really got him.

1011
01:05:57,609 --> 01:05:59,440
Lenny, raise your arm.

1012
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,197
All right.

1013
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:05,644
Make him stick out his tongue.

1014
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:07,882
Stick out your tongue.

1015
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:14,359
Make him wiggle his tongue.

1016
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:18,886
Now, wiggle your tongue.

1017
01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:27,478
Sly, make him pick his nose. Go on.

1018
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:29,521
Come on, Sly. Make him pick it.

1019
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:31,489
That's gross.

1020
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:34,724
- Make him.
- Make him pick his nose.

1021
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,523
Pick your nose now.

1022
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:38,598
Pick it. Pick it.

1023
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:48,888
When I snap my fingers...

1024
01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:50,884
you'll wake up.

1025
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:55,242
Lenny, wake up.
Time to take the kids home.

1026
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:58,606
Get their jackets on them.
We leave here in 30 minutes.

1027
01:06:58,849 --> 01:06:59,849
I'm up!

1028
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:01,887
All right, move out.

1029
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:05,280
Where is that?...

1030
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,638
Boy, this is not your lunch break.

1031
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:18,644
All right, Ice Pick. Hop to it.

1032
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:34,003
Come on, Carrie.

1033
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:35,364
Aren't you coming?

1034
01:07:35,609 --> 01:07:37,645
No, I got a job to do here.

1035
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:40,245
/ don't know but /'ve been told...

1036
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,639
Eskimo girls are mighty cold...

1037
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:45,005
Dr. Kinder is a son of a gun...

1038
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:47,479
Got cooties and they weigh a ton...

1039
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:50,323
One, two, three, four
One, two...

1040
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:51,529
Three, four...

1041
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:53,919
- We got it! We got it, Margo!
- We did it!

1042
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:55,397
Where is everybody?

1043
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:59,278
You got what? An eviction notice?

1044
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:02,202
We get the whole ball of wax.
The loan, everything.

1045
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,087
We find out tomorrow.
Where is everybody?

1046
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:06,126
Out delivering the kids.

1047
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:07,484
Is everything okay?

1048
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:09,959
I don't know.
Something weird's going on.

1049
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:11,608
I got a bad feeling.

1050
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:12,849
Mrs. Dexter?

1051
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:14,883
He hasn't?

1052
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:17,166
Randy hasn't gotten home yet.

1053
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:20,162
- Okay. I'll get right on it.
- It's late.

1054
01:08:25,249 --> 01:08:26,887
Mrs. Walters?

1055
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:31,123
I know. Well, we're checking into it.

1056
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:32,722
It's probably a flat tire.

1057
01:08:32,969 --> 01:08:34,721
Okay, I'll phone you back.

1058
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:37,449
I'll phone the bus.

1059
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:42,009
Bobbins' bus.

1060
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:44,569
Where are you?

1061
01:08:46,129 --> 01:08:49,166
We have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1062
01:08:49,889 --> 01:08:53,643
We have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1063
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:03,637
What did he say?

1064
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,483
They had a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1065
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:09,038
Dickie was kind of
saying it along with him.

1066
01:09:09,289 --> 01:09:10,881
Like a song-and-dance team?

1067
01:09:11,129 --> 01:09:13,120
I don't know. They sound like robots.

1068
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:16,247
What kind of errand could they
possibly have at Babyco?

1069
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:22,238
What is it, honey?

1070
01:09:25,009 --> 01:09:26,328
Yes, Mrs. Skyla.

1071
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:30,846
I think she's trying to tell us
something about Whit.

1072
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,279
- He's in the bathroom.
- Quack, quack.

1073
01:09:35,249 --> 01:09:36,967
What are you trying to tell us?

1074
01:09:37,169 --> 01:09:38,921
He went off with a duck?

1075
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:42,764
What is it, sweetie?

1076
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:43,969
Babyco.

1077
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:47,600
Hello. Mrs. Hebutis.

1078
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:50,080
Concentrate, Daddy.

1079
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:52,001
You can do it, Daddy.

1080
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:54,158
Try.

1081
01:09:54,409 --> 01:09:55,728
Go on. I'm getting it.

1082
01:09:55,969 --> 01:09:57,925
Connect with your inner child.

1083
01:09:59,769 --> 01:10:02,442
- Try harder. Danger!
- What?

1084
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:06,207
Whit has a twin brother called Sly.

1085
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:08,599
He's been here for the last two days.

1086
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,561
- What?
- What "what"?

1087
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:13,762
Sly and Whit got switched
at the mall.

1088
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:17,962
And Dr. Kinder kept Whit
in her secret lab to experiment on.

1089
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:19,449
Oh, my God!

1090
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:21,765
- What?
- She says Elena has a secret lab.

1091
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:24,085
I don't believe this.
Whit and Sly got switched.

1092
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:26,041
What? Who's Sly?

1093
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:29,998
She's getting rid of the lab
and moving the babies to Liechtenstein.

1094
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:32,805
Liechtenstein? Oh, my God!

1095
01:10:33,089 --> 01:10:34,568
Liechtenstein? What Liechtenstein?

1096
01:10:34,809 --> 01:10:36,322
I'll tell you on the way.

1097
01:10:36,969 --> 01:10:39,244
Sweetie, do you know
all the secrets to life?

1098
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:42,486
Sure. Piece of cake.
I'll explain when you get back.

1099
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:46,287
- What's with the Liechtenstein?
- I'll tell you.

1100
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:55,485
Liechtenstein.
I hate Liechtenstein!

1101
01:10:56,649 --> 01:11:00,403
Hello? 911?
This is an emergency.

1102
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:03,999
- What is the nature of this emergency?
- There's been a kidnapping.

1103
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:05,762
And who's been kidnapped?

1104
01:11:05,969 --> 01:11:07,322
My son.

1105
01:11:07,569 --> 01:11:09,719
How old is he?
Who kidnapped him?

1106
01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:13,041
He's almost 2, and his aunt
did it yesterday at the mall.

1107
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:15,638
His aunt kidnapped him
at the mall yesterday?

1108
01:11:15,849 --> 01:11:17,885
- Right.
- And you're just reporting it?

1109
01:11:18,089 --> 01:11:20,319
She switched him for his twin brother.

1110
01:11:20,529 --> 01:11:22,121
She switched him with his twin?

1111
01:11:23,169 --> 01:11:25,239
- How do you know this?
- My daughter told me.

1112
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:26,598
How old is she?

1113
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,049
Eighteen months.

1114
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:30,484
- / know this sounds strange.
- No, sir.

1115
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:33,084
I get this kind of call all the time.

1116
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:35,521
Now let me get this straight.

1117
01:11:35,729 --> 01:11:38,402
Your 18-month-old daughter told you...

1118
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:40,765
that her aunt kidnapped your son...

1119
01:11:40,969 --> 01:11:43,529
by trading him
for his twin at the mall?

1120
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:45,761
- Is that about it?
- Listen.

1121
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:49,962
This woman is moving all of the babies
to a secret lab in Liechtenstein!

1122
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:53,083
A secret lab in Liechtenstein?

1123
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,281
Well, that is serious.

1124
01:11:55,529 --> 01:11:59,522
Give me your name, sir,
and I'll get you all the help you need.

1125
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:01,925
- She thinks I'm nuts.
- Well, no wonder.

1126
01:12:03,169 --> 01:12:04,169
911?

1127
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:06,843
Now listen.
You know that Babyco building?

1128
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:11,241
There's a bomb in there, and we're going
to blow those little suckers to Venus!

1129
01:12:15,009 --> 01:12:16,886
You wanted cops? You got cops.

1130
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:21,678
The magnificent Sly
and the Bobbins' babies...

1131
01:12:21,889 --> 01:12:24,961
have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1132
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:31,085
Security personnel, report to stations.

1133
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:32,444
What are you doing?

1134
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:34,759
The magnificent Sly
and the Bobbins' babies...

1135
01:12:35,009 --> 01:12:37,887
have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1136
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:43,998
What's up, doc?

1137
01:12:44,249 --> 01:12:45,284
Well, well...

1138
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:47,764
the resourceful Mr. Sly.

1139
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,366
Go! Go! Move!

1140
01:12:50,689 --> 01:12:53,328
I don't know who
your friends were, Sly...

1141
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,127
but I do know one thing.

1142
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:57,407
You are mine.

1143
01:12:57,729 --> 01:12:59,765
See you in Joyworld, doc.

1144
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:13,718
You know the drill. Take your places.

1145
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:16,119
I'll be in the control centre.
Move out.

1146
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:25,127
Show me the money.

1147
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:27,127
Fasten your seat belt, doc.

1148
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,722
The ca-ca's gonna hit the fan.

1149
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:33,167
Okay, robo-entertainers, where are you?

1150
01:13:37,969 --> 01:13:38,969
Beautiful.

1151
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:40,842
Where are you, big boy?

1152
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:44,280
Okay, baby, nappy's over.

1153
01:13:45,009 --> 01:13:46,362
Come on, you can do it.

1154
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:48,128
Give me five.

1155
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:49,598
That's it. Cool.

1156
01:13:50,649 --> 01:13:52,924
Let's bring up some schematics.

1157
01:13:53,609 --> 01:13:56,407
Great. Now for a little rewiring, boys.

1158
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:58,005
And then...

1159
01:13:58,209 --> 01:14:00,086
let the games begin.

1160
01:14:01,009 --> 01:14:04,638
Bring my helicopter to the helipad
at the back of Joyworld.

1161
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:07,119
Hover and descend on my command.

1162
01:14:16,449 --> 01:14:18,963
What can you hope to get from this?

1163
01:14:19,169 --> 01:14:21,364
Just a little satisfaction, doc.

1164
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:24,879
Okay, let's get ready to move out.

1165
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:27,718
All right, Sly, come off it.

1166
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:29,607
I know it's you.

1167
01:14:29,849 --> 01:14:32,124
Okay, brother, make your move.

1168
01:14:38,129 --> 01:14:39,926
All right. The fun is over.

1169
01:14:40,249 --> 01:14:42,285
Okay, boys, let's march.

1170
01:14:44,769 --> 01:14:45,838
Lights...

1171
01:14:48,049 --> 01:14:49,118
camera...

1172
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:51,449
action!

1173
01:15:00,049 --> 01:15:00,845
Baby...

1174
01:15:01,049 --> 01:15:02,801
want a hug.

1175
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:05,320
Baby want a hug.

1176
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:07,647
- Get them, you fool!
- Go!

1177
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:10,719
Baby want a hug.

1178
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:17,080
What? No hug?

1179
01:15:19,169 --> 01:15:21,603
That make Baby Bunting mad.

1180
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:23,164
Get the baby!

1181
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:24,404
Right cross.

1182
01:15:25,769 --> 01:15:26,884
Left hook.

1183
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:29,608
You the one, baby.

1184
01:15:29,809 --> 01:15:32,164
Okay, alien, a little target practice.

1185
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:36,363
Blew his brains out!

1186
01:15:40,489 --> 01:15:42,207
Merry Christmas!

1187
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,367
And a happy New Year...

1188
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:53,239
What's the matter with you guys?
These are oversized dolls!

1189
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:54,449
Go, clown.

1190
01:15:54,849 --> 01:15:56,282
You know the drill.

1191
01:16:02,889 --> 01:16:06,040
Lexi, kangaroo. Duby, ostrich.

1192
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:14,208
Oh, behave, baby!

1193
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:21,641
Enjoy the ride, suckers!

1194
01:16:56,089 --> 01:16:57,158
Not yet.

1195
01:16:57,609 --> 01:16:59,247
Not yet. Now!

1196
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:20,369
Take him.

1197
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:22,883
You take him.
I saw what happened last time.

1198
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:31,604
All right. The Whit man's in the house.

1199
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:33,124
Get him!

1200
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:50,607
Basil, out of the park.

1201
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:55,164
All right, Lexi. Give me five, Basil.

1202
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:57,001
We're out of here.

1203
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:05,598
You don't mess with the Sly man, Heep.

1204
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:42,403
Stop! Stop!

1205
01:18:42,609 --> 01:18:44,520
It's you and me, Sly.

1206
01:18:44,769 --> 01:18:46,487
Mano a mano.

1207
01:18:46,729 --> 01:18:49,687
You're a tremendous
disappointment to me, Sylvester.

1208
01:18:49,929 --> 01:18:53,604
You never understood
the importance of the work.

1209
01:18:54,289 --> 01:18:56,439
Why, you could've known greatness.

1210
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,561
Instead, you're just gonna be another...

1211
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:01,164
another kid.

1212
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:08,524
Are you smart enough to keep
your mouth shut?

1213
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,921
Need I say more?

1214
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:18,284
Et tu, Basil?

1215
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:20,283
And proud of it.

1216
01:19:38,169 --> 01:19:40,319
Sly, I knew you'd come back for me.

1217
01:19:40,769 --> 01:19:42,361
Every time, kiddo.

1218
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:48,046
Sly, are you okay?

1219
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,438
I feel funny.

1220
01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:54,286
No. I think that's Sly.
Sly, are you okay?

1221
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:57,163
What?

1222
01:19:57,609 --> 01:19:58,678
Helicopter.

1223
01:19:58,929 --> 01:20:00,840
- The helicopter pad?
- Roof.

1224
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:02,317
The roof? He's on?...

1225
01:20:02,569 --> 01:20:04,400
Oh, my God. Elena!

1226
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:18,922
Here, take him.

1227
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:20,649
All right, take him up.

1228
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:39,568
Take it up, you fool! Up!

1229
01:20:39,809 --> 01:20:40,844
Up?

1230
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:42,729
Oh, my God!

1231
01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:00,445
Dan, are you all right? Are you okay?

1232
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,838
Mommy!

1233
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:03,804
Mommy!

1234
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:06,442
Aunt Elena!

1235
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:11,249
Auntie Elena!

1236
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:15,678
Lower the chopper.

1237
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:23,324
Lower the helicopter immediately.

1238
01:21:23,529 --> 01:21:24,757
Do it now.

1239
01:21:25,009 --> 01:21:27,443
This is your last warning.

1240
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:30,039
Lower the chopper.

1241
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:39,845
Officer, arrest this woman.
She's insane!

1242
01:21:40,049 --> 01:21:41,482
She's trying to harm the babies.

1243
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:44,647
Auntie Elena, you tell them
or I swear to God...

1244
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:47,922
For heaven's sakes,
stop calling me that.

1245
01:21:48,249 --> 01:21:49,887
I am not your aunt.

1246
01:21:50,289 --> 01:21:51,358
You're not my aunt?

1247
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:54,083
Your mother adopted you
when you were 2!

1248
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:55,569
I was adopted?

1249
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:59,405
Do you actually think that you and I
come from the same gene pool?

1250
01:21:59,609 --> 01:22:02,203
Thank you, God. Thank you. Thank you!

1251
01:22:05,769 --> 01:22:08,841
I would have felt terrible
hitting my aunt like that.

1252
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:11,644
Officer, that's my son.

1253
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:14,283
- This is your child, ma'am?
- I know my son.

1254
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:19,247
Look at your daddy.

1255
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,008
Look at you.

1256
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:32,687
Are you crossing over?

1257
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:35,277
I think maybe I am.

1258
01:22:36,929 --> 01:22:39,124
Maybe it won't be so bad.

1259
01:22:39,809 --> 01:22:41,845
There's just so much they don't know.

1260
01:22:42,089 --> 01:22:43,363
You're right about that.

1261
01:22:44,129 --> 01:22:45,881
But they try so hard.

1262
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:47,448
You gotta love them.

1263
01:22:49,169 --> 01:22:50,841
I'll see you on the other side.

1264
01:22:52,729 --> 01:22:54,879
I feel kind of funny myself.

1265
01:22:57,729 --> 01:22:59,162
See you.

1266
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:36,409
Honey!

1267
01:23:37,609 --> 01:23:38,678
Honey!

1268
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:41,808
It was a giant baby and a dinosaur.

1269
01:23:42,129 --> 01:23:44,404
- You're remembering.
- Something about Dickie.

1270
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:46,685
Dickie and Lenny.
They were like a team.

1271
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:48,726
- Something like that.
- The twins!

1272
01:23:48,969 --> 01:23:50,527
It was a secret lab.

1273
01:23:50,769 --> 01:23:52,361
Liechtenstein. Where are the boys?

1274
01:23:52,609 --> 01:23:54,486
- Everything's fine.
- It's true.

1275
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,924
Babies do talk.
Now the whole world knows.

1276
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:58,522
But only you understood them.

1277
01:23:58,769 --> 01:24:00,760
Whit and Sly.
They can tell us everything.

1278
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,368
Guys.

1279
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:06,444
Hey, twins! We've got twins.

1280
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:09,963
Okay, guys, tell me the secrets of life.

1281
01:24:10,329 --> 01:24:13,526
Come on, Sly, what's up?
What's going on out there?

1282
01:24:13,769 --> 01:24:14,963
They've crossed over.

1283
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:17,006
What? You've crossed over?

1284
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:21,127
No secrets of life.
No universal knowledge.

1285
01:24:21,569 --> 01:24:23,844
Wait. Carrie knows it.
Come here, Carrie.

1286
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:25,689
- Right.
- Come here.

1287
01:24:26,849 --> 01:24:28,362
Come here, sweetie.

1288
01:24:28,569 --> 01:24:30,366
Come on. Tell me everything.

1289
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:31,678
Come on.

1290
01:24:33,049 --> 01:24:34,368
Come on, honey.

1291
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:37,125
Gee, another Kodak moment.

1292
01:24:37,969 --> 01:24:38,969
I get it.

1293
01:24:39,129 --> 01:24:41,643
You're not gonna
tell me a thing, are you?

1294
01:24:42,409 --> 01:24:43,205
Nope.

1295
