1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,458
All set, Charlie.

2
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,703
Hey, Pa!

3
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,680
You got time for a game before supper?

4
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,187
Go get your ball.
I'll meet you out back.

5
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:59,021
Okay, Roy. Come on.
I want to see some smoke on this one.

6
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:18,834
Son, you put that in a bottle,
you got something sweeter than Yoo-Hoo.

7
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,415
Beauty!

8
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,582
You got a great gift, son.

9
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,121
It's as if angels
came down from heaven...

10
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,317
and put a blessing
on your three bowling digits.

11
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:36,488
You can apply everything
that I've taught you about bowling...

12
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,326
to your daily life...

13
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,424
and if you do that,
you're gonna be decent...

14
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,435
you're gonna be moral...

15
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,562
you're gonna be a good man.

16
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,713
All set, guys.

17
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,585
Can you believe this?
Me on a professional bowling tour?

18
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,596
It's your calling, son.

19
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,600
One day, when people say the name
"Munson," they're gonna think "winner. "

20
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,107
Just like DiMaggio is to baseball...

21
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,166
or "Unitas" is to football.

22
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,439
That's what "Munson" will be to bowling.

23
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,377
- That's right.
- Yeah, Roy.

24
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,246
I hope so, Dad.
I want to make you proud.

25
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,612
Maybe you can get
this old piece of crap working...

26
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,395
of if you get in a pinch, maybe
you'll get a couple of bucks for it.

27
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,535
Thanks, Dad.

28
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,106
- You go get 'em, son.
- I will.

29
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,961
It all comes down to this roll.

30
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,967
Roy Munson, a man-child...

31
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,334
with a dream to topple
bowling giant Ernie McCracken.

32
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,339
If he strikes...

33
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,274
he's the 1979 Odor-Eaters champion.

34
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,506
He's got one foot in the frying pan
and one in the pressure cooker.

35
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,605
Believe me, as a bowler,
I know that right about now...

36
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,779
your bladder feels like
an overstuffed vacuum cleaner bag...

37
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:25,153
and your butt is kind of like
an about-to-explode bratwurst.

38
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,422
Do you mind?
I wasn't talking when you were bowling.

39
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,662
Was I talking out loud?

40
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,165
Was I?

41
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,694
Sorry.

42
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,205
Good luck.

43
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,334
Big problem, my friend.

44
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,842
Engine blown.

45
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,844
Someone put sugar in your tank.

46
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,477
- Sugar? That's impossible.
- Here! Sugar!

47
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,714
Maybe the bad kids around here.

48
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,987
How much is it gonna cost to fix?

49
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,754
$2,000.

50
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,489
$2,000! That's gonna wipe me out!

51
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,531
I'm sorry. Did I wake you, Fatima?
Ethyl supreme. Top it off.

52
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,038
Right away.

53
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:53,272
Watch the door. Hey, pinhead,
juice the tires for me, will you? Today?

54
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,440
Oh, Roy!
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

55
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,683
Hi, Mr. McCracken.

56
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,710
Hey, call me "Ernie" or "Big Ern. "

57
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,523
Young bowler like yourself...

58
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,788
the tour can be very difficult,
very expensive.

59
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,328
Tanqueray and Tab.

60
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,093
Keep 'em coming, sweets. I got
a long drive. Do me a favor, will you?

61
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,570
Would you mind washing off that perfume
before you come back to our table?

62
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,005
Little bad luck,
like you had here today...

63
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,066
all your dreams can go up in smoke.

64
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:30,013
That's why even we veteran bowlers
work our way, tournament to tournament.

65
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,016
We need the supplemental income.

66
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,019
- Supplemental income?
- Supplemental.

67
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,353
It means "extra. "

68
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,453
- You interested?
- Interested?

69
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,862
Would you be interested
in some extra income?

70
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,967
Extra income?

71
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,737
Want to make more money?

72
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,544
Why don't you go eat that outside
and then come on back in?

73
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,387
Not you.

74
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,136
Do people actually bowl here?

75
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,503
They live here. They die here.
They get their mail here.

76
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,099
I don't know about this.

77
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,111
Something doesn't seem right.

78
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,677
It takes guts to say no, kid.

79
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,618
You got a lot of courage. I don't think
I could call my mommy and daddy...

80
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,145
and tell them I didn't have
what it takes to make it on the tour.

81
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,351
All right, let's get going.

82
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,418
Better call them
before they go to sleep. Hurry up.

83
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,954
- All right.
- Nice flip-flop. Way to go.

84
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,332
Two more for my young friend here.

85
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,805
- I got it in the nose.
- Here. Take it out of that.

86
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:13,814
Say, buddy, you gonna buy the beers
or the whole place?

87
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,181
This is just my bonus.
I had a good month.

88
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,690
"A good month. "

89
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,217
This punk shattered
my monthly record.

90
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,230
I had the entire company record
21 times.

91
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,732
He shattered it.
Look at this bonus.

92
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,358
What do you sell?

93
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,027
Dictionaries.

94
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,537
Yeah. Door to door.

95
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,268
What do you say we play
a couple of games?

96
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,280
- Maybe 20 bucks a game?
- No!

97
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,408
- You're not gonna bowl drunk again.
- I insist.

98
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,282
What do you want to risk?
You have everything going for you.

99
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,016
You're on a gravy train
with biscuit wheels.

100
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,059
You've just shattered my record.
What do you want to lose it for?

101
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,788
This is a Gran Torino looking at you.

102
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,461
Don't do it. Let's just have
six, seven drinks and go.

103
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,193
Hey, buddy boy...

104
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,034
you looking for
a little friendly action?

105
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,976
I just might know somebody
to accommodate you.

106
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,582
Speak of the devil, and he appears.
I'm gonna play the jukebox.

107
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,085
Yes!

108
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,636
- All right!
- God!

109
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,243
He was robbed.

110
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,406
- Game, set, match, fellows.
- Yeah.

111
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,816
I believe you owe us another $100.

112
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,946
We're not getting much mercy
here tonight.

113
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,389
You guys have to forgive me.

114
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,450
You see, bowling for money...
that's my only vice.

115
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,123
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks, sugar.

116
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,303
Okay, two vices.

117
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,100
That's still very good.

118
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,237
All right, let's go.
Thank you for the education, gentlemen.

119
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,042
We've just received a PhD in stupidity.
Doctor, shall we?

120
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,345
Give us a chance to win our money back.

121
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,950
Are you crazy? Padre, how much
are you into us for already?

122
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,216
$350.

123
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:38,025
That's a landau roof and power steering
down the drain.

124
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,827
Could be in your pocket right now.
Let's go.

125
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,391
Double or nothing
I can pick up that spare.

126
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,528
- I think I can do it.
- That's the 6-7-10.

127
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,301
You'll pick up that spare the same day
my hair starts falling out.

128
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,707
- Let's get out of here.
- I can do this.

129
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,541
For $700? No way.

130
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,105
No, not for $700.
What have you got here?

131
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,516
For $1,500. Guys?

132
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,645
You want some of the action?

133
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,213
Come on, you chickenshits.
I'm good for the money. Put up my share.

134
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,352
Now, Mr. Big Shot, Mr. "I wear my pants
high and pick up every spare...

135
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,861
drunk or sober. "

136
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,660
- Come on, guys.
- We'll take that bet.

137
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,100
Fine, my so-called friend.
Take your silly little ball...

138
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,103
and make your silly little spare...

139
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,604
or miss it!

140
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,702
Come on, boy. Bowl!

141
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,908
The name's not "boy. "
It's Roy.

142
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,587
Roy Munson.

143
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,028
How'd he do that?

144
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,424
What did I tell you?

145
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,371
This feels weird.
Are you sure this is legal?

146
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,739
I don't know.
It's fun though, isn't it?

147
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,381
What's the sugar for, Mr. McCracken?

148
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,783
Didn't I tell you to call me "Ernie"
or "Big Ern"?

149
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,553
It's for my morning coffee.

150
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,255
Get out of the car, wise guy!

151
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,459
- What do we do?
- Sometimes a bowler...

152
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,469
just has to face the music.

153
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,003
- Come on.
- There you are. Let's go.

154
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,602
And that bowler is you.

155
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,882
- You're in deep shit, kid.
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

156
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,356
Let me see that hand.

157
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,859
I thought I recognized...

158
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,156
that name.

159
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,197
Father, please do something.

160
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,394
I'm a priest like you're a dictionary
salesman, you piece of shit.

161
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,901
Get him inside.

162
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,438
- Come on.
- Don't do this.

163
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,938
What are you doing?
I'll pay you back, I swear to God!

164
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:14,753
Get him up there.

165
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,253
Do it!

166
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,448
Hey, Herb. How's life?

167
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,727
Taking forever.

168
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,227
Morning, Mike.

169
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,966
Can you get sick drinking piss?

170
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,462
I think you can.

171
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,301
Even if it's your own?

172
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,776
Captain Hook!

173
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,282
Wait up.

174
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,553
I want that rent by tomorrow,
or you're out of here!

175
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,097
I got you down for a 50-gallon drum
of lane oil and a case of bowler's tape.

176
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,800
Every week, I tell you the same thing:
We don't need nothing.

177
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,511
What about...

178
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,071
a gross of fluorescent condoms for
the novelty machine in the men's room?

179
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,879
Those are fun even when you're alone.

180
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,544
- Yeah.
- You get it?

181
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,214
- This is the hula-hoop of the '90s.
- No!

182
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,690
We don't even have a novelty machine
in the men's room anymore.

183
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,296
And you call this a bowling alley?

184
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,344
You stroke a hell of a ball...

185
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,475
but I'll bet when you're off,
you leave a lot of buckets.

186
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,019
Excuse me?

187
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,183
Buckets. 3, 5, 6 and 9. It's from
coming in too light in the pocket...

188
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,488
and sending the head pin
around the 3.

189
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,058
You could tell all that
from seeing me throw one strike?

190
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,500
I didn't see it. I heard it.

191
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,661
Try moving a couple of boards
to the left.

192
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,721
Would you look at that!

193
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,386
Sweeter than Yoo-Hoo.

194
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,862
How come you know so much about bowling?

195
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,866
Maybe this will help explain it to you.

196
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,700
Oh, wow. That's really something.
What's that made out of?

197
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,602
14-karat gold.

198
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,868
Really? Looks like rubber.

199
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,070
No. The ring, not the hand.

200
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,874
Wow. State champion.

201
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,543
You state champion?

202
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,988
Was. Iowa, '79.
Name's Roy Munson.

203
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,490
Ishmael Boorg.

204
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:52,292
You've got as powerful a stroke
as I've ever seen.

205
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,561
You could lose a little
off the backswing, but you're not bad.

206
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,866
- What's your average?
- I don't know. 265, 270.

207
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,706
I've got to go.

208
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,175
- Bye.
- Whoa! Hey, easy does it.

209
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,645
What's your hurry?
We're just getting acquainted.

210
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,650
You're wasting your time.
He's from way out in Brimfield.

211
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,085
- So?
- Brimfield's an Amish community.

212
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,521
- He's Amish?
- No fooling you.

213
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,060
Wait up. I want to talk to you.

214
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,567
About what?

215
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,962
You got something special.

216
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,167
With your talent and my knowledge,
you could be a champion.

217
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:42,077
I mean that, and I know talent
because I manage bowlers.

218
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,549
Bowling manager?

219
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,452
Why would a bowler need a manager?

220
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,459
Don't you need a coach...

221
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,158
a friend, a brother?

222
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,670
Someone who will stick by your side
through thick and thin?

223
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,138
Someone who will be a loyal friend
and never, ever...

224
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,802
ever turn on you...

225
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,310
no matter what?

226
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,409
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not interested.

227
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,751
I hope you rot in hell, you loser!

228
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,856
You suck!

229
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,649
You don't deserve a car!

230
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,401
Where's the milk for the coffee?

231
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,461
We're all out.

232
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,536
Well, what do you call that
in the cooler?

233
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,278
Well, if you want to buy some,
help yourself.

234
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,408
But the freebies are all out.

235
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:56,614
Buy some? What, I gotta pay for mustard
if I get a hotdog?

236
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,817
If the freebies are out, yeah.

237
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,163
Can you break a 20?

238
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,497
Oh, and give me a box of Marlboros.

239
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,276
Do I gotta pay for matches?

240
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,107
Five, ten, here's twenty.

241
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,274
If you ever need to just talk,
call me.

242
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:32,616
Hey, whoa.
Let me help you here.

243
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,023
- Come on up.
- Thanks.

244
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,755
- Absolutely precious.
- Yeah.

245
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,658
That will come out.

246
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,259
Treasure these special times.

247
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,296
Look at you. Coochie, coochie.

248
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,502
Did you burn your little fingers?

249
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,113
- Adorable.
- Thanks.

250
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,121
Charge me for milk, will ya?
Ya lowlife.

251
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,723
- Give me the pocketbook, lady.
- No!

252
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,463
- Give me it!
- Okay.

253
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,334
Give it back.
What are you, sissy? You need a purse?

254
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,498
I'll slice your throat!

255
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,337
You burned me, you bastard!

256
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,972
Go ahead, you chickenshit!
Run home to Mommy!

257
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,039
Pussy.

258
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,711
Here you go. You okay?

259
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,420
I'm fine.

260
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,361
That was a brave thing you did.

261
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,064
You are a hero.

262
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,396
A genuine hero.

263
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,663
I'm no hero.
I don't even know what happened.

264
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,672
Nine out of ten times, I'd be running
the other direction.

265
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,235
Oh, you know, about the rent...

266
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,541
Don't you worry about that.

267
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,174
You pay me the money whenever you get it
because I know you are good for it.

268
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,921
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. You... thank you.

269
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,115
What 50? We said 25.

270
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,456
I deserve a little extra after getting
third-degree burns on my pupils.

271
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,294
I didn't know you were going to use
a knife. I'm just buying some time.

272
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,301
- I don't want to give her a coronary.
- I had to make it look real.

273
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,303
Besides, that coffee wasn't even hot.

274
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,962
Now that's hot.

275
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,474
Where's your newspaper?
I got to take a dump.

276
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,478
- I don't have the paper.
- I need something to read.

277
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,071
Here. Use this shampoo.

278
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,482
"New and improved. " I read this already.
You got any of that new Mentadent?

279
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,883
I know how you like to drink,
so I brought you some...

280
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:54,556
Why, you no-good son of a bitch!

281
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,568
You crazy bastard!
How the hell did you get in here?

282
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,069
Get out!

283
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,230
That will be 100 now, you prick!

284
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,570
And don't come back!

285
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,576
- Munson!
- Some people never learn.

286
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:09,375
You are history.
I am calling the cops!

287
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,145
Wait. Whoa. Hey, calm down.

288
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,856
You have every right to be angry, okay?
Just take a deep breath.

289
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,258
There must be some way
I can work this off... make it up to you.

290
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,343
Well.

291
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,116
Oh, stop it.
It wasn't that bad.

292
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,422
Oh, my little Roy toy.

293
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,227
What is it about good sex
that makes me have to crap?

294
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,870
Guess it's all that pumpin'.

295
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,735
Pump and dump.

296
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,969
You really jarred
something loose, tiger.

297
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,716
Oh, boy.

298
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,254
Got two bits of advice for you.

299
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:31,159
Number one: Forget about this bowling
business and get yourself a real job.

300
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,564
Number two: You still owe me
another month's rent.

301
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:42,164
So if I were you, I would start doing
some tongue exercises before Friday.

302
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,691
Oh, top of the morning to you.
I'm Hezakiah Munson.

303
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,599
I'm passing through
on my way to Ohio.

304
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,263
Any shingling or butter churning
need doing?

305
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:01,214
Lucas. You know better than that.
We're waiting on your brother...

306
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,220
to come in from the fields.

307
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,224
How many children do you have,
Brother Hezakiah?

308
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,765
None that I know of.

309
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,897
What I mean to say is I was...

310
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,496
We... I'm unable to have children.

311
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,567
Nasty cheese-grating accident
as a young man.

312
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,742
Why are you late this time, Ishmael?

313
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,785
Sorry, Pa.
I was out in the cornfield...

314
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,083
and the stalks were broken...

315
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,123
and I thought I could fix them.

316
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,623
Hi, Grandma.

317
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,990
Please meet our friend...

318
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,591
from Ohio, Brother Hezakiah.

319
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,603
Hello, Ishmael.

320
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,510
Why did you come here?

321
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,606
We didn't get a chance
to finish talking.

322
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,209
You're only going
to make trouble for me.

323
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,878
Have a seat.

324
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,957
Look. My grandfather took me bowling
when I was a kid.

325
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,654
It was our secret.

326
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,857
If anyone here found out
that I went to that bowling alley...

327
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,900
I don't know what would happen.

328
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:27,563
There's a tournament
in Reno, Nevada, in a few weeks.

329
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,369
The best bowlers in the country
are going to be there.

330
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:34,469
With my help, I think you can beat them.
You hear me?

331
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,572
The first prize is $1 million.

332
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,913
We split everything
right down the middle.

333
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,415
No, sir. I think it's best
that you go.

334
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,889
By tomorrow, they'll find out
that you're a fraud.

335
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,893
We Amish demand more of ourselves.

336
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,862
You people work 8-hour days.
We work 12.

337
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,923
We do whatever you people do
plus a half. That's how we survive.

338
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,060
Believe me, keeping up
is not going to be a problem.

339
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:09,609
Pa! His bed's made, but he
isn't in there. He must have left.

340
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,246
Guess Brother Hezakiah was afraid
of getting his fingers dirty.

341
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,186
Morning! I hope you don't mind.
I got up a little early...

342
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,519
so I took the liberty
of milking your cow.

343
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:24,290
It took a little while to get her
warmed up. She sure is a stubborn one.

344
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,226
We don't have a cow.

345
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,234
We have a bull.

346
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,201
I'll brush my teeth.

347
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:07,463
Take Lucas down with the other children.
Keep an eye on them for us, please.

348
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,734
Brother Hezekiah, come with us.

349
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,244
The children?
I wanted to help with the barn.

350
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,178
You can help after lunch.
Go ahead.

351
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,474
Grab your tools. Follow me.

352
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,811
I don't know how a barn-raising
is done in Ohio...

353
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,757
but here in Pennsylvania,
no one runs for the dinner bell...

354
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,624
in the middle of lifting
a 2,000-pound wall!

355
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,187
Okay. All right. I mean...

356
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:47,432
Brother Thomas, you know what it says
in the Bible about not forgiving people.

357
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,733
Why don't you tell us all what it says?

358
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,846
Well, it's against it.

359
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,346
Thomas can raise a barn...

360
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,414
but can he pick up a 7-10 split?

361
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,791
God blessed my brother
to be a good carpenter.

362
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,420
It's okay.

363
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,227
He blessed you, too,
and I'll give you a clue what it is.

364
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,360
It's round and has three holes,
and you stick your fingers into it.

365
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,734
You leave Rebecca out of this!

366
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,239
I'm talking about bowling...
your future.

367
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,836
Just drop it. Right now,
the only future I have...

368
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,846
is reshoeing Buttercup.

369
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,439
Holy cow!

370
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:37,011
Yeah, this is Buttercup, the biggest,
strongest horse in the county.

371
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,023
I'd like a word with you.

372
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,524
Okay, Pa.

373
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:50,165
Take the horse's shoes off.
Ishmael will be right back.

374
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,666
Don't be angry with your brother.

375
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:03,544
He's been under a lot of pressure
dealing with those bankers.

376
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,980
Is everything okay?

377
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,015
No, son.

378
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:13,888
The community's in trouble. They're
threatening to foreclose on the land.

379
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,086
Is there anything I can do?

380
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:21,257
Not unless you can figure out a way to
come up with a half a million dollars.

381
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,167
There's a storm on the horizon.

382
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,668
I guess the angels are bowling.

383
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,908
Maybe they'll bring us a messenger.

384
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,212
Took some doing,
but I finally got them off.

385
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,255
Where do you keep the new shoes?

386
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,421
What, I got a boog hanging?

387
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,893
Tell my parents that God spoke to me
to go on a mission with Brother Munson.

388
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,905
If the good Lord sees fit...

389
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,568
I'll be back
with enough money to save the land.

390
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:10,410
Promise me that you'll be careful
when you're out among the English.

391
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,813
Do not allow yourself to be corrupted.

392
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,184
Don't worry, Miss Rebecca.
Your goodness gives me strength.

393
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,917
Nothing can make me stray.

394
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,736
Buckle up, my friend. You're
about to embark on a great adventure.

395
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,815
- Smoke?
- No.

396
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,316
No, thanks.

397
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,520
You really should try to quit.

398
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,319
They say it's bad for your heart,
your lungs.

399
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,361
- Quickens the aging process.
- Is that right?

400
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,362
Who's done more research
on the subject...

401
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,524
than the good people
at the American tobacco industry?

402
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,299
They say it's harmless. Why would they
lie? If you're dead, you can't smoke.

403
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,705
You get warmed up.
I'll grab us a cup of coffee.

404
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,078
I don't drink coffee.

405
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,640
- Why not?
- It's a stimulant.

406
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,684
What do you think cigarettes are?

407
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,056
They are?

408
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,653
Make it extra-large,
two sugars, lots of cream.

409
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,830
Lots of cream.

410
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,839
You all right?

411
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:56,115
Ish, what happened in there?

412
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,051
I don't know.
I thought I played pretty good.

413
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,389
He's just a little better than me,
that's all.

414
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,487
Pretty good? 186.

415
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,061
You lost to a club player!

416
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,867
That's not supposed to happen!
You're carrying a 270 average!

417
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,876
What do you expect?
I mean, you guys with your 10 frames.

418
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,673
What do you mean, "10 frames"?

419
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,774
My grandpa always taught me
to bowl 15 frames.

420
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:31,413
Like I told you, we Amish do everything
half again as hard as you do.

421
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,391
Ten frames? That's for Quakers.

422
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,693
- I ain't going home.
- Look.

423
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,396
You wouldn't stand a chance
against those guys.

424
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,864
You said I was the best prospect
you'd ever seen.

425
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,535
You said you could make me a champion.

426
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:57,707
I've been liquored up for 17 years.
My judgment's not what it once was.

427
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,979
Pull the car over.
I want to get out of here.

428
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,922
- I'll drive you home.
- I don't want to go home!

429
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,255
I want to go to Reno!

430
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,057
Now pull the car over.
Let me out of here.

431
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,369
This is silly.
You've only been gone a couple of days.

432
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,371
They'll forgive you.

433
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,840
Yeah, you're right.

434
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,843
They'll probably forgive me.

435
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:31,748
They expect me to come home with my tail
between my legs, but I won't do it.

436
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,785
I'd sooner get Munsoned
out here in the middle of nowhere...

437
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,820
than lose face in front of my friends.

438
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,479
What did you say?

439
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,421
I don't want to lose face...

440
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,118
No, before that.

441
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,128
I said I'd sooner get Munsoned
out here...

442
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,823
in the middle of nowhere.

443
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,492
"Munsoned"?
What the hell is that?

444
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:54,231
You know. Munsoned.
To be up a creek without a paddle.

445
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,741
To have the world in the palm
of your hand and then blow it.

446
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,038
It's a figure of speech.

447
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,860
Congratulations, my friend.
You passed the test.

448
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,801
A true champion doesn't quit,
and neither did you.

449
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,365
You were testing me?

450
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,500
A little Roy 101.

451
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,575
You were just testing me.

452
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,214
Oh, Mr. Munson. Whoa!

453
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,059
Hop in.

454
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,263
I got to watch you.

455
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,994
So I did good, huh?

456
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,834
You did great,
but school's just beginning.

457
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:16,042
A bowler's two worst enemies
are his eyes and his ears.

458
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,556
You shut these, you close those
and you just feel it.

459
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,822
Coach, listen to this.

460
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,829
"English bulldog, one testicle.

461
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,525
$500."

462
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,693
For that kind of money,
you'd think you'd get two testicles.

463
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,205
- Don't you think?
- How the hell should I know?

464
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,207
I'm tired of all your questions.

465
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,676
I'm not here to teach you everything
about everything in the world.

466
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,306
I'm here to teach you about bowling,
and that's it.

467
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,647
Okay. Keep your shirt on.

468
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:59,314
I can figure some things out
for myself.

469
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,129
Wait a minute. I'm going to bet?

470
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:17,334
If we're going to make enough dough
to get to Reno, we're going to bet.

471
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,245
You can't have it both ways.

472
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,942
If you want to earn half a million
dollars and save your town...

473
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,246
you'll have to bend the rules
a little.

474
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,345
No way.
There's no way I can bet.

475
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,688
It's against my religion.
I was raised to not be a gambler.

476
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,660
- There's no way I'm going to bet.
- Hey, hey, Ish.

477
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,697
- No! No way!
- Hey!

478
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:44,996
Listen, you stupid banana head.
You don't have to bet. I'll bet for you.

479
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,661
Oh, that's cool.

480
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,898
What's the worst that could happen?

481
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,375
So, you two are dictionary salesmen.

482
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,176
You would be punctilious
in assuming that.

483
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:05,188
Your buddy tells me you're the best
salesman in the whole company.

484
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,520
You must be a smooth talker.

485
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,627
Yep.

486
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,626
You don't have to read them
to sell them, you know.

487
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,671
So, Steve, what do you say
we bowl a couple of games?

488
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,174
Steve?

489
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,004
Yo, Steve-arino.

490
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:30,946
Oh, right.

491
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,576
Okay, you want to bowl
for some big money, hey?

492
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:40,454
But I'll lose my entire bonus check
because I'm so bombed.

493
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,651
You get that way from ginger ale?

494
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:50,165
No, he was sniffing glue
in the parking lot.

495
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,929
I haven't heard this one
in a while.

496
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,700
How does the rest of this hustle work?

497
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,809
- Nice going, De Niro.
- It's "Steve. "

498
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,007
You want to blow the whole thing?

499
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:11,952
If you guys want a straight-up money
game, go to this address tonight.

500
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,882
At midnight.

501
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,950
And bring some money.

502
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,028
Wow! Look at that!

503
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,831
Are you all right, sir?

504
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,967
I'm fine.
Just make sure you win.

505
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:35,842
We can't lose. It's the centurion's
faith that wins him divine favor.

506
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:42,215
Gotcha! Okay, park the shitbox
and come with me.

507
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,719
Come on.

508
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:49,851
He seems like a real cutup, huh?

509
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,622
You know, Stanley...

510
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:55,563
I don't necessarily feel
like we need to play for money.

511
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,330
- Why don't we just play for fun?
- Cut the bullshit.

512
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,236
I know you're a hustler.
Can your kid play or not?

513
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,534
He can play.

514
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,478
Fine. Then it's $1,000 a game.

515
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,577
Claudia, why don't you show us the way
to the bowling alley?

516
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,421
Isn't she the most incredible woman
you've ever seen?

517
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,226
She's hot.

518
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,060
And those babies are real.

519
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,169
Twice.

520
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,934
What's so funny?

521
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,815
I didn't want to be the one to tell him,
but with those narrow hips...

522
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,909
that girl couldn't have
more than 6 or 7 children.

523
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,260
An open frame in the 10th.
I was robbed, goddamn it!

524
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:08,430
He's got a 228.
You need three strikes.

525
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,273
Okay? Stay focused.

526
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,401
Snap it. Pull that string.
All right.

527
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:21,208
Now it's getting interesting, huh?

528
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,619
Bottom of the ninth,
two-minute warning, last frame?

529
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,435
There's no question farmer boy's a fine
bowler, but competing under pressure?

530
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,802
One more.

531
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,875
Boy, it's hot in here.
I need something to cool down.

532
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:15,368
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?
Does anyone else want one?

533
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,374
Yeah, I'll take a couple of jugs...
mugs.

534
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,535
Bottle. One bottle.

535
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,308
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
I'll get that.

536
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,046
What kind do you want?

537
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,555
Whatever.

538
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,289
Here you go, sir.

539
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,461
- Come on, buddy. Bowl.
- Yeah. I'm kind of nippy.

540
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,185
Yes!

541
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,192
What can I say? Good game.
My hat's off to you.

542
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:22,095
The great Stanley got beaten
by the farm boy on his own track.

543
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,375
Could I have a word with you
in the other room, dear?

544
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,386
Don't you ever pull that shit with me.

545
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,031
What's wrong with you?

546
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,565
Anyway, I owe you guys
a little bit of money.

547
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,104
Let's play another game.

548
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,084
Oh, no, not tonight.
We got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow...

549
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,813
and it's a school night.

550
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,652
- What the hell is that?
- What?

551
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,659
This. $100 bill
wrapped in Monopoly money?

552
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,667
You look like you want to hit me.

553
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,636
We don't raise our hands in anger
against others.

554
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,530
Well, we do!

555
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,771
Unbelievable!
You disgrace my home...

556
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,746
dishonor the game by betting
with money you don't even have?

557
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,248
You piece of garbage!

558
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,251
I want you to take them out back...

559
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,516
and make his left hand
look just like his right hand!

560
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,184
- Oh, Mr. Munson!
- What the hell? Get them!

561
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,193
- I got them!
- Get the lights!

562
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,786
- I got the punk.
- Where's the door?

563
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,300
You bald bastard,
I'll gouge your eyes out, you son of a...

564
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,800
Ah, shit!

565
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,272
- Give me the keys.
- Why?

566
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,506
Hey, nobody drives my car.

567
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,915
- Come on.
- Wait!

568
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,925
Ah, shit! Look at this.

569
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,476
Slow down.
You're going to get us all killed.

570
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,378
Shit!

571
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:49,610
I don't know why I did this.
I don't know where I'm going...

572
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,813
or what I'll do when I get there.

573
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,220
Why couldn't this have worked out?

574
00:49:55,993 --> 00:50:00,521
He hit me, the bastard,
and hitting, I don't take!

575
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:05,034
Look, just calm down, all right?
Take it easy. Calm.

576
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,036
Like the kid back there. Look how...

577
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,077
Pull it over.

578
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,048
Ishmael always was a strange boy...

579
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,280
but he means well
and we love him.

580
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,914
- Please bring him back home.
- I will, Father.

581
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,891
I promise you
I will not return without him.

582
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,969
I walked past the mall

583
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,267
Just like I say

584
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:47,208
And I felt this hurt
that would not go home

585
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:51,236
I can't expect you all
to see this my way

586
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,908
But you might not remember

587
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,612
The trees that I'd known

588
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,881
And I want them to bring back

589
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,082
My old corner store

590
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,228
Damn this hand!

591
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,491
Where do you get something like that?

592
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,592
Prosthetics-R-Us, aisle six.
Right next to the glass eyeballs.

593
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,399
Must be tough
when you're spanking your monkey.

594
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,237
You have a monkey?

595
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,005
Hey, handsome. How about a dance?

596
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,747
Yeah, well, thank you, young lovely...

597
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,978
but I'm a little worn out.

598
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,986
I wasn't asking you.

599
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,318
She said "hand-some,"
not "hand-less. "

600
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,451
- So how about it?
- I don't know how to dance.

601
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,461
Well, it's about time you learned.

602
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,232
Well, when there's things to do

603
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,437
And not because you gotta

604
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,537
When you run for love

605
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,775
Not because you oughta

606
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,511
Listen.

607
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:06,044
We appreciate your help with
your boyfriend and everything, but...

608
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,385
You look.

609
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,823
I did it for the kid.

610
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:13,294
Cheap hustler like you, I don't care
if they put a bullet in your head.

611
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,059
Oh, you care about the kid, huh?

612
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,532
I got a news flash for you,
Mother Teresa.

613
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,071
Just because you spend most of your time
in a missionary position...

614
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,073
doesn't make you a missionary.

615
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,000
This will work out fine.

616
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,374
What?

617
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,710
It's better that we don't like each
other, since we'll be business partners.

618
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,510
Checks and balances.

619
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,152
- Business partners?
- Yeah.

620
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,653
That's precious.

621
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,316
I saw your phony roll.

622
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,189
You don't have enough money
to get to Reno.

623
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,524
Why don't you just...

624
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,622
eat your chili fries,
drink your shake...

625
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:53,499
and go blow lunch or whatever you do
to keep your ass in business.

626
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,003
Look, Mr. Munster.

627
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,801
You're not exactly the smartest guy
I ever ran across.

628
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,843
Yeah? And who are you?
Alfred Einstein?

629
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,447
So this is rock and roll.

630
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,719
- I like it.
- Oh, God.

631
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,887
- It's my boyfriend, Skidmark.
- I'd like to meet him.

632
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,925
I don't think you do.

633
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,055
Your act is about as fresh
as a Foghat concert.

634
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,065
It really bites.

635
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:27,797
I know a little about this racket.
I learned it the hard way.

636
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,967
Yeah, well, I've got stake money...
500 bucks.

637
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,737
I'll tell you something else.

638
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,903
Ishmael likes me.

639
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,413
I promise you, you're not his type.

640
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:42,212
Oh, I'm his type.
I'm every guy's type.

641
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,219
You trying to pick up my woman?

642
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:47,222
You crazy or something?
Come here!

643
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,691
She was just teaching me to dance.
I didn't know how to dance.

644
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,352
You want to dance?

645
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,488
You saying you want me to dance?

646
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,896
No, not if you don't want to.

647
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,992
You're trying to move in on my squirrel.

648
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,003
I ought to stoot-slap your ass
right now.

649
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,335
We're going to drill you
another asshole!

650
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,102
You want to kiss somebody, Goldilocks?
Kiss these!

651
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,685
Take that, you freaky piece of shit.
You don't mow another guy's lawn!

652
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,551
All right!

653
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,058
That was really heroic.

654
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,096
I did Ish a favor.

655
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:30,564
If I hadn't knocked him out,
those animals would've torn him apart.

656
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:34,400
- That's the thanks I get?
- You didn't have to have beers with 'em.

657
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,965
I didn't want them to think
that we were in cahoots.

658
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,937
You cleared that up
when you rubbed Tabasco in his eyes.

659
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:49,284
Could you move that seat up
so I can stretch my feet out?

660
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,279
Thanks.

661
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,824
Here. I had them wrap up your food...

662
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,417
'cause this is probably
your last meal...

663
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,089
seeing as you don't have
anymore money.

664
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,098
You're the greatest.

665
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,639
I just had a thought.

666
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:16,434
Seeing as how Claudia
has been so kind...

667
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,141
to us, I thought maybe...

668
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,343
she could join us
till she gets back on her feet.

669
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,021
If I could see you, I'd kiss you.

670
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,756
Isn't he the best?

671
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,764
You're the best, Mr. Munson.

672
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,303
Whatcha doin'?

673
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,870
Flossin'.

674
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,887
Where'd I get Munson from?

675
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,317
The name's Munson. What I'm doing
is flossing. This is called floss.

676
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:21,090
It cleans your teeth. You should try it.
You'll be amazed what you find.

677
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,099
I don't know much about life
outside of Brimfield.

678
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,569
I was never in a car before.

679
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,766
I never stayed
in a fancy hotel before...

680
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,776
never saw a man pick his nose
with a hook before.

681
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,675
When I stop and think about it all...

682
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,682
it can get pretty scary.

683
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,423
- It's an emergency. We got to leave.
- But what are we...

684
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:55,896
- No if, ands or buts. Get moving.
- I'll go get Miss Claudia.

685
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:59,401
No. Don't get Claudia.
I'll explain it all later.

686
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,528
- Just be quiet.
- Okay.

687
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,206
I think I tore my sack.

688
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,211
Are you okay?

689
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,611
What did I just say?

690
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:15,378
- "I think I tore my sack"?
- No. "Be quiet!"

691
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,185
The army evacuated everybody.

692
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,758
Yeah. A big military train derailed...

693
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:29,662
and this whole area is in danger of
being contaminated by a huge cloud of...

694
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,792
- Shit.
- A huge cloud of shit?

695
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,166
Wow.

696
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,536
I think I smell it!
Come on. Let's go.

697
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,236
Could we go have a little chat?

698
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,808
- Surely.
- Great.

699
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:57,490
Hey, everybody, there's
a shit cloud coming! Run for your lives!

700
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,427
A $60-a-night motel room,
and you're sleeping in the car?

701
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,693
- That makes sense.
- Don't I feel like a fool?

702
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,996
I know what you're thinking.
Let me explain.

703
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,535
Mommy!

704
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,839
You must have a really wide foot.
You got both of them.

705
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,506
I can't believe you were going
to ditch out and go to Reno without me!

706
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,072
I thought we were partners.

707
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,812
Spare me the indignant routine,
all right?

708
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:27,014
You've been rubbing your tits
in that kid's face since we met...

709
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,217
so you could steal him.

710
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,624
- What?
- Don't give me that "What?" crap.

711
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:35,425
Half the dresses you got,
you need two hairdos to wear. Admit it!

712
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:39,594
You been planning on taking him from me
and leaving me. I just beat you to it.

713
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,502
How dare you accuse me of anything!

714
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:46,668
Ish worships you, and you've fed him
bullshit to line your own pockets.

715
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,677
Come on. Right now.

716
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,680
- You and me, bud.
- What...

717
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,682
Hey, look. Listen, lady.

718
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,344
I've done a lot of creepy things
in my life.

719
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,582
I'm won't lower myself
to having a fistfight with a girl.

720
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,523
Stop that!

721
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,099
Where is he?

722
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,803
Great.

723
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,438
"I thought you were my friends.
Good-bye. Ishmael. "

724
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:18,259
I hope Ishmael has enough street smarts
to get to Reno by himself.

725
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,767
Poor guy.

726
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,937
He's like a baby out there.

727
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:28,310
I hope he doesn't get Munsoned
out in the middle of nowhere.

728
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:34,715
Oh, shit.

729
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:40,188
You know, I didn't realize it,
but we're near where I grew up.

730
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,657
What time are the tours
to your boyhood home?

731
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,640
You know, it's been...

732
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,836
17 years since I showed
my face around here.

733
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,155
How do I look?

734
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,629
You look good. Real sharp.

735
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,370
All right.

736
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,514
You okay?

737
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:25,757
I... It's just not what I expected.

738
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,598
What's taken you so long to come back?

739
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,435
Guess I was ashamed.

740
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:35,936
Everybody expected so much from me.

741
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,073
Everyone believed in me.

742
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,537
At least my dad did.

743
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,548
He gave me this when I left.

744
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,452
I never could get
the damn thing running.

745
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:58,226
It's funny. It's like time stopped
for me when I left this town.

746
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,695
He taught me a lot out here.

747
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,641
I got word he died about 10 years ago.

748
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,151
I didn't even have the nerve
to come back for the funeral.

749
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,225
Well, your old man would be proud.

750
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:34,889
Here you are, passing all that
bowling knowledge on to Ishmael.

751
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,364
No, he wouldn't be proud.

752
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,473
Let's go find that kid.

753
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,894
I sure hope you make enough money
out in Reno...

754
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,263
to save that town of yours.

755
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,393
Oh, thanks, Miss Tabitha.

756
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:23,941
- Time to settle up.
- Is that eight hours already?

757
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,413
This shift just flew by.

758
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:33,512
This lap dancing's so much fun, I feel
like I should be the one paying you.

759
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,687
- Gee, mister, I didn't know!
- Didn't know?

760
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,525
No, please, sir!
Please!

761
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:45,089
I- I can work it off. I'm pretty good
with a needle and thread.

762
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,603
I can knit. I can sew the girls'
costumes when they get frayed.

763
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:52,869
No, sir, please! I'll do anything!
Anything! Please!

764
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:54,603
Anything?

765
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,812
Come here.

766
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,417
What do you think about new beginnings?

767
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:07,047
What is that?
The feminine hygiene spray?

768
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,683
You and me, starting over.

769
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,186
Yeah.

770
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,198
I like that.

771
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:24,933
- Longish hair. Yeah. Down that way.
- Weird guy?

772
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:27,738
Uncle Willee's Snake Farm.

773
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:31,678
Yeah, he was here.
I offered him a job, a good job.

774
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:34,375
You think that guy took it?

775
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,814
He didn't take it.
The wimp is afraid of snakes.

776
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,621
Son of a bitch, you're going in my soup.

777
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,296
Thank you.

778
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:11,852
Have you seen a big Amish guy
come through here...

779
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,413
40-ish, stocky, sort of friendly?

780
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,721
Kind of stupid?

781
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,886
Well, naive.

782
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,426
Feast your eyes.

783
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:46,685
Get in! Come on! Get a move on!

784
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,555
- Nobody quits in the middle of a show!
- Sons of bitches!

785
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:57,464
I don't understand how you can still be
mad at us. We just saved your butt.

786
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:01,936
I heard what you were saying about me,
about each other.

787
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:05,599
I thought we were partners,
but I guess I was wrong.

788
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,310
It's tough out there, all right?

789
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,440
The world can kick your ass.

790
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:17,452
I only have a vague recollection
of when it wasn't kicking mine.

791
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,878
I guess that's why Claudia and I
were fighting.

792
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,948
We both had a rotten run of it
for awhile.

793
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:29,191
You get hurt over and over again,
you stop trusting people...

794
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,426
so you don't get hurt again.

795
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:39,166
Look, if you really want to end this,
we'll drop you off wherever you want.

796
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,933
If you want to go on...

797
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,606
from here on out, we're all
gonna work together as a team.

798
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:49,242
And no more bullshitting.
I promise.

799
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,889
You remember what it says in the Bible
about not forgiving, right?

800
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,619
I know exactly what it says.

801
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,089
It's against it, right?

802
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,042
" Jeffersons On Ice"! Look at that.
I love Sherman Helmsley!

803
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,930
What's this?

804
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:28,170
- What is that?
- It's a tattoo. Relax.

805
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,269
How could you let me do this?

806
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,841
I don't know. I don't remember a thing.
The whole night's a blur to me.

807
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,455
I've committed a sin.

808
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,790
I've desecrated my body.
Can't go home now.

809
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,989
No, can't go home.

810
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:53,125
It'll come right off.
It'll burn off in a jiffy.

811
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:00,074
Hey, this isn't so bad.

812
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,244
What's the matter?

813
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,270
Nothing.

814
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,857
You are going to give me $100,000
on the line...

815
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,918
and a $50,000 yell, okay?

816
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:25,797
Hey, top-heavy, give me a Tiparillo and
a sake and seltzer, s'il vous plait.

817
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:29,031
Okay. Here we go.
Come on! Do it to me!

818
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,369
Yeah, right. Overshot. All right.

819
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:39,005
No, it's okay,
because I am going to bet...

820
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:44,041
$800,000 on the line.

821
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,552
Okay?

822
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,255
Here we go.

823
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,451
Hey, doll-face, how about bringing me
a little Lady Luck?

824
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,961
- Sure thing.
- Well, no, not you.

825
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,663
Winner!

826
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,933
That's something.

827
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,438
All right.

828
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,615
Okay, here we go. Two number 64s...

829
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,754
and a 41.

830
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,921
Their 64 is supposed to be
the best in the city.

831
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,825
Yeah? That 41 doesn't look bad.

832
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,056
Go to the potato bar when you're ready.

833
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,656
Who is the biggest threat
to you in the tournament?

834
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:35,430
Me. If I get drunk, fall down and
hurt myself, I might lose. Sure, babe.

835
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,438
- What's your name?
- Darlene.

836
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,440
- I'm in 1103.
- Excuse me.

837
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,477
What's the story behind
this paternity suit against you?

838
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:45,104
It's not a case.
The woman's a stone-faced liar.

839
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,911
Let's not talk about that. I pulled out
of her really early on that one.

840
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,009
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

841
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,348
Hey!

842
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,355
The Munson.

843
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:59,350
Big Ern. Long time.

844
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:02,761
I'll say. Probably a year
for every topping on the table.

845
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,433
I heard a horrible rumor.

846
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,836
Oh, creepy!

847
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,237
I'm sorry.

848
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:16,004
You know, for the first couple years...

849
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,012
I felt responsible.

850
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,710
How you been otherwise?

851
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,953
The last 17 years,
a day hasn't gone by...

852
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:29,684
that I haven't thought about what I'd
say to you if I ever ran into you again.

853
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,593
I bet. Hello.

854
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:36,495
Oh, my God. Claudia?

855
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,858
You two know each other?

856
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:43,302
It's a small world
when you got unbelievable tits.

857
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,535
Baby, we had some good times
in Chicago.

858
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,372
I remember. I know
you haven't forgotten.

859
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:53,710
- Him and you? The two of you together?
- Why don't you quit slumming?

860
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,875
Come back to me.
Let's try to make it work.

861
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:59,148
Let's try, really try. How about it?

862
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,486
I'd rather mop the floors
at a peep show.

863
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,891
Oh, girl, you still got
your great stuff.

864
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:09,226
Why don't you get the hell out of here?
You ruined my life!

865
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,962
Are you still holding on to the anger?
I said I was sorry. I meant it.

866
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:18,837
I remember that night too, and I don't
remember anybody twisting your arm.

867
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:23,401
Oh, God! I just said "twisting your arm"
to Munson. I can't wait to tell people...

868
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:27,947
Don't do it. He's just trying
to lower you to his level.

869
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,883
Let me give you some advice.
Stay away from this guy.

870
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:33,251
Give him a wide berth.

871
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,224
He's what is called a born loser...

872
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:40,159
a real Munson.

873
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:41,661
You!

874
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:47,999
You just shut up, mister!
I don't know who you think you are...

875
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,166
but if you don't wiggle those
childbearing hips out that door...

876
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,834
you're going to find your nose
sniffing my big Amish ass!

877
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,844
I'm in 1103.

878
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,877
Thanks.

879
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,385
You okay?

880
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,395
I'm going to go after him, talk to him.

881
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,638
Boo.

882
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,682
You shouldn't have quit me.

883
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,059
Yeah? You shouldn't have hit me.

884
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,394
You think that hurt?

885
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,635
You wait and see what I do
to your two friends.

886
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:00,196
Look, we both made mistakes.

887
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,108
I've got 42 grand right there.
We can take off now.

888
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,339
Those guys are bugging me anyway.

889
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,246
I want to see those guys
one more time.

890
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:13,913
They're not worth it.
They're a couple of losers.

891
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,924
We can just take off right now.

892
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,020
I missed you.

893
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,169
You okay?

894
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,944
You're not taking a crap
in the sink, are you?

895
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,553
It's over.

896
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,486
It's broken.

897
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,326
I think it's just sprained.

898
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,924
Okay. It's broke.

899
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,301
Excuse me. Where is the lady
who's staying here?

900
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,967
- She checked out already.
- She left with a couple of guys.

901
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:11,638
Couple of guys? No.
You mean you saw her with us, right?

902
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,648
No. These guys were good looking.

903
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,287
You got the bag, right?

904
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:26,119
- Tell me you got the bag.
- Oh, yeah. Okay, relax.

905
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,128
Yeah, the bag's fine.

906
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:32,132
I gave it to Miss Claudia to hold.

907
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,813
Who are you calling a psycho?

908
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,184
I didn't say anything to you.

909
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,550
Are you okay?

910
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,364
Hi. How are you?

911
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,196
Remember me?

912
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,294
Yeah. From the crap table.

913
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,568
That's right. From the crap table.

914
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:16,077
And you're the big guy
with the lucky dice, aren't you?

915
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:19,012
Oh, geez.

916
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:23,244
Boy, the two of you kind of look
a little down on your luck.

917
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:26,219
- If you only knew.
- Geez, that's tough.

918
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,490
Look at George and Wheezie go.

919
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,618
What did that fat-ass model do
with my lottery ticket?

920
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:37,923
Well, look, I've got
a little proposition for you.

921
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,594
I'm all ears.

922
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,970
I will pay you $1 million
to sleep with your friend here.

923
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:50,034
$1 million. One night. Cash.

924
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,605
I just throw that out.
You two mull it over.

925
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,117
Get back to me. I'll be back here.

926
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:02,822
What's there to mull over?

927
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:06,418
Are you going to set
that creep straight, or should I?

928
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,428
I'll handle this.

929
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,606
I said, are you all right?

930
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:41,560
I wish I'd have never trusted her.
What was I thinking?

931
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,531
42 grand down the drain.

932
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:49,803
- She'll be back.
- You're never going to see her again.

933
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,863
I happen to think you're wrong.

934
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:57,310
Anyway, it doesn't matter. The money
we came to win is right here in Reno...

935
01:21:57,379 --> 01:22:00,212
at a legitimate sporting contest
where the best player wins...

936
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:03,445
because he's the best player,
and we have the best player.

937
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,952
I'm listening.

938
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:09,388
We'll do what we set out to do.
We'll win that tournament.

939
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:12,153
Yes! I knew...

940
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,526
you were a champion
the minute I saw you bowl.

941
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,461
I'm not going to bowl. You are.

942
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,560
You are such a loser.

943
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:25,572
You're a bona fide schmuck. Look at me!

944
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,341
You can win that tournament.

945
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:33,074
You're a champion,
and that never goes away.

946
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:37,380
If you made it through the first few
rounds, you'd find your touch again.

947
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:39,978
I'm Ernie McCracken.

948
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:44,958
When I found out Billy was growing up
without a daddy, I had to do something.

949
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:49,053
When Big Ern saw us in the paper,
he got involved with the Unified Fund.

950
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,293
I had to. I couldn't help myself.

951
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:56,599
But little Billy's not the only one.
There's also little Jason here.

952
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,606
Once again, this year I'll be
sponsoring a fatherless family...

953
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:02,575
in every city I bowl in.

954
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:06,375
Sometimes when I wake up in the morning,
Mr. McCracken's already there.

955
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,984
Jonathan, run a fly pattern
all the way to the goal line.

956
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,922
Tennessee!

957
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,787
Kentucky!

958
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:20,193
Find the meat!

959
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,627
Uh, deeper, Jonathan.

960
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:30,467
It's a tough world. These kids nearly
got Munsoned, but they're back now.

961
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,872
Through the Unified Fund,
I found out...

962
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:37,844
that if you give a little,
you can get back...

963
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:40,244
a whole lot more.

964
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,638
Hey, give me that. What are you doing?

965
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:11,172
It's a young crowd.
I don't recognize a single soul.

966
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:15,249
Welcome to my church.

967
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:21,054
It's kind of intimidating to be in
the presence of so many great athletes.

968
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,323
Hi. What's your name?

969
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,158
Munson, Roy E.

970
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:32,198
Seriously.

971
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,541
- Amateur or professional?
- Professional.

972
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:47,009
We have a problem here.

973
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,384
Your dues are in arrears.

974
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:53,478
You haven't paid them since 1979.

975
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:59,350
How much is that going to cost me?

976
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:02,521
Dues times 16 years...

977
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,566
plus penalties plus interest...

978
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:09,125
equals $38.

979
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,875
Let's go. That's it.

980
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:20,538
Would you be willing to hold on to this
till after the tournament?

981
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,379
Come on. What are we going to do
with a rubber hand?

982
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,484
The ring.

983
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:32,856
Okay.

984
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:35,623
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

985
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:40,532
The National Bowling Stadium, with
the Silver Legacy Hotel and Casino...

986
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,435
would like to welcome everyone
to the $1 Million...

987
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:44,802
Winner Take All...

988
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:48,001
Brunswick-Reno Open!

989
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:51,842
Please enjoy your stay here at
our fabulous facility, and remember...

990
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:57,044
the Silver Legacy is the talk of the
strip with our 22-topping potato bar.

991
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:59,586
Let's start the tournament!

992
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,313
That's the way!

993
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,319
All right!

994
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:37,457
You wouldn't happen to have
a Phillips-head screwdriver, would you?

995
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,257
Never mind.

996
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:21,935
All right!

997
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:26,694
You know, Ish, I'm starting to feel
like a winner again.

998
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:30,329
Okay, you scumbags.
Now turn around and face the wall.

999
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,371
We have a Cinderella story
shaping up here.

1000
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:19,209
Roy Munson, the 1979
Iowa State Amateur Champion...

1001
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,215
has suddenly come out of nowhere
with his bowling ball.

1002
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:24,877
He is a major contender
in this competition.

1003
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:28,080
So, Roy, let me ask you. What have you
been doing all these years?

1004
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:35,452
Well, the-the...
After the hand, I...

1005
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,896
No, there was the '80s.

1006
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:39,956
You know, for a while, I...

1007
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,731
Drinking.

1008
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:47,331
Yeah. A lot of drinking.

1009
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:53,179
Are you still drinking?

1010
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:56,375
No, no, I don't.
That's behind me now.

1011
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,612
Why, are you buying?

1012
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,931
...as the favorite
for "Coach of the Year. "

1013
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:50,596
And now we're going live
to the National Bowling Stadium...

1014
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,936
in the Biggest Little City in the World,
Reno, Nevada...

1015
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,499
where ESPN is set to bring you
final round coverage...

1016
01:31:56,577 --> 01:32:00,877
of the $1 Million Winner Take All
Silver Legacy Reno Open.

1017
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:05,112
What an incredible championship match
we have in store for you today.

1018
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:07,120
Ernie McCracken, a crafty veteran...

1019
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,180
and, you know, a heck of a nice guy,
goes against Roy Munson...

1020
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,591
a promising young talent
in the 1970s.

1021
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:21,363
- Whatcha doin' in there?
- Barfing.

1022
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:24,394
Barfing?

1023
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:27,841
Where do I keep getting "Munson" from?

1024
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:30,343
Please rise for the National Anthem.

1025
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:48,428
Have you been drinking again?

1026
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:52,723
I don't puke when I drink.

1027
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,734
I puke when I don't.

1028
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,237
I'm scared.

1029
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:06,777
Let's get ready to bowl!

1030
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:08,974
Here come our two finalists.

1031
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:13,214
Roy Munson has the most intimidating
hook in all of bowling. Literally.

1032
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:16,381
The fans in Reno have started
calling him the Rubber Man...

1033
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,721
because he bowls
with a rubber prosthetic hand.

1034
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:23,127
Take a look at the focus on Roy's face.
He is ready for this match.

1035
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:25,256
A nasty spill.

1036
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:28,131
That's kind of embarrassing,
in front of an audience like this.

1037
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:32,161
Look at Ernie McCracken. A guy like
Big Ern, with his panache and style...

1038
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:36,107
has clearly done for bowling
what Muhammad Ali did for boxing.

1039
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,203
Wow. Take a look at that.

1040
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,944
Have you, in 34 years of covering
bowling, Chris, seen a ball like that?

1041
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,508
Is that a rose?

1042
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:47,884
It appears to be. Clearly custom-made.

1043
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:51,857
Ernie's got a heart of gold,
but what an intimidator.

1044
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,723
Go, Big Ern!

1045
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,558
He looks for his spot.
On the approach.

1046
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:01,100
How about one more title, sweetness?

1047
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:07,303
Look at that form. That left arm
way out is an unusual style.

1048
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:13,646
- Wow. Right off the bat.
- Beautiful.

1049
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:17,411
He delivers on the goods.
Look at him pump up this crowd.

1050
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,257
Roy looks a little nervous. It is
his first final in nearly 20 years.

1051
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,816
Rubber Man takes the ball
from his good left hand.

1052
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:30,125
Notice how carefully he places it
in the prosthetic hand.

1053
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,563
- You have no idea, the pressure...
- Time out!

1054
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:35,568
- Look at this!
- Give me that handsome cheek!

1055
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:38,504
I only got two!

1056
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:41,803
- Give us a break.
- Look at Big Ern.

1057
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:45,311
Look at Big Ern. Calls her back.

1058
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,312
How gallant is that?

1059
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:53,479
This man's gonna win many political
offices when his career is over.

1060
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:56,489
A great role model for America's kids.

1061
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:02,128
Atta boy, Luther!

1062
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:09,929
Yes, a solid pocket hit.

1063
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:13,599
Munson answers right back
in Big Ern's face.

1064
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:49,532
Hey, sport, Coca-Cola.

1065
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,468
You betcha.

1066
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:56,709
I got to make a phone call.

1067
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,109
Could you put on ESPN, please?

1068
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:06,483
Sure thing.

1069
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,351
Come on, Roy.

1070
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:22,361
- Yes!
- Nice action.

1071
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:34,840
This million-dollar championship match
has reached the 10th frame.

1072
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:38,976
Leading by nine pins, Roy Munson,
shooting first on the right lane.

1073
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:41,988
A strike here provides
some breathing room.

1074
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:54,126
The dreaded 7-10 split.

1075
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:57,728
You know, Roy Munson has two chances
to win this tournament now...

1076
01:37:57,805 --> 01:38:00,273
slim and none... and slim
may have just left town.

1077
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:05,472
How true. In bowling,
there are 1,022 spare leads...

1078
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:08,845
and this, the 7-10,
is by far the most difficult.

1079
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:11,214
Virtually impossible to convert.

1080
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:14,982
There's no way to slide the 10 pin
into the 7 and vice versa.

1081
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:19,856
Oh, please! I can't look!

1082
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:32,199
What are you doing here?

1083
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:34,833
It's time to go home.

1084
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,173
I can't go home now.
This is the 10th frame.

1085
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:40,577
If he makes this, he's going to make
a million dollars and save the farm.

1086
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:45,108
I have half a beer left. There's no way
I'm going home. Over my dead body.

1087
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:48,183
It's time to go home now.

1088
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,436
Oh, my God. He has done it.

1089
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:16,314
Now if Roy can pick up
one final strike...

1090
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:20,877
it'll force Big Ern to roll
three consecutive strikes to win.

1091
01:39:23,657 --> 01:39:27,024
With that spare,
he's not slammed the door on Big Ern...

1092
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:29,392
but he's put on
quite a lot of pressure.

1093
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,564
Where'd he go?

1094
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,910
- Yes.
- Rubber Man has gotten it done...

1095
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:51,008
and now the pressure
is squarely on Big Ern McCracken.

1096
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:55,818
Trailing by 29 pins,
he needs three consecutive strikes...

1097
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:58,119
to win it all.

1098
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:01,650
I need you now more than ever.

1099
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:26,116
One strike down, two to go.
You can cut this pressure with a knife.

1100
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:41,233
That's two. There's two.
His second.

1101
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:56,908
Roy Munson is now forced
to sit and watch.

1102
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:06,358
It has come down to this:

1103
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:09,658
One ball, one strike...

1104
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,392
$1 million.

1105
01:41:12,466 --> 01:41:14,400
And the loser gets nothing.

1106
01:41:56,777 --> 01:42:00,770
I'm magnificent! I'm the greatest!

1107
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:04,079
I'm Big Ern! I'm the greatest!

1108
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:07,382
A one-pin victory
for Ernie McCracken.

1109
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:11,254
Put it in the record books:
226 to 225.

1110
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:32,472
Some lucky fan has a souvenir.

1111
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:41,512
Big Ern, a million dollars.
What are you going to do with it?

1112
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:43,522
I don't know.

1113
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:46,457
All I know is,
I finally got enough money...

1114
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:49,519
that I can buy my way out of anything.

1115
01:42:49,596 --> 01:42:53,123
I can do anything I want
when I get my money later.

1116
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,134
And I won!

1117
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:59,935
Finally, Big Ern is above the law!
It's a great feeling.

1118
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:01,941
You were so cool. Any pressure?

1119
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:06,002
Where are those girls? Get those girls
over here. Yeah, there was pressure.

1120
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,173
I didn't want to get beat
by a guy with a hook.

1121
01:43:09,249 --> 01:43:11,513
Does this mean that he gets
a handicap?

1122
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:14,611
I don't know. I'm rich.
What do I care?

1123
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,838
Tough luck.

1124
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:10,469
- You bastard.
- Where the hell is she?

1125
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:13,741
- How should I know? She was with you.
- She stole my money!

1126
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:16,305
Welcome to the club.

1127
01:44:18,352 --> 01:44:20,286
I checked my phone records
at the hotel.

1128
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:24,188
She called that bastard, McCracken,
14 times in the last three days.

1129
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,056
What the hell is your relationship
to him?

1130
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:32,598
Now stop it!

1131
01:44:36,136 --> 01:44:41,699
I'll tell you what my relationship is
to him. He's the guy who gave me that.

1132
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:44,107
Nice. Is that solid gold?

1133
01:44:44,177 --> 01:44:47,772
- The hand.
- Big Ern was responsible for that?

1134
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:49,110
Yeah.

1135
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:55,643
I don't know. I used to think it was.

1136
01:44:57,391 --> 01:44:59,723
Now it's like you and Claudia.

1137
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:02,728
You probably blame McCracken
for screwing that up.

1138
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:07,629
But I'll bet it's your own damn fault.

1139
01:45:13,073 --> 01:45:15,007
Let's go find McCracken.

1140
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:20,974
Hey. Hey!
What are you looking at?

1141
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:22,982
You suck!

1142
01:45:29,256 --> 01:45:31,622
Go away. You'll get
your rent money tomorrow.

1143
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,366
I got the money.

1144
01:46:08,261 --> 01:46:10,354
You left us flat.

1145
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:14,730
You dumped us when we needed you
the most. You tricked us.

1146
01:46:17,738 --> 01:46:21,196
If I'd have stuck with you,
Stanley would've hurt you and Ishmael.

1147
01:46:23,276 --> 01:46:25,744
What happened to McCracken?

1148
01:46:25,812 --> 01:46:28,906
I never went with him.

1149
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:33,282
I just made those phone calls
to throw Stanley off my scent...

1150
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:36,345
and maybe give Big Ern a little payback.

1151
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:41,460
84 grand.

1152
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:43,462
We can split it three ways.

1153
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:46,993
We only had half that.

1154
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:50,127
Yeah. Well, uh...

1155
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:52,137
we doubled it.

1156
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:58,104
He bet against you.

1157
01:47:02,482 --> 01:47:05,747
But I'm ready to start betting on you.

1158
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:21,367
Yeah, well, too late.

1159
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:24,103
What?

1160
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:27,305
Half a mil?

1161
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:32,144
Trojan condoms. You know, Rubber Man.

1162
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:34,146
All I have to do is a commercial...

1163
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:37,775
show up at a couple trade shows
and pharmacies...

1164
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:40,752
and give a little talk
at Vassar College orientation.

1165
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,722
That's great.

1166
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,782
Yeah. It is great.

1167
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:50,762
And this is only getting divided
one way.

1168
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:04,677
I can't face them.

1169
01:48:05,412 --> 01:48:08,848
I wanted to be the hero for once.

1170
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:11,850
I wanted to be the one to save the day.

1171
01:48:15,755 --> 01:48:20,317
Brother, everyone knows you meant well.

1172
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:50,514
What are you two doing here?

1173
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:56,056
I'll tell you
what they're doing here.

1174
01:48:56,129 --> 01:48:59,223
They came to tell us the truth
about your trip.

1175
01:49:04,137 --> 01:49:06,901
They tell you everything?

1176
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:10,141
Yes, Roy told us everything.

1177
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:15,973
He told us about the booze
and the lusting...

1178
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:20,042
the late nights, the lying...

1179
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:23,989
and the gambling.

1180
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:28,322
And he told us how you got him
to quit all that...

1181
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:35,368
how you got Roy to straighten
his life out and how you got...

1182
01:49:35,435 --> 01:49:40,065
Claudia to quit being
so much of the whore that she is.

1183
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:46,078
Roy told us how every time he wanted
to quit, you wouldn't let him...

1184
01:49:46,146 --> 01:49:49,309
how you quoted the Scriptures
to give him strength.

1185
01:49:50,216 --> 01:49:53,151
Yeah, son, he's told us everything.

1186
01:49:56,122 --> 01:49:58,852
And we're mighty proud of you.

1187
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:08,124
What about the bank
and the foreclosure?

1188
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:13,571
That's all been taken care of
by Brother Roy and Sister Claudia.

1189
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:16,803
They put $500,000 in the bank.

1190
01:50:16,876 --> 01:50:19,310
Our troubles are over!

1191
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,682
You guys!

1192
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:29,717
I'm going to have to watch you two.

1193
01:50:31,524 --> 01:50:33,856
I knew you'd come back.

1194
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:39,728
Thanks.

1195
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:42,359
Thanks for everything.

1196
01:50:45,405 --> 01:50:48,863
You know
that old centurion's faith thing...

1197
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:51,376
about you saving the Amish people?

1198
01:50:56,049 --> 01:50:57,482
Well...

1199
01:50:59,019 --> 01:51:01,487
that was baloney.

1200
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:04,182
It wasn't them you were saving.

1201
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:06,191
It was me.

1202
01:51:12,365 --> 01:51:14,299
You lost me. What?

1203
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:24,301
Come on.
Everyone's waiting at the party.

1204
01:51:24,377 --> 01:51:27,471
They want to hear about the missionary
work you did with Brother Munson.

1205
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:30,710
Okay, Miss Rebecca. Bye.

1206
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:36,550
Bye, Ish.

1207
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:41,618
Hey, Roy.

1208
01:51:42,896 --> 01:51:44,887
I have something for you.

1209
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,833
Wow.

1210
01:51:51,638 --> 01:51:53,572
You got it working.

1211
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,471
Yeah. I wound it.

1212
01:51:56,409 --> 01:51:58,343
Oh, it has a winder?

1213
01:52:00,847 --> 01:52:03,145
Well, look at that. A little ladybug.

1214
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:05,343
You should make a wish.

1215
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:07,552
All right.

1216
01:52:12,358 --> 01:52:14,292
You know what I wished for?

1217
01:52:16,362 --> 01:52:18,057
What?

1218
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:35,378
Bye, Brother Munson. Bye, whore.

1219
01:57:03,449 --> 01:57:04,882
Cut!
