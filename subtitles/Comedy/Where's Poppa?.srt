1
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,339
Hello, goodness. Get yourself a package
of Dorman's Endigo,

2
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,887
the cheese with the paper
between the slices.

3
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,012
Bad news for those planning
to play golf this weekend.

4
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,016
Yes, I'm afraid that is right.
You may get rained out.

5
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,474
37 degrees, the temperature
right now, under cloudy skies.

6
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,311
The wind is north at ﬁve miles.
The sun rose at 6:02.

7
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:09,865
- The sun will set tonight at 6:07.
- There are two stories that tie in

8
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,576
with what we were talking about
earlier this morning

9
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,911
in which we noted that
this is St. Joseph's Day

10
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,080
and the swallows
are coming back to Capistrano.

11
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,954
I thought it was the buzzards
going back to Hinckley, Ohio.

12
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,664
No, that took place on Sunday and then
the swans came to Traverse City, Michigan.

13
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,383
Here are two stories,
one from Carlisle, En gland,

14
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,596
where ofﬁcials of the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

15
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:37,392
say that today they ﬁnally learned
why a group of seagulls

16
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,846
were walking about with
what is described as a wobble

17
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,727
and could not fly.

18
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:47,312
- They've got wobbling seagulls in England?
- Yes. A spokesman for the society said

19
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:52,115
the gulls were drunk on the waste
thrown out onto the street

20
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,409
by an amateur winemaker.

21
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,905
Couple of times a day,
we have the pleasure of presenting

22
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,415
Carol Wrighter for your entertainment.

23
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,370
If you were born between
July 22nd and August 21st,

24
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,876
your astrological sign is Leo.

25
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,927
- And here is your forecast for today.
- All right, all you Leos out there,

26
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,598
please and delight one of your
own clan who has the blues

27
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,018
or is not sure how to tackle
a worry facing them.

28
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,724
Present arrangements can be improved
to have more comfort at home.

29
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:29,186
Think how to handle a ticklish situation
so that everyone will be satisﬁed.

30
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,488
And if you're born
under the sign of Virgo,

31
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,737
get into a serious huddle
with your usual allies.

32
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,281
You are listening
to Rambling with Gambling

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,621
here at WOR Radio in New York.

34
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,743
We have Marian...

35
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,657
Get out of here!

36
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,750
Gordon,

37
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,636
you shouldn't do that.

38
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,056
Always trying to cheer me up.

39
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,182
It's time to get up.

40
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,060
You almost scared me to death.

41
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,016
"Almost" doesn't count.

42
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,938
Gordon, get me my slippers.

43
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,238
Oh, my...

44
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,952
You're such a silly boy,

45
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,079
always teasing your momma.

46
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,275
Where's Poppa?

47
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,819
Still dead.

48
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,325
Don't talk fresh. Where is he?

49
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,282
Come on, will you?
You want me to help you or not? I'm late.

50
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,085
You're a good boy, Gordon.

51
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,545
What happened to that lady
with the white shoes?

52
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,418
She always dressed me nice.

53
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,125
She quit.

54
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,969
She was a good dresser,
but she never let me wear her white shoes.

55
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,595
- That's why I hid them in the toidy.
- That's why she quit.

56
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,806
I fell down, Gordon.

57
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,644
What the hell is that?

58
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,528
Gordon.

59
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,984
Yes.

60
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,621
I gotta get my roots touched up.

61
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,621
What happened to that lady
touched up my roots so good?

62
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,710
She used to pinch me.

63
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,130
She didn't pinch you. You pinched her.

64
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,708
Yeah, that's right. I liked to pinch her.

65
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,668
That's why she quit.

66
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,515
This is a blue dress.

67
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,181
I wanna wear my red dress today.

68
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,690
Why?

69
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,770
This one is Poppa's favorite.

70
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,619
Yeah. You know, it shows off my figure.

71
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,992
Yeah.

72
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,586
It's so beautiful!

73
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,052
This isn't my red dress.

74
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,051
It is so.

75
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,470
Yeah?

76
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,934
It's so big on me.

77
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,315
All your clothes are too big for you.
You're shrinking.

78
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,449
You're getting smaller every day.

79
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,660
You say, when you left
the apartment this morning,

80
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,783
your mother was all right.

81
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,457
That's right, Officer. She was fine.

82
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,920
- She was gone when you got back?
- That's right. Disappeared.

83
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,296
People just don't disappear.

84
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,586
- What do you suppose happened to her?
- I think the dog ate her.

85
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,672
- Don't give me any of that bullshit.
- No, I'm serious.

86
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,303
When I got home today,
I found the dog in the kitchen,

87
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,227
there was a red dress
hanging out the corner of his mouth.

88
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,100
And what does that prove?

89
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,683
My mother was wearing that dress
when I left this morning.

90
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,602
Is that the alleged dog?

91
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,238
Yep. It's just the way I found him.

92
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,693
How the hell can a dog eat an old lady?

93
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,996
You see, Officer,
she'd been shrinking a lot lately,

94
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,166
and she really wasn't
much bigger than a rabbit.

95
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,419
Just about one good bite for the dog.

96
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,878
Okay. I'll have to take him
downtown and book him.

97
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,583
Whatever you say, Officer.

98
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,838
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer any questions.

99
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,013
Do you understand?

100
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,185
Gordon!

101
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,724
I'm hungry!

102
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,831
Mom.

103
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,661
To keep you company,
how would you like a nice, big dog?

104
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,584
I don't like dogs.

105
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,266
I like canaries.

106
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:47,104
- Bert! Come here, Bert.
- Where are you, Ernie?

107
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,654
- I'm right here in my bathtub.
- I see. Okay, Ernie. What is it now?

108
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,948
What is it now?
I am here in my tubby, Bert.

109
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,900
That means I'm going to wash myself.

110
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,156
Gordon!

111
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,740
- You forgot my breakfast.
- I'm going to wash myself, and while I do,

112
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,459
you're going to pretend
you are washing yourself.

113
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,956
- I am?
- Of course you are.

114
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,963
That's what all the boys and girls
listening are going to do.

115
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,211
- Are you ready, Bert?
- Look, no, Ernie, I don't...

116
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,545
Good! And are all you kids ready? Good.

117
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,514
Okay. Everybody wash!

118
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,063
Everybody wash your hands!

119
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,568
Everybody wash your face.

120
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,825
Gordon.

121
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,080
You know I like it cut six pieces.

122
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,639
Everybody wash your tummy.

123
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,692
- Okay, Bert, you take the next one.
- My turn? Yep, you do it.

124
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,478
Everybody wash your heels.

125
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,030
- Your heels, Bert?
- Yeah, it is fun.

126
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,448
Okay.

127
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,576
Everybody wash your kneecaps.

128
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,788
- Your kneecap, Bert?
- Your kneecaps, both of them.

129
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,248
Okay.

130
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,997
Here we go. Everybody wash your thumbs.

131
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,212
- We did that when we did the hands, Bert.
- No.

132
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,288
Okay.

133
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,717
Everybody wash your,
here it comes, big toe.

134
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,428
- That's a good one, Bert.
- I like that.

135
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,303
Now, everybody wash your everything.

136
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,638
Such a nice boy.

137
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,772
Thursday? That's my day off.
And Sunday, I never work Sunday.

138
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,019
Can you start on Friday?

139
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,152
I'll think about it.

140
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,819
When can you let me know?
I can't leave my mother without a nurse.

141
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,946
I said I'll think about it.

142
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,653
Good day.

143
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,622
Miss Morgiani.

144
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,162
What is it?

145
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,632
- Is there anyone else out there?
- Yes. I was about to send her in.

146
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,459
Would you step in, please?

147
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,389
Please sit down.

148
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,768
My name is Mr. Hocheiser.

149
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,855
Not a chance. I'm not going back there.

150
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,939
Back where?

151
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,063
- To that crazy mother of yours.
- She's no trouble now.

152
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,520
- Is she dead?
- No.

153
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,024
Then forget it.

154
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,889
Do you require references?

155
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,723
For what?

156
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,566
For the job. The ad didn't say.

157
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,658
I can get references,
but I don't think they'll be very good.

158
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,156
You don't need references.

159
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,782
I don't?

160
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,160
They usually require references.

161
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,244
I don't require references.

162
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,331
I don't require anything.

163
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,386
- When can you start?
- Right away. The sooner the better.

164
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,338
It's an easy job. You'll love it.

165
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,764
I hope so.

166
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,347
I don't have much experience.

167
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,019
It doesn't matter.

168
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:57,100
In fact, I'm afraid I'm not very good.
Most of my patients have died.

169
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,106
That's okay. I don't mind.

170
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,195
You don't?

171
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,940
You mean you want me?

172
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,695
Yes!

173
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,656
What's the matter?

174
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,122
Please forgive me.

175
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,295
This is the first nice thing
that's happened to me

176
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,001
since my marriage.

177
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,759
You're married?

178
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,391
Divorced.

179
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,640
How long were you married?

180
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,567
Thirty-two hours.

181
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,146
- What?
- Thirty-two hours.

182
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,116
That's not very long.

183
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,244
It was an eternity!

184
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,861
His name was Leonard Callan,

185
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,035
and I thought he was
the most wonderful man in the world.

186
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,083
He was a stockbroker.

187
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,456
He was sensitive,

188
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,544
sweet, and very kind.

189
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,974
When we talked about sex,
he was as shy as I was.

190
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,801
We were both virgins.

191
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,811
You were?

192
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,766
And when he asked me to marry him,
I accepted.

193
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,351
We flew to London for our honeymoon.

194
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,063
Leonard was so sweet.

195
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,366
We drank champagne

196
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,827
and we talked,

197
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,122
and he didn't try to rush me at all.

198
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,331
And then when we were all relaxed,

199
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,833
we got undressed

200
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,260
and he carried me to bed.

201
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,100
- I shouldn't be telling this to you.
- Of course you should.

202
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,059
We made love.

203
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,065
I'd never experienced
anything like it before.

204
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,571
It was wonderful.

205
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,614
I was so happy.

206
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,984
And then,

207
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,246
I rolled over

208
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,995
to kiss my wonderful Leonard,

209
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,829
and that's when I saw it.

210
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,498
What? What did you see?

211
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,678
He made a caca on the bed.

212
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,847
- What?
- I couldn't believe it either.

213
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,442
I said to him,
"How could you do such a thing?"

214
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,066
And do you know what he said?

215
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,237
He said,

216
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,440
"Doesn't everybody?"

217
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,987
That son of a bitch!

218
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
He took a dump in the bed!

219
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,847
I knew I shouldn't have told you this.

220
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,231
Of course you should.

221
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,234
That's how people get to know each other.

222
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,657
I've never told it to anyone before.

223
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,152
I can understand that.

224
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,456
I felt that you'd understand.

225
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,580
I'm glad that you felt that I would.

226
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,464
You're due in court!

227
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,169
Tanner case. You better read those briefs.

228
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,838
I'm due in court.

229
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,559
Can you come to my house
for dinner tonight?

230
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,680
I don't know where you live.

231
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,984
I don't even know your name.

232
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,901
Louise.

233
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,777
Every little breeze
seems to whisper "Louise"

234
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,490
The birds in the trees
seem to twitter "Louise"

235
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,496
Each little rose

236
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,373
Tells me it knows

237
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,663
I love you

238
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,423
I love you

239
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,714
Every little beat that I feel in my heart

240
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,596
Seems to repeat

241
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,769
What I felt at the start

242
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,312
Each little sigh

243
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,191
Tells me that I adore you

244
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,243
Louise

245
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,409
Just to see and hear you

246
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,875
Brings joy I never knew

247
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,424
But to be so near you

248
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,296
Thrills me through and through

249
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,932
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss

250
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,980
It had to be

251
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,433
But the wonder is this

252
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,274
Can it be true

253
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,488
Someone like you

254
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,363
Could love me

255
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,368
Louise

256
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,671
You're late!

257
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,175
I love you.

258
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,429
I'm late.

259
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,756
All rise!

260
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,761
Hear ye, hear ye.
This court is now in session.

261
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,768
The Honorable William Bills presiding.

262
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,849
The court is now in order.

263
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,026
- Is the prosecution ready?
- Yes, Your Honor.

264
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,527
Is the defense ready?

265
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,193
Yes, Your Honor.

266
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,822
You may commence.

267
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,200
I waive my opening statement.

268
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,716
I waive my opening statement, Your Honor.

269
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:28,017
- Call your witness.
- I call Colonel Warren J. Hendriks.

270
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,015
Col. Warren J. Hendriks,
please take the stand.

271
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,737
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but, so help you God?

272
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,985
- I do.
- Be seated.

273
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,153
Now, Colonel,

274
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,658
suppose you tell the court
what happened on the day in question.

275
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,369
I was lying out on the beach.

276
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,327
A beautiful day out,
I thought I'd get myself a suntan.

277
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,171
How the hell can you
get a suntan in a full-dress uniform?

278
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,418
Order!

279
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,215
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

280
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,260
And that boy over there
walked up to me and he said,

281
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,632
"Where's the parade, Admiral?"

282
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,846
Were those his exact words?

283
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,225
Yes, sir. He called me Admiral.
And I said, "Move on, you little punk."

284
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,847
Your exact words were,

285
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,022
"Move on, you cocksucking draft-dodger."

286
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,601
Order! Young man,
I'll have none of that in my court!

287
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,437
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
We apologize. It won't happen again.

288
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,114
You may proceed.

289
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,781
Now, after you told the defendant
to move on, what happened?

290
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,206
He called me a creep, sir.
Said I was a no-good, army creep.

291
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,535
I tried to appeal to his patriotic spirit.

292
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,709
He said I was full of shit.

293
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,297
- Objection.
- Overruled.

294
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,092
- You said that?
- Yeah. That's what he is.

295
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,671
Now, Colonel, how did you feel
when the defendant suggested

296
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,506
that you were full of shit?

297
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,805
I took it as an insult,

298
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,770
both personally and to
the uniform I wear so proudly.

299
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,892
Is that all?

300
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,851
No, he said that all us
career soldiers was the same.

301
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,404
He implied that we wore
all those ribbons and things

302
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:08,450
just so we could tell some dumb chick
about all the gooks and krauts we killed.

303
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,822
Make them think we're big heroes.

304
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,913
Seems to think we get some thrill

305
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,242
going around telling people
how many gooks and krauts we killed.

306
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,670
Let me tell you, it's not
like that at all. No, sir.

307
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,340
I killed 40, maybe 50 gooks,

308
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,300
some of them with my bare hands.

309
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,255
- Be that as it may...
- You can't trust them.

310
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,760
They like to surrender,

311
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,183
then sneak up on you
when you aren't looking.

312
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,387
I got my first 15
of the little bastards that way.

313
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,892
Colonel, if we could return to...

314
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,983
They'd drop down from the trees,
like they was gonna surrender.

315
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,445
Waving them little white flags.
But they didn't fool me. No, sir.

316
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,113
I let them walk out there,

317
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,907
then when they was all lined up,
nice and neat,

318
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,447
I blew their fucking heads off.

319
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,702
They were surprised.
You should have seen them.

320
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,376
- Guts, brains, lying all over the place.
- Now, Colonel.

321
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,749
One of them came apart,
right in the middle.

322
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,754
Top half of him just fell off,
his two legs just standing there.

323
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,511
Boy, that was really something.

324
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,931
I think if I'd yelled, "Forward march"

325
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,225
them two scrawny little legs would have

326
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,553
just walked off by themselves.

327
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,018
That's fine, Colonel.

328
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,649
Your Honor,
I'd like to request 10 minutes.

329
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,195
I got one of their brains as a souvenir.

330
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,238
Brought it home to my little boy.

331
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,318
He keeps it in a little jar
on a shelf in his room.

332
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,449
But I...

333
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,332
I didn't like killing them.

334
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,909
Not the way that boy thinks.

335
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,496
We all understand the hardships
you've been through, Colonel Hendriks.

336
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,088
Little shitbox. Never even fired a rifle.

337
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,886
Ask him who he ever killed
for his country.

338
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,682
Colonel, if we may,
just go on with your story.

339
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,562
After he cursed me,
him and his friend jumped me,

340
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:05,643
and then that boy over there
took off my right shoe and sock

341
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,194
and he cut my big toe off.

342
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,073
- You never told me that.
- I told your secretary.

343
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,445
Why did you cut his toe off?

344
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,202
I cut his toe off
so he wouldn't be fit for duty.

345
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,704
So he wouldn't
be able to go back and kill anymore.

346
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,952
I don't need a big toe to kill gooks.

347
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,534
We should have cut your goddamn head off!

348
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,040
- Silence!
- I killed for my country!

349
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,129
You're a goddamn hypocrite.

350
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,049
I will hold him in contempt of court.

351
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,427
You and assholes like you
would dance into the Second World War

352
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,096
with big smiles on your faces.

353
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,846
That's right. Even jerks like you
realize you're full of it!

354
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,225
- 30 days for contempt of court!
- You told everybody that war was shit.

355
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,898
We shouldn't kill anymore.
"Peace, bro!" Yeah, we believed you.

356
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,816
We thought you meant it,
but what you meant

357
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,278
was that anymore war
might finish it, right?

358
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,697
Except after a while,
the rest would be okay!

359
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,991
We're not buying that crap anymore!

360
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,898
This is the best job I ever had.

361
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,694
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

362
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,622
Gordon.

363
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,224
Gordon, we have our shoes on.

364
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,436
God, Gordon!

365
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:02,112
- Gordon, what's that banging?
- It's the pipes.

366
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,704
It sounds like somebody
banging at the door.

367
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,873
- It's just pipes.
- Gordon?

368
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,952
- Gordon, somebody's calling your name.
- Gordon!

369
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,005
- It's probably my mother.
- Your mother?

370
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,050
- She must have woke up.
- But why is she banging?

371
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,676
- Sometimes the door sticks.
- I should meet her.

372
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,971
Louise, the banging has stopped.

373
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,394
Gordon, I really should meet her!

374
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,806
Okay, you're right.

375
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,494
Gordon, where is she?

376
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,836
I think I should warn you.

377
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,719
My mother is old.

378
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,310
- I love old people.
- Very old.

379
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,183
The older the better.

380
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,723
By "old,"

381
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,017
I mean,

382
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,734
old.

383
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,236
Gordon, if she's your mother,
I'll love her.

384
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,621
I'll get her.

385
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,365
Where are you going?

386
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,092
Gordon?

387
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,011
Sometimes the door really jams.

388
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,973
Why don't you put on your shoe?

389
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,349
Right.

390
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,432
They move into the ring now.

391
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,185
The challenger is sparring
with a left to the body,

392
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,857
a right to the head
and another right to the head.

393
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,694
- Poppa home yet?
- Not yet.

394
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,192
I hope he doesn't forget
to go to the cleaners.

395
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,739
He forgets to pick up his shirts.

396
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,031
Mom.

397
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,287
Mom, there's somebody I want you to meet.

398
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,205
Is it my sister?

399
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,032
Your sister's gone.

400
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,165
I just spoke to her this morning.
She told me she was coming over.

401
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,210
There's a girl here
that I want you to meet.

402
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:06,219
She's very nice. I like her very much.
She's going to help me take care of you.

403
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,798
- Poppa'll take care of me.
- She's not just another nurse, Mom.

404
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,642
It means a lot to me, Mom.

405
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,561
And I want you to know that
if you mess this one up for me,

406
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,981
I'm gonna punch your fucking heart out.

407
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,273
Got it?

408
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,901
Such a nice boy.

409
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,418
- This is my mother.
- Hello. It's so nice to meet you.

410
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,171
- That's not my sister.
- Say hello to Louise.

411
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,595
You told me it was my sister.
What did you do to my sister?

412
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,973
- She's a little absent-minded.
- Where's my dinner?

413
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,221
- I'm hungry.
- Mother, you already ate.

414
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,771
- I want my dinner.
- Let her join us.

415
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,564
Gordon, it'll be fun.

416
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,860
We're going to have
a nice dinner together.

417
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,360
- Who is she?
- I told you. She's here to help us.

418
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:11,285
- I'm warning you, Ma.
- Gordon, you get things started.

419
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,081
We're going to just have a lovely evening.

420
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:17,866
Who is she?

421
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,580
- I'll tell you all about myself at dinner.
- Mother's very tired.

422
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,541
Gordon! A place setting for your mother

423
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,717
while she and I have a little talk.

424
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,762
- You don't understand.
- Gordon, don't worry about anything.

425
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,589
Just leave it to me.

426
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,300
I love your mother.

427
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,892
Well!

428
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,903
Isn't this nice?

429
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,744
You have a lovely apartment here.

430
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,044
I'm so glad we met.

431
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,420
Who are you?

432
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:16,099
Louise. Louise Callan.

433
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,974
Gordon has been telling me
so much about you.

434
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,274
Gordon?

435
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,107
I know a Gordon.

436
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,946
You must be very proud of your son.

437
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,448
Sidney's a wonderful boy.

438
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,331
I thought his name was Gordon.

439
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,791
That one.

440
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,875
Yes, Gordon. He's a wonderful boy, too.

441
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,002
I'm sure he is.

442
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,007
Got a pecker this big.

443
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,636
I beg your pardon?

444
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,056
- This big. Just like his Poppa.
- Okay. Here it is!

445
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,514
Can't wait till Poppa gets home.

446
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,978
- Sorry it took so long.
- Everything looks so good.

447
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,934
She's not a big eater.

448
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,756
We're going to be
great friends, aren't we?

449
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,053
Yeah.

450
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,238
What's wrong?

451
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,580
Maybe she's tired.

452
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,137
Gordon.

453
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,348
Aren't you going to lift her head
out of the plate?

454
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,137
I guess so.

455
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,198
- Poppa'll get you for this!
- What's the matter with her?

456
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,867
- She's having a nightmare.
- The poor...

457
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:24,871
- Stay away from me! Where's Poppa?
- I warned you, Ma. I warned you!

458
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,870
- You tramp! Where is he?
- Don't call her a tramp.

459
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,670
She's trying to get Poppa away from me!
Get out of here!

460
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,671
- She doesn't like me!
- She does.

461
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,547
She called me a tramp!

462
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,796
Poppa?

463
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm hungry!

464
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,474
Louise?

465
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,172
Sid, you have 10 minutes.

466
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,501
If you're not here by then,
I'm throwing her out the window.

467
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,178
Son of a bitch!

468
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,757
If you go to your brother's house tonight,
you take your bed with you.

469
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,720
- Sidney!
- Gladys, he sounded crazy.

470
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,306
He is crazy. And she's crazy.

471
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,108
- Mom, Sheldon's hitting!
- No hitting!

472
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,311
Let him throw her out the window already.

473
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,819
- Ma! Danny's biting.
- No biting!

474
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,399
- You know, Sidney...
- Gladys, move.

475
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,659
- You know you're crazy, too.
- Move.

476
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,907
I think you like getting mugged
every night.

477
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,489
Will you move?

478
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,457
No. Not tonight, Sidney.

479
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,127
- I said move.
- No.

480
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,379
Ma! They're kicking me!

481
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,253
Get away from that door,
or I'm gonna choke your child.

482
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,795
Ma, get away from the door!

483
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,523
Don't go through the park!

484
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,908
Evening, Sidney.

485
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,109
Jesus.

486
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,327
Not tonight, fellows.
Really, I'm really in a very big hurry.

487
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,660
I believe we all know the procedures.

488
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,836
I don't have any money on me, I swear it.
I swear, guys. I don't have...

489
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,384
- it's the same old shit.
- Let me at the motherfucker!

490
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,338
- Let me take his motherfucking head off!
- Easy, now! Cool it, baby.

491
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,513
Now, look, man.

492
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,309
Every night, you bop through the park here,
and every night we run you down.

493
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,438
- Now, we're friends, ain't we?
- I certainly hope so.

494
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,606
How come you ain't got no bread with you?

495
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,026
- You always steal it from me.
- Now, look, man.

496
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,612
- We all gotta make a buck, right?
- That's quite true.

497
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,863
If you expect to bop through this park
every night, you've gotta have some bread.

498
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,995
Otherwise, me and my boys
might be forced to do you some harm.

499
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,163
Let me rip him!

500
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,286
I swear, next time
I'll bring plenty of money.

501
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,366
- You sure, man?
- Yes.

502
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,627
If this happens again,
I'm gonna let Muthafucka on your ass.

503
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,500
And Muthafucka likes to tear ass.

504
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,797
- Let me tear that motherfucker's ass!
- Cool it!

505
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,386
- We gonna play the game.
- Game time!

506
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,973
What do you mean?

507
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,893
- Remember Cornel Wilde?
- Who?

508
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,400
- Cornel Wilde, the movie actor.
- No.

509
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,611
You ever see that movie The Naked Prey?

510
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,733
- I don't think so.
- It's like you Cornel.

511
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,411
And you better start praying,
'cause you gonna be naked!

512
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:23,828
What do you mean?

513
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,673
Man, since you didn't bring no bread,
we gonna take your clothes and sell them.

514
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,173
- Come on. That's not funny.
- Start running.

515
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,222
No, I'm not gonna.

516
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,597
Man, you pandering valuable running time.

517
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,724
You want Muthafucka on your ass?

518
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,256
God!

519
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,667
Third, please.

520
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,168
Lady?

521
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,133
Would you do me a favor.
Ring the third floor, please?

522
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,590
Thirdo?

523
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,099
Sorry, lady.

524
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,089
Where the hell were you?

525
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,893
You know I almost got killed getting here?

526
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,223
A minute later, you'd be killed
by an old lady falling out a window.

527
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,307
What happened this time?

528
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,859
- She messed up my dinner.
- That's all?

529
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,652
Sid, I had a girl up here.

530
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,322
A beautiful girl,
who I'll probably never see again.

531
00:46:56,397 --> 00:47:01,119
A girl I've been looking for all my life.
We made plans, Sid, and she fucked it up!

532
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,332
She's ruining me, Sid.
She takes up all my time.

533
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:09,081
My practice is going to hell.
My life is going to hell.

534
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,083
I've had it, Sid.
Something has gotta be done!

535
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,215
What do you want me to do, Gordon?

536
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,380
I don't want you to do anything, Sid.

537
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,678
I've made up my mind.

538
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,426
I'm gonna put her in a...

539
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,227
Don't ever say that word, Gordie.

540
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,271
You don't put your mother in a home.

541
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,738
- She's got a home. This is her home.
- You call this a home?

542
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,532
Remember when Poppa was dying, Gordon?

543
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,701
Please, don't do this.

544
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,745
Remember what we promised him
on his deathbed?

545
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,288
Sid!

546
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:52,211
- I'm asking you, Sid, don't do this.
- "My children.

547
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,463
"Sidney?

548
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,798
"Gordon?

549
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,922
"Your father is dying.

550
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,760
"Sidney?

551
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,632
"When you and Gladys get married,

552
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,595
"promise me you'll name
the first boy after me.

553
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,274
"Thank you, Sidney. And, Gordon,

554
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,570
"promise me you'll finish law school

555
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,906
"and promise me you'll always
take care of your mother,

556
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,700
"and you'll never put Momma

557
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,703
"in a home."

558
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,917
You're right, Sid.

559
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,457
I'm not gonna put her in a home.

560
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,127
I'm gonna kill her.

561
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,090
What?

562
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,633
I'm gonna kill her.

563
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,186
You're right, Gordon.

564
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,848
- What?
- Kill her, Gordon.

565
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,441
- Kill her?
- What other choice is there?

566
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,572
It's my fault. I haven't been fair to you.

567
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,275
I haven't being doing my job as a brother.

568
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,612
All I cared about was my wife and children.
I never thought about you, Gordie.

569
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:14,001
I'm gonna make you a promise now,
and may God strike me blind

570
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,078
if I don't keep this promise.

571
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,211
I promise that from now on,
I'm gonna think about you.

572
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,088
When you need me, I'll be here.

573
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,717
What happened tonight will never,
and I mean never, happen again.

574
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,423
If you have something going here, call me.
I'll take care of Mom.

575
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,635
I'll take her out of the apartment
until you're finished.

576
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,222
You're right to want to kill someone.
But kill me, not Momma.

577
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,559
I deserve it. I screwed up your life.
Give me a chance.

578
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,109
Let me make it up to you.

579
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,735
Thank you, Gordie.

580
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,734
You've made me very happy.

581
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,710
You got something I can wear?

582
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,090
Taxi!

583
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,187
Why did you run away?

584
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,982
Your mother was
so frightened and so upset.

585
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:04,654
- I just got afraid that she might die.
- You must never worry about that.

586
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,322
- Chinese food?
- Yes. To make up for ruining dinner.

587
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:34,092
- I'll clear the table.
- No. Let me.

588
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,470
I'll get the bowls.

589
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,996
Gordon?

590
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,125
Do you know what would make me very happy?

591
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,169
What?

592
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,014
I'd like to ask your mother to join us.

593
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,183
- You're not serious?
- Yes.

594
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,761
But, Louise, you saw what just happened!

595
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,565
I know, but if she gets to know me,
maybe she won't be so frightened of me.

596
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,985
- Louise.
- And I want her to like me.

597
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,937
No, no. She likes you fine.

598
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,197
- Gordon.
- Yes?

599
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,740
Trust me.

600
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,157
I'll get the food ready.
You get your mother.

601
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,474
I'll get the food

602
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,650
and you get my mother.

603
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,482
Okay.

604
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,341
Mrs. Hocheiser?

605
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,775
Sid? Gladys, where's Sid?

606
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,484
Yes, but he left here 10 minutes ago.
Where the hell is he?

607
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:56,025
Listen, Gladys!

608
00:53:56,525 --> 00:54:00,780
As soon as he comes through the door,
tell him to get back over here.

609
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:04,041
Tell him this is it.

610
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,951
I need him.

611
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,799
Mrs. Hocheiser?

612
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,730
Gordon, if Poppa comes home
and catches you dressed like that,

613
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,354
he's going to be very disappointed.

614
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,279
No, Mrs. Hocheiser.

615
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,700
I'm not your son.

616
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,366
My name is Louise.

617
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,875
We met earlier. Do you remember?

618
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,420
Stop making an ass of yourself, Gordon.
Get out of that dress.

619
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,373
Sit down. Watch this.

620
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,712
Sit down!

621
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,856
- Hi, Dad. Did you get mugged again?
- Shut up!

622
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,228
The schmuck just called.

623
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,193
He said to tell you he wants you
right back there again.

624
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,819
- Sidney, you are not going back there!
- Gladys, I have to.

625
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,653
- Out of my way, will you? I have to change.
- No, Sidney!

626
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,739
I promised. I made a solemn oath.
Will you move, please?

627
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,665
If you walk out of this house...

628
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,459
Gladys, please.
I don't have time to beat up the kids.

629
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,789
I am warning you. If you go over there...

630
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,839
Gladys, if I don't go over there,

631
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,881
he'll send her here.

632
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,682
Don't change.

633
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,599
Take a cab. Here's money.

634
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,305
Hurry!

635
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,688
I hope you like Chinese food.

636
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,520
- Don't sit there.
- Why?

637
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,197
Gordon, you know that's Poppa's place.

638
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,541
You're not Gordon.
Why'd you tell me you were Gordon?

639
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,789
I didn't. I never did.

640
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:16,673
This is my son.
You can't fool me. This is him.

641
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,877
I'd know that tush anywhere!

642
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:24,765
Is that a tush!
There's never been a tush like it.

643
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,013
- Ma, will you cut it out?
- What a tush.

644
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,847
Please don't do this. Ma! Don't do this!

645
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:36,151
- I think I'd better go.
- Please don't leave.

646
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,150
She just wants to... Please don't...

647
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,281
She's just trying to embarrass you.
Please.

648
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,530
- Cover your tush!
- Louise, don't leave!

649
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,658
Wait, Louise, wait!

650
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,135
Louise! Wait!

651
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,126
Motherfucker, where you going?

652
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,877
Not again, fellows. Please!

653
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:02,381
- Can I leave now?
- Leave? You can't leave now, Sid.

654
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:03,708
Why not?

655
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,886
- It's our big club dance.
- You're having a dance tonight?

656
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,464
- You're the guest of honor.
- Really?

657
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,893
- You must stay, Sid.
- Sweetie, I can't. I really can't.

658
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,770
You motherfucker, you gonna stay.

659
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,813
I'd love to, Muthafucka,
but I really have to get going.

660
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,649
- We don't want nobody moving around.
- What are you doing?

661
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,814
My brother's waiting.

662
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,320
That's gonna be motherfucking fine.

663
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,330
Wait a minute. What are you gonna do?

664
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,828
- Rape.
- Rape?

665
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,961
We always rape somebody
the night of the big dance.

666
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,588
It's tradition. It's part of our heritage.

667
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,755
Everybody knows that!

668
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,177
Fellows, don't do that. Come on.

669
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,269
Who's going first?

670
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,650
The guest of honor.

671
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,853
- It's you, Sidney.
- Me?

672
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,031
- Yeah, baby.
- No fooling around!

673
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,858
Don't do that!

674
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:15,659
- This your first rape?
- This will be my first. Don't fool around.

675
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,790
She's got red tights.

676
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,209
Red tights!

677
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,911
Hot stuff!

678
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:30,002
- Get going.
- Jump on her, man.

679
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,426
I got it!

680
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,810
- Jump on her!
- I got it!

681
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,762
Now I got it, yeah.

682
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,315
Boy, is that good!

683
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,407
- Hello.
- Gordie.

684
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,985
Listen, you promised
you'd come when I needed you,

685
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,412
you didn't show,
so we have nothing to discuss.

686
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,956
Gordie, don't hang up.

687
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,624
I need your help. I'm in jail.
You gotta get me out.

688
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:49,085
I'm very tired, Sid. I haven't slept.

689
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,627
Momma bit me in the ass,
and I fell down a flight of stairs.

690
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,720
Later, Gordon. I'm in big trouble
and you gotta help me.

691
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:59,140
I was on my way over to your place.
I got arrested.

692
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,596
What for?

693
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,187
- Rape.
- What?

694
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,144
Rape!

695
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,439
Rape? Who the hell did you rape?

696
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,905
Look, it's a long story.

697
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,358
Will you just come down

698
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,824
and get me out, please?

699
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,913
Why would you rape anybody?

700
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,036
I'll tell you when you get here, please.

701
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,038
I'm at the 68th Street station house.

702
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,664
Hurry, do me a favor.

703
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,458
Thanks a lot.

704
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:46,104
You could have warned her.
That's the first thing they're gonna ask.

705
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,897
I tried to, but they stopped me!

706
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,350
- Who?
- The guys in the park!

707
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,610
Before I could do it,
they tore her clothes off.

708
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:55,064
- Why didn't you run?
- I couldn't. They were holding me.

709
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,490
They pushed me on top of her
and made me do it.

710
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,444
Then they took off and left me there.
I was arrested.

711
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,029
Who arrested you?

712
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,406
That's the bad part.

713
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,538
The woman I was raping was a cop.

714
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,296
You raped a cop?

715
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,918
It's one of those guys that walks around
in drag looking for purse snatchers.

716
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:19,221
- Couldn't you tell?
- Not right away! It was dark!

717
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,264
And I was terribly excited.

718
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,983
- I think you're in a lot of trouble, Sid.
- You think so?

719
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:38,449
- Where is the arresting officer?
- I don't know. He was all shook up.

720
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,238
He'd never been raped before.

721
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,996
You the guy that raped
the cop in the park?

722
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,333
He is. That's my brother.

723
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,918
Here.

724
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,467
These are for you.

725
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:16,695
What is it?

726
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,943
I don't think I need your help anymore.

727
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,907
These are from the cop I raped.

728
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,700
"Thank you for a wonderful evening."

729
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,912
He's not gonna press charges.

730
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,912
He wants me to leave my name
and my phone number with the guard.

731
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,633
Gordie.

732
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,682
Do you think I should leave
my phone number?

733
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,626
That's it, Sid.

734
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,800
I can't depend on you anymore.

735
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,758
Long-stemmed roses.

736
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,262
I'll spend the rest of my life
with a potato.

737
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,431
I never got flowers from anyone.

738
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,732
Such a nice man.

739
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,065
Pull over, driver.

740
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,566
A real human being.

741
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,106
Get out, Sid.

742
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,617
- What?
- I said, "Get out."

743
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,950
Would you like a rose?

744
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,751
You son of a bitch! Why'd you do it?

745
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,711
I hope Momma never dies, you putz!

746
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,893
Where to?

747
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,100
Take me to the courthouse.

748
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:25,069
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
look at that old woman.

749
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,743
How would you like to come home
every night

750
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,446
and find a potato
sitting in your living room?

751
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,704
A vegetable sharing
your apartment with you?

752
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,085
Your Honor,

753
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,917
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

754
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,508
I respectfully request that this old woman

755
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,803
be sentenced to spend
the rest of her natural life

756
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,925
locked in a toilet.

757
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:04,317
- Coach Williams, you were hired by the...
- Memphis Maulers football team.

758
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,147
Memphis Maulers
professional football team.

759
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,531
- That's right. As the head coach.
- Head coach.

760
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,712
Did you have a contract to coach?

761
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,468
That's right.

762
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,720
For $40,000 a year!

763
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,427
For three years!

764
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,637
That's correct.

765
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,690
- You haven't been paid!
- That's right.

766
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,912
Why weren't you paid, Coach Williams?

767
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,705
They fired me!

768
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,955
Why did they do that?

769
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,078
For no reasons!

770
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,085
I told you that. That's why I hired you!

771
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,721
Mr. Hocheiser.

772
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,955
Your Honor, Coach Williams...

773
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:02,063
Coach Williams.

774
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:04,978
Yeah.

775
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:08,278
What kind of a football team

776
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:11,447
did you bring to Memphis?

777
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,034
A special hand-picked one.

778
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,453
- Hand-picked?
- That's right.

779
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,951
They were about nine or 10 years old.

780
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,908
- Nine or 10 years old?
- That's right.

781
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,835
Where did you find these children?

782
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:28,211
I looked around till I found the biggest
and fastest boys in the country.

783
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,675
Their parents gave you permission
to take them?

784
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,843
No, I took them.

785
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:34,171
- You just took them?
- Yeah, I took them.

786
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,724
What did their parents say
when they found out?

787
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:41,929
They were happy to get the bonus money.
Besides, they weren't too bright anyhow.

788
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,852
Order!

789
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,104
Coach Williams.

790
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,963
- Mr. Hocheiser.
- Your Honor.

791
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,261
Coach Williams.

792
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,394
- My God!
- Is that all, Mr. Hocheiser?

793
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:35,152
Mr. Hocheiser, if the court
may have your attention.

794
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,869
Your honor, counsel requests
a 10-minute recess.

795
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,663
- Request denied.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

796
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:46,205
Hocheiser, for Christ's sake!
I ain't finished yet!

797
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,706
You may proceed, Mr. Devloe.

798
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:52,169
Coach Williams, you saw nothing wrong
with taking these children?

799
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,922
I wanted to teach those boys
the game of football.

800
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,303
They ate, slept and talked
nothing but football.

801
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,097
Could they, or could they not,
speak English?

802
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,643
They didn't have to speak no damn English!
They just had to play football!

803
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,978
Besides, the quarterback could speak.

804
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,977
- English?
- He could say numbers.

805
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,696
I bought a plane ticket
and I'm going home.

806
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,293
Where's home?

807
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:31,997
Waukegan, Illinois.

808
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,210
Doesn't Jack Benny come from there?

809
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,051
Yes.

810
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,469
Did you know him?

811
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,225
No.

812
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,822
They named a high school
after him out there, didn't they?

813
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,984
It was a junior high school.

814
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,196
Junior high.
I thought it was a high school.

815
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:06,785
No.

816
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,927
Goodbye, Gordon.

817
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,436
I really think we could have had
something wonderful together,

818
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,524
but I can't compete with your mother

819
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,943
and she's never going to let go.

820
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,235
Louise, let's get married!

821
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,701
What about your mother?

822
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:56,085
I'm gonna put my mother in a...

823
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,438
I'm gonna put my mother

824
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,229
in a home.

825
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:21,156
- I'm gonna put her in a home, Louise.
- Yes, Gordon, yes!

826
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,875
The male members insist
that there's something about being nude

827
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,177
that makes you want to play volleyball.

828
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:48,599
What is the ultimate effect
of pornography on young men?

829
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,143
Boredom, says a team
of psychological researchers

830
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,271
at the University of North Carolina.

831
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:57,351
They hired a group of volunteer men,
ages 21 to 23,

832
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,902
for 90 minutes a day for three weeks.

833
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:03,281
The subjects were ﬁrst screened
for psychiatric disorders,

834
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,325
and then exposed
to a variety of pornographic materials

835
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,994
during the daily hour and a half.

836
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,913
Their ﬁrst exposure
was to a hard-core stag movie

837
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,541
which a control group also watched.

838
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:16,294
Subjective reports
have spoken for themselves.

839
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:19,088
Physiological measurements
of the specimen,

840
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,542
testiﬁed to the arousal of the subject.

841
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:27,013
After that exposure to pornography,
the controls were given no more.

842
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:31,309
The subjects were surrounded by it daily
during the time devoted to the experiment.

843
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,353
At ﬁrst, they exhibited
high interest and arousal,

844
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:36,480
then both fell rapidly.

845
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,525
Psychological and physical tests
measured...

846
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:40,693
Why did you do that?

847
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,029
Come on, put on your coat.
We're going for a ride.

848
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,277
I don't wanna go for a ride.
Where's Poppa?

849
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,700
That's where we're going.
We're gonna see Poppa.

850
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,322
We're gonna see Poppa?

851
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,413
Such a good boy!

852
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,608
Homes.

853
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,659
"Homes for the aged."

854
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,415
For Christ's sake, will you come on?
Come on, hurry up!

855
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,163
I've gotta look nice for Poppa.

856
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,791
You look good. You look terrific.

857
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,066
Get in the car.

858
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,222
Just stay there.

859
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,237
Excuse me. Where's the office?

860
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,028
The manager?

861
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,781
- Where's the office?
- I don't know.

862
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,628
Who's there?

863
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,164
What do you want?

864
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,711
- Look, I got your ad here.
- Yeah? You're not from the State, are you?

865
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,511
Not from the Health Department, are you?

866
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,807
- No, no. Look. I've got my...
- And the goddamn health people.

867
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:42,226
I told those bastards
to stay away from here.

868
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:43,553
I run a clean place.

869
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:46,480
It ain't easy taking care
of all these old people, you know?

870
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,478
You mean you're here by yourself?

871
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,111
Yes, that's what I mean.
It's tough getting help.

872
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:56,191
- Nobody wants to take care of old people.
- I know what you mean.

873
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:03,414
- How many people do you have here?
- Seventy three. I don't know, no, maybe 72.

874
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,366
I didn't check all the rooms yet.

875
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:09,582
Sometimes they go in the night, and I
don't find out about it till the morning.

876
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:14,213
Look at this. Hot lunches. Every day.
Everything's gotta be done by the book.

877
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,762
- Pass it around.
- Do you do the cooking, too?

878
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,590
Since Grace died,
I do everything around here.

879
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,644
- Are you Gus?
- There ain't no Gus.

880
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:28,264
I wish there was a Gus.
He'd help me out, that bastard.

881
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,563
- What do you got? A mother or father?
- A mother.

882
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,612
- I ain't got no room.
- She's no trouble. She'll sleep anywhere.

883
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,781
- I told you, I ain't got no room!
- There's no bread!

884
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,609
She's out in the car.
I drove her all the way out here.

885
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,195
What do you want me to do about it?

886
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,372
- Can't you check the rooms now?
- Can't you see I'm serving lunch?

887
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,701
- Lunch, for Christ's sake!
- Gordon, this is a terrible place!

888
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,465
Up there!

889
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,293
You tell them I ain't gonna
serve lunch all day.

890
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,217
Lunch! How many times I gotta tell you?

891
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,716
I tell you, lunch! Hey, you.

892
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,177
You want lunch? You shake your ass!

893
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,237
Do you have any rooms?

894
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,997
Yes, we have rooms.

895
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,451
I wanna put my Momma here.

896
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,878
But there are forms to fill out.
You just can't put her.

897
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,381
Would you go get the forms, please?

898
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,208
All right. Get the forms.

899
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,180
Where are we? Where's Poppa?

900
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,057
We'll meet Poppa. That's what we're doing.

901
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,767
Where is he? Poppa!

902
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,602
Stand right here, or you won't see Poppa.

903
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:31,894
- You got the forms?
- Yes, here they are.

904
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,106
Give them to me.

905
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:37,276
Gordon Hocheiser.

906
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:40,776
- You want to get her?
- Yes, we'll go get her.

907
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,820
- All right.
- Gordon, you said we're gonna meet Poppa.

908
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,621
What? Yeah.

909
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,162
No. Never mind. I'll get her.

910
01:21:57,496 --> 01:22:01,633
- Now, you're going to love it here.
- I'll tell you when I love it!

911
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:05,212
I'll love it when I'm meeting Poppa.
Now, just go. Go away.

912
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:08,048
- Go!
- Here's Poppa.

913
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,140
Poppa?

914
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:14,267
Momma?
