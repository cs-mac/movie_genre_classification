1
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,637
You suck.
- Oh, my God.

2
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:07,007
Get those tards
off the stage right now.

3
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,509
- Let's bail.
- Don't we wanna see if we win?

4
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,483
Come on.

5
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,587
I can't wait to graduate
and get the hell out of this place.

6
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,659
I thought we had
some intricate harmonies.

7
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,693
Should've done
"Mama Said Knock You Out."

8
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:30,959
I'll tell you one thing, when we graduate
from college, we're gonna soar like eagles.

9
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,034
Yeah, we just haven't peaked yet.

10
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:36,639
We're the ones who are going to get
the cool jobs, the sexy husbands...

11
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,768
...the sky-high self-esteem.

12
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:41,502
Right. Today's geeks turn out
to be tomorrow's winners.

13
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:45,375
So screw college because, ladies,
real life starts now.

14
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:47,641
Yeah, and we are gonna have it all.

15
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,982
Look out, world, here we come.

16
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,756
- Oh!
- Ah!

17
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,454
Dang it.

18
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,997
Oh.

19
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,191
Your blouse.

20
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,359
- I have a moist towelette.
- No worries.

21
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,596
I'll just hit T.J. Maxx on the way to work.

22
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,801
The max for the minimum, smart.

23
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,775
- I have to go. I'm graduating students today.
- Oh, great.

24
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:17,476
Well, hang in there.

25
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,478
Like a cat on a branch.

26
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,974
- See you later.
- Bye.

27
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,379
Have a great day.

28
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:28,388
Graduation day
is always very emotional for me.

29
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:33,324
The bond that we share with
our canine friends is a special one.

30
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:36,297
Dogs don't care
how much money you make...

31
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,835
...what kind of car you drive,
or whose name's on the back of your jeans.

32
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:44,167
They don't care if you cry a lot
at commercials...

33
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,831
...or have a mustache
that you haven't waxed.

34
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,706
Dogs don't care if you shame-eat
when you're lonely.

35
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:54,114
And I never, ever feel judged by dogs.

36
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:57,720
Because dogs love your insides.

37
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,312
And that's why I love dogs.

38
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,392
Come on.

39
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,466
- Gayle, I really don't...
- Oh, over here.

40
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,901
Gayle, I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

41
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:18,836
Pepper's already changing my life.

42
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, she's a good dog.

43
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:25,174
Well, ever since I met Pepper and you,
I've felt much more confident.

44
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:29,143
Life is just that much easier.

45
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,253
Running errands, taking the train.

46
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,086
I even think that
I might be ready to start dating.

47
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:37,715
Something I never would've dreamed of
before I met you and Pepper.

48
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,261
- Really?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:49,598
You know, I wouldn't usually
ask this of a client, but what the hell.

50
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:53,833
I have two tickets to
the Amy Grant concert on Friday.

51
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,069
Would you like to go with me?

52
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:00,410
Well, you see, the thing is,
I only love Amy Grant.

53
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,709
Wow.

54
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,909
May I?

55
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,845
Oh.

56
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,760
I'm sorry. You know what?
I've got plans.

57
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,595
Come on, Pepper.

58
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,804
Senator Hartmann's office.

59
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,908
Senator Hartmann's office.

60
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,038
Ma'am?

61
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,317
One shot from this baby
can blow a man's spine out his back.

62
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:41,552
I thought that you could use
a whole bottle.

63
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,262
Something else?

64
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,734
Have you had a chance to read
my notes on fuel efficiency?

65
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,999
I really think my ideas
offer a bold bipartisan...

66
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,369
- Betty.
- Becky.

67
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:04,001
Honey, why would a sweet gal like you
wanna get involved...

68
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,206
...in stinky old policy debates?

69
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,754
Well, as much as I love my job
as office manager...

70
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,118
...what I really want
is to make a difference.

71
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,159
Did you know that
this country is addicted to oil?

72
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,495
Listen, Betty.

73
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:25,862
You're a really good office manager.

74
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:30,199
But if you wanna be a woman in politics,
you're gonna have to get some nuts.

75
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,136
Let me ask you a question.

76
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,538
Are you tough enough
to take a loaded shotgun...

77
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,714
...aim it at some cracker
and tell them to "eat me"?

78
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,085
Why don't you just leave the politics
to the gals with the loaded guns?

79
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:49,019
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

80
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,557
Thank you.

81
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,288
The wedding's in three months...

82
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,526
...and we just wanna iron out some kinks
before the big day.

83
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:03,263
Oh, but don't get me wrong,
William and I are fine. Best friends, really.

84
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:08,234
I think the most important thing
in a relationship is honesty.

85
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,609
Well, we have a motto, doc, don't we?

86
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,038
- No secrets.
- No secrets.

87
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,048
Honey, I'm home.

88
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,881
I brought dinner.

89
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,318
Honey?

90
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,727
Honey. It should've been me.

91
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,700
Honey.

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,203
Friend.

93
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,933
Soul mate.

94
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,746
Always loyal.

95
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,016
Often hilarious.

96
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:53,053
We dedicate this
"make your own pizza" party to you.

97
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:58,657
The first in 12 years you didn't attend.

98
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,296
This is really hard.

99
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,633
Rest in peace, girlfriend.

100
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:08,292
See you on the other side.

101
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,934
Now let's make some pizza.

102
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,905
Mini pepperonis?
- Mm-hm.

103
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,771
No cheese for me. I'm off dairy.

104
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,277
You don't have to go off anything.
You look great.

105
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:21,280
Yeah. I'm not attractive enough
for a blind man.

106
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,578
We need to discuss if we're still
going on our road trip next week.

107
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,914
Maybe it's too soon.

108
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,417
She would want life to go on.

109
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,791
You're right.

110
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,758
Honey loved hearing about our trips.

111
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,331
I remember sitting on that sofa
and telling her about every adventure.

112
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,193
Oh, the way she laughed.

113
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:41,836
Oh.

114
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:44,639
Energy becomes energy.

115
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,639
I think we should go on the trip.

116
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,071
Yay.

117
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,712
Because, you guys,
I have a real treat planned for us.

118
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,817
We are going to Tempe, Arizona
to the Wimmin's Music Festival.

119
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,787
Please tell me Tracy Chapman
is performing.

120
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,855
She and her "Fast Car" will be there.

121
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,012
Oh, my goddess.

122
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,325
Gayle, what's wrong?

123
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,055
- You love women-centered folk music.
- I do.

124
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:13,692
I know. I just... I wish we could go
somewhere more fun, you know.

125
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,030
So, like, we could be more fun.

126
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:17,399
We're fun.

127
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:20,371
Tell me that our yearly Americana road trip
isn't fun.

128
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:23,273
- Yeah, or at-home karaoke Fridays.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:24,936
Or the Movie Numbers Game.

130
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:26,979
Hon, you love the Movie Numbers Game.

131
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,980
- I do love that game.
- You go first.

132
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:33,019
- Name a movie, one to 10, go.
- <i>One Crazy Summer.</i>

133
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,986
- <i>Two of a Kind.</i>
- <i>Three to Tango.</i>

134
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,148
- <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral.</i>
- <i>Five Easy Pieces.</i>

135
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,692
- <i>Six Days and Seven Nights.</i>
- Ooh. A double.

136
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:43,423
- <i>8 Mile.</i>
- The erotic <i>Nine and a Half Weeks.</i>

137
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,089
And <i>10.</i> We did it.

138
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,070
- See? We're pretty fun.
- Yeah, we are.

139
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,869
<i>Again, Vice President Lawrence Kenner</i>
<i>has resigned.</i>

140
00:09:57,046 --> 00:10:00,413
<i>The disgraced politician remains</i>
<i>in an undisclosed location...</i>

141
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,417
<i>... a day after he was caught in</i>
<i>a motel room with two underage girls.</i>

142
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,782
- <i>He said he loved me.</i>
- <i>You liar!</i>

143
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,287
<i>The presi...</i>

144
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:12,621
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I love me's a scandal.

145
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:17,188
Well, the president
will be making his selection...

146
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,799
...at the end of the week.

147
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,698
And guess who's at the top of his list.

148
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:23,796
That's right, Mama.

149
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:25,964
Mama's at the top of that list.

150
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,167
They're gonna want someone
squeaky clean.

151
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:31,142
- They'll comb through every part of your life.
- I'm spotless.

152
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:35,045
I already deported the maid,
and my husband's impotent.

153
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,142
What about your daughter, Ashley?

154
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,551
But we were Lancelot and Guinevere
of the medieval feast last year.

155
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:43,916
Not now, Trevor.

156
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,153
Ashley, we want different things.

157
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,798
Since I got my braces off
and that mole removed...

158
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:52,559
...I realized it's time for me to move on.

159
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,503
- None of the medieval freaks even work out.
- Hey, Doug.

160
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,470
Stop talking to that fugly face
and get over here.

161
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,974
Support our spring break.
- Buy a cookie.

162
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:06,774
All proceeds will support binge drinking,
promiscuity and public nudity.

163
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,246
South Padre.

164
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,152
It's senior spring, Ash.

165
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:16,682
They're trying to be your friend
because your dad owns Six Flags.

166
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,326
Maybe so, but they're fun.

167
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,121
- And I wanna be with a girl who parties.
- I can be that girl.

168
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,598
I can.
I could be a right, fine saucy wench.

169
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,964
- I can be saucy.
- Ashley.

170
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,133
You'll never be that girl.

171
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,137
Hey, Mason, wait up.

172
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,248
- What's so great about them?
- Forget Doug, Ashley.

173
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,082
Let him and those frat gorillas
go on their stupid spring break.

174
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:49,822
I hate his fake face.

175
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,119
One second.

176
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,389
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

177
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,227
What's up with my little rock star?

178
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,996
I think someone's
got a spring break coming up.

179
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,236
Yeah, it's next week.

180
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,170
Oh, no.

181
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,368
<i>Where's your crazy sorority</i>
<i>off to this year?</i>

182
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,113
South Padre.

183
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,813
Where the Padre never stops.

184
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,012
Oh, baby, you are my pride and joy.

185
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,817
Now, you be good
and make safe choices.

186
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,290
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye-bye, baby.</i>

187
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,231
What? Don't want her
to be disappointed.

188
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,931
She has this image about me.

189
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,696
You know,
you've really gotta stop lying to her.

190
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:40,074
You know what, miladies?
You're right, the lying stops here.

191
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,073
I am going to South Padre.

192
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,906
I'm gonna prove to Douglas
that inside this fair maiden...

193
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,275
...lies the heart of a wanton trollop.

194
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,418
He's gonna want me back.

195
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,087
My baby girl is just like
her mother was back in the day.

196
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,690
She's the most popular girl
in her sorority...

197
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,886
...smart as a whip
and always up for a good time.

198
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,161
If the press catches her acting out,
you're sunk.

199
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:09,327
- It'll be Bush twins, the sequel.
- It's just spring break, y'all.

200
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,644
Somebody impregnate me!

201
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,049
I guess we better send someone down...

202
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,880
...to South Padre Island
to keep an eye on that girl.

203
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,286
And I need someone who's responsible,
but young enough to pass.

204
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,254
Betty.

205
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:38,161
- You're going to spring break, girl.
- I am?

206
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:42,133
You're gonna stay
on my daughter, Ashley, 24/7.

207
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,296
You'll keep her under the radar
for the five days she's there.

208
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,940
Now, don't you tell her I sent you
because we mostly trust each other.

209
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:50,677
I am so on it.

210
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:54,509
All right, girl, it's time for you to show me
those huge hairy nuts you got...

211
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:56,514
...hidden down there.

212
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:26,371
Pappy, Pappy.

213
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,613
Hello? Sweetheart.

214
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,654
The invites came in.
They look really good.

215
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,189
- You've gotta see. They look...
- Ooh!

216
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,952
Will... William? Juan Carlos?

217
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,159
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:49,335
- I thought you were teaching a class.
- Yeah, class canceled.

219
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:54,704
William, are you sure
that we have no secrets?

220
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,335
- Okay, the truth?
- Yeah.

221
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,744
I'm not liking your "implicaish," okay?
You don't trust me?

222
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,147
- Then I'm really "sorr," but wedding off.
- You're breaking up with me?

223
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,652
Leave me alone!
You're giving me a nervy break-D.

224
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,982
What...?

225
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,222
I mean, do you really think he's gay?

226
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:15,454
I mean, it's not like every straight guy
is into football, right?

227
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,121
I mean...

228
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,823
I don't know, maybe it's me.

229
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,491
Maybe if I only had...

230
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,328
A penis?

231
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,739
I just wanna be married.

232
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,670
Judi, forget about him, okay?

233
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,214
We're going on vacation.

234
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,545
I can't go with you guys.

235
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:40,249
- What?
- What?

236
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:44,017
Today the senator handpicked me
for an important mission.

237
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:49,087
She's sending me on a spring break
to watch over her daughter, a wild child...

238
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:52,927
...and to possibly transform her
into being a better human being.

239
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:57,197
- Did you just say "spring break"?
- I know, it's crazy, right?

240
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,467
Wow, you get to do college
all over again?

241
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,134
- You're really lucky.
- It's a real opportunity.

242
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,472
Do you guys remember college?

243
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:11,553
<i>No more blood for oil.</i>
<i>We must stop this unjust war.</i>

244
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,416
<i>No more blood for oil.</i>
<i>We must...</i>

245
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,489
Hey. Hold on one second.

246
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,627
No, no, no. No.

247
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:31,730
Bigtime congrats to the following
new Kappa Mu Delta sisters.

248
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,335
So when you hear your name,
come on up and join us.

249
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,412
Marcy. Ayala.

250
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:40,739
Jo Lynn.

251
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,340
Laurie.

252
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:45,316
And Claire.

253
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,355
Everyone else, thank you.

254
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,891
Ew.

255
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,757
College was rough.

256
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,994
It was a learning experience.

257
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,337
I wanna go with you, Becky.

258
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,601
- Where?
- To spring break.

259
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,005
You do?

260
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,148
Let's go.
We never went to spring break in college.

261
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,840
I'll trade in my first-class tickets
for three coaches.

262
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,346
- And I have a suite at the Four Seasons.
- Yeah.

263
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,115
- I've never stayed at a Four Seasons.
- This is the kind of vacation we need.

264
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,691
- We do need to shake things up a little bit.
- Wait.

265
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,521
What would Honey want us to do?

266
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,322
Hey, Becky.

267
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:30,688
You really need to bury that cat.

268
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,369
Get it together.

269
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,472
That's what I'm talking about!

270
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,109
Let's have sex.

271
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:16,539
This is terrific.

272
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:18,077
It's repulsive.

273
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:23,013
"The 4 Seasonés"?

274
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,145
We're gonna get date-raped in there.

275
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,881
- You think?
- Judi.

276
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:32,851
Yeah.

277
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,220
Yoo-hoo, ladies, over here.

278
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,290
Howdy, girls. Yoo-hoo.

279
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,799
Hold up one sec. Mama needs her meds.

280
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:42,732
You know how it is.
Mm. Mm-mm.

281
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:47,066
Welcome to The 4 Seasonés.

282
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,266
My name is Charlene.

283
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,536
This here is my 18th spring break.

284
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,806
Y'all, my hot ass
ain't even half done with the party. Whoo!

285
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,784
Okay.

286
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,011
Checking in.

287
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:00,986
Becky St. Germaine.

288
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:04,489
That's right.
I got y'all in a suite on the third floor.

289
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,059
Bathroom's in the hall.

290
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,163
- Wait. One bathroom for the entire floor?
- I'm out of here.

291
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:15,292
And listen, if I ever catch any of y'all
doing the nasty, y'all know this.

292
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,771
I may just join in. What?

293
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,909
Oh, shit. All right, all right. Y'all get.

294
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,475
Y'all get and party.

295
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:25,772
Get the party started, girls. Whoo!

296
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,953
This place is dog balls.

297
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:45,298
It has a lot of character.
- I kind of smell pee.

298
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,832
This is a suite?

299
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,597
Let me just grab this towel to wipe...

300
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,400
Ew.

301
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:58,305
Judi, the bedspread is
the filthiest part of the entire room.

302
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,041
Oh, that's right, that's right.
I heard that on <i>20/20.</i>

303
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,979
Oh, no.

304
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,949
Okay. Becky, what's your plan?

305
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,286
Okay, yeah.

306
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,056
This is Ashley.

307
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,858
We find her, we bond.

308
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,491
We insinuate ourselves into her clique
and then we all become best friends.

309
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,399
- Great.
- That's... That's your plan?

310
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:24,696
Yes, it is.

311
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:26,704
According to my Internet research...

312
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,811
...this club, Chuggers,
is the Studio 54 of South Padre.

313
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,209
We're never gonna get in there.
- Yoo-hoo.

314
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,111
- Hi, hi, hi.
- Charlene.

315
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,752
- Hey, Charlene. Can you get us in?
- Hey. Hey, hey.

316
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,083
Y'all, I didn't bone that bouncer 46 times
for nothing.

317
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,404
Let's get Coyote Ugly, y'all.

318
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:02,338
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey, hey!

319
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,906
Hey. I don't like being picked up.

320
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:07,405
Put me down. Right here. Becky.

321
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,550
Judi! Gayle!

322
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,276
I need to find my friends.

323
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,717
Tequila. Doubles.

324
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:17,518
Oh, what white wines
do you have by the glass?

325
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,423
Hey, Miss Fancy Pants,
this ain't the Red Lobster.

326
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,863
Whoo. Here we go.

327
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:25,260
Hey, I don't touch the hard.

328
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,459
Just drink the damn thing.

329
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:33,767
How do you drink this?

330
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:37,002
Honey, I'd drink gasoline
if you put a lime in it.

331
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,273
- Another round.
- Have you seen this...?

332
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:44,642
No means no.
- Come on, baby.

333
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,215
Come on.
- No touching.

334
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,980
- Just looking.
- Come on.

335
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:50,784
Down, boys. No, drop it.

336
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,290
Up, up.

337
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,486
Here we go. Up, up, up.

338
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:56,654
Look, look. You want a glowstick?

339
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:59,130
Go get it. Go get it.

340
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:02,903
That was incredible.

341
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,936
Men are just dogs with thumbs.

342
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,132
Sit down.

343
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,717
What's your name?

344
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:18,853
- Gayle.
- I'm Mason and we're the Sevens.

345
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:22,980
Seven hot chicks in seven pairs
of Seven cutoff jeans.

346
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,955
Ain't nobody fiercer than us.

347
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,925
- My mama thinks I should be a model.
- Yeah.

348
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,759
I look good in real life,
but in pictures I look even better.

349
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,731
Flawless.
- Don't you love my hair?

350
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,837
Super fierce.

351
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,246
I'm so sorry, Gayle. I love you.

352
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,047
I love you.

353
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,424
- Gayle!
- I got a lot of dreams.

354
00:22:56,591 --> 00:23:00,027
I'm gonna get this ass on <i>Road Rules,</i>
climb Mt. Everett...

355
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:04,627
...and start a charity
to give spray tans to the homeless.

356
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,563
- You wanna dance?
- No.

357
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:11,564
Yes. Yes, I do.

358
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,181
You know what safe sex is?

359
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,786
Dating men who are gay.

360
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:30,714
But I'm ready to make up for lost time.

361
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,209
You are so sexy.

362
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:50,776
I know.

363
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,714
Hey, can I join you guys?

364
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,349
I'm game.

365
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,645
One-night stands, threesomes, fourgies.

366
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,788
Hey, it's all good.

367
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:03,186
Get over here, you dirty little slut.

368
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:10,488
Sorry. Sorry.

369
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,697
Don't move. Don't move.

370
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,859
- Ashley.
- Hey, Ashley.

371
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,362
- Ashley, come here.
- What? Come here.

372
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,473
Ashley, don't move.
- You have to stay.

373
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:21,734
Guys, come down here.

374
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,538
I had this girl all wrong.

375
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,682
There's nothing ordinary about her.

376
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,646
And if she'll say yes...

377
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:33,515
...I would love for her
to be my new chief of staff.

378
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:35,246
What do you say?

379
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:38,688
Hybrid cars for everyone.

380
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:43,491
Excuse me. Ashley, we have totally
gotta get out of here.

381
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,133
- Truvy is having an asthma attack.
- There he is.

382
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:47,598
Ashley.

383
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,737
Find Judi. We gotta get out of here.

384
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,005
- Hi, Becky.
- No, we gotta get out of here.

385
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:04,979
Surprise.

386
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,051
Ashley.

387
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,750
- What are you doing here?
- Getting jiggy.

388
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,960
I'm about to puke
and, like, not on purpose.

389
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:16,025
Why don't you just leave me alone?

390
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:19,190
Because I ain't nice.

391
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,668
That girl has been torturing me
since freshman year.

392
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:31,710
- The worst roommate matchup ever.
- I have a moist towelette.

393
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,344
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

394
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:36,643
Her ex-boyfriend has lost his mind.

395
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:39,810
You know what? If Doug wants trash,
I'm gonna give him trash.

396
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:41,319
What does that mean exactly?

397
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,822
It means tomorrow we're going
to the beach to act like total idiots.

398
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:46,585
I'm sorry, who are you?

399
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:49,389
I'm Becky St. Germaine.

400
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:50,861
I'm a college student.

401
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:54,528
A grad student, and you?

402
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:58,331
- Lydia, Truvy and Ashley.
- Whoo! Whoo!

403
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,167
I'm gonna be a slut.

404
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,004
- A slut. I'm gonna be a slut.
- Becky.

405
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:05,976
You guys horny too?
Who's horny? You?

406
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,671
I hate it here, Ashley.

407
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,146
Oh, that's Ashley.

408
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,909
Take me home, I need to barf.

409
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:12,610
- I need to barf.
- Okay.

410
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,755
- Whose shoe is this?
- It's your shoe, Judi.

411
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:16,686
That's bullshit.
- All right.

412
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,325
Who wants to do me?

413
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,199
Hey, you guys.

414
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,598
The special today is huevos rancheros.

415
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,465
Yum.

416
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,107
- Just coffee for me. Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.

417
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,106
Oh, Judi, are you okay?

418
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:39,373
Well, it's just huevos rancheros
always reminds me of William.

419
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:42,781
Because he went down
on that Hispanic guy?

420
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,180
No, because it was our Sunday tradition.

421
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,152
All right.
Judi, you're here to forget about him.

422
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,053
Maybe you should eat something.

423
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:54,753
No, thanks. The thought of food
makes me wanna seriously chunder.

424
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,262
- Chunder?
- Oh, yeah, it means to vomit.

425
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,129
This place is opening up
a whole new world for me.

426
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:02,395
You know what I learned?

427
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,438
That the roll of fat that hangs
over the jean is called a muffin top.

428
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:11,370
Our trips are not only fun
but educational.

429
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,140
Are we excited about
going to the beach today?

430
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:16,580
That sounds perfect. I just wanna relax.

431
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,549
I just wanna stretch out
with a good book, you know?

432
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:50,951
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

433
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,185
Whoo! Keg stands, y'all.

434
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,918
Judi, let me flip and tap you.

435
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,960
- I don't understand.
- Get over here.

436
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:06,263
All's you gotta do is drink,
but don't let it get up your nose...

437
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,458
...because that hurts.

438
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,000
- Let her rip.
- Gayle.

439
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,699
It's our protector.

440
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,406
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Oh, is it too revealing?

441
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,875
- You look like my nana.
- Thank you.

442
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,070
Come with us.

443
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:21,306
<i>Chug, chug, chug.</i>

444
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,442
I'm gonna go look for Ashley.

445
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:31,655
I did it! Let's go again!

446
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:37,426
That's better.

447
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,029
Girl, welcome.

448
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,363
Your abs ain't that bad, by the way.

449
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,062
Oh, my God, thank you.

450
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:49,474
Why do you litter?

451
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,881
This place is so weird.

452
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,855
Whoo! I wanna see some balls.

453
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,520
What?

454
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:20,002
A talent show.
- Do you guys have any talents?

455
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,837
- I can put my tongue in my nose.
- I have no gag reflex.

456
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,308
We are so gonna win this.

457
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:30,747
Everyone knows
you can't spell talent without T and A.

458
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,443
Okay, listen up.

459
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,180
The winner gets 150 drink tickets...

460
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:40,453
...a group day of beauty at Texas Tan
and 12 bottle-opener keychains.

461
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,391
Oh, my God.

462
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:43,792
That's the prize?

463
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:46,093
Gayle, you be the coach.

464
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:48,235
Oh, no, no, no. I just coach dogs.

465
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:50,394
And we're the Bad News Beyotches.

466
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:52,534
Check up on this.

467
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,052
Here's what I want. Give me two lines.

468
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,255
You... Okay, Mason in front.
Now, heads up.

469
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:12,285
Tails back, boobs out, stomachs in.

470
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,958
And give me four booty roundabouts
in unison...

471
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:18,298
...with extra butt-cheek vibration.

472
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:19,660
Go.

473
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,506
Whoo! I love it.

474
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:31,839
I love it a lot. Again.

475
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:33,613
Yeah!

476
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,627
- You.
- Can I keep my T-shirt on?

477
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:48,155
- Whatever.
- Okay.

478
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,395
Oh, God!

479
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:56,102
- Two against one, that's not fair.
- You're right.

480
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:59,132
Yeah.

481
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:02,639
I'm allergic to tomatoes.

482
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,916
That girl's gone bonkers.

483
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,826
Excuse me. Excuse me. Let me through.

484
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,729
<i>Kill, kill, kill.</i>

485
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,750
This is really degrading to women.

486
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:45,944
Really.

487
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,049
Why would anyone
wanna wrestle in salsa?

488
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,993
We're human beings, we're not tacos.

489
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:59,932
Listen, I understand what you're feeling.

490
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,232
I too have recently suffered a loss.

491
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:05,395
- Your boyfriend dump you too?
- No, my cat died.

492
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,968
And I know that the language
of letting go is not in that salsa.

493
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,543
Right.

494
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:14,076
- Body shots?
- No.

495
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:16,682
I'm talking about releasing
the spirit of fun...

496
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:19,443
...without the display of public nudity.

497
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:24,448
I'm talking about enjoying ourselves
in a real and meaningful way.

498
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:28,118
I'm talking about
girls really going bonkers.

499
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,290
I don't get it.

500
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:50,111
Look at us all laughing.

501
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,386
See? We don't have to be like everyone else
to have fun.

502
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,857
Everyone else?

503
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,259
Burnouts, wastoids and sluts.

504
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,503
I freaking love you.

505
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,207
No, I freaking love you.

506
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:24,647
Hey, you guys,
let's tell each other our secrets.

507
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:25,911
Yeah.

508
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,145
I can't read.

509
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:32,952
I have sex with my uncle
every Thanksgiving.

510
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:40,524
You're gonna have to deal with that later.
You're gonna have to deal with that later.

511
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,403
Good night, ladies.

512
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:44,397
Oh, my God.

513
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,959
Oh, my God.

514
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,394
Total walk of shame.

515
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,195
Yeah, you're damn right
it's a walk of shame.

516
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,332
Because I just got me some, beyotch.

517
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:38,579
- Where have you been?
- Oh, Mason and I passed out on the beach.

518
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:41,080
Ladies.

519
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:42,688
Where have you been?

520
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,722
I had sex...

521
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,521
...with a straight guy.
Yeah, you heard.

522
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,428
One, two, three, snap.

523
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,590
Have you two gone cuckoo-bananas?

524
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:58,000
Becky, please.
Your voice is like daggers in my skull.

525
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:00,902
I was worried sick about the both...

526
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,403
You had sex?

527
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:06,777
Got freaky all night.

528
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,142
Tell us everything.

529
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:11,752
Okay, well, I don't remember much,
but I know it was amazing.

530
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,910
We had a really special connection.

531
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,419
You guys...

532
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,650
...I've never felt this way before.

533
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:21,961
What's his name?

534
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,923
I don't know.

535
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:29,295
I can't believe you had sex.

536
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,565
Was it meaningful?

537
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:33,707
Oh, you guys, he's really special.

538
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,672
Oh, I can't wait for you to meet him.

539
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,674
This place is incredible.

540
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,541
- I'm gonna throw up again.
- Awesome.

541
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,222
And time.

542
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:55,856
This is so not what I was expecting
when I came to South Padre.

543
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,464
If my mom saw this,
she would totally freak.

544
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,101
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

545
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:04,830
My mom was Miss Texas,
valedictorian.

546
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,702
Now one of the most powerful women
in Washington.

547
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,474
Ain't easy being me.

548
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,640
She sounds like a real piece of work.

549
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,677
They call her "The Hatchet."

550
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,179
I don't know who you're talking about.

551
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,577
Excuse me, I have to take this.
It's an important call.

552
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,518
Okay.

553
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,953
- Hello.
- Talk to me, Betty.

554
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:30,461
Ow! Ming Ling, shit.

555
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,263
So my wild horse running you ragged?

556
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:38,233
- Oh, she's crazy, all right.
- <i>Don't screw this up.</i>

557
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:40,397
Three more days to keep her safe...

558
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:43,941
- <i>... and we'll make history.</i>
- Oh, don't you worry, I'm so on it. I...

559
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:46,045
Hello? Hello?

560
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,749
- Good morning, everybody.
- Morning? It's 5 p.m.

561
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,580
Well, it's morning somewheres.

562
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:56,049
Gayle, what are you wearing?

563
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,424
My boo loaned it to me. Slamming, huh?

564
00:37:58,592 --> 00:37:59,616
What's going on here?

565
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:02,058
It's a magazine-soda-pop-
Chex-Mix-pool party.

566
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,594
- Come join us.
- Okay.

567
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:08,258
Y'all, we got a booze cruise in 10
and then the foam party.

568
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:10,729
- You guys are going to a foam party?
- Oh, yeah.

569
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:14,033
They fill up a whole club with beer foam.
It's like living in a keg.

570
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,903
Becky, you have to meet the Sevens.

571
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,409
When you hang with them,
you're hot by association.

572
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:21,480
- You know the Sevens?
- We're kind of like the Eights right now.

573
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,715
- So, shorties, you coming with?
- No way, Jose.

574
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,022
- Sorry, Judi.
- His name was Juan Carlos.

575
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:32,853
You think maybe I can go with you?

576
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:36,292
- I have no problem with that.
- Don't you have to be on the list, Gayle?

577
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:39,126
And isn't that list closed?

578
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,937
Yes, I believe that list is closed, Becky.

579
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:47,632
Y'all, let's motor.
This ass ain't getting any higher.

580
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,139
Can I get a "what, what?"

581
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,607
Later-hosen.

582
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:07,354
Gayle, the Sevens and I have been talking.
Four and Five think you're awesome.

583
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:11,294
Six and Seven think it'd be better if you
were taller, and Two had no comment.

584
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:12,989
I'm, like, really stupid.

585
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,191
Oh, it's okay.

586
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:17,428
And I... I think you are almost there.

587
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,869
Oh, my God. You guys.

588
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,606
I can't feel my face.

589
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:29,883
Oh, my God,
that's the guy from last night.

590
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:32,747
That is some grade-A baloney pony.

591
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,785
Go talk to him.

592
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:40,717
See, I told you we'd get in.

593
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:43,363
Doug's gotta be in here somewhere.

594
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:48,497
Lydia? Lydia!

595
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:50,364
Lydia!

596
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:52,165
Lydia!

597
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,501
Hey.

598
00:39:58,946 --> 00:39:59,970
Hey.

599
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,217
- What's up?
- Nothing.

600
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,752
We cool?

601
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,154
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:17,728
Hey...

603
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,724
Thank you.

604
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:47,860
Hi.

605
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:58,427
All right, maestro.
Let's get this party started.

606
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:00,039
What's up, suckers?

607
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:04,904
My name is Gayle
and I'm the party master. Woo, woo.

608
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,138
Do you guys like line dancing?

609
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:08,372
No.

610
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,484
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's my girls.

611
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,410
We're gonna get it going tonight.

612
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:17,614
We're gonna blow your mother-humping
mind with a thing called electric slide.

613
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,622
Maestro.

614
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,823
Whoo!

615
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,230
That's right. Get it going.

616
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:32,064
Yeah.

617
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:35,100
All right. You guys aren't feeling it, huh?

618
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:36,300
Here's some incentive.

619
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,775
How about you come up
and do the electric slide...

620
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:40,573
...to get your free keychain.

621
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:44,473
Give me those damn keychains.

622
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,950
Oh, they really like keychains.

623
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,631
Hey.

624
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,839
Spring break forever!

625
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,574
I'm flying.

626
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,275
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

627
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:24,382
Girl, you're a Team Seven now.

628
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:27,186
I'm 35 years old.

629
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:31,954
I'm flying.

630
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:53,515
Chug, chug. Chug, chug.

631
00:42:53,687 --> 00:42:56,747
- What time is it?
- Almost dinner.

632
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:03,928
I must have blacked out again.

633
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:05,429
Me too.

634
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,159
You guys have been drunk
for three straight days.

635
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,200
Oh, girl, don't hate.

636
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,669
Stop talking like that.

637
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,173
Becky, there's this party tonight,
beer fountains.

638
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:20,074
It's like the Trevi in Rome but with beer.

639
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:21,680
You're loaded, Judi.

640
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:24,084
Roll with us.

641
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:25,718
What is going on here?

642
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,950
I had sex with a stranger...

643
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:30,522
...and now we're falling in love.

644
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,320
Yeah, and I mounted
an Abercrombie model.

645
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:36,963
He was 19 years old.

646
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,393
We're different women here.

647
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:40,726
- Yeah, so come with us.
- Yes.

648
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:43,529
Oh, wow, my tan is out of control.

649
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,729
I have a job to do.

650
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,107
Your job is done.

651
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:52,074
Yeah, Ashley's a nerdball.
She ain't making no Page Six.

652
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:54,305
You're missing your second chance.

653
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:56,449
Becky, it's not the same without you.

654
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:57,641
We're a trio.

655
00:43:57,818 --> 00:44:01,447
We're like the Three Musketeers
or Wilson Phillips.

656
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,283
True that.

657
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:06,688
We've been reborn, Becky.

658
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:12,056
Holler back, girl.

659
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,401
Ashley. Come on, let us in.

660
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:49,934
Forget about Doug.

661
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,129
She's been in there all day.

662
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:54,206
Do you wanna play mahjong?

663
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,969
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

664
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:02,240
No, thank you, ladies.

665
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,576
I'm out.

666
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:05,711
Hey, Mr. Man.

667
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:10,220
Get me a shot of anything and whatever
my little friend here wants too.

668
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:11,653
Yeah, all right.

669
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:13,816
Me likey when the lady buys.

670
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:15,757
Well, you know...

671
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,027
Down it, wench.

672
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,069
You guys, this game is so boring.

673
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,299
We've been playing it for,
like, two hours.

674
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:30,302
We don't know any other games.

675
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:33,208
I know a game.
Let's play the Movie Numbers Game.

676
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,975
It's super fun. You say the titles of movies
that have numbers from one to 10.

677
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,210
I'll start.
<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

678
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:40,876
<i>Two Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

679
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,181
- Numbers what to what?
- One to 10.

680
00:45:43,357 --> 00:45:44,915
Hey, I threw up four times today.

681
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,888
- You know, that's very unhealthy.
- So is being fat.

682
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:51,121
Fat people are nice people, okay?

683
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:53,596
People are fat for all different reasons.

684
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,031
You have a slow metabolism
or a thyroid problem...

685
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:59,138
...or you're an adult and
your parents decide to get a divorce.

686
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:03,367
And you find yourself in your grandma's
laundry room eating brownie mix...

687
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:04,704
...and crying.

688
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:07,403
What, are we all supposed
to be the same? That's crazy.

689
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,947
That's just crazy talk.

690
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,017
Gayle.

691
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,885
You are so wise.
You are like a big sister.

692
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:20,885
Yeah, we are starting
to become like family.

693
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:22,221
Absolutely.

694
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:26,892
- Yeah.
- Oh, and you're like the one we adopted.

695
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:29,001
Aw.

696
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,244
You look just like my R.A.

697
00:46:42,783 --> 00:46:46,810
I haven't been touched by a man
since Clinton was in office.

698
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,185
Hey, I need to talk to you.

699
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:57,421
Please, I just... I need... Just one second.

700
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:02,127
Look, nothing was gonna happen
with me and that guy over there.

701
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:05,066
Yeah, you know,
it's really none of my business.

702
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:09,238
Don't be mad, please.
You've gotta trust me.

703
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:12,975
I'm just trying to take a leak.

704
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:14,807
Why are you being so cold?

705
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:18,776
I don't even know you.

706
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:23,083
Yeah? Well, I feel like
I don't even know you anymore either.

707
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:27,093
This is why I'm not a slut.
I just don't have what it takes.

708
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,423
Because when I love, I love hard.

709
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,430
But you, you're just like
every other guy here, right?

710
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,229
Y'all just see me as some piece of ass!
Well, guess what, homeboy...

711
00:47:37,404 --> 00:47:40,430
...I ain't your sex robot.

712
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:43,837
Move it!

713
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:50,147
Good Lord, look at that. That is pathetic.

714
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:52,148
It's like putting lipstick on a turd.

715
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,482
Guys, I have a good idea.
Let's make her over.

716
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,256
You know, it'll be a fun project,
like I was.

717
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,859
Gayle, she is pure nasty.

718
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:03,519
You, you were a diamond in the rough.

719
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,528
She kind of is too. She's really smart.

720
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:09,328
And, you know, her mother
might be vice president next week.

721
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,329
She might be famous
and be in magazines.

722
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:15,873
Oh, my God. Let's make friends.

723
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:17,840
She could get the Sevens in <i>Us Weekly.</i>

724
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:24,547
- No, that wasn't why I told...
- Yoo-hoo. Ash. You come here.

725
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:27,346
Damn, girl, you clean up real nice.

726
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,455
- Yeah, you really like this?
- I do.

727
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:32,251
- Okay.
- Listen, honey, I am sorry.

728
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:35,884
I have matured so much this past week.
I am tired of being a jerk.

729
00:48:36,263 --> 00:48:38,857
You and me need a fresh start.
Let me get you a drink.

730
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:40,192
Hi.

731
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,699
Hey, Ashley,
let's go play a hot game of Scrabble.

732
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:45,099
I am not liking you that much right now.

733
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:46,834
Let's chug.

734
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,441
Spring break tears people apart.

735
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:55,281
- What's she doing here?
- Go get Becky.

736
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:57,074
I said, are you guys ready?

737
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,946
It's time for the wet T-shirt contest.

738
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,247
Ladies, come on up.

739
00:49:06,393 --> 00:49:07,417
All right.

740
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:08,618
Mason. Mason.

741
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:11,093
You've gotta enter
the wet T-shirt contest.

742
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,561
Yeah.

743
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:16,725
What...? What's...? What are...?
What's going on here?

744
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:18,701
I'm partying.

745
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:22,435
- You don't party.
- Nor should she. Yay!

746
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:24,834
Dude, I am a total party girl.

747
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:26,741
Somebody give me another drink.

748
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:29,473
- Doug, get us another round.
- Know what? Make that two.

749
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,914
Let's Padre, people!

750
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:34,712
Ashley, I know you want him back.

751
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,450
Believe me, I am nothing to him.

752
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:40,957
You gotta jump-start that man.
Give him what he wants.

753
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:42,891
If you shake it, he will come.

754
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:47,159
No. No, let's not shake anything.
Whoo!

755
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,234
It's wet T-shirt time.

756
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:54,901
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley, wait.

757
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,100
Remember your Women's Studies class.

758
00:49:57,277 --> 00:49:59,507
And you remember what team you're on.

759
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,204
Girls, get your cameras.

760
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,449
Hey. Hey.

761
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:08,551
Ashley's been skanked by the Sevens.

762
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:10,952
Bye, I'll see you later.

763
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:20,964
Ashley.

764
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:24,297
Ashley. Ashley. Down, girl.

765
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:28,801
Move.

766
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:30,441
What's happening?

767
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,135
They found out
her mother might be famous.

768
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:34,507
- Who told her?
- I did.

769
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:37,013
We tell each other everything,
that's how it works.

770
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:38,481
- Gayle.
- Ashley!

771
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,646
That's my girl.

772
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:02,168
Ashley, you don't have to do this.

773
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:03,673
You're not a Mason.

774
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:05,744
I am now.

775
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:08,041
What would the senator say?

776
00:51:10,217 --> 00:51:12,242
- The senator?
- Yeah, your mother.

777
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:14,250
My mother?

778
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:16,955
Your brother.

779
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,016
- She sent you, didn't she?!
- No, no, I...

780
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:24,059
I should have known
those wrinkles weren't from the sun!

781
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,897
I thought we were friends!

782
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:43,847
Put me down.
- I'm sorry, I had to do it.

783
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,611
Judi, Gayle, I'm going to jail.

784
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:48,118
Hey, hey. Let go of me.

785
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,914
Hey, hey, hey, be strong. Be strong.

786
00:51:51,091 --> 00:51:53,252
Stop singing that song.

787
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,355
Oh, does this mean we have to leave?

788
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,020
Come on.

789
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:00,533
I don't know.

790
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,600
Oh, my God. Is she dead?

791
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,604
Okay, I'll deal with this.
You go to jail.

792
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:09,233
This would not be happening
at the Wimmin's Music Festival.

793
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:11,267
Hi.

794
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:14,607
Come on, old gal, here we go. All right.

795
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:18,239
Christina Aguilera,
what are you doing here?

796
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:25,083
I hate you, Becky.

797
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:28,586
- I feel really bad.
- I feel like ass.

798
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:29,922
You smell like ass.

799
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:32,388
I was just doing my job.

800
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,999
I thought you were my friend.

801
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:36,829
- I am your friend.
- No, you're not.

802
00:52:37,003 --> 00:52:39,301
You're just a butt-sucking liar.

803
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:42,231
That sound like Deion, don't it?

804
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,001
You're the one lying to your mom.

805
00:52:44,177 --> 00:52:46,407
Mama-love knows no bounds, honey.

806
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,844
God bless all the mamas.

807
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,181
Look who's talking.

808
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:53,642
You're the one trying to impress her.

809
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,983
Let me guess.
She told you to grow a pair of nuts.

810
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:58,920
Oh, I hate that word.

811
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,923
Yeah, they're nasty.

812
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,663
If you'd just...

813
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:06,822
If we all accept ourselves...

814
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,468
...the way that we are,
we'll be so much happier.

815
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:10,625
- Word.
- Amen.

816
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:12,203
Like you and your friends?

817
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,105
I miss my babies.

818
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,301
I miss my babies.

819
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,949
First of all, this place is disgust.

820
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:38,325
Second of all, what are you doing
at spring break anyway?

821
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:41,557
Catholic school G. I love.

822
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:44,293
What are you doing here?

823
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:47,530
I want a second chance.

824
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:48,867
Come home.

825
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:54,213
What about your massage?

826
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,614
I love women.

827
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:03,984
I love their hair, I love their smooth skin.

828
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,921
I'm a huge fan of those.

829
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:10,695
I really wanna believe that.

830
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:12,926
Then do.

831
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:18,166
Look, I need to go.
I have to go bail Becky out of jail.

832
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,398
- You girls went craze, huh?
- You don't even know.

833
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:25,740
Jude, the firm dinner's this weekend.

834
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:27,675
I could really use you by my side.

835
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:31,681
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because people can't live alone forever.

836
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,285
Judi, look.

837
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,614
Let's have the wed.

838
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:41,852
And then after,
we'll have a really nice life "togeth."

839
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:47,594
Every spring, this place,
she flares up like a cold sore.

840
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:49,564
And I'm back for more. You know...

841
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:54,298
...the kids and the sex and the booze,
you think it'll go on forever.

842
00:54:54,474 --> 00:55:00,071
But it's like one of them videos, you know,
of a fireplace that you put on your TV.

843
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:04,114
And, like, no matter how close
you get to the screen...

844
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:07,151
...it's never gonna warm you up.

845
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:12,719
I just wanted to be a stylist to the stars.

846
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,360
- Oh, you still have time.
- Do you think so?

847
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:16,995
- Yeah.
- You do?

848
00:55:17,163 --> 00:55:18,187
Yeah.

849
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:20,356
Oh, hello there, fine fellow.

850
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:23,565
- Who is this?
- Oh, honey, that's a tree.

851
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,433
My name is Charlene.

852
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,105
What are you wearing?

853
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:34,605
- All right.
- I love him.

854
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:36,043
- Yeah.
- Don't touch me.

855
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:38,081
- Okay.
- Please touch me.

856
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,411
- All right.
- Thank you.

857
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,281
Here we go.

858
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,155
- Let's just stay here for a while.
- You got it.

859
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:45,791
- Okay, all right.
- Okay.

860
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,998
All right, ladies, you can go.

861
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:01,163
- Judi, thank God.
- Thank you.

862
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:03,571
You guys,
we have a little bit of a problem.

863
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:07,336
Over here, over here.

864
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,975
Ashley.
- All right, that's enough.

865
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:14,416
- Give the lady some room.
- Can I get a comment?

866
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:18,956
- There will be an official statement later.
- That's the girl from the wet T-shirt contest.

867
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,491
Right here, right here.
- I am not a girl.

868
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:23,526
I am a woman.

869
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:25,527
- Now let us through.
- Ashley, over here.

870
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:29,457
<i>After several Long Island iced teas,</i>
<i>a strip show and a bar brawl...</i>

871
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,332
<i>... Ashley Hartmann,</i>
<i>daughter of Senator Kay Bee Hartmann...</i>

872
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:35,133
<i>... potential vice-presidential appointee,</i>
<i>was arrested...</i>

873
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,799
<i>... after spring-breaking</i>
<i>on South Padre Island.</i>

874
00:56:38,678 --> 00:56:41,579
<i>Ashley's troubles couldn't come</i>
<i>at a more inopportune moment...</i>

875
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:45,115
<i>... for the potential vice president,</i>
<i>as the president is two days away...</i>

876
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:46,946
<i>... from announcing his selection.</i>

877
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,144
Motherf...

878
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,381
<i>Ashley kept, like, chugging.</i>
<i>And I was all like, "Stop."</i>

879
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:52,855
<i>And she was all like, "No."</i>

880
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:55,494
<i>And then all of a sudden,</i>
<i>she just starts thrashing...</i>

881
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,655
<i>... on this real unattractive lady,</i>
<i>and I'm, like, thinking:</i>

882
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,234
<i>" Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Drinking and public displays of sex...</i>

883
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:06,895
- <i>... is, like, real bad for women. "
- Can we turn this off, please, somebody?

884
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:09,337
Just turn it off. Thank you.

885
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:21,818
Let's pack it in and leave.

886
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:25,590
What? No, I'm not going anywheres.

887
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:27,953
We got two days of partying left,
right, Judi?

888
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,852
Actually, I need to go too.

889
00:57:31,297 --> 00:57:35,358
You guys, William and I reconciled.

890
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,729
We are gonna get married.

891
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,229
Sweetie, he's as gay as a goose.

892
00:57:40,406 --> 00:57:42,601
Mason says
there's no such thing as gay men.

893
00:57:42,775 --> 00:57:45,972
- Just guys that haven't met her yet.
- Enough with the Masons already.

894
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:48,410
Oh, come on,
don't be bagging on my girls.

895
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:50,208
Hey, I thought we were your girls.

896
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:52,011
Yeah. No, you are.

897
00:57:52,185 --> 00:57:55,643
Just the Sevens asked me
to perform with them in the talent show...

898
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:58,052
...so I think I'm finally gonna win.

899
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,055
I think your cornrows are too tight.

900
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,694
How can you think about
getting on a stage without us?

901
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:04,693
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I want to win.

902
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:07,628
You haven't gotten sun here,
you've gotten sun-damaged.

903
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:10,793
Jiffy Pop.

904
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,062
Ouch.

905
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,639
You guys, focus.
I just said I'm getting married.

906
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:18,140
Now, why can't you two
just be happy for me?

907
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:20,973
- Judi, he's a gay.
- Judi, he's a gay.

908
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:22,973
Let this be a lesson to you girls.

909
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:26,880
Never base your self-esteem
on the validation from men.

910
00:58:27,053 --> 00:58:28,850
Or women.

911
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:30,956
I might have low self-esteem...

912
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:33,752
...but at least
I'm not rocking the gaucho pants.

913
00:58:34,494 --> 00:58:36,519
Honey gave me these pants.

914
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:38,755
- For my 30th birthday.
- You know what, Becky?

915
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:42,891
She didn't give you those pants. Know why?
Because cats can't give gifts, okay?

916
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:44,730
Judi, tell her. She's delusional.

917
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:47,771
Tell her, Judi. We can't spend
every night playing Pictionary.

918
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,965
You bought that game.

919
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:52,009
- She bought that game.
- Give me a break. Judi, pick a side.

920
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:53,372
- Pick a side.
- Pick a side.

921
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:55,070
- Pick a side.
- Pick a side.

922
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:57,443
You guys, I don't need to pick a side...

923
00:58:57,717 --> 00:58:59,981
...because I am getting married.

924
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,515
And it will be a small, private affair.

925
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:07,353
I'll be at the Hilton with my fiancé.

926
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,158
You hear that?
That's the sound of the party train.

927
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:15,495
And this gal's gonna be on it. So peace.

928
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:20,832
I'm sorry you had to see that.

929
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:24,339
Let's get the hell out of here.

930
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,805
Ashley, aren't you coming?

931
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,077
No.

932
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:36,111
What?

933
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:43,288
Are we really gonna let those Seven bitches
run us out of town?

934
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:45,394
They're kind of the Eights now.

935
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:47,461
I wanna enter in that talent show.

936
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,998
I heard that sentence in college once.
It ruined my life.

937
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,695
Becky.

938
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:55,568
Aren't you tired of being a doormat?

939
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:59,537
Letting the Masons of the world
just win all the time?

940
00:59:59,912 --> 01:00:03,814
This isn't just a talent show. This is war.

941
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,921
Becky, you are not a cautionary tale.

942
01:00:11,324 --> 01:00:12,348
She's right.

943
01:00:13,393 --> 01:00:16,191
Let's take back the beach.

944
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:27,062
- Charlene.
- Oh, hi.

945
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,367
We're starting a band.

946
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,669
And I need your help.

947
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:33,835
You need me?

948
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:56,360
Yeah, hey.

949
01:00:56,536 --> 01:00:59,994
Stop. You know what?
That viola cannot handle the melody.

950
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:01,902
We need someone on keyboards.

951
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,772
My cousin Lavonne plays the piano down
at the church. We could give her a call.

952
01:01:05,945 --> 01:01:09,472
Oh, but she's such an alcoholic.
Yeah, it's so sad.

953
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:13,750
Ashley.

954
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,583
Oh, my God. Everybody's talking about you
like you're some big star.

955
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:20,955
I've decided to take you back.

956
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:24,019
- Oh, gosh, really?
- Really.

957
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:26,691
You're the only girl for me.

958
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,333
Oh, Douglas.

959
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:31,836
Your mole's growing back.

960
01:02:07,573 --> 01:02:09,302
Ugh.

961
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,981
On the left. All right, good.

962
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,485
Got that.

963
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:27,659
Welcome to the 37th Annual
All-Girl Talent Show.

964
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,261
I'm Dan, and you're about to see
a lot of naughty.

965
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:32,898
But first, let's say hello to our judges.

966
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:35,465
Christopher Knight,
Bruce Vilanch and La La.

967
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:38,160
Ladies, five minutes to get to that table
and register.

968
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,737
So let's make that happen.
Get it on! I'm Dan.

969
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,605
Are we too late to sign up
for the talent show?

970
01:02:44,777 --> 01:02:46,301
- Just made it.
- Drink it.

971
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:49,642
Lavonne, drink it.
You have got to focus on the music.

972
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,508
Dear God, thank you for making us sexy.

973
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,086
We love you. Jesus is the best.

974
01:02:56,556 --> 01:02:58,080
And God bless our troops...

975
01:02:58,257 --> 01:03:02,387
...the unborn,
and all Sevens for all mankind.

976
01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:05,929
- Amen.
- Praise him.

977
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:08,524
It's so weird you guys are religious.

978
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,293
Gayle.

979
01:03:11,771 --> 01:03:14,604
On the outside, I see you've changed.

980
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:16,966
How are you?

981
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,543
- Get away from us.
- Good luck, Gayle.

982
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,745
Let the show begin.

983
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:26,407
Our first contestants come straight
from the Pan-Asia Club of Florida State.

984
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:30,118
The Hoochie Minh.

985
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:54,504
And for the flight, I brought a copy of...
Wait for it.

986
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:57,111
<i>Steel Magnoles.</i>

987
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:59,774
Oh. Yay.

988
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:01,078
You look good, Jude.

989
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:03,387
Really pretty.

990
01:04:03,556 --> 01:04:05,956
- You think?
- Yes.

991
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:08,627
- Hey.
- Yes?

992
01:04:08,794 --> 01:04:12,059
Let's go over to that bathroom over there
and do it.

993
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:13,823
Jude, you just went.

994
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,468
No, I mean do it,
like throw me up against a wall...

995
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:18,501
...and call me your dirty little slut.

996
01:04:19,071 --> 01:04:20,129
You're talking craze.

997
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,039
- We have a problem, William.
- What's that, Baby G?

998
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:27,878
We don't have sex ever.

999
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:36,014
Are you thirsty?

1000
01:04:36,188 --> 01:04:38,281
Because I am thirsty.

1001
01:04:40,826 --> 01:04:42,123
- I can't do this.
- What?

1002
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,660
I can't go back with you.

1003
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:45,387
- Come again?
- I can't marry you.

1004
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:46,793
One more time.

1005
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,434
How can I make you understand?

1006
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:52,432
Okay, here's the "sitch," all right?

1007
01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:54,869
I'm at a real crucial "mome" in my life...

1008
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:59,910
...and I'm not just gonna settle
for half a "relaish."

1009
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,808
I've still got a "fuetch."

1010
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,610
And, William, truth be T...

1011
01:05:05,918 --> 01:05:07,545
...you're a total 'mo.

1012
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:34,902
<i>Hoochie Minh.</i>
Give it up for the Hoochie Minh.

1013
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:38,209
<i>Hoochie Minh, Hoochie Minh,</i>
<i>Hoochie Minh.</i>

1014
01:06:13,252 --> 01:06:15,049
Take it off!

1015
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,122
- We are so much hotter than that.
- Mm-hm.

1016
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:20,588
We're so gonna win this.

1017
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,453
Gayle, I'm putting you in the back row.

1018
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:25,358
You're looking kind of bloated.

1019
01:06:25,531 --> 01:06:27,726
But I haven't eaten for two days.

1020
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,630
Damn it, Gayle,
you wanna win this thing or not?

1021
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,304
Get this thing off me.

1022
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:35,838
No!

1023
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:37,805
François.

1024
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:40,411
What is wrong with you?

1025
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:43,173
Dogs are our friends.
They love our insides.

1026
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:45,517
God, freak out much?

1027
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:47,653
Dogs are gross.

1028
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:51,456
You know what? I don't belong here.

1029
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:53,114
Look at me, I look ridiculous.

1030
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:54,623
I'm wearing a boa.

1031
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:56,989
- Whose idea was this?
- Yours.

1032
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,524
Did I get caught up in the razzle-dazzle?
Yes.

1033
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,997
But you know what I learned?

1034
01:07:02,168 --> 01:07:03,897
These will get you here:

1035
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,867
But this is gonna get you here:

1036
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:08,003
And then this will get you way up here:

1037
01:07:08,174 --> 01:07:10,642
Then use this and this together,
and you're up here:

1038
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,370
And then you don't even care
about these.

1039
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,713
Are you talking about boobs?

1040
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,009
Oh, God. You know,
I chase girls like you my whole life.

1041
01:07:19,185 --> 01:07:21,449
And you know what?
You're all a bunch of bullies.

1042
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,952
And you know what happens to bullies?

1043
01:07:25,324 --> 01:07:28,418
They get whatever they want,
but they don't get love.

1044
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:29,788
Real love.

1045
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,294
Mary J. Blige style. Here.

1046
01:07:33,365 --> 01:07:36,129
Why don't you take this?
Use it as a thong.

1047
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,826
Gayle.

1048
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,530
- Eat this.
- Thank you.

1049
01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:46,403
This tastes so fucking good.

1050
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:49,643
I am so tired of being hungry.

1051
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:50,873
Let's go.

1052
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:54,611
All right, people, give it up for
the hottest chicks from the state of Texas.

1053
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:56,516
The Sevens.

1054
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,885
I trained them well.

1055
01:08:30,055 --> 01:08:31,989
Move. Come on.

1056
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,352
Get, get.

1057
01:08:46,272 --> 01:08:47,933
Let's beat it.

1058
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:58,414
Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1059
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:01,984
Take it off.
- Go for it, baby.

1060
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,090
Mason.

1061
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,888
Lavonne.
Lavonne, you gotta keep it together.

1062
01:09:11,297 --> 01:09:13,026
Becky's Friendz, you're up next.

1063
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,066
Becky's Friendz?
That's the name of our group?

1064
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,725
All right, that's it, Ashley.

1065
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,768
Your spring break is over, girls.

1066
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:20,997
Grab her, boys.

1067
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:22,831
Senator, please.

1068
01:09:23,008 --> 01:09:24,635
Betty, Betty, Betty.

1069
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:27,938
I think that you have done
just about enough.

1070
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:31,173
I never should have sent
a weak-willed number cruncher.

1071
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,114
God, I hate plain women, I really do.

1072
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:37,278
You know what?

1073
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:40,516
"Hate" is a strong word.

1074
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:42,388
And I am not plain.

1075
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:44,222
I'm Becky St. Germaine.

1076
01:09:44,396 --> 01:09:46,261
And you know what else?

1077
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:49,200
You can eat me, you cracker.

1078
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,694
Who are you calling a cracker?

1079
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:55,963
- Back it up!
- Mama. Mama, please listen.

1080
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,108
I'm not the daughter you thought I was.

1081
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,110
I'm not popular.

1082
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,107
I've never pole-danced
and I didn't get into any sororities.

1083
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,276
Not even the lesbian one.

1084
01:10:09,722 --> 01:10:12,020
These are my friends.

1085
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:15,253
Mama, I'm plain.

1086
01:10:15,427 --> 01:10:17,918
There is nothing special about me.

1087
01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:20,497
Don't you ever say that again.

1088
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,133
Hello? You're on.

1089
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,201
We have to get out there, Ashley.

1090
01:10:24,904 --> 01:10:27,566
Go, go, go.

1091
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:30,641
Go, go, go.

1092
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:32,504
Oh, baby.

1093
01:10:32,678 --> 01:10:34,839
All right, get your butt up on that stage.

1094
01:10:35,214 --> 01:10:37,148
But keep your top on, all right?

1095
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,217
- Let's do it.
- Chip off the old block, that one is.

1096
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:44,288
Sevens are the team to beat. Let's see if
the next group of girls has what it takes.

1097
01:10:44,456 --> 01:10:48,187
Ladies and gentlemen, holler out
for Becky's Friendz. With a Z.

1098
01:10:48,627 --> 01:10:50,254
Yeah.

1099
01:10:50,429 --> 01:10:52,522
Thank you so much, everyone.

1100
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:58,330
Y'all, Lavonne's done. I'm so sorry.

1101
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,496
- Sorry, sorry.
- Go home!

1102
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:04,937
Forget about it.

1103
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:06,441
Get off the stage!

1104
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:09,874
Ladies.

1105
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:12,045
Judi.

1106
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:14,619
Let's do this.

1107
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:18,083
Two, three, four.

1108
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:28,485
What?

1109
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,553
You suck!

1110
01:13:36,929 --> 01:13:39,261
Hey. Hey, you know what, South Padre?

1111
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:42,423
We don't care what you think
because we're freaking awesome.

1112
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:44,694
Yeah, so smoke on that, spring break.

1113
01:13:45,938 --> 01:13:47,906
What's the matter, y'all?

1114
01:13:48,607 --> 01:13:50,541
Hey, all you regular girls, give it up.

1115
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,243
Clap, come on. Give it up.

1116
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:55,141
Yeah.

1117
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:58,110
We're not going anywhere.

1118
01:13:58,283 --> 01:13:59,944
And just wait till next year.

1119
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:08,017
And this is for Honey, my dead cat.

1120
01:14:09,094 --> 01:14:11,187
- Yeah!
- Give it up.

1121
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:16,693
<i>Dead cat, dead cat, dead cat.</i>

1122
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,894
<i>Dead cat, dead cat.</i>

1123
01:14:19,071 --> 01:14:21,801
Way to go, girls. Way to...

1124
01:14:23,742 --> 01:14:25,471
Becky.

1125
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,014
Ladies and gentlemen...

1126
01:14:30,182 --> 01:14:32,980
...the next vice president
of the United States of America...

1127
01:14:33,152 --> 01:14:35,586
...Senator Kay Bee Hartmann
and her daughter, Ashley.

1128
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:38,814
- We're gonna save the environment.
- Can you tell us about...?

1129
01:14:38,991 --> 01:14:41,619
Mason here, Ashley's best friend.

1130
01:14:42,628 --> 01:14:44,960
- I don't know her.
- Get that girl out of the shot.

1131
01:14:46,798 --> 01:14:49,961
Come on, ladies. Let's go.

1132
01:15:18,697 --> 01:15:20,164
Please don't hurt me.

1133
01:15:20,332 --> 01:15:22,994
Don't say anything, just listen.

1134
01:15:24,336 --> 01:15:28,102
I want you to know
that you've changed me.

1135
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:33,301
And not a day will go by when
I don't think about our time together.

1136
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:37,579
But you're so young...

1137
01:15:37,749 --> 01:15:40,377
...with so many dreams and years
ahead of you.

1138
01:15:42,154 --> 01:15:45,453
It could never work between us,
I know that now...

1139
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:50,288
...but always know
that you're in my soul.

1140
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:55,164
Wait.

1141
01:16:18,357 --> 01:16:20,086
Goodbye.

1142
01:16:52,891 --> 01:16:56,452
Oh, hey, you guys, let's take a picture
so we'll always remember this trip.

1143
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:58,994
- Charlene.
- Okay.

1144
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,299
Okay, all right.
Get together, y'all, all right.

1145
01:17:02,467 --> 01:17:07,632
- Ready? One, two...
- Cheese.

1146
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:15,112
Ashley will not be speaking
at a fundamentalist college, no.

1147
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,147
And also, we are focusing
on the family and the environment...

1148
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:21,286
...so you can tell those
anti-immigration dudes to shove it.

1149
01:17:21,653 --> 01:17:24,816
Oh, my God. I've only been
on eHarmony for two weeks...

1150
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:27,652
...and I already have
23 coffees lined up.

1151
01:17:27,826 --> 01:17:31,159
- You go, girl.
- Guys, are we making pizzas or what?

1152
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,491
- Oh, yeah.
- I gotta go.

1153
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:37,326
- You got me the mini pepperonis again.
- Put a smiley face on mine.

1154
01:17:37,502 --> 01:17:39,402
- That's really amazing.
- I'll do that too.

1155
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:41,436
Okay, guys, I got an idea.
Movie Numbers.

1156
01:17:41,606 --> 01:17:44,040
Only Movie Numbers Extreme.

1157
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:46,905
- Ooh!
- One to 20.

1158
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:50,173
Okay, I'll start, I'll start.
<i>It Happened One Night.</i>

1159
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:51,941
- <i>Basic Instinct 2.</i>
- Nice.

1160
01:17:52,117 --> 01:17:54,711
- <i>Three Men and a Little Lady.</i>
- I love Steve Guttenberg.

1161
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:58,822
- I love Steve Guttenberg.
- Okay. <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

1162
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,423
- <i>Nine to Five.</i>
- That's so good.

1163
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,753
That's three numbers, nine, two, five.
Okay.

1164
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,412
You're a pretty puppy.

1165
01:19:00,452 --> 01:19:05,014
This is really degrading to women.
Really.

1166
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:15,325
We're kind of like Laverne and Shirl.

1167
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,180
I can't... I can't...

1168
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,444
South Padre.

1169
01:19:38,757 --> 01:19:41,089
You know what this lawn chair
reminds me of?

1170
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:44,422
- What?
- The time I had sex on a lawn chair.

1171
01:19:44,596 --> 01:19:46,325
What?

1172
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:40,654
