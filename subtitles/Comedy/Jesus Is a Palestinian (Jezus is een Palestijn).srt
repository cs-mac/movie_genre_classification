1
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:05,805
Behold the handmaiden 
of the Lord,

2
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:10,211
may you be done unto me
according to your word.

3
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,168
The savior has been born.

4
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:30,709
This is my world!
I will not share it with an infant!

5
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:36,887
There is no room for two kings here!
Like a newborn scorpion under foot!

6
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:44,566
Kill them all!
Kill! Kill them all!

7
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,963
The slaughter of the innocents 
was in vain.

8
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:53,167
In the village of Nazareth,
the child Jesus, grew to manhood.

9
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:55,915
In Galilee, John the Baptist,

10
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:58,874
preached against the sinns sins
of Herod's successor.

11
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:02,538
I'm not afraid of your power 
on earth, Herod Antipas!

12
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:07,475
If I do not warn you, 
you will die in sin.

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,468
And the Lord will ask me 
to account for your life!

14
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:16,102
Arrest the prophet.
I demand that you arrest him!

15
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,041
Demand?

16
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:24,922
Demand? 
That's a strong word, my heart.

17
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:26,715
You must remember...

18
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:30,581
...John is right.

19
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:38,758
By the laws of Moses, 
we have sinned.

20
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:45,294
I am the voice of one 
crying in the wilderness,

21
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,466
make straight 
the way of the Lord.

22
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,971
Though the dust will returneth
to the earth as it must,

23
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:27,006
the spirit returneth unto God, David.

24
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:45,829
Mary, you'll be left alone.

25
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,253
They will run the shop.

26
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:05,967
Jesus, we have always known.

27
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:09,842
It was not for us 
that Jesus came to earth.

28
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,987
If only I could've stayed 
a little longer.

29
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,787
God's will be done.

30
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,676
Peace, Joseph.

31
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:47,543
To thine end, I command my spirit.

32
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:12,700
Out of my distress,
I cried to the Lord and He answered me.

33
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:15,339
I cried and He heard my voice.

34
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,886
I went down into the cities
underneath the earth,

35
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,602
to the peoples of the past,

36
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:33,846
but He lifted my life from the grave.

37
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:43,585
Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God,
the Lord is one.

38
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:54,380
Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God,
the Lord is one.

39
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:32,837
You are born into a new light
through your repentance...

40
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,630
...and the Lord forwards
His blessings on you!

41
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,325
The Lord rejoices in repented hearts.

42
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,870
Go in peace.

43
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:48,312
He will forgive you,
if you truly mean it in your heart.

44
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:56,518
Open up your eyes,
be ready for the coming of the kingdom.

45
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,184
Let your heart now be cleansed.

46
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:10,522
Forgive me, I have sinned.
Help me to be strong.

47
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:11,838
Be strong.

48
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,589
It is I who need baptism from you...

49
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,502
...and yet you come to me.

50
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,709
Let it be so.

51
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:08,175
We must fulfill all righteousness.

52
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:33,840
Lord, Eternal Father,
I hear your voice.

53
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,801
"This is my beloved Son,

54
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,005
in whom I am well pleased."

55
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,553
You are born into a new life,
true to your repentance,

56
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:15,179
and the Lord pours His blessings on you.

57
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:19,792
The Lord rejoices in repented hearts.

58
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,853
This water cleanses you.

59
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,327
Andrew. Philip.

60
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:46,852
Behold, the lamb of God,

61
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:53,880
who takes unto Himself
the sins of the world.

62
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,604
It is Him you must follow now, not me.

63
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,257
He must increase as I must decrease.

64
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,559
He has come to take us,
come with us please!

65
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,452
My time is over.

66
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:30,594
Mary! Mary!

67
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:34,185
- Mary! Mary! Mary!
- Mary!

68
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:39,193
Mary, your son is back!
He's at the synagogue.

69
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,543
He went straight
to the synagogue! I saw him!

70
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:57,627
And now our reading from the prophets.

71
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:02,129
The prophet Isaiah.
Now, who is... who is our reader?

72
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:03,788
It is my turn today, Rabbi.

73
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,347
Isn't that Joseph's son?

74
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:18,125
- Yes, Joseph the carpenter.
- The carpenter, God rest his soul.

75
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:35,910
The spirit of the Lord is upon me,

76
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,206
because He hath anointed me to give
good tidings to the poor.

77
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:46,336
He has sent me to heal
the broken hearted,

78
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:53,050
to preach deliverance to the captives,
to give sight to the blind,

79
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,346
and to set at liberty
them that are bruised.

80
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:02,637
To proclaim the acceptable
year of the Lord.

81
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,936
- Amen.
- Amen.

82
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:28,174
Today, in your hearing,

83
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,700
the scriptures are fulfilled.

84
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,635
The scriptures are fulfilled?

85
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:45,267
- Did he say fulfilled?
- How can he dare to say such a thing?

86
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,685
What do you mean?

87
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:52,982
The prophecy you have read can only
be fulfilled by the coming of the Messiah.

88
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:55,805
- Yes, he's right.
- By the coming of the kingdom of God.

89
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,959
The kingdom of God comes not
in a way foreseen by men.

90
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:04,826
Repent and believe the good news.

91
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:15,670
The kingdom of heaven, behold,
is suddenly upon you.

92
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:17,714
What?

93
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,082
Rabbi, take the scriptures 
away from him!

94
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,430
He is a blasphemer!

95
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,805
He shouldn't touch them
with his unclean hands!

96
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:44,739
I've heard things about you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

97
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:49,678
A prophet is never accepted
in his own country!

98
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:53,372
Who do you think you are?
John the Prophet?

99
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,958
You should be thrown 
out of this holy place!

100
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:01,922
Blessed is he who is not ashamed of me!

101
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:05,759
- Take this man out of here!
- Don't let him touch the holy scriptures!

102
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:15,558
Today, in our hearing,

103
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:20,370
the scriptures are fulfilled.

104
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,359
What... What's happened
inside the synagogue?

105
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,088
Let's go see!

106
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,716
Rabbi! You must stop them!
You cannot let this happen!

107
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,759
Rabbi! They don't understand
who this man is! Andrew!

108
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:59,633
Go away, go away!
Never come back to Nazareth!

109
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,936
- Don't let him go!
- Blasphemer!

110
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:04,564
Stone him to death!

111
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,524
Blasphemer!

112
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,177
That's what he deserves!

113
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,031
Don't let him go!

114
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,538
Master! Master!

115
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:25,375
Master!

116
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,626
We were told to make
ourselves known to you.

117
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:38,554
I am Andrew of Capernaum,
a fisherman by trade,

118
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,392
but your follower now,
if you'll take me.

119
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,354
This is Philip.

120
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:51,841
We were sent by John
the prophet, the Baptist.

121
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:57,864
He has just been imprisoned
by King Herod Antipas.

122
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,504
Andrew.

123
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,642
Philip.

124
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,439
Come with me.

125
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,568
Come on!

126
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:44,575
- Tell me, when was John arrested?
- As soon as he returned to Galilee.

127
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,828
He had to return. Too many people
were waiting for him...

128
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,838
There it is. The sea of Galilee
and Capernaum, where I was born.

129
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:04,628
It's a town of fishermen, but it also has
the greatest synagogue in Israel.

130
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,585
You can stay at my brother's house.

131
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,933
He's a good man, Simon Peter.

132
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:33,138
The commandments God gave
to Moses so long ago...

133
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,082
...must not remain dead stone
for the reverence of unthinking minds.

134
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,503
Dead stone? The tablets
of the law, dead stone?

135
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:44,387
- What do you mean, Rabbi?
- Stone is what the law is written on...

136
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:46,382
...but the law itself is alive!

137
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:50,374
And living things
are constantly changing.

138
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:51,969
But the law is eternal.

139
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,765
- You cannot change law of Moses.
- That's right, the law is here.

140
00:19:56,766 --> 00:20:00,466
The man is made
of flesh and blood, and he changes.

141
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,607
Doesn't he remain the same man?

142
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:08,510
God wants to write 
the law on your hearts.

143
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:13,211
Rabbi, you said you have come
here to give us the good news.

144
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,397
Is this it the good news?
That the law is living like a man?

145
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:25,643
The good news I bring you is this:
Your captivity is over.

146
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:30,507
But what does that mean,
our captivity is over? What captivity?

147
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,050
Captivity in sin!

148
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,890
God fulfills the promise
He made to our people Israel,

149
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,560
and reconciles Himself to man.

150
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:49,567
God is coming to you.

151
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,215
To all of you, 
even the most wretched.

152
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:04,710
Do not shut the door in His face.

153
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,677
Rabbi! The demon has always 
tried to throw him...

154
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,237
...into fire and into water 
to destroy him!

155
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:52,825
If you can do anything,
have mercy, help my poor faith!

156
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:08,974
Satan!

157
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,541
Leave him!

158
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,000
My son! My son!

159
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,819
Praise be the Lord!

160
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,422
Yes, we're all fishermen in our family.
Andrew here knows us well,

161
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:14,757
but I was sent off to learn.

162
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:17,213
All you were fit for, perhaps.

163
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:18,636
And what have you learned?

164
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:23,015
Well, hat two and two
make four, sometimes.

165
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:27,292
But most people seem
to be here to be pushed about,

166
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:30,420
that getting on is a fine thing,

167
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:33,836
that birth is the beginning of death.

168
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,156
But there must be something more
for man between birth and death.

169
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:49,998
Today, when I heard you preaching,
I began to understand, and it gave me hope.

170
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:56,129
Through your words,
the old scriptures seems to become alive!

171
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,333
That's all we want.
We want the Lord to be alive,

172
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:08,400
written in our hearts,
not carved in stone.

173
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,858
What is your name?

174
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,487
John, son of Zebedee.

175
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,824
John...

176
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:29,953
...stay with us.

177
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:36,333
Back, back! This way, you idiots!

178
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,090
That's my brother now, Simon Peter.

179
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,550
And there's my brother, James.

180
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,791
He's shouting again, angry as usual.

181
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,386
If anyone's drunk, it's you!

182
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:51,167
He doesn't mean it. He's a good man.

183
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:56,286
- What's the matter, brother? Poor catch?
- Poor catch? Nothing!

184
00:25:56,833 --> 00:26:00,084
The only things we catch
these days are Roman taxes!

185
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:04,194
And while we are out sweating,
working our hands raw on the nets,

186
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:08,780
the stinking tax gatherers
take half and give it to the Romans!

187
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,407
Bloodsuckers!

188
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:14,764
Go brother. Go and tell that leach,

189
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:19,041
that two-face
tax collector of ours, Matthew,

190
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,792
that if he wants more money out of me,
to put some fish in the lake.

191
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:26,590
Simon, this is the man 
I told you about.

192
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,843
The man John spoke of.
John the Baptist.

193
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,008
What? Another holy man?

194
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:37,636
Are you another of those
that tell us to be patient,

195
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,950
and promise us 
better times will be ahead?

196
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:44,981
What about now?
What about our children?

197
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,210
Who will fill their bellies?

198
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,072
A lot of talk these days
while we all starve!

199
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:58,160
Find a holy man who can put an end to that.
Then maybe I'll listen.

200
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,683
Go out again.

201
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:05,960
I shall come with you.

202
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:09,530
We've just pulled in!
Get the nets off the boat!

203
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,010
Please Simon, do as he says.

204
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,054
Why do you always listen to these people.
Who knows the lake better than I?

205
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,763
Please!

206
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,376
Please!

207
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,707
What are you staring at?

208
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:09,002
Come. You can preach to the fish.

209
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:14,314
Cast off! We're going out again.

210
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:57,163
We've been out all day
and we caught nothing!

211
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,165
He send us out again
and we catch all these fish!

212
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:03,113
It's a miracle!

213
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:07,338
It's not a miracle!
Only God can work miracles.

214
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,632
They speak these profanities,
they believe it!

215
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:12,554
We must go and speak to him!

216
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:30,080
My house cannot hold
anymore people!

217
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:34,713
Please! Please! Please!

218
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:46,827
Help me out! I can't get up!

219
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,884
It was amazing! 
I've been fishing for four years,

220
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,534
I've never seen a catch so big.

221
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,299
More.

222
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:37,721
So, there were miracles were they?

223
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,922
And a big catch inspired by a prophet,
what's his name, Jesus? Get out!

224
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:47,083
He's staying with Simon Peter.
You know him? The fisherman?

225
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:51,592
Yes. He owes me back taxes, 
doesn't he?

226
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,307
Move!

227
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,705
Well, well, well...

228
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,971
Well, if there's been a big catch,
he can pay, can't he?

229
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,175
The kingdom of heaven is like
a treasure hidden in a field.

230
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:24,346
A man finds it, and in his joy spends
everything he has to buy that field.

231
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:28,180
It's like a merchant
in search of fine pearls.

232
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,387
He finds one pearl of great value,
and sells everything to have that pearl.

233
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,383
You, you're all fisherman.

234
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:45,155
Well, the kingdom of heaven is like a net.
A great net thrown into the sea.

235
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,436
Suddenly it is filled!
It's almost bursting!

236
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:57,352
You have to call to the other
boats to come and help!

237
00:32:57,355 --> 00:33:01,264
Everybody is working
together, happy, excited!

238
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,598
It's a time for joy.

239
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:08,282
For rejoicing in what God
has freely given.

240
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,349
But one day...

241
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:21,805
...God will ask you to account
for the gift he has given.

242
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,719
Be prepared.

243
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:34,446
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

244
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:39,309
Rabbi. You say the kingdom
of heaven is at hand,

245
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:41,988
but when exactly will it come?

246
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,264
When you see the clouds
moving from the East,

247
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,070
you say the rain
is coming, and so it is.

248
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:56,008
When the desert wind blows,
you say it will be hot, and it is.

249
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:01,313
All of you can read the signs
of the earth and the sky.

250
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:09,139
How is it you can't read
the signs of the times?

251
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:17,035
The kingdom of heaven is here, now.

252
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:24,642
What's he doing here?

253
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,101
That's Matthew,
the tax collector! Get him out!

254
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,193
- Peter, your friend Matthew is here!
- Get out!

255
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,515
- Bloodsucking tax collector!
- There's no place for you here!

256
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:42,937
Out of my house! You scum! Filth!

257
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:46,200
- No Simon, don't! Simon, look!
- I will not have it defiled by you!

258
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:50,012
I hear you've had a big catch Simon!

259
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:52,770
We'll talk about it later, shall we?

260
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:58,316
But what about this friend of yours?

261
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,050
This new preacher
or teacher or whatever he is.

262
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,345
Am I not allowed to speak with him?

263
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:08,317
Not in my house!

264
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,896
You seem to be most unwelcome here.

265
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,803
I don't know your name,
but I know what you do.

266
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,145
Levi, or Matthew,
I'm known by both names.

267
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:28,524
And by others.

268
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:33,382
I see you and I must meet in a place
where both of us are welcome.

269
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:35,117
Is your own house far?

270
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:39,601
Why do you ask?

271
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:42,903
I should like to have
supper with you tonight.

272
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:55,423
You would enter 
the house of a sinner?

273
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:58,514
I would enter any house 
where I am welcome.

274
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:27,720
Wait! What are you doing?
Be careful, this is my property!

275
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:41,938
Help me. I've been this way 
for 20 years.

276
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:48,439
It is the curse of God, punishment
for my sins and for my parents' sins.

277
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,859
Your sins are forgiven you.

278
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:59,140
Rabbi, you must not speak so!

279
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:04,753
That's blasphemy.
Only God can forgive sins.

280
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:11,095
Which of these is easier,

281
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:17,167
to say your sins are forgiven you,
or rise up and walk home?

282
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:26,438
The Son of Man
has the power to forgive sins.

283
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:56,430
Rise and walk home.

284
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:09,853
He doesn't seem to realize the scandal
it would cause! Peter, you tell him!

285
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,898
I've told him.

286
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,509
Well, tell him again!
The whole place is talking about it!

287
00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:17,456
- Meeting some Pharisees, I suppose.
- Well, they know the law!

288
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:20,400
Tax collectors cannot even
enter the synagogue,

289
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,927
and anyone who associates
with them is as defiled as they are.

290
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,337
- Yes, according to the Pharisees!
- But yes.

291
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:26,670
Well, that's their argument.

292
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:30,403
- Peter, tell him again.
- I've told him! What do you want from me?

293
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:34,890
I said Matthew is my
bloodsucking enemy. I hate Matthew!

294
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:39,018
But all Jesus would say was,
"Well, why don't you join us as well?"

295
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:44,838
Andrew...

296
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:50,847
Andrew, I'm not like you.

297
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:55,094
I'm not a follower
of priests and prophets.

298
00:39:58,183 --> 00:40:02,488
I'm a fisherman.
I have my family to think of.

299
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:05,600
You followed the Baptist,
now follow this one.

300
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:07,691
- Peter!
- Just leave me alone!

301
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,376
Why did you bring him here to me?

302
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,639
This is my life.

303
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,402
My nets.

304
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:33,942
My boat.

305
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:40,272
Go on! Follow him...

306
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:43,220
...but leave me!

307
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,441
Come on. You can't talk to him
when he's like this.

308
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:51,261
Come on, Philip.

309
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,061
This is where I belong.

310
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:14,731
Master!

311
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:17,956
It's a scandal for you
to eat with these people!

312
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:19,008
Don't you know who they are?

313
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:22,143
We've lived our lives honorably.
Made sacrifices to keep the law.

314
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,306
They are thieves, whores, usurers.
Violent and godless people.

315
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:28,228
And now you sit
and eat with such people,

316
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:30,649
who spend their lives
in orgies and perversions!

317
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:34,222
I've not come to call the virtuous
to repentance, but the sinners,

318
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,354
and they might enter the kingdom
of heaven even before you.

319
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:41,022
Listen, Master! If you go and eat with
these people they will contaminate you.

320
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,054
The whole town will abandon you!

321
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:49,682
James, the heart of the Lord is mercy.

322
00:42:11,392 --> 00:42:12,764
He's here.

323
00:42:18,357 --> 00:42:19,399
Quiet!

324
00:42:21,568 --> 00:42:23,064
Peace be with you.

325
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:34,880
Thank you...

326
00:42:36,957 --> 00:42:38,417
...coming to my house.

327
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:45,560
Rabbi, you are welcome.

328
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:48,636
Welcome Rabbi.

329
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,731
- Move!
- No, no, no, don't move. I'll sit there.

330
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:03,407
Wine.

331
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:07,749
This is my brother James.
He's in the same business as I am.

332
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,132
I drink to you in the name of all here.

333
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:47,261
Rabbi, we want to hear your words.

334
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:49,300
- Please speak to us!
- Yes!

335
00:43:49,317 --> 00:43:51,270
No, no, no, no, no!
Let's eat first!

336
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,612
No! Let him decide.

337
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,372
No, no.

338
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:08,612
I'd like to tell you a story.

339
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:11,550
Sit down! Sit down!

340
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:23,526
A certain man had two sons.

341
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,772
And one day the younger
of these sons said to his father,

342
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:32,559
"Give me my share of your estate now."

343
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:37,305
So his father divided his wealth
between his two sons.

344
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:40,164
And a few days later,

345
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,956
this younger son 
set off for a distant land,

346
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:50,115
and there he squandered
all the money he had on riotous living.

347
00:44:53,544 --> 00:45:00,446
Now, not long after this,
a great famine swept over the land,

348
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:03,770
and the boy began to starve.

349
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,465
He persuaded a farmer
to hire him to feed his pigs,

350
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,929
but he was so hungry that even
the husks he was feeding the swine...

351
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,176
...began to look good to him.

352
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:17,770
And still, nobody gave him anything.

353
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:26,385
Finally, the boy came to his senses.

354
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:29,539
"At home...

355
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:37,221
...even my father's servants
have enough food, and to spare.

356
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:41,475
And here I am starving to death.

357
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:50,609
I will go home, and ask my father
to hire me as one of his servants."

358
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,862
And so, he set off.

359
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,985
Now he was still some
distance from his home...

360
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,135
...when his father saw him coming,

361
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:15,105
and he was so filled with compassion,

362
00:46:17,415 --> 00:46:25,137
that he ran towards his son
and embraced him and kissed him.

363
00:46:26,673 --> 00:46:30,886
The boy said, "Father! I have sinned
against Heaven and you.

364
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:33,887
I am not worthy
to be called your son."

365
00:46:35,557 --> 00:46:39,309
But his father called
for the servants and said,

366
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,553
"Bring me the finest robe
in the house and put it on him.

367
00:46:42,896 --> 00:46:45,858
Put rings on his hands
and shoes on his feet!

368
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:50,465
Kill the fatted calf,
we must celebrate with a feast.

369
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,520
My son was dead...

370
00:46:58,738 --> 00:47:00,175
...and is alive again!"

371
00:47:07,462 --> 00:47:12,701
Now, the older brother 
at this time...

372
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,655
...was working in the fields,

373
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:23,681
and as he came back to the house,
he heard the noise of music and dancing.

374
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:27,809
He called for one of the servants
and asked what was happening,

375
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:31,516
and he was told.

376
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,396
At this, the older brother
became very angry,

377
00:47:39,808 --> 00:47:41,689
and he refused to go into the house.

378
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:46,680
The father came out, tried to plead
with him, but he wouldn't listen.

379
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,259
"I have worked for you
all this time, all these years,

380
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,888
and never once have I disobeyed you!

381
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:57,392
And in all that time, you've never even
give me so much as a goat...

382
00:47:57,393 --> 00:47:59,431
...so that I could have
a feast with my friends.

383
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:06,011
My younger brother comes back,
having spent all your money on harlots,

384
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:09,360
and for him you kill the fatted calf!"

385
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:13,987
"Please," said the father.

386
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,473
"Please, try to understand.

387
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:30,245
You are always with me,
everything I have is yours.

388
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,015
But it is right to celebrate.

389
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:39,348
Your brother was dead...

390
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,680
...and is alive again.

391
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:57,847
He was lost, and is found."

392
00:49:16,124 --> 00:49:17,558
Forgive me master.

393
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:21,712
I am...

394
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,102
I'm just a stupid man.

395
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,848
Free the man! He is innocent!

396
00:50:30,854 --> 00:50:32,100
He's a man of God!

397
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,678
Free John the Prophet!

398
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:51,564
Free the man!

399
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:06,590
John!

400
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:09,294
John?

401
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:15,267
What is it you want from me?

402
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:23,013
Is it just a matter of my
violating the marriage vows?

403
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:26,062
Is that it?

404
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:32,154
Because I don't mind
to repent that, John.

405
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:36,860
Will that satisfy you?

406
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:47,804
You think it makes me happy
to see you rotting away...

407
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:51,053
...in the dark down there with
a howling gang outside the walls?

408
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:54,852
Why don't you listen to reason?

409
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:03,020
There's work for you here
in this wretched kingdom.

410
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:07,351
If it's power you want,
you can have power.

411
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:12,732
Power to build, not to break.

412
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:28,732
My task has been to prepare the way
for the one who shall wear the crown.

413
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:33,886
Who is this man? This prophet from Galilee?
Is he the one I ought to be talking to?

414
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:40,178
Do not fear the toppling 
of your throne.

415
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:44,434
Before kingdoms change...

416
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:49,904
...men must change.

417
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:52,388
Ah, you say that, yes,

418
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,651
but I've been listening
to those fools outside.

419
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:58,314
What leaders intend
and what their followers are after...

420
00:52:58,317 --> 00:52:59,727
...are not one and the same thing.

421
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:04,602
That crowd of yours needs
someone to control it.

422
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:11,148
John, if I set you free,

423
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,848
what would you do with your freedom?

424
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:26,609
I would follow the one
whose way I have prepared,

425
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:30,358
just like many others
who already follow Him.

426
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:40,179
But you will not set me free.

427
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,179
Herod...

428
00:54:21,408 --> 00:54:22,451
...I was wrong.

429
00:54:23,702 --> 00:54:24,745
Yes...

430
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:27,734
...I was wrong.

431
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:31,017
The curse of God is upon us.

432
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:35,395
Release John.

433
00:54:38,466 --> 00:54:43,064
Yes, send him away. Send him away.
Send him to Egypt. You're right.

434
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:46,608
What harm can 
he do us there, after all.

435
00:54:49,017 --> 00:54:51,524
Yes, tomorrow.

436
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:54,820
Yes, tomorrow on your birthday.

437
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:59,427
What better present could you give
to yourself and your people?

438
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:02,763
A great gesture of clemency.

439
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,636
I see! I see!

440
00:55:39,815 --> 00:55:44,059
Oh, what a remarkable woman you are!
How quickly your heart changes!

441
00:55:45,362 --> 00:55:48,429
Once he was free,
and had gone to Egypt,

442
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:52,181
he just might meet with
some unfortunate accident.

443
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:04,730
What imagination, my king.
How fast your thoughts travel.

444
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:10,013
Imagination? You know
I can always read your mind.

445
00:56:10,014 --> 00:56:12,816
Don't forget I can read
your mind too, my lord.

446
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:17,341
Herod...

447
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:22,863
...what present shall
I give you on your birthday?

448
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,405
What do you think I would like most?

449
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:33,574
Salome.

450
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:48,171
You see, I can read your mind.

451
00:56:56,887 --> 00:57:00,585
- Welcome to our shores!
- Come save us!

452
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:03,143
Come save us!

453
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:45,348
Take her away. Back to Capernaum.

454
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:20,919
Do no think I have come
to bring peace on earth.

455
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:24,334
I've come not to bring peace...

456
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,006
...but a sword.

457
00:59:34,202 --> 00:59:37,949
I have come to sow discord
between a man and his father,

458
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:40,672
between a daughter and her mother.

459
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:43,466
A man's enemies...

460
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:48,840
...will be members of his own family.

461
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:59,512
You may say, "We have left our belongings
to become your followers."

462
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:04,088
I tell you this:
Anyone who has left home,

463
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:10,167
or father, mother, wife,

464
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:16,390
children, land, 
for the kingdom of God...

465
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:20,975
...shall be rewarded
a hundred times over... on earth,

466
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:23,779
and inherit
the kingdom of God.

467
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,142
Whoever wants 
to save his life will lose it,

468
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:32,086
but if a man will lose
his life for my sake...

469
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:35,087
...and for the gospel 
I bring you, he will save it.

470
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:39,305
For many that are first will be last,

471
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,014
and the last first.

472
01:00:46,228 --> 01:00:49,458
So do not store up
for yourselves treasures on earth,

473
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:53,336
where it grows rusty and moth-eaten
and thieves break in to steal it.

474
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,638
Store up treasure in Heaven,

475
01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:59,295
for where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.

476
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:04,882
My name is Jairus. I am one
of the elders of the synagogue here.

477
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,599
My little daughter is dying.

478
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:15,587
I beg you, come and lay your hands
on her so that she may be cured and live.

479
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,518
Take me to her.

480
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:44,157
You're daughter is dead.

481
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:53,380
Do not weep.

482
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:56,460
The child is not dead.

483
01:02:00,256 --> 01:02:01,308
Only sleeping.

484
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,929
Who are you to come
here with your jokes?

485
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:11,308
We've seen that
she's dead, you haven't!

486
01:02:12,339 --> 01:02:14,352
Peace Thomas, peace.

487
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:09,500
Talitha kumi.

488
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:22,791
Rise, little girl.

489
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:07,917
Give her something to eat.

490
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,257
She's alive! She's alive! She's alive!

491
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,896
Rabbi, I want to apologize.

492
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:57,786
I didn't know who you were.

493
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:01,383
But I thought the child was dead.

494
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:07,776
Well, she was dead!
I saw her with my own eyes.

495
01:05:09,516 --> 01:05:11,909
Can't you believe
without seeing, Thomas?

496
01:05:15,022 --> 01:05:16,147
Sometimes I do.

497
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:22,612
Sometimes I think
I know what I believe, but...

498
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:28,901
...something happens,
my mind gets blurred and...

499
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,454
...I don't know.

500
01:05:34,748 --> 01:05:36,953
To doubt so much,
you must want to be certain.

501
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,503
I do!

502
01:05:42,156 --> 01:05:43,549
Then follow me.

503
01:05:49,762 --> 01:05:53,057
You mean, give up my work and...

504
01:05:53,058 --> 01:05:54,408
Yes.

505
01:05:56,538 --> 01:06:00,200
Jairus, will you give me your servant
to be one of my disciples?

506
01:06:01,899 --> 01:06:05,207
With gladness, master.
I am happy for him.

507
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:15,153
Do you have doubts
about following me, Thomas?

508
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:18,999
No.

509
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:24,753
I don't believe I have.

510
01:06:52,812 --> 01:06:53,813
Women.

511
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,985
I ask you, why would they listen?

512
01:07:02,904 --> 01:07:05,025
I told my wife
I won't be away for long.

513
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,358
In any case, the fishing
is hopeless why not go away.

514
01:07:13,122 --> 01:07:18,492
I told her. I said,
I'll come back in the spring.

515
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:23,370
Don't lie to her, and to yourself.

516
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:26,051
Lie?

517
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:30,054
Yes. You know very well...

518
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:32,765
...you'll never go back.

519
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,274
I will.

520
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:44,901
No you won't.

521
01:07:48,203 --> 01:07:49,823
Never.

522
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,452
You'll never fish again.

523
01:07:56,016 --> 01:07:57,292
You'll never get drunk again.

524
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:04,754
And you'll never go back
to Capernaum again.

525
01:08:07,744 --> 01:08:08,966
None of us will.

526
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,220
We'll never be the same.

527
01:08:17,282 --> 01:08:20,647
And neither will the lives
of everyone in the whole world.

528
01:08:26,858 --> 01:08:28,318
We know why, Simon.

529
01:08:40,061 --> 01:08:43,909
We are the first to know.

530
01:09:26,247 --> 01:09:28,874
The ruthless shall be no more!

531
01:09:29,488 --> 01:09:31,794
The arrogant shall cease to be!

532
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,172
Remember the words 
of the scriptures!

533
01:09:35,173 --> 01:09:39,342
Vanity of vanities. All is vanity!

534
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:43,903
Woe unto them that seek to do evil!

535
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,101
Woe unto them that call
evil good, and good evil.

536
01:09:48,121 --> 01:09:52,230
Woe unto them that
are wise in their own eyes!

537
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:21,925
Have you not known?

538
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,594
Have you not heard?

539
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:28,472
Hath it not been told you
from the beginning?

540
01:10:29,348 --> 01:10:33,615
Have you not understood from
the foundations of the earth?

541
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,942
Music! Music! Music!

542
01:11:45,962 --> 01:11:50,398
Go to him. Go. Remember.

543
01:12:22,537 --> 01:12:25,856
Dance, Salome.

544
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:30,274
Dance.

545
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:39,188
When I've danced,
what will you give me?

546
01:12:42,369 --> 01:12:44,526
Whatever thou shall ask of me,

547
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:51,274
I will give to thee,
unto the half of my kingdom.

548
01:13:20,026 --> 01:13:21,051
My friends!

549
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,972
The princess is going to dance.

550
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,820
Was that anything?

551
01:16:46,828 --> 01:16:47,917
Yes.

552
01:16:50,998 --> 01:16:51,999
Anything.

553
01:16:56,336 --> 01:17:00,799
I want the head of the Baptist.

554
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:10,916
Oh... no!

555
01:17:12,685 --> 01:17:14,144
You promised.

556
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:19,984
Yes, you promised!
You promised, yes!

557
01:17:21,902 --> 01:17:23,320
You swore, my Lord...

558
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:27,235
...before all your guests.

559
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:31,946
Shall it be said that king Herod
does not keep his promises?

560
01:17:43,235 --> 01:17:49,219
King Herod, you said anything.
Yes, you promised! Yes, you promised!

561
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:55,872
A king will rule
in righteousness,

562
01:17:56,220 --> 01:18:00,259
and princes 
will rule in justice,

563
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:06,410
and the eyes of those that 
will not see will not be closed,

564
01:18:06,692 --> 01:18:09,643
and their works are
in the dark and they say,

565
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:13,210
"Who seeth us?
Who knoweth us?"

566
01:18:13,211 --> 01:18:18,356
Oh, woe unto them! 
Woe unto them!

567
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:55,744
His head, sheared off 
like a rabbit's,

568
01:18:57,173 --> 01:18:59,573
and given as a present
to the dancing girl.

569
01:19:00,718 --> 01:19:04,865
Only by killing him could Herod
hope to silence his voice,

570
01:19:07,015 --> 01:19:08,811
but I can still hear him.

571
01:19:11,102 --> 01:19:12,531
We must avenge him.

572
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:15,900
Revenge, bad politics my friend.

573
01:19:17,108 --> 01:19:18,988
Suppose we kill Herod,
who will replace him?

574
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:25,694
I'll tell you, another servant of Tiberius,
a Roman procurate like Pontius Pilate.

575
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,397
So what should we do then? Submit?

576
01:19:28,452 --> 01:19:31,283
Or become soldiers of Rome like
the Syrians or the Greeks?

577
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:37,986
No, the Romans must know
they can never rule Galilee with ease.

578
01:19:38,628 --> 01:19:41,082
Oh, I know but for the present
we strike in the dark.

579
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,914
The time will come when God
shall send us our leader.

580
01:19:45,301 --> 01:19:47,275
Then we shall make open war.

581
01:19:52,349 --> 01:19:54,198
You mean a real war?

582
01:19:55,435 --> 01:19:59,441
The people of Israel, alone,
against the Roman empire?

583
01:20:01,316 --> 01:20:04,485
Brothers, this is Judas Iscariot.
I've asked him to talk to you.

584
01:20:04,486 --> 01:20:06,834
You should here what he has
to say about Jesus of Nazareth.

585
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,821
Jesus of Nazareth? 
Do you know him?

586
01:20:11,409 --> 01:20:14,564
Oh, I've heard him preach many times,

587
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:19,300
and I have seen
the kind of power that he has.

588
01:20:24,879 --> 01:20:27,818
Is he the man to place our hopes on?

589
01:20:28,269 --> 01:20:30,437
Why do you ask me this question?
John answered it.

590
01:20:31,469 --> 01:20:32,987
Remember what the Baptist said?

591
01:20:34,055 --> 01:20:36,700
I bear witness that this is the man.

592
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:41,028
Tell all my friends
and disciples to follow him,

593
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:44,420
and proclaim in His name
the kingdom of heaven.

594
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,404
We know that, we know that.

595
01:20:47,484 --> 01:20:54,495
But could he be the one, priest and king,
who will lead our people Israel?

596
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:57,410
Could he be the Messiah
promised by our Lord?

597
01:20:57,785 --> 01:21:04,626
I believe that if one day the people
of Israel do find a Messiah...

598
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:11,321
...oh, yes, it will be him.

599
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,266
But, no, I beg of you,
let him fulfill his mission.

600
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:22,567
That is my advice.

601
01:21:26,188 --> 01:21:27,230
I intend to follow him,

602
01:21:29,106 --> 01:21:34,737
and I hope, if he will accept me,
become a disciple.

603
01:21:37,615 --> 01:21:41,767
Very well, Judas.
Will you keep in touch with us?

604
01:21:47,707 --> 01:21:48,713
If you wish.

605
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:09,937
Peace be on you, John.
Though your blood cries out for revenge,

606
01:22:10,813 --> 01:22:14,235
may your soul find rest
in the glory of the righteous.

607
01:22:18,486 --> 01:22:19,654
May peace be with you John.

608
01:22:20,613 --> 01:22:21,823
Eternal peace, John.

609
01:22:23,283 --> 01:22:24,742
Eternal peace on your soul, John.

610
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:27,453
May your soul find eternal peace.

611
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,980
We shall not forget you, John.

612
01:22:39,548 --> 01:22:40,799
Peace be on you, John.

613
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,518
You stupid idiots! Go on, go away!

614
01:23:31,519 --> 01:23:35,195
You mind your mother's business
crazy... and your sister's!

615
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:42,442
Get out of here! Get out!

616
01:23:43,523 --> 01:23:46,409
- Get away! Get out of here.
- Can't I come in for a minute?

617
01:23:53,436 --> 01:23:55,073
Can I come in for a minute, too?

618
01:23:58,402 --> 01:24:00,023
Come.

619
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:22,082
You pigs! Don't you come
near me anymore! I'll kill you!

620
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:24,240
What is it? What's going on?

621
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,785
Ask your pigs over there,
those big, brave sons of yours.

622
01:24:29,994 --> 01:24:31,327
Amon!

623
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:36,435
There's no peace in this neighborhood
since you came here. Noise and filth.

624
01:24:37,397 --> 01:24:39,100
The curse of God is on you.

625
01:24:47,243 --> 01:24:50,539
Don't worry, Mary.
They're only boys' games.

626
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:55,065
Ah, boys, they would only burn
my house down. The fathers...

627
01:24:57,268 --> 01:24:58,777
...they're all against me.

628
01:24:59,488 --> 01:25:03,774
Not all, Mary. There's a friend
of yours in town today.

629
01:25:03,861 --> 01:25:06,607
- I have no friends.
- Oh, yes, you have!

630
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:11,560
Jesus, the prophet!
Friend of our God, forgiver of sins.

631
01:25:11,829 --> 01:25:14,450
Hey, according to him,

632
01:25:15,526 --> 01:25:18,527
the sins of the flesh are nothing
compared to the sins of the soul.

633
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:32,904
A man will always forgive a man,
but a woman's sin, that's another story.

634
01:25:33,735 --> 01:25:35,703
For most people, but not for him.

635
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:37,985
I've never seen anybody like him.

636
01:25:38,942 --> 01:25:40,167
Have you seen him often?

637
01:25:40,817 --> 01:25:43,442
If you go around on business like me,
you can't help seeing him.

638
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:47,398
Turn a corner, cross a square,
go into a camp, there he is!

639
01:25:49,175 --> 01:25:50,229
Come on.

640
01:25:52,153 --> 01:25:55,695
He might be here for another year.
I'm sure you'll come across him.

641
01:25:55,696 --> 01:25:57,740
Oh, I sleep during 
the daytime, don't I?

642
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:00,488
Sorry, I forgot.

643
01:26:01,363 --> 01:26:04,616
Well, a big crowd
is following him in everywhere.

644
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:07,106
Sometimes so big
he has to sleep in the field.

645
01:26:09,196 --> 01:26:12,232
He thinks nothing of eating 
and drinking with thieves and whores.

646
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:15,565
Any scum of the earth
is good enough for him, eh?

647
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:20,240
One of his disciples, 
as they call themselves, was a...

648
01:26:20,265 --> 01:26:22,675
...a tax collector, devious one.

649
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,114
But this Jesus,

650
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:32,406
well, he says it's not the righteous
that need him, it's the sinners.

651
01:26:32,407 --> 01:26:34,368
So you see, you have got a friend.

652
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:49,151
- What about next week?
- Go on.

653
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,789
Look!

654
01:28:04,775 --> 01:28:08,107
There's Joseph of Arimathea.
One of the leading Pharisees in Jerusalem.

655
01:28:09,358 --> 01:28:14,553
Which of you, for all his worrying,
can add one day to his life,

656
01:28:15,107 --> 01:28:17,284
one inch to his stature.

657
01:28:18,731 --> 01:28:22,488
So don't concern yourselves
so much with the means of life,

658
01:28:23,653 --> 01:28:25,773
what you shall eat and drink,

659
01:28:27,192 --> 01:28:31,939
or with your bodies
and how they should be clothed.

660
01:28:34,775 --> 01:28:37,279
Life is more than clothing.

661
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,244
Consider the birds of the air,

662
01:28:41,244 --> 01:28:44,997
they do not sow, or reap,
or gather into bonds,

663
01:28:44,998 --> 01:28:46,956
but our Heavenly Father feeds them.

664
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:53,210
Will He all the more feed you?
Are you not worth more than they?

665
01:28:56,897 --> 01:28:59,245
Consider the lilies of the field.

666
01:29:02,108 --> 01:29:03,702
They do not spin,

667
01:29:04,864 --> 01:29:06,648
they do not weave,

668
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:14,997
but not even Solomon, in all his glory,
was so arrayed as one of these.

669
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:19,398
Now if God so clothe
the grass of the field,

670
01:29:19,399 --> 01:29:22,064
which is here today and tomorrow
thrown into the fire,

671
01:29:22,756 --> 01:29:25,774
will he not 
all the more clothe you...

672
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:30,393
...who have so little faith?

673
01:29:36,728 --> 01:29:41,150
Therefore do not ask, 
"What should we eat?

674
01:29:43,192 --> 01:29:44,710
What should we drink?

675
01:29:46,779 --> 01:29:49,196
How should we dress ourselves?"

676
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:55,483
It is only the faithless
who set their hearts on these things.

677
01:29:57,205 --> 01:30:00,815
You must first seek the kingdom
of God and His righteousness,

678
01:30:00,816 --> 01:30:03,618
and everything will be
added freely unto to you.

679
01:30:04,463 --> 01:30:07,609
So do not be anxious about tomorrow.

680
01:30:11,344 --> 01:30:14,023
Tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

681
01:30:19,685 --> 01:30:23,982
Let the day's own trouble
be sufficient for the day.

682
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:34,060
Extraordinary.
But isn't that taking it too far?

683
01:30:34,824 --> 01:30:38,914
Well, surely our religion
isn't opposed to honest hard work.

684
01:30:39,037 --> 01:30:43,948
Imagine what he says has been said
by the prophets, but not like this.

685
01:30:43,999 --> 01:30:45,397
I agree with you.

686
01:30:46,669 --> 01:30:50,366
But we can't be sure until
we meet with him face to face.

687
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,360
Why not invite him to eat with us?

688
01:30:54,176 --> 01:30:56,401
- Would he come?
- I'm sure he would.

689
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:59,385
Such a man must be willing 
to discuss his ideas with...

690
01:31:00,092 --> 01:31:02,209
...people who are open-minded.

691
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:43,097
Good master!

692
01:31:48,101 --> 01:31:52,492
Please, tell me, master,
what must I do to have eternal life?

693
01:32:01,822 --> 01:32:07,146
Go and sell all you have
and give it to the poor,

694
01:32:09,288 --> 01:32:11,226
and you shall have treasure in Heaven.

695
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:16,004
Then, come and follow me.

696
01:32:17,211 --> 01:32:21,743
Sell Everything? Everything I own?

697
01:32:23,301 --> 01:32:25,901
Everything my father slaved for?

698
01:32:28,264 --> 01:32:34,439
Everything. You cannot serve
two masters, God and money.

699
01:32:54,956 --> 01:32:56,006
You see...

700
01:32:58,361 --> 01:33:00,911
...it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle,

701
01:33:00,913 --> 01:33:03,421
than for a rich man
to enter the Kingdom of God.

702
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:43,979
Master, may I speak with you?

703
01:33:55,887 --> 01:33:57,525
What is your name, my son?

704
01:33:58,265 --> 01:33:59,964
My name is Judas Iscariot.

705
01:34:02,019 --> 01:34:04,217
Or call me a scholar. 
The State finds use for...

706
01:34:04,217 --> 01:34:06,850
...I read and write...
Hebrew, Greek, Latin. I...

707
01:34:07,649 --> 01:34:09,321
I translate documents.

708
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:15,521
This has become
a country of many tongues.

709
01:34:26,499 --> 01:34:28,527
Now I have never beaten copper,

710
01:34:30,105 --> 01:34:35,239
nor carved wood nor caught
fish as your men have, but...

711
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:38,814
...I know your men.

712
01:34:49,605 --> 01:34:52,947
My father was 
a prosperous builder who said,

713
01:34:52,949 --> 01:34:56,735
"My son must never have calluses
on his hands, nor brick dust in his hair.

714
01:34:56,737 --> 01:34:59,901
My money must make 
my son into a scholar."

715
01:35:03,409 --> 01:35:07,984
Well, behold, a scholar
who wishes to serve you.

716
01:35:21,051 --> 01:35:24,903
But do you need a man like me?

717
01:35:43,281 --> 01:35:45,752
The tree is known by it's fruit.

718
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:50,926
Come...

719
01:35:53,063 --> 01:35:54,412
...stay with us.

720
01:36:24,752 --> 01:36:28,677
And now some scenes 
from Jesus of Nazareth Part III...

721
01:36:28,895 --> 01:36:31,037
...which shall be presented
tomorrow night.

722
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:33,460
I can see! I can see!

723
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:38,127
Jesus of Nazareth, he cured the blind man!
Jesus of Nazareth...

724
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:43,691
Your faith has saved you.

725
01:36:43,721 --> 01:36:46,174
Go, and sin no more.

726
01:36:47,256 --> 01:36:49,748
But the Romans have butchered 
hundreds of innocent people,

727
01:36:49,748 --> 01:36:50,927
young people, old people,

728
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:53,255
lives ended without mercy, 
without trial.

729
01:36:54,087 --> 01:36:56,508
We must meet 
the sword with the sword!

730
01:36:56,550 --> 01:37:00,462
All who take up the sword
shall perish by the sword!

731
01:37:00,921 --> 01:37:05,379
Jerusalem, the faithful city,

732
01:37:06,213 --> 01:37:11,970
she that was full of justice,
has become a harlot!
