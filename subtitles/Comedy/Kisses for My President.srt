So, it was you.

The secret agent that
sneaked into our organization.

27

A secret agent?

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,035
Seeing that you're having
a rendezvous with a retired agent,

29
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:11,705
you must be pretty desperate.

You still got skills.

But sorry.

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,035
I exposed your identity.
Let's go to a safe house now.

I think I fell into their trap.

50
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,005
It's been awhile since we last met...
I'm sorry.

- How's your current job working out?
- Why are you doing such a dangerous job?

53
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:59,335
My job now is fine.

54
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,830
But why are you doing something so dangerous?

55
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,555
Those were my exact words to you

56
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,165
when I was your team leader
at headquarters.

57
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:17,495
I guess...

58
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:20,925
I feel responsible?

59
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,175
Because of this sense of responsibility
to protect someone,

60
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:29,250
I said

61
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:33,500
Ah...because you feel responsible.

62
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:40,071
Was I a brave person?

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,835
Brave?

64
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,410
You were reckless.

65
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,305
To the point I regretted hiring you.

66
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,415
I had no idea I could be such a person...

67
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,450
If I hadn't...

68
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:57,820
If...

69
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,575
If I hadn't fallen in love with you,

70
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,440
we might still be working together.

71
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,645
That's why I had to let you go.

72
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,410
I'm sorry for getting you involved again.

73
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,910
I didn't know who I could trust at headquarters,

74
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,680
so I came looking for you.

75
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:51,570
I won't show up in your life again.

76
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,895
Please don't go...

77
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,160
I mean...

78
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,980
You're still bleeding.

79
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,380
At least wait until
the bleeding stops.

80
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,250
I think it was stupid of me to leave you.

81

Even if I have to risk my life ,

82
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,110
I'll protect you by your side.

83
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,180
The person who'll risk his life to love me...

84
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,110
is this person...

85
