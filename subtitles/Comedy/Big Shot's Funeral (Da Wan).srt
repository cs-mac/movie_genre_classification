00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:18,155
In Ancient China

3
00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:21,887
China was divided into many small states

4
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,920
Each state invaded the other

5
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:26,905
Society was in chaos

6
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:36,459
There were 7 major warring nations vying for power -
Qing, Chu, Han, Zhao, Wei, Qi, and Yan

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,146
100 years later

8
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:43,375
A number of small states were annexed

9
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,566
Han and Zhao were the first and last
to be defeated by Qing respectively

10
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:03,778
In 227 BC

11
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,720
Troops from Wei marched against Liang

12
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:11,709
The battle took place at the Phoenix mountains

13
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:13,577
The 2 armies clashed fiercely

14
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:18,436
In total 3000 lives were lost
Both armies were annihilated

15
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,294
San Lang!

16
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:57,188
San Lang...

17
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,452
Guess you're not as lucky as I am

18
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,084
General!

19
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,562
Who are you?

20
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:28,533
I'm a Liang soldier!

21
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:23,023
On the great road to my home

22
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:30,072
at the foot of Mount Liang

23
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:37,689
5 acres of fertile land

24
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,464
It's rather good

25
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:45,477
5 acres of fields to farm

26
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:53,639
Let me tell you something

27
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,301
When I was a kid, I caught
a wild pig but my dad let it go

28
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,030
You know why?

29
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,084
Because the pig was pregnant

30
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you pregnant?

31
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:09,367
You know, you're my slave now

32
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,146
You're not seriously injured

33
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,632
Hmm, you're bleeding a little too much

34
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:21,595
This medicine is a family recipe

35
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,471
we don't normally share it with outsiders

36
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,598
Does it hurt?

37
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,584
Well, it'll hurt a lot more now

38
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,154
Young man, don't get so worked up

39
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,047
You can't die on me

40
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:42,078
No cussing please

41
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,266
My father once told me

42
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,824
Scratch if you're itchy, and smile if you're unlucky

43
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,371
Good advice

44
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:29,905
General

45
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,866
Lieutenant Fu

46
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,176
Yes sir

47
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,812
Stand down

48
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,263
Why are you here?

49
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:43,829
To pursue and kill the Liang soldiers

50
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:49,795
How many have you killed?

51
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:51,955
Say something!

52
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,217
One

53
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,299
I expect my men to be aggressive in battle

54
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,038
Liang troops were aggressive, hard to defend against them

55
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,544
We must be prepared to die for the country at any time

56
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,180
I hope, General, that you remember that I rescued you

57
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:01,421
You know how we deal with deserters?

58
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,556
General, the army was destroyed last night

59
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:09,265
I'm still here! It's not destroyed!

60
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,553
We were ambushed last night

61
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,932
Maybe you're the spy?

62
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,171
You are ruthless!

63
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,928
He tried to rescue you, but you killed him!

64
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,101
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,155
He's right, you know

66
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:39,311
Your army is destroyed

67
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:40,994
Kill me then

68
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,097
I don't kill slaves

69
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,221
But, if you start begging now

70
00:08:46,364 --> 00:08:47,718
I might even let you go

71
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,690
Kill me!

72
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:52,555
You really want to die?

73
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,749
Ok, I'll help you

74
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,414
Such a waste

75
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:04,911
I was not able to defeat the Liang army

76
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,993
You want to die?

77
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,188
I won't let you die even if you wanted to!

78
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,797
Master Wen, this time we've succeeded

79
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:54,623
He said if he will find peace in death on the battlefield

80
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,166
Your kind of soldiers are deserters

81
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,267
No, I'm the kind of soldier that feigns death

82
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,370
My father once told me that
there is no shame in fearing death

83
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,772
but to die a useless death is humiliating

84
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,492
I pity that soldier, San Lang

85
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:04,709
I told him to feign death, but he refused

86
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:05,879
How much am I worth?

87
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,236
There's no harm in telling you

88
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,616
A live enemy General is worth 5 acres

89
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,112
5 whole acres!

90
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:12,655
I have a piece of jade around my waist

91
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,436
How much is this broken piece of rock worth?

92
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,211
A lot

93
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,429
I accept our introduction gift, General

94
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,995
but I still do not believe you

95
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:32,111
He's one of ours, and he's still alive!

96
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:35,516
We were betrayed

97
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,047
Anyone home?

98
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:58,017
Anyone here?

99
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,039
Men! Bring on the food and drink!

100
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,841
Is that how you nobles say it?

101
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,593
How dare you! Execute him!

102
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:33,940
There's nothing to eat

103
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:57,583
General, spare me!

104
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,050
General, show mercy!

105
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,944
There were 2000 infantry and archers in the Liang army

106
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,001
They used 1000 infantry troops to ambush us

107
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,055
Both sides were destroyed

108
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,164
This is the sword I gave him

109
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:22,870
Where is he?

110
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:24,784
I believe we will find him

111
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,793
Wu..

112
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,255
If he is alive...

113
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,640
There's a war going on

114
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,999
Where can you take refuge in?

115
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,796
General, have you heard of the Magic Tree?

116
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,597
The Magic Tree at Mount Phoenix?
I hear they are very powerful

117
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,246
Is he your slave?

118
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,997
He is my good-luck charm

119
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,260
Just hold on, we'll be there soon

120
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:59,176
How many days more?

121
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,101
2 days

122
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:07,207
Peasant!

123
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,563
Don't force me

124
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:11,455
Don't force me!

125
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,453
Don't make me angry

126
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:20,634
Give me some wine

127
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:21,758
No

128
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,626
Wine!

129
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,457
Has the General fought many battles?

130
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,002
Many. I have survived over a hundred

131
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:39,115
Cut me loose

132
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,565
Then you must have killed a lot of people

133
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,829
Yes, that will be even more

134
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,815
In the battle yesterday with the Wei, I fought 8 men

135
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,434
Will you please bring me along with you?

136
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,350
I will be your slave too

137
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,340
Alright

138
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,232
I have studied music and I can sing

139
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,637
You drink, I will entertain you

140
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,098
If we find him alive, what then?

141
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,526
Just remember that he is dead

142
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,155
What was that for?

143
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,561
For killing a lot of people, General

144
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,174
I am not a General

145
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:25,066
My family was probably killed by you too

146
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,677
I was sold here as a singing prostitute

147
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:29,323
When we were entertaining you

148
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,472
I might even have served you before

149
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:37,169
Actually I didn't want you to drink

150
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:32,503
Hey, let's stop fighting

151
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,420
Open the door, I am a Liang soldier!

152
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,848
I've captured a General of the Wei army

153
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:34,128
Halt

154
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:39,834
Who is he?

155
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,445
A General of the Wei army

156
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,159
It is definitely him. I'm sure of it!

157
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,819
That head definitely belongs to a Wei General

158
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,431
Reward him!

159
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,160
Hold on

160
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,041
Who killed him?

161
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:00,211
Me

162
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:01,942
You're able to kill him?

163
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,090
He must be a deserter! He must have
cut the head off a dead soldier to deceive you!

164
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:09,130
Execute him!

165
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,444
I'm innocent!

166
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Where's the horse?

167
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:08,002
Whether you want to kill me or release me

168
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,964
I will kill you at the first opportunity

169
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,391
Kill, kill, kill

170
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:13,899
I'm just a farmer

171
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,744
I won't kill, and I don't want to kill

172
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,660
If you make me angry

173
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,807
I still won't kill you

174
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,096
I can't believe I was tricked by a girl

175
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:27,208
I gave her food, and she poisoned me!

176
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:30,845
You tricked her, and she tricked you back. It's fair

177
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,388
She should have beaten you up!

178
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:36,303
Wearing this helmet is useless

179
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:41,662
What did she whisper to you last night?

180
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,785
Peasant!

181
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,915
Between me and him, who's the better fighter?

182
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,050
He is a talented General

183
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,128
Don't I even measure up to him?

184
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:58,578
You are soft-hearted, he's ruthless

185
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:04,730
To be King, you must know your enemy's strength

186
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:07,914
I will bring some men with me and search in
the direction of the Liang state. Will Master....

187
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:10,527
I will not go back without seeing him!

188
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,395
You know,

189
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:14,636
I have waited 20 years

190
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:18,412
Just to farm and not to fight anymore

191
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,372


192
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:50,597
The carriage is gone. This is cut

193
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:23,447
Don't feign death. I won't be fooled.

194
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:52,800
We're too prominent going on the main road

195
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,483
We should go by side roads

196
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:56,129
I haven't travelled on side roads before

197
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:58,612
But it's ok. I have my father's map

198
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,950
Liang wine is too strong

199
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:12,219
A small road also runs straight to my home

200
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,346
Men.... Men!

201
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:28,833
My father said stepping into bear droppings is good fortune

202
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:30,655
Ambush

203
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:32,801
Yeah ok

204
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,095
What's in the cart?

205
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:42,126
Nothing special

206
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,529
Rob!

207
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,919
I said, rob!

208
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,338
Hold on, who are you?

209
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,115
General

210
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,356
It's true!

211
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,573
Hit him

212
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,954
Hit him!

213
00:23:04,097 --> 00:23:06,054
No!

214
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:11,508
Don't hit him anymore

215
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,028
Sorry

216
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:19,110
Please don't hit us anymore

217
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,948
You can take anything you want, just spare our lives

218
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:23,819
Eh? What do you have?

219
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:24,896
Only a broken down cart

220
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,019
For revenge!

221
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,841
Quiet!

222
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:30,825
How is he related to you?

223
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:32,841
Oh him?

224
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:34,616
He's my son

225
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:35,943
I am not his son!

226
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,121
You ungrateful thing!

227
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,536
He's crazy! He wants to go to war!

228
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,660
I tied him up so I can go back to my fields

229
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,762
You're a farmer? Our fields have been destroyed by your war

230
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,752
For revenge!

231
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:49,767
I will decide! Take the cart!

232
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:51,366
Unfilial child. Waste of time bringing him up

233
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:57,192
Are you crazy? What you want the sword for?

234
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,176
Plowing

235
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,091
Plowing? You have a field?

236
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,238
Let's go

237
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:19,427
They are a bunch of idiots

238
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:22,643
They don't know you are the most valuable thing here

239
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:27,118
I am your son!

240
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,753
I must be filial to you

241
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,437
Come, show me

242
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:34,260
Plowing fields!

243
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,445
Don't move. Don't even breathe...

244
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,476
You tried to strangle me!

245
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,495
If I had not rescued you....

246
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,521
Ungrateful!

247
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,300
I didn't poke yet

248
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:07,798
My father was right,stepping into
bear droppings brings good luck!

249
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,048
It's good

250
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:18,805
Please, have mercy on us!

251
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:31,519
Do not move

252
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:43,257
I can choose to let him live, or kill him

253
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,310
I have the power

254
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:52,438
One acre for growing beans, one acre for growing melons

255
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:57,100
Two acres for growing beans, and two more acres for growing paddy

256
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:00,317
No, three acres for growing beans

257
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:15,780
Ok, you tell me. I have 5 acres. What do I plant in them?

258
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,335
I can give you 1,000 acres

259
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:18,838
1,000 acres is too much

260
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:21,826
1 acre more, and I can't divide myself among them

261
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:27,372
Which do you think is better?
Growing paddy or beans?

262
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:30,917
Grow rice. I like eating rice

263
00:27:31,664 --> 00:27:35,301
Idiot! Paddy is rice, rice is paddy!

264
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,248
Are you very tired?

265
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,393
Are you very comfortable?

266
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,609
Now I'm not tired anymore

267
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,793
5 acres of land.. I'll be so busy!

268
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,963
Right, must remember to buy a cow

269
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:03,449
Maybe buy 2 - one male, one female

270
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:06,620
The bull for plowing fields, and the cow for milk

271
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,816
I would like to see how you are
going to bring me into Liang state

272
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,452
Oh yes, I don't know how to milk a cow

273
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:13,812
I need to marry a wife that does

274
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:19,776
My eldest brother was very good at fighting

275
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,644
but he was killed in the war

276
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:25,327
My second brother was the most honest

277
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,185
he also died in the war

278
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:33,009
I'm the only one left in my family

279
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,020
General, do you have brothers?

280
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,911
As good as none

281
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,209
Hey, what are you doing?

282
00:28:55,795 --> 00:28:57,708
I really cannot find him!

283
00:28:57,896 --> 00:29:00,731
Mount Phoenix is so huge, where do I look?

284
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,227
He is tied up

285
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:06,192
His father tied him up, said he was crazy

286
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,922
but I think both of them are crazy

287
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:13,615
I'll be going now...

288
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:34,296
Avenge me....

289
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:49,201
I won't make it easy for you to be taken from me

290
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:51,953
In all the battles, in all the years

291
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:55,963
I have never seen such a fine arrow, have you?

292
00:29:56,943 --> 00:30:00,205
Yes I have. It belongs to a rival family

293
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:05,425
All of you have brought it upon yourselves

294
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:09,900
Do you know why they want to rescue you? So that they can kill you

295
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:12,884
I captured you, but I want you alive

296
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:14,753
What your father said was right

297
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,806
A useless death is very humiliating

298
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,744
I will go with you willingly

299
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,642
Even the General is afraid of death

300
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:27,696
I just want to die with dignity and pride

301
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:41,213
Which way?

302
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:44,905
Actually when we arrive in Liang state, I can assist the Liang King

303
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:46,681
the only condition is to kill you first

304
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,827
Don't lie to me. No one can trick me

305
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,974
Except for that woman

306
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:53,259
You want a lot of women?

307
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,981
Let's talk about you. What kind of women do you like?

308
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,408
Pretty and sexy

309
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:03,858
Or intelligent?

310
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,516
I like honest ones

311
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:10,990
Intelligent ones will do too.
They can teach me how to read and write

312
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,051
You don't have a woman, do you?

313
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:26,037
So, what did that girl tell you?

314
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:29,346
I'll let you know when we reach Liang state

315
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:31,502
You, take a look down the moutainside

316
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,835
You, circle back and search again

317
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,574
Who's that?

318
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:53,049
Du Pham tribe, lawless and nomadic

319
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:55,475
Go over and say Hi

320
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,737
They won't understand me

321
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,070
They are fierce fighters

322
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:00,938
Don't provoke them

323
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:09,368
Hurry up. You're not tired, are you?

324
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:17,530
In strong winds, birds will not panic and will seek shelter

325
00:32:18,557 --> 00:32:21,818
What are you talking about?

326
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:25,406
When the phoenix loses its feathers, it's uglier than wild chickens

327
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,328
Hey, you're pretty good at throwing stones

328
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,592
That's how we killed wild chickens when we were kids

329
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,673
How did you know the Wei army
will lay an ambush at Phoenix Mountain?

330
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:43,029
I didn't know

331
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,969
In any case, we've been ambushed for 2 days

332
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,418
So he's angry inside

333
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:51,889
If we weren't ambushed

334
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,643
With our training, we could each take on 10 enemy soldiers

335
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:57,999
Defeating the Liang troops would have been easy

336
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,588
Don't brag. Liang soldiers are no pushovers

337
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:07,786
In any case, soldiers like you disgrace the Liang state

338
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,346
Come, let's see how you take on 10 opponents

339
00:33:33,018 --> 00:33:34,896
The General vs The Deserter?

340
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,116
Now it's Liang vs Wei, very fair

341
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:43,378
If you want to be fair, then don't attack my wounds

342
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,162
Ok, to even it up further...

343
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,119
You're already dead

344
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:43,406
You are also dead, so we both died together

345
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:44,680
Not counted!

346
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:58,162
The battle is over. Wei state wins

347
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:22,978
All these months, there's fighting everywhere
and people are drafted to be soldiers

348
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,521
He attacks him, he attacks him

349
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:26,064
What's there to see?

350
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:30,816
Liang state wins! Liang state wins!

351
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:33,762
So this is the fairness you spoke of?

352
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:36,467
There's no fairness in war

353
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,088
We'll have meat to eat in a while. Have a snack first

354
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,777
Fussy about dirty food?

355
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,001
As you wish

356
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,782
General, what do you eat when you're not at war?

357
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:19,280
Delicious meat from gorillas

358
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,963
Seafood from the Eastern sea

359
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,979
No wonder you wage war. You eat weird stuff

360
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:32,056
Aren't you illiterate?

361
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:39,278
My father taught me these 2 words. They are simpler to write

362
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:45,577
There's nothing simple about those 2 words

363
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:48,141
Why don't you come back with me to Wei state?

364
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:50,614
I can give you a post in the government

365
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:51,969
I forgot to tell you

366
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,700
The reward for capturing an enemy General alive is
wealth, lands, and lifetime exemption from the army!

367
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:58,500
A lifetime away from soldiers, just farming, no wars

368
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,299
Only when there is war, will there be a winner

369
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,446
And only when the winners rule, will there truly be peace

370
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:08,618
Then peasants like you can have an peaceful life

371
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:09,797
You know,

372
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:11,106
If it weren't for your damned war

373
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:13,392
I would be living that life right now!

374
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,030
You really don't want any food?

375
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:22,454
Honestly, I'm a little hungry

376
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:54,873
We have meat!

377
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,765
We have meat..

378
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:05,031
Hey, I'll help you start a fire!

379
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:08,306
You are pregnant, we can't eat you

380
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,453
Father told us before...

381
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:16,787
Hurry! Hurry!

382
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:19,026
There are people coming, let's go!

383
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:21,824
Why the panic? It's only one horse

384
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,341
Eh? One of our own?

385
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:52,978
Comrade...

386
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,583
Son of a bitch!

387
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,321
You, check those trees there!

388
00:39:44,828 --> 00:39:47,159
A sword from Liang state

389
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:12,208
Kneel!

390
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,367
I am a Liang soldier. I only kneel to a Liang General

391
00:40:21,144 --> 00:40:21,901
What's going on?

392
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,306
Are you a Liang scout?

393
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:24,205
Yes

394
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,969
What about you?

395
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,859
Me too

396
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:26,936
What's your mission?

397
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,432
I climbed up Phoenix Moutains
and discovered that both armies....

398
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,113
.. both armies destroyed each other, yes

399
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:31,537
Why travel by side roads?

400
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,893
Well you are on the main roads...

401
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:34,529
...side roads are easier to travel, and faster too

402
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:36,163
Really fast

403
00:40:36,307 --> 00:40:37,528
I do not know him

404
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,745
What? He has a concussion

405
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:41,684
He has a concussion

406
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:43,691
I did not fall...

407
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,140
Whether I fell or not, I still don't know him

408
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:46,914
- What?
- What what?

409
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:49,493
We don't kill scouts!

410
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:51,222
Is this your sword?

411
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:52,065
Yes

412
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:54,120
How does a General's sword end up in your hands?

413
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:55,615
I found it

414
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,118
You're not a scout

415
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,615
I am not

416
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,122
Where's the Wei General?

417
00:41:02,323 --> 00:41:03,535
I do not know

418
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:05,077
You dare to say you don't know?

419
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:07,503
Ok ok I know, I know!

420
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:10,115
I captured your General

421
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:11,564
You're pretty impressive

422
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,979
I'm not impressive

423
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,102
Where is he?

424
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,039
He escaped

425
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:18,125
Escaped? That means you're useless to us now

426
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,225
No no no, I had him hidden

427
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,452
Bring us to him

428
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:22,528
He really escaped

429
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:23,930
What you want me to do?

430
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:31,664
Stay back! Stay back all of you!

431
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,578
Stay back!

432
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:45,221
Stay back!

433
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:46,715
If I die, you won't get what you want

434
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,211
What do you want?

435
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:51,800
I want to be rewarded

436
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:54,041
I can reward you

437
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:56,093
You're a disgrace to the Liang army

438
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,455
Of the 2 of you, one is useless

439
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:25,994
So.. what now?

440
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:32,190
To the horses!

441
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:32,761
Sorry

442
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,490
Wu..

443
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:40,825
Stand down

444
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,081
Let them pass

445
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,203
He's alive, right?

446
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:56,149
Well then

447
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:59,319
He's only a General, nothing special

448
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:02,722
Who knows, I may capture a king next

449
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:07,252
Am I a disgrace to the Liang state?

450
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,027
Am I a disgrace to the Liang state?

451
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:24,298
Come on

452
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:28,307
Come get me!

453
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:37,110
You didn't expect that I still live?

454
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:38,697
Your evil plans

455
00:45:38,841 --> 00:45:41,729
have killed 1,000 of our brave Wei soldiers

456
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:45,645
Their souls will never forgive you!

457
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:48,069
And you

458
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:51,587
you pitiful peasant

459
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:54,908
you cowardly deserter!

460
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:58,078
A big road runs straight to your house

461
00:45:58,266 --> 00:46:01,249
And now you'll go home empty handed!

462
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:16,196
Where did you come from?

463
00:46:17,362 --> 00:46:19,040
Where do you live?

464
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:21,605
Once I defeat Jiangshan

465
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:24,823
I'll start building that big ship

466
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:28,607
Yes, we'll set sail under the full moon

467
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,893
and travel the world

468
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:32,807
My father the King, said

469
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:37,048
we should paint 10,000 dragons on the boat for good luck

470
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:39,940
When Master becomes King, you can do anything

471
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:43,670
To become King, the old days are behind us

472
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:46,329
Get some rest, Master

473
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:51,500
My father told me that sparrows can become phoenixes

474
00:46:53,132 --> 00:46:54,624
That's good

475
00:47:43,086 --> 00:47:44,355
Why did you trick me?

476
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:45,899
I even beat you up

477
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,534
Kill me, General

478
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:50,471
I'm not a General. I'm only a foot soldier

479
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,642
There is no difference.
You still kill just the same

480
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,022
Hey, are you lost?

481
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:01,622
You really think you can get to
the Magic Tree and say a few prayers?

482
00:48:05,488 --> 00:48:07,260
I'm only a peasant girl

483
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:14,165
I have a map here

484
00:48:14,877 --> 00:48:16,846
It can help you find the Magic Tree

485
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:22,158
You should take the horse too. The road ahead is difficult

486
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:30,308
I'm returning this to you

487
00:48:51,352 --> 00:48:53,683
You hungry? Me too

488
00:48:54,673 --> 00:48:56,489
Have to find something to eat

489
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:25,483
5 acres of fertile land
at the foot of the mountains

490
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:35,073
5 acres of fields to plant some crops

491
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:35,900
You're wrong

492
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,800
No, you are wrong!

493
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,783
All of you, shut up! You are still lacking if you
want to be famous travellers and explorers

494
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:43,886
Lacking what?

495
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,589
Patience

496
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:46,713
Good point

497
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:48,627
Sir, how do I get to Wei state from here?

498
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:49,715
This way

499
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:50,129
No, that way

500
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,510
The way to Wei state is dangerous

501
00:49:53,654 --> 00:50:00,077
Better to take your chances
with the Liang state instead

502
00:50:02,314 --> 00:50:04,653
Let's see how you'll escape now

503
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,111
You'll be safe here

504
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,816
I'll be going home soon

505
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,197
Live long and prosper

506
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:57,789
That's good

507
00:52:40,065 --> 00:52:45,653
A big road runs straight to my house

508
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:51,242
At the foot of Mount Liang

509
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,784
The land is fertile

510
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:59,169
That's good

511
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:02,942
Yeah

512
00:53:11,419 --> 00:53:12,771
Relax, relax!

513
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:18,083
If I knew this was going to happen,
I would have strangled you back at the tavern

514
00:53:18,272 --> 00:53:20,927
If not for the bear that day, you'd be dead now

515
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:25,028
Hey, ease up. Do you understand me?

516
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:27,093
They're taking us to be sacrificed

517
00:53:27,283 --> 00:53:28,542
Sacrificed?

518
00:53:28,732 --> 00:53:29,852
Definitely to be buried alive

519
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:31,255
Buried alive?

520
00:53:43,034 --> 00:53:44,945
How far is it from here to Liang state?

521
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,557
If we take the road by the river, 1 day

522
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,426
Which village are you from?

523
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:50,932
3 Legged Hole village

524
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:53,731
You're still hoping
to bring me back for a reward?

525
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:57,182
Yes, you are my slave remember?

526
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:59,980
Hey! I am not your slave!

527
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,219
I am HIS slave!

528
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:34,264
Trade a horse for him

529
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,673
Be careful Master!

530
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:04,391
Halt!

531
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:37,681
How do we get out of these?

532
00:56:37,826 --> 00:56:39,086
I was about to ask you the same thing!

533
00:56:58,173 --> 00:56:59,573
Wu

534
00:57:43,295 --> 00:57:44,555
I have an idea

535
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:45,585
What kind of ideas can you have?

536
00:57:45,775 --> 00:57:47,779
Remember, we're in this together

537
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,856
Right, my father told me once

538
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:53,376
that whether it's eagles or chickens
in the pot, it's still called "meat"

539
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:55,383
Good point, a very good point

540
00:58:33,048 --> 00:58:34,355
Help them!

541
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,510
This wasn't such a good idea

542
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
No, it's a good idea

543
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:17,372
Wu

544
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:18,961
Yes sir

545
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:23,248
So you finally face me with a real sword

546
00:59:23,437 --> 00:59:26,232
You're no longer my Master, sorry

547
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,975
It's too bad. You were my best student

548
00:59:58,035 --> 00:59:59,200
Come on, get on!

549
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:03,441
Hurry up, buffalo!

550
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:39,461
Run, Master!

551
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:32,253
This way

552
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,588
No, this way!

553
01:01:36,082 --> 01:01:39,388
You know, I wasn't trying to rescue you

554
01:01:39,948 --> 01:01:42,277
It was because the buffalo bumped around randomly

555
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:46,797
So, do you think the buffalo is strong

556
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:48,619
or were the walls too weak?

557
01:01:48,762 --> 01:01:51,278
Regardless, thank you

558
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,285
It's all good

559
01:01:54,684 --> 01:01:55,804
What do you have there around your waist?

560
01:01:57,622 --> 01:01:58,834
It's a secret

561
01:01:59,025 --> 01:02:01,540
Before we part ways, I'd like to tell you a secret too

562
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:04,897
You know why that bunch wants me?

563
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:06,169
I don't care

564
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,735
Anyway, the affairs of you nobles are too complicated

565
01:02:08,879 --> 01:02:11,627
Eversince we met, it got even more complicated

566
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:14,326
Peasant!

567
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,098
You are still my slave

568
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,932
Let's see you try to escape now

569
01:02:20,447 --> 01:02:21,484
You spoilt my big plans

570
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,074
Now you're the big plan

571
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:28,712
I am your fields!

572
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:31,743
Yes, 5 acres of field!

573
01:02:31,992 --> 01:02:33,809
Not forgetting the monetary rewards!

574
01:02:33,953 --> 01:02:36,283
Right, a lot of money

575
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Wait wait!

576
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,115
Why?

577
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:41,144
I'm telling you to stop!

578
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,826
I'm not listening to you!

579
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,739
Why didn't you say so earlier?

580
01:03:06,296 --> 01:03:07,566
The bush isn't strong enough

581
01:03:08,173 --> 01:03:09,247
Don't grab me!

582
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,463
If not you, then what?

583
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:12,097
Let go first. I'll come for you later

584
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:14,104
You think I'll believe you?

585
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,925
I told you!!

586
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,523
Wu.. Wu!

587
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:36,694
Master!

588
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:40,235
Why?

589
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:46,059
He's still alive.
Is it pre-destined? Where is he?

590
01:03:46,203 --> 01:03:47,983
Master, we should return to Wei

591
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:50,968
No! You don't know what I'm thinking

592
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:12,941
I truly admire you

593
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,905
Ok tie me up then

594
01:04:21,977 --> 01:04:23,710
I'll go take look at where we are

595
01:04:25,622 --> 01:04:27,253
I said, I'm going to take a look!

596
01:04:38,518 --> 01:04:39,918
Where we are?

597
01:04:51,748 --> 01:04:55,241
It's futile. We'll both die in here

598
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:09,766
A big road runs straight to my house

599
01:05:10,793 --> 01:05:16,241
At the foot of Mount Liang

600
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:20,945
The lands are fertile

601
01:05:21,135 --> 01:05:22,627
You're mad

602
01:05:23,479 --> 01:05:25,762
It's ok. My father once said

603
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:29,305
be thankful to be alive

604
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,753
Why must I be King of Wei?

605
01:05:30,944 --> 01:05:34,297
You'll be a good King for Wei

606
01:05:34,354 --> 01:05:37,850
Are you saying that I should
harden my heart and kill him?

607
01:05:37,993 --> 01:05:41,299
At this point in time, there is no other choice

608
01:05:41,582 --> 01:05:44,479
Ok, how should he die

609
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:48,020
for us to be safe?

610
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:50,586
What are you thinking of?

611
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,382
Cauliflower

612
01:05:56,087 --> 01:05:57,905
Yes, grow some cauliflowers

613
01:05:58,048 --> 01:05:59,121
Why?

614
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:00,243
What do you mean, "why"?

615
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:02,484
Why am I here with you?

616
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:07,248
We could have conquered the world

617
01:06:07,483 --> 01:06:09,719
And then lie in a grand tomb at the end

618
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,798
There will be countless people
buried with us, as packing material

619
01:06:14,196 --> 01:06:16,153
No one will bury us if we die here

620
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:22,395
That's right! We'll save up and open a pharmacy!

621
01:06:22,586 --> 01:06:25,100
Actually, your medicine's pretty good

622
01:06:26,174 --> 01:06:29,156
I will appoint you as Chief Medical Officer

623
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:38,422
You know, we could be friends if it weren't for the war

624
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:41,032
Perhaps

625
01:06:42,571 --> 01:06:44,435
If you can make it out alive

626
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:48,210
Promise to do something for me,
make it worth my while to save you

627
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,612
Tell me

628
01:06:51,755 --> 01:06:54,225
Don't ever invade Liang state again

629
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:05,539
At least 10 years, let time heal old wounds

630
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,151
You sly fox! Ok, agreed!

631
01:07:14,211 --> 01:07:16,075
Now you must promise me something

632
01:07:16,264 --> 01:07:16,966
Ok, go on

633
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:18,972
If you make it out alive

634
01:07:19,812 --> 01:07:21,676
You must tell your General

635
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:25,264
that I died on the battlefield

636
01:07:25,919 --> 01:07:28,759
tell him I died on the sandy ground

637
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,894
that I didn't disgrace Wei

638
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:38,823
Even though the Wei army was
wiped out, the Wei flag still stood proud

639
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:42,979
Please don't lie to me

640
01:07:43,819 --> 01:07:45,778
You peasant!

641
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:50,390
It's good to be a peasant

642
01:09:32,437 --> 01:09:34,257
Wake up!

643
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,601
Dad! I'm alive!

644
01:09:58,722 --> 01:10:00,632
Thanks be to the Heavenly God

645
01:10:01,054 --> 01:10:03,337
Hey I just remembered...

646
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:07,540
You know, this place is 3 Legged Hole

647
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:10,025
There's a village nearby. I'll get a boat there!

648
01:10:10,308 --> 01:10:11,612
It's just half a day by river

649
01:10:11,803 --> 01:10:13,201
To where?

650
01:10:13,391 --> 01:10:15,766
Where else? Liang state!

651
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:20,799
Don't try to escape!
You aren't going anywhere without me!

652
01:10:28,947 --> 01:10:30,299
Hurry up!

653
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,212
Hide quickly!

654
01:10:32,403 --> 01:10:33,522
Why hide?

655
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:35,156
Hide!

656
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:38,791
Help me up

657
01:10:46,428 --> 01:10:47,686
Little brother

658
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,391
Little brother?

659
01:10:51,743 --> 01:10:53,328
He is your little brother?

660
01:10:53,472 --> 01:10:55,894
Hunting me down must be hard work

661
01:10:56,097 --> 01:10:56,983
My Prince

662
01:10:57,173 --> 01:10:58,339
Prince?

663
01:10:58,527 --> 01:10:59,974
So who are you mourning?

664
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,701
Our father, the King

665
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:04,779
When I left, he was just ill!

666
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:08,284
It's fated. You are a great warrior,
and Father liked you because of it

667
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:11,223
If Father didn't get mad at me for
starting negotiations with Liang state

668
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:13,004
I would be Crown Prince

669
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:15,663
So, to ensure my demise, you set up the ambush!

670
01:11:16,316 --> 01:11:17,867
Because of your feuding

671
01:11:18,057 --> 01:11:19,875
the Liang state paid the price of 2000 men!

672
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:21,277
You are not fit to speak to me

673
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:23,331
It's you that is unfit to talk to me

674
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:25,894
He has nothing to do with this

675
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:27,074
But he is the enemy!

676
01:11:27,218 --> 01:11:28,850
He wants me alive, you want me dead

677
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,602
Ok then. Kill me with the crossbow
I gave you. Return and be a good King

678
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,591
You've always had a soft spot

679
01:11:45,524 --> 01:11:50,415
This is your sword. If you don't kill him, he'll kill you

680
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:53,417
Only one of you can become King

681
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:59,937
I don't understand why one of you must die

682
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:00,921
Stay out of this

683
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:03,205
You are making things complicated

684
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:04,747
I said, stay out of this!

685
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:07,592
Ah I see. It's that bald guy there stirring up trouble

686
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,553
Ok I'll keep quiet

687
01:12:23,662 --> 01:12:25,620
Ok they are here. We can leave now

688
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:33,769
I've disappointed you

689
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:37,033
Do what you need to do, Master

690
01:12:57,982 --> 01:12:59,148
Let's go hide

691
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,051
General!

692
01:14:22,611 --> 01:14:23,917
Behind you!

693
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:30,633
I'm too nosey!

694
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:37,340
What a waste...

695
01:15:20,072 --> 01:15:21,516
Where are all the stones?

696
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,215
Stay back!

697
01:15:49,405 --> 01:15:51,698
I'll take out the other eye

698
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:54,775
Big brother!

699
01:16:59,102 --> 01:17:00,501
Stop fighting!

700
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:05,718
I am the one you want

701
01:17:07,396 --> 01:17:09,214
I am the one you want

702
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:12,849
We are brothers

703
01:17:13,223 --> 01:17:14,809
One of us must live

704
01:17:16,906 --> 01:17:19,049
You don't understand what I am saying, right?

705
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,407
Do you understand now?

706
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:28,134
This is what I need to do

707
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:30,932
Little brother!

708
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,897
Big brother, did I die a good death?

709
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:46,767
That big boat of ours

710
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:50,868
We can't be on it together

711
01:18:36,908 --> 01:18:38,166
Do me a favour

712
01:18:39,806 --> 01:18:41,344
Please bury him

713
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:51,170
Hurry up. We still have half a day's journey by river, General

714
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:55,224
No, it should be "Prince"

715
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:02,815
The wine from Wei is too weak

716
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,102
I know what you're thinking

717
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:08,830
I also know what you're going to say

718
01:19:12,324 --> 01:19:15,957
"It's good, we are still alive"

719
01:19:18,099 --> 01:19:20,615
Honestly, after seeing you and your brother

720
01:19:21,277 --> 01:19:22,490
It made me think of my own brothers

721
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,078
They must have been good soldiers

722
01:19:24,268 --> 01:19:26,412
Actually, I want to be a good soldier too

723
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:31,629
At the time, all 3 of us were drafted
into the army at the same time

724
01:19:31,865 --> 01:19:33,962
The first tour lasted 3 years

725
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:35,793
When we got back

726
01:19:36,727 --> 01:19:38,731
our village had been burnt to the ground

727
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:40,922
Now I'm homeless

728
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:44,103
Before my father died, he said

729
01:19:45,316 --> 01:19:47,646
We serve the country before we serve our home

730
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:53,732
But when will this war end?

731
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:59,507
He said, "Listen up, children"

732
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:04,773
"Of the 3 of you, 1 must live"

733
01:20:09,336 --> 01:20:11,433
"to continue the family line"

734
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:16,371
Now I'm the only one left

735
01:20:20,468 --> 01:20:25,171
Capturing you was my only good turn of luck

736
01:20:33,086 --> 01:20:37,695
I guess my luck isn't that good

737
01:20:53,009 --> 01:20:54,361
No need to ask me

738
01:20:54,968 --> 01:20:57,206
That day, what she said to me was

739
01:20:58,836 --> 01:21:00,559
"Retribution"

740
01:21:03,123 --> 01:21:04,568
Peasant

741
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:27,703
PEACE

742
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:43,616
MOUNT LIANG

743
01:21:43,759 --> 01:21:46,786
Liang state is just around this corner

744
01:21:51,955 --> 01:21:55,494
Liang and Wei as allies. Perhaps my brother was right

745
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:57,140
If the King of Liang doesn't kill me

746
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,016
perhaps I can discuss national affairs with him

747
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,652
Perhaps.. perhaps

748
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,204
Perhaps it's too late

749
01:22:05,091 --> 01:22:06,581
Perhaps

750
01:22:21,245 --> 01:22:23,203
It's always bustling in Liang

751
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,070
Your secret

752
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:39,974
I underestimated you

753
01:22:40,909 --> 01:22:43,563
I'd never expect you to capture
and bring me to Liang state

754
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:48,093
Am I your slave now, or your enemy?

755
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:57,359
Neither. You're free

756
01:22:59,827 --> 01:23:02,260
Go, before I regret it

757
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:07,989
Why?

758
01:23:09,248 --> 01:23:12,415
Of the 2 of you, 1 must live

759
01:23:23,368 --> 01:23:24,905
Hey! Will you keep your promise?

760
01:23:25,429 --> 01:23:26,687
What?

761
01:23:26,878 --> 01:23:28,601
In 10 years

762
01:23:28,793 --> 01:23:32,052
Of course I will

763
01:23:36,206 --> 01:23:37,745
I forgot to tell you

764
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:41,099
That piece of jade you took from me is really valuable

765
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:45,014
You can exchange it for wealth and lands

766
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:48,137
Found it!

767
01:23:50,886 --> 01:23:52,656
I may lose my life

768
01:23:54,807 --> 01:23:58,021
I'm left with nothing again. It's fine

769
01:24:01,305 --> 01:24:03,028
Leave quickly!

770
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:06,477
Run away!

771
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:47,625
Let him surrender

772
01:24:49,814 --> 01:24:52,564
Liang state is destroyed. Kneel and surrender!

773
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:56,756
Liang state is gone?

774
01:24:57,923 --> 01:24:59,182
How can Liang be destroyed?

775
01:24:59,371 --> 01:25:02,259
Liang state refused to surrender, so Qing state annexed it

776
01:25:02,588 --> 01:25:05,127
Your army is destroyed. Kneel or die!

777
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:07,135
The army is wiped out?

778
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:08,559
Liang state is gone

779
01:25:08,596 --> 01:25:09,971
The army is destroyed

780
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,153
Liang state is gone

781
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:39,310
I have lost everything

782
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:44,249
Put the flag down

783
01:25:50,487 --> 01:25:53,422
There's a big road..

784
01:25:54,028 --> 01:25:55,478
Your army is wiped out

785
01:25:55,573 --> 01:25:56,694
No, not wiped out yet

786
01:25:56,743 --> 01:25:57,702
.. that leads to your house

787
01:25:57,607 --> 01:25:58,564
Drop your weapons!

788
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:01,422
I'm still here. Come on!

789
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:08,700
My house is at the foot of Mount Liang

790
01:26:11,025 --> 01:26:18,799
The land is fertile, 5 acres of it

791
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:23,226
5 acres of good fields, for planting crops

792
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:28,258
Dad, I can't continue the family line

793
01:26:29,982 --> 01:26:38,512
A large river flows straight to my house

794
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:47,035
With a wife and kid, and spacious rooms

795
01:26:49,644 --> 01:26:58,396
With fat chickens and geese
and strong cows and goats

796
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:07,524
Growing beans, rice and vegetables

797
01:27:31,869 --> 01:27:34,010
I didn't disgrace Liang state

798
01:27:46,533 --> 01:27:49,328
Liang state was annexed by Qing

799
01:27:49,702 --> 01:27:52,451
The General went back to Wei and became King

800
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,341
He gave up wars

801
01:27:55,578 --> 01:28:00,327
When Qing attacked, he ordered a quick surrender

802
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:02,670
so that the population can live in peace

803
01:28:02,787 --> 01:28:08,086
Qing continued to conquer states for several more years

804
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:14,981
In 221 BC, the Qing unified China
