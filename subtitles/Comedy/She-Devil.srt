1
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:10,659
( beeping )

2
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,589
( clock chiming )

3
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,691
Man: Holly.

4
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,559
Holly.

5
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,448
What time is it now?

6
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,470
Just ten minutes later

7
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:49,090
Than when you asked before.

8
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:55,830
And do you think
he'll get here in time?

9
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,933
He'll be here any minute now.

10
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,935
Take it easy, John.

11
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,621
Do you really have
to tell him tonight?

12
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,356
Yes. Tonight.

13
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,442
I feel that it may be my last.

14
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,843
Now, now, now.

15
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,828
You know you're
going to get better.

16
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,680
Holly...

17
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,382
What's become of your passion

18
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,418
For cold, scientific fact?

19
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,919
( bell ringing )

20
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,687
There he is now.

21
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,222
Hurry.

22
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,124
( ringing )

23
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,813
I believe
my uncle's expecting me.

24
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,331
I'm Leo Vincey.

25
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,217
Yes, I can see that.
Hi, Vincey.

26
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,484
Come on in.
Thank you.

27
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,120
My name's Holly, Horace Holly.

28
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,388
Glad to know you.

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,756
Confound your English fog.

30
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,491
Our ship was a whole day late.

31
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,944
Well, thank heavens you're--
you're here in time.

32
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,096
Time?
What's all the rush?

33
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,580
Your cable said,
"catch first boat,

34
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:47,915
Greatest adventure
in the world."

35
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,517
What's all the mystery?

36
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,619
You'll hear all about
that from your uncle.

37
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,454
But there's one thing
my cable didn't say--

38
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,489
John Vincey's dying.

39
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,375
Good lord.
What of?

40
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,643
Radium poisoning.

41
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,960
Hmm.

42
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:02,463
I haven't seen the old
man since I was a kid.

43
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,798
He never quite got over

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,433
Our side of the family
going american.

45
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,834
Why did he send for me?

46
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,404
There's no time to explain
that now, every minute counts.

47
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,705
Come along in.

48
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:21,216
I'm sorry, sir, I couldn't
get here any sooner.

49
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,934
Never mind that, my boy.

50
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,002
There's no time for
explanations now.

51
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,571
Come closer.

52
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:31,926
Holly, did you ever see
such a striking resemblance?

53
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,545
Extraordinary.
I'd already noticed it.

54
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,114
Look at that portrait.

55
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,250
Holly, turn on that light.

56
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,708
He does resemble me at that.

57
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,044
Or should I say
that I resemble him?

58
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:53,781
That is your ancestor of
a dozen generations ago.

59
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:54,932
Really?

60
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,101
John Vincey in the 15th century.

61
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,789
Wow. I must say we Vinceys

62
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,742
Have a way of looking
like each other.

63
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,761
I have no time for
explanations now, my boy.

64
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,113
I'm a man of science.

65
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,815
I'm not superstitious.

66
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,834
If I were,
I might imagine

67
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,619
That your resemblance to a
man dead nearly 500 years

68
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,322
Is fate's way of showing me

69
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,190
That you will find again
what he discovered.

70
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,358
What is that, sir?

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,759
The means of overcoming
man's enemy.

72
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,027
Man's enemy?

73
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,329
My enemy, your enemy,

74
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,729
The enemy of all
living things.

75
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,031
Careful, John.

76
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,300
That is what I mean, Leo.

77
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,635
That is the swinging
march of man's enemy.

78
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,154
Time, bringing death--

79
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:36,524
Invisible, relentless death.

80
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,292
I guess nobody can stop that.

81
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,760
Who knows?

82
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,662
A lot of men have believed
that they could--

83
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:42,814
Ponce de Leon,

84
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,849
Who searched for the
fountain of youth,

85
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,084
Or those 15th-century alchemists

86
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,421
Who tried to discover
the elixir of life.

87
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,356
But what connection
has all this with me

88
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,658
Or John Vincey over
there on the wall?

89
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,494
That's what your uncle's
going to tell you.

90
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,313
Holly, get me the box.

91
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,683
Listen to me carefully, Leo.

92
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:03,968
I haven't time left to
tell you more than once.

93
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,954
Uncle John, I don't think
you should exert yourself--

94
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:07,488
Please, please.

95
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,407
What I am going to
tell you is a secret

96
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,542
Handed down in our family
from father to son.

97
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,777
The first John Vincey there

98
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,229
Did not go on his last
great adventure alone.

99
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,432
His wife left their son
in England to go with him.

100
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:20,802
For five years, they
vanished from the world.

101
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:23,605
Then, one night in a town
in northern Poland,

102
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:26,857
A woman--
ill, starving, dying--

103
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,494
Collapsed at the door
of an English merchant.

104
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,896
He took her in and heard
her ravings of hardship

105
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,498
And fantastic terror.

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,201
And that woman was
John Vincey's widow.

107
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:41,555
Before she died, she
became more coherent,

108
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,291
Begged for someone
to write a letter

109
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,243
To her family in England.

110
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,811
Here's the letter,

111
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,514
Dictated by that dying woman

112
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,049
Almost five centuries ago.

113
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,406
( chuckling ) Yes,
it is something of a puzzle.

114
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,308
Doesn't she tell
what happened to John Vincey?

115
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,577
Here.

116
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,546
"so he was killed

117
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,014
Because he refused
to abandon me."

118
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:09,149
Does it give any idea
where they went to?

119
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,719
Not much, mentions
the land of muscovy.

120
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,104
Russia, eh?

121
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,406
Or siberia
or kamchatka--

122
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,608
All known as muscovy
in the 15th century.

123
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,177
The place
where he was killed

124
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,929
Was far, far north.

125
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,980
She escaped
with their English servant.

126
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,582
They fell in
with some natives

127
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,451
Who guided them
back across a glacier

128
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,087
Over what she calls
the schugle barrier.

129
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,872
And there,
death struck again.

130
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:33,057
Holly, read it.

131
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,814
"then a great beast
sprang on our guides

132
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,582
"and killed them all.

133
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:44,018
"my servant giles
killed the beast,

134
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,186
"but died
of his grievous wounds.

135
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,972
So I was left alone."

136
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,024
But what about the discovery
you spoke of?

137
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,192
What'd they find?

138
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:52,660
John: Read on.

139
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,898
"in this strange land,
we saw the flame.

140
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,385
"and he who stands therein
comes forth unharmed

141
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,805
To triumph over death."

142
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,439
But John Vincey
died there.

143
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,992
Why, if he found this,
uh, this flame?

144
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,961
Because he was murdered.

145
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,830
But you are scientists.

146
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,965
Do you really
take all this seriously?

147
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,599
Seriously?

148
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,435
Come, my boy.

149
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,971
I'll show you
how seriously.

150
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,473
Come into the laboratory
where Holly and I

151
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,675
Have done our lifework.

152
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,194
In the beginning,
I was as skeptical as you.

153
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,947
Then Holly and I,

154
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,083
Years ago...
In this very room,

155
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,170
Began our efforts
to reproduce

156
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:39,040
John Vincey's
life-prolonging flame.

157
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:42,643
We failed.

158
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,446
But our researches
in radioactivity

159
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,881
Carried us far enough
to make us believe

160
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,783
That such an element
really exists.

161
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,685
An element
to preserve life?

162
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:52,853
Yes.

163
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:56,040
Seventeen years
in this room.

164
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,108
There's one other thing
we ought to show him, John.

165
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,377
Here.

166
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,012
Can you make out
the inscription?

167
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,883
Holly: It means, "here burns
the flame of life."

168
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,336
That is the sole possession
Vincey's wife had left.

169
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,588
She sent it to the son
she never saw again.

170
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,424
It's all so mysterious,
it doesn't make sense.

171
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,960
This thing's gold,
not an unknown element.

172
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,628
To be sure, it's gold.

173
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,747
It's only the symbol
of the flame of life

174
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,115
John Vincey found.

175
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,034
Don't you understand?
I'm afraid I don't.

176
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,469
Flame destroys life.

177
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,654
A thousand volts of electricity
will destroy life.

178
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,155
But increase
the frequency,

179
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:29,990
And you may safely
take a million volts

180
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,225
Through your body.

181
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,027
And the radiation
from this unknown element,

182
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,562
This flame of life,

183
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,865
May be a million degrees hotter
than any fire we know,

184
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,435
Or it may be
as cold as ice.

185
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,119
( chuckles )
that's too much.

186
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,255
A cold flame?

187
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,990
Did you ever hear
of a man being burned

188
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,158
By x-rays or radium?

189
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,325
Mm-hmm.

190
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,694
Did he feel himself
being burned?

191
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,295
No. No more
than I did myself.

192
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,265
This flame of life, Vincey,
is pure radiation,

193
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,267
The most intense
and flame-like radiation

194
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,769
In the whole universe.

195
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,903
Radiation from what?
From the unknown element.

196
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,172
Do you really believe
such a thing exists?

197
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,575
We no longer believe,
we know it exists.

198
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,810
Our experiments prove that.
That's right.

199
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,578
And they also prove
something else.

200
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,814
This element cannot be
artificially produced.

201
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,583
Only nature,
only god can produce it.

202
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,568
But where?

203
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,503
In a glacial region
of volcanic character.

204
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:16,871
That's largely guesswork,
isn't it?

205
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,122
No!

206
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,225
Not if the family legend
is true,

207
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,828
And I believe that it is.

208
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,699
I believe that John Vincey
found that flame

209
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,134
And that it still burns

210
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,704
Somewhere remote
and mysterious,

211
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,874
Offering eternal life.

212
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,843
That's why I've sent for you.

213
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,695
You're a Vincey,

214
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:43,230
The last of us.

215
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:45,500
Holly can't do it alone,

216
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,568
But he'll go with you.

217
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,104
John Vincey was an explorer.

218
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,339
It's in your blood, too,

219
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,759
And the love of-- of adventure.

220
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,528
Don't look upon this
as a deathbed wish.

221
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,831
If you should try,

222
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,449
If you succeed,

223
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,919
I shan't be here.

224
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,605
But I hope that
somehow I shall know

225
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,041
And somehow share in your triumph

226
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,910
When you say...

227
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,446
"here burns...

228
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,950
The flame of life."

229
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,986
Uncle John?

230
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,422
John?

231
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,357
John!

232
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,127
( shouting )

233
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,045
( wind howling )

234
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,031
( barking )

235
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,838
( barking continues )

236
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,943
Holly: Let's hope this
chap has some tea.

237
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,512
Leo: I'll take mine with
a big reindeer steak.

238
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,281
( man speaking foreign language )

239
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,949
Fine old northern hospitality--

240
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,752
Nothing in the world
like it, they tell me.

241
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,913
Northern hospitality, eh?

242
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,215
( speaking foreign language )

243
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,416
( second man speaking
foreign language )

244
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:32,673
Well, I'm blown.

245
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,809
I thought you were some of those

246
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,311
Infernal wandering chantos.

247
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,814
Can't take any chances with them.

248
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:43,134
Don't we know it-- stayed
with a tribe of 'em last week.

249
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,336
Planning to stay here
the night, I take it.

250
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,905
We hope so. Come 20 miles today.

251
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,607
Come in.

252
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,442
Come in.

253
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,746
Sit down, both of you.

254
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,548
There's a big stew on the
stove just about ready,

255
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,016
Plenty to go around.

256
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,785
( hesitantly ) yeah,
I'm--I'm glad of that.

257
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,153
Hey!

258
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,288
How about supper?!

259
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,889
Do we eat or don't we?!

260
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:19,169
Huh? Oh, that's my daughter Tanya.

261
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,704
Sit down.

262
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,278
Thank you.

263
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,588
Thank you very much.

264
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,382
Now, then, gents,

265
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,418
Do I understand you want
to do business with me?

266
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,237
We heard you had the post
furthest up country.

267
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,605
We thought you might be able

268
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,707
To help us get some
natives to go on.

269
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,342
Where do you want to go?

270
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,145
Did you ever hear of
the schugle barrier?

271
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,181
Why, yes. I've heard
natives talk of it.

272
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,150
Leo, at last, we're on our way.

273
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,584
On your way where?

274
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,353
Over the schugle.

275
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,538
You're crazy.
Why?

276
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,639
You'll never get a native
to guide you there.

277
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,409
We'll pay him well.
That ain't the point.

278
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,444
They're afraid to go, I tell ya.

279
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,046
Why?

280
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,049
Because no one who got
over ever came back,

281
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,051
So far as I know.

282
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,236
Well, why didn't they come back?

283
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,305
What lies beyond the schugle?

284
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,490
More of the same, I suppose.

285
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,659
Of course, the natives
have tales about it.

286
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:33,628
Well, what do they say?

287
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,098
I never paid much attention
to their foolishness.

288
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,567
I can tell you.

289
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,868
You can? What is it?

290
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,737
The natives say that
beyond the schugle,

291
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,971
There are terrible dangers.

292
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:45,205
They say--
( whack )

293
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:46,307
Bah!

294
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:47,892
Yes? Go on.

295
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,961
Why, it's just a sort of legend.

296
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,830
Holly: What is the legend?

297
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,364
A long time ago, they believe,

298
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,000
A woman came out of the country

299
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,367
That lies far beyond the schugle.

300
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,369
What sort of woman?
A white woman.

301
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,006
She told them that she had
escaped from a strange place.

302
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,207
Strange?

303
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,142
And if a man finds the way there,

304
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,226
He will never die.

305
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,728
( snickering )
the catch in that

306
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,598
Is he dies before he gets there!

307
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,734
Hold your trap, Tanya,
you gab too much.

308
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:16,437
Wait.

309
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,423
Is there anything in
the story about fire?

310
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,559
A flame?

311
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,628
Anything you can connect with this?

312
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,965
No, I don't think so.

313
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,566
What's that?

314
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,803
Gold, ain't it?

315
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,205
Yes.

316
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,424
It is gold.

317
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,693
I see.

318
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,862
Well, now you begin to make sense.

319
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,865
So that's what lies
beyond the schugle.

320
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:45,983
No. You don't understand.

321
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,052
Gold isn't what
we're interested in.

322
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,386
Ah.

323
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,589
Suppose I could get
a few natives to go on.

324
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,558
How much could you pay them?

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,976
Anything they asked.

326
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,278
Well, that's liberal enough.

327
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,448
Money no object, eh?

328
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,418
Lads...

329
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,389
No one can say old Dugmore
ever let a white man down.

330
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,524
I'll get natives to go.

331
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,893
I'll run the outfit myself,

332
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,661
And you needn't pay me a penny.

333
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,830
How's that for an offer?
What?

334
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,698
What about those dangers
you talked about?

335
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,068
I'll be frank with you gents--

336
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,569
I figure it's worth some risk

337
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:25,339
To be a partner in
what you're after.

338
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,707
My dear sir, that's absurd.

339
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,210
You can't be a part in
what we're looking for.

340
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,112
I said a partner.

341
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,448
You try to keep me out of this,

342
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,151
And I'll fix it so that
no native in these parts

343
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:40,154
Will come within a
thousand miles of ya.

344
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:44,124
( sinister chuckle )
take it or leave it.

345
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,776
Dugmore: Tanya, here.

346
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,110
( wind whistling )

347
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,895
( dogs barking )

348
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:51,897
I tell you again, Dugmore,
you're crazy.

349
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,632
You can't take a girl up there.

350
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:55,935
Oh, stop rowing about it.
I'm sick of hearing it.

351
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,837
We don't know what
we're getting into.

352
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,255
What's your idea, then?

353
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:00,756
To leave her here alone

354
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,457
With no one around
for 400 miles

355
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,960
Except a lot of wandering chantos

356
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,895
Who'd like to get even with me?

357
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,280
Anyhow, we want
somebody to cook.

358
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:09,915
My dear, has anybody
taken the trouble

359
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,617
To ask you what--
what you want to do?

360
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:13,969
I want to go.

361
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:14,970
There, you see?

362
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:17,740
She wouldn't leave
her poor old pa.

363
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,727
Well, if there were
anyplace to leave her,

364
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,329
I wouldn't let her come along.

365
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,751
Think you'll be all right?

366
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,653
I'm all right.

367
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,721
Come along, let's go.
Let's go.

368
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,156
( man speaking foreign language )

369
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,757
( speaking foreign language )

370
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,711
( dogs barking )

371
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,283
Leo: Hey, Dugmore!

372
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:23,856
Look.

373
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,125
That may lead to a way
over the schugle barrier.

374
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,459
What do you think?

375
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:28,760
Well, let's hope so.

376
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:30,429
We've followed that
cliff for a week

377
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:32,298
Without finding a way through it.

378
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,616
Anyhow, it'll be a
shelter from the wind,

379
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,553
And the dogs can't
go on without a rest.

380
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,555
( man speaking foreign language )

381
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,368
Hurry up with that food, Tanya.

382
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,554
It'll be ready as soon
as I get it thawed out.

383
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,206
Hmm.

384
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,375
I wouldn't mind being
thawed out myself.

385
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:02,527
Leo, this is no place to camp.

386
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,114
But Dugmore says the
dogs need a rest.

387
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,532
I don't like it.

388
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:08,367
Sitting down here
under this wall of ice,

389
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:09,768
It's--it's dangerous.

390
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,920
What's the matter with you now?

391
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,488
What's dangerous?

392
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,524
( rumbling )

393
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,796
There you are.

394
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:22,531
Well, what of it?

395
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,234
You've heard that
several times lately.

396
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:26,685
In this narrow place,

397
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,620
Any noise might start vibrations

398
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:30,355
Which might cause an avalanche.

399
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:31,890
Merely shouting might do it.

400
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:33,458
Aw, pipe down.

401
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,912
Who's lived in the north
for 20 years, me or you?

402
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,298
Lecture yourself out
of that, professor.

403
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,799
You...

404
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,035
Hurry up with that grub.

405
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:47,473
I still don't like it.

406
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,794
( sniffs )

407
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,029
Mmm, smells good.

408
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,998
Tastes good, too--
snow rabbits.

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,716
The ones I shot?

410
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,319
Oh, I'll fix that.

411
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:02,020
You don't have to help me.

412
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,272
But I want to.

413
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,640
You think having me
along is a nuisance.

414
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:06,808
Oh.

415
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,011
We couldn't get
along without you.

416
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:11,646
I wish you really meant that.

417
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,649
I do, honest.

418
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,067
Because I can cook?

419
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,468
( chuckles )
well, not only that,

420
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,320
But there's another reason...

421
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,289
Your father.

422
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,908
If it weren't for you, I couldn't
get along with him for a minute.

423
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,911
But with you here, I find
him at least bearable.

424
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:28,464
I know.

425
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,966
That isn't very
nice of me, is it?

426
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:32,701
I can't blame you, but...

427
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:35,087
I understand.
He's your father.

428
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,855
You see, I was brought up

429
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:39,474
By the Russian sisters
at Yuroshi.

430
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:41,510
The convent broke up
about a year ago,

431
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:44,513
And--and he came and took
me to the trading post.

432
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,015
He said he was my father.

433
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,718
Oh, I begin to understand.

434
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,953
Well, it's all right, really.

435
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,721
But it isn't all right.

436
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,005
When we get back from this trip,

437
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:56,508
I'll teach him how a girl
like you ought to be treated.

438
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,209
If I had a daughter like you,

439
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:01,697
Don't you think I'd love her
and show her that I do?

440
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,165
Would you?

441
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,332
Why, of course I would.

442
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,434
I don't see how he
can help loving you.

443
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,537
Why, you're...You're--

444
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,771
Vincey!

445
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,707
Vincey! Holly! Holly!

446
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,141
What's up?

447
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:15,210
The natives have just
come down from the glacier,

448
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,546
Shrieking something
about a white man.

449
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:20,149
Let's go up and see
what it's about.

450
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,970
( speaking foreign language )

451
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:28,106
They'll show us
the way.

452
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,441
( speaking
foreign language )

453
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:30,742
( shouting
in foreign language )

454
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:33,011
( growling )

455
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,630
Come on.

456
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:09,280
By the lord Harry.

457
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,400
What a beast.

458
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,735
Holly, what is it?

459
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:16,872
Unless I'm barmy, it's--
it's a saber-toothed tiger.

460
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,908
Think of it, man!

461
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,742
That's a new one
on me.

462
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,460
Saber-toothed tiger--

463
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:25,664
They've been extinct for
thousands of years, haven't they?

464
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,982
In all known parts
of the world, yes.

465
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,951
But here...

466
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:32,321
They must've been preserved in that
ice for-- for 400 to 500 years.

467
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:34,690
They must've camped
in this glacier.

468
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:37,926
Look how that man's dressed!

469
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,828
Holly, the servant--

470
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,231
The faithful servant who
was with John Vincey's wife.

471
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,233
What'd the parchment
say, remember?

472
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:45,367
By Jove, Leo, you're right.

473
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,220
He killed the great beast, but
died of the wounds it gave him.

474
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,355
And she escaped
alone, remember?

475
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:53,525
Holly, we found our way,
the way to the flame.

476
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:54,677
Look.

477
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,780
That stiff's got a chain
around his neck,

478
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:02,484
And there's a ripped canvas bag.

479
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:05,553
It's gold.

480
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:09,074
This ice ain't so thick,
and with this ax--

481
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,108
Don't be a fool!

482
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,376
You heard what Holly said

483
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,162
About any vibration
causing an avalanche.

484
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,964
Oh, the professor
says a lot of things.

485
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,406
Come on,
let's get out of here.

486
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:56,822
Dugmore!

487
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,023
Dugmore!

488
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:03,345
( rumbling )

489
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:06,948
Dugmore!!!

490
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,217
Stop it, you fool!

491
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,780
Aah!!

492
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,451
Ohh!! Aah!!

493
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:22,157
There's no hope for the others.

494
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,959
You know that.

495
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,595
I know.

496
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:30,899
No sledges, no food,
and no way back.

497
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,867
And no way forward.

498
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,454
Holly, look.

499
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,413
This was covered by the glacier.

500
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:46,865
It may lead through the barrier.

501
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:50,185
Tanya?

502
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:52,320
All right.

503
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:55,139
At least this is a
shelter from the wind.

504
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,245
Interesting formation.

505
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:02,280
Pity there isn't more light.

506
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,684
Oh, I'm tired.

507
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:10,805
Poor kid, you've had
a tough time of it.

508
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,248
Leo! Leo, Tanya!

509
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,700
Come quick!

510
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,156
Look.

511
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,291
There's our way.

512
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:30,875
Our way? Where?

513
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,494
What are you talking about?

514
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:33,912
Don't you understand?

515
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:36,764
They're fumeroles,
volcanic formation--

516
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:39,434
One hour ago, ice, glacial ice--

517
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:41,602
And now, volcanic heat.

518
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:44,723
I get it--
what uncle John talked about.

519
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:46,091
We could never get through.

520
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:47,593
Of course we can.

521
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:48,860
Listen, Tanya,

522
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:51,129
When I wanted to leave
you at the trading post,

523
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:52,330
What'd you say?

524
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,932
Why, I said I wanted to go.

525
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:55,767
All right, come on.

526
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:05,561
Sulfur, of course.

527
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,362
Phosphorus, too.

528
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:10,047
That accounts for the glow.

529
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:20,876
Well, that's the last of 'em.

530
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,646
Can't we rest a bit?

531
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,723
Look, there's more light.

532
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:38,260
Yes, and another opening.

533
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,638
Aah!

534
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:02,350
Just a minute, Leo, give 'em a
chance to show if they're friendly.

535
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,890
Try your lingo, Tanya.

536
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:13,629
( speaking foreign language )

537
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,530
We--we greet you, my friend.

538
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:22,170
Nagu-da.

539
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,606
Other natives:
Nagu-da, nagu-da.

540
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:27,209
Nagu-da.

541
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,610
Thank you.

542
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:29,828
Nagu-da.

543
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,995
Say it to him, Leo.

544
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,163
Well, what does it mean?

545
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:33,998
"good day" or "how are
you?" or "greetings"

546
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,667
Or something of the kind.

547
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:37,168
Don't--don't judge
'em by their looks.

548
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,070
They're most probably
a very friendly people.

549
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:40,472
Show your confidence in them.

550
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:41,906
You know what it means, Tanya?

551
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:44,076
No.

552
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:49,047
( speaking foreign language )

553
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,032
It's all right, we're coming.

554
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:14,889
( shouting in foreign language )

555
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,067
( all shouting in foreign language )

556
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,308
( laughing )

557
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,612
Well, they seem awfully pleased
to see us, don't they?

558
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:57,315
( shouting continues )

559
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,445
Thank you, thank you.

560
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:12,780
Nagu-da.

561
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:13,948
( giggles )

562
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,532
Nagu-da.

563
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:18,953
You see?
I was right.

564
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:22,423
They're just kind,
hospitable, simple people.

565
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:24,808
I'm not sure they're so simple.

566
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,528
( shouting grows louder )

567
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:35,153
Leo, do you realize
what we're eating?

568
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:36,354
Some sort of melon.

569
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:38,389
It's a pre-melon,
something like papaya.

570
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:39,656
What of it?

571
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:40,958
What of it?

572
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
Tropical fruit here in the arctic?

573
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:44,412
It means there's some
sort of fertile country

574
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,947
Somewhere beyond these caves.

575
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:49,133
It may be what we're looking for.

576
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,387
( drumbeat plays )

577
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:57,024
All: ( chanting ) huh.

578
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:59,960
Huh!

579
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:01,061
Huh!

580
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:02,396
This doesn't look
so good to me.

581
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:03,497
Huh!

582
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:04,666
Nonsense.

583
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:06,067
I suspect it's a
ceremony of welcome.

584
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,002
Huh!

585
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:11,722
Huh!

586
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,725
Huh!

587
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:15,710
Huh!

588
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:17,011
( beat quickens )

589
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:19,013
Huh! Huh!

590
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,681
Huh!

591
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:21,949
Huh!

592
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,217
Huh!

593
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:24,251
Huh!

594
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,353
Huh!

595
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:26,353
Huh!

596
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:27,922
Huh!

597
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:29,156
Huh!

598
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:30,575
Huh!

599
00:30:30,577 --> 00:30:31,659
Huh!

600
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,960
Huh!

601
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:34,245
Huh!

602
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:35,462
Huh!

603
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:36,647
Huh!

604
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:38,332
Huh!

605
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:39,483
Leo.

606
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:41,919
Steady, Tanya, steady.

607
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:45,022
Huh!

608
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,457
Huh!

609
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:47,825
Huh!

610
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,093
Huh!

611
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:51,028
Huh!

612
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,530
Huh!

613
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,101
What's up now?

614
00:30:57,103 --> 00:30:59,286
As I told you, a
ceremony of welcome.

615
00:30:59,288 --> 00:31:00,904
Huh!

616
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,206
Huh!

617
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,941
Huh!

618
00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:05,476
Huh!

619
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:06,944
Huh!

620
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,679
Huh! Huh! Huh!

621
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,047
I don't like this.

622
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,850
Oh, nonsense, it's--
it's most interesting.

623
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,985
( drumbeat and chanting
continues )

624
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:24,678
Come with me.

625
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:55,909
Aah!!!

626
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,646
Uhh!

627
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,620
Leo!

628
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,810
( man shouting in
foreign language )

629
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:49,845
( continues in foreign language )

630
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:01,024
Are you all right, Leo?

631
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,409
( speaking foreign language )

632
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:16,272
Nagu-da?

633
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:19,409
( speaking foreign language )

634
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:23,529
( continues in foreign language )

635
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,995
( all talking at once )

636
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,995
( continues in foreign language )

637
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,567
( speaking foreign language )

638
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:01,834
I...I-I-I thought...

639
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:02,968
Steady, Leo.

640
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,587
Leo, you are hurt.

641
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:06,222
( man speaking foreign language )

642
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:08,524
Holly, watch him.

643
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,025
Tanya: Wait, please!

644
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:11,561
Old gentleman...

645
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:14,997
My friend, him very sick.

646
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,167
No can walk.

647
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:20,503
You get out...Out.

648
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:23,223
Let him...Ride.

649
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,575
Oh, Holly, I'm trying to tell him

650
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,227
That Leo can't walk
any further.

651
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:29,562
Holly: You old idiot,

652
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:31,531
Can't you see for
yourself he's hurt?

653
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:35,568
( speaking foreign language )

654
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:38,154
Oh!

655
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:40,873
Holly, he's dying.

656
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,375
No, no, Tanya.

657
00:34:42,377 --> 00:34:44,477
Bad concussion, I'm afraid.

658
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,745
( with accent )
do not be afraid.

659
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:49,449
He will not die.

660
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:54,536
But--but how can you
know English?

661
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:58,508
I have a wise teacher
who knows all tongues.

662
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,976
( speaking foreign language )

663
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,811
But wait, wait.

664
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:03,178
Who--who was your teacher?

665
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,765
What is this place?
Where are we going?

666
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:06,849
What--what's gonna happen?

667
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:10,403
You will learn your fate
from hash-a-mo-tep.

668
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:13,523
( speaking foreign language )

669
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:19,529
Tanya, Tanya.

670
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:20,930
It's all right, Leo.

671
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:38,163
( speaking foreign language )

672
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:49,559
I say, this is incredible!

673
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:51,477
What is this place?

674
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:53,212
Country of kor.

675
00:35:53,214 --> 00:35:54,880
Kor?

676
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:03,239
Tanya, think of it--

677
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,590
You're seeing something

678
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:05,992
That nobody ever dreamed existed.

679
00:36:05,994 --> 00:36:07,159
Hush.

680
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:09,261
Aren't you interested?
No.

681
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:19,555
( shouting in foreign language )

682
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:24,276
( continues shouting )

683
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:46,065
( continues in foreign language )

684
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:49,285
( plays slow drumbeat )

685
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:08,421
That mountain...

686
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:11,307
There are stairs
and a great door.

687
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:12,959
What is it?

688
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:14,877
It's the palace
of hash-a-mo-tep,

689
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,547
Hollowed in the heart
of the mountain.

690
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:47,843
( chimes )

691
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:31,620
( speaking foreign language )

692
00:38:45,952 --> 00:38:47,904
( continues in foreign language )

693
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:49,805
( woman speaking foreign language )

694
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,306
( continues in foreign language )

695
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:52,691
Woman:
Speak in English, then,

696
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:55,427
So the strangers may understand.

697
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:58,214
Returning from the journey
on which you sent me,

698
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,284
I passed the place where
dwelled the peoples

699
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:02,668
Of the caves.

700
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,588
I weary of those people.

701
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,091
There, I found these strangers
fighting for their lives.

702
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:10,843
The cave people would
have killed them.

703
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:13,596
Against my order,
known these many years

704
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:15,965
That any stranger must be
brought to me unharmed?

705
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:19,051
Have not their fathers
and their fathers' fathers

706
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:22,004
Taught them that my word is law?

707
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,523
They await your
judgment, o queen.

708
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:27,059
They shall not go unpunished.

709
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:30,228
What is your name, stranger?

710
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,764
Holly, o queen.

711
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:33,932
Welcome, Holly,

712
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:36,953
Though you are not
he for whom I wait.

713
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:38,421
But I don't understand.

714
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:39,822
Why should you?

715
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,758
What do you know
of immortal dreams,

716
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,328
Immortal memories?

717
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,979
But who are you?

718
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:49,982
I am yesterday and
today and tomorrow.

719
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:53,785
I am sorrow and longing
and hope unfulfilled.

720
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:56,506
I am hash-a-mo-tep, she--

721
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:59,475
She who must be obeyed.

722
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:02,345
I am...I.

723
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:04,347
But you speak my language.

724
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:05,815
How is that?

725
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:08,718
I learned it from
a countryman of yours

726
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,685
Long ago.

727
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:10,987
What's that?

728
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,587
You mean there's been
another Englishman here

729
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,240
In your lifetime?

730
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:16,475
Who? How long ago?

731
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:20,429
See that the strangers
are well-treated, Billali.

732
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:22,798
I will decide later
what they shall do.

733
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,983
And the other one?
The other?

734
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:27,102
A young man, wounded in the fight.

735
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:28,504
I thought--

736
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:30,105
( angrily ) you thought?!

737
00:40:30,107 --> 00:40:31,607
Bring him to me at once!

738
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:37,847
( speaking foreign language )

739
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,999
( speaking foreign language )

740
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:44,436
It's not enough
that I should wait in hope

741
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:45,905
Unending years in pain.

742
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:48,507
Then you forget my orders,
disobey my commands.

743
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:51,427
Who gives you leave to
think contrary to my will?!

744
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:05,874
Nearer, bring him nearer.

745
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:11,697
That's it!

746
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,532
Aah!!!

747
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:05,217
John Vincey...John Vincey!

748
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,802
( gasps )

749
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:08,270
Oh, my love...

750
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:11,039
My dearest love.

751
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:13,409
At last.

752
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:17,162
You're hurt.

753
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:19,815
Billali...

754
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:22,551
Billali, take him to my chamber.

755
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,287
Through the forbidden door?

756
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:27,590
Yes.

757
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:29,825
And bear him gently.

758
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,293
( speaking foreign language )

759
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:47,176
Please let me go with him!

760
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:51,430
Who are you?
You are his wife?

761
00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:52,664
No! I'm nothing to him!

762
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,333
But he needs someone!

763
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,102
He will not be alone.

764
00:42:58,438 --> 00:43:01,239
Tanya: No!! Leo!!

765
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:04,810
Oh, please, please let me go!

766
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:07,362
Let me go with him, I tell you!

767
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:09,681
Let me go! Leo!

768
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,117
Leo!

769
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:09,127
I--I just had to see how he is.

770
00:46:10,764 --> 00:46:12,898
What gives you so much courage?

771
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,767
Can you help him?

772
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:18,337
He will wake from his
sleep refreshed and well.

773
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:19,638
There's no need to fear.

774
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,740
Are you sure?

775
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:24,242
Yes. Look if you will.

776
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:25,977
Then leave.

777
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:39,141
How often have I watched
beside him lying so.

778
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,881
But now, this is warm.

779
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:47,182
Flesh.

780
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:57,593
He needs nothing you have to give.

781
00:46:57,595 --> 00:46:59,294
Go now.

782
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,746
Go before he wakes.

783
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,849
And forget him.
He is not for you.

784
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:12,090
( rings gong )

785
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,100
Why do you hate me?

786
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:23,502
Hate you?

787
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:26,538
Why, you're nothing.

788
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,673
Nothing.

789
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:32,177
Once, long ago,

790
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:35,480
A woman like you
destroyed my happiness.

791
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:40,636
The same thing shall
not happen again.

792
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,343
How's Leo?

793
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:49,912
Leo?

794
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:52,314
You know, my friend.
Vincey.

795
00:47:52,316 --> 00:47:54,366
Vincey. Oh, yes.

796
00:47:54,368 --> 00:47:57,119
Have no fear.
She will heal him.

797
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,404
I see.

798
00:47:59,406 --> 00:48:00,672
Look here...

799
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:04,809
You're the most important
man in the country, aren't you?

800
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:09,498
I have served she continuously
for more than half a century.

801
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,836
What?! Half a century?
You're joking.

802
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:16,638
You think I'm too young?

803
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,074
Oddly enough, I wasn't
thinking about you.

804
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,691
What are you doing?

805
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:38,944
It's an old English custom.

806
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:40,696
What is it?

807
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:43,498
Smoking. Don't you smoke?

808
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,568
Smoke and fire.

809
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:49,088
Do you worship the flame?

810
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,822
Of course, old boy.

811
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:52,223
Don't you?

812
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:54,927
It will soon be time
for the yearly offering

813
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:56,611
In the hall of kings.

814
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:59,614
There you may see the
sacred fires rekindled

815
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:02,251
If she permits you to be present.

816
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:07,022
You think if I showed her this?

817
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:10,158
( gasps )

818
00:49:12,512 --> 00:49:15,179
What's the matter?
What does it mean?

819
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:17,315
Are you tired
of life?

820
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:19,918
Then question she concerning that.

821
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,553
But tell me...

822
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:24,522
Who is this who stands in fire?

823
00:49:24,524 --> 00:49:26,425
Ask no more questions,
I tell you.

824
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:28,577
It is she's own secret.

825
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:29,761
Put it away.

826
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:31,196
Very well.

827
00:49:31,198 --> 00:49:32,196
I thought that you might know.

828
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:33,499
How should I know?

829
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,966
She goes alone.

830
00:49:34,968 --> 00:49:36,234
Alone?

831
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:37,636
On such a long journey?

832
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:39,321
Long journey?

833
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:41,623
No. There in the hall of--

834
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:46,361
You're cunning.

835
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:47,730
I said too much already.

836
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:49,814
Well, just tell me
one more thing.

837
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:51,900
How long has she ruled
over kor?

838
00:49:51,902 --> 00:49:54,135
All her life.

839
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,570
But...

840
00:49:59,726 --> 00:50:00,759
Tanya, what's happened?

841
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:02,260
She wouldn't let me stay.

842
00:50:02,262 --> 00:50:03,729
She is with Leo.

843
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:04,763
You saw him?

844
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:05,931
He's still asleep.

845
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:07,666
She says he'll be well
when he wakes.

846
00:50:07,668 --> 00:50:10,068
Oh, but, Holly, Holly, I'm afraid.

847
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,539
I--I feel something evil about her.

848
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:16,408
She would not let you
stay to speak with him?

849
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,944
You mean that she is
planning to keep us apart?

850
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:20,111
What nonsense.

851
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:21,880
Leo will have something
to say about that.

852
00:50:21,882 --> 00:50:23,515
You think so?

853
00:50:23,517 --> 00:50:25,116
But you may see him.

854
00:50:25,118 --> 00:50:29,054
She has commanded that you
both be present at the trial.

855
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:32,490
You mean the trial of
the men who attacked us?

856
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:36,828
Punishment of the men
who injured him.

857
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,064
( speaks foreign language )

858
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:41,450
What does it mean?

859
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:44,603
She knows Leo.

860
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:48,540
She says he belongs to her.

861
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:50,792
She called him John Vincey.

862
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:54,963
But, Holly, how could
she know John Vincey?

863
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:56,765
How could she?

864
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,634
I want to believe it.

865
00:50:58,636 --> 00:51:00,668
Suppose it's true?

866
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:03,120
Suppose it's true?!

867
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,590
Did you dream I was
watching while you slept?

868
00:51:57,692 --> 00:52:00,693
I dreamed of a man
dead for centuries.

869
00:52:00,695 --> 00:52:03,863
And you called me by his name.

870
00:52:03,865 --> 00:52:05,598
Dreams are only memories

871
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,535
In the endless flow of time.

872
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:11,672
Who are you?

873
00:52:49,744 --> 00:52:51,077
Drink.

874
00:52:58,253 --> 00:53:01,321
( speaking foreign language )

875
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:08,679
Had I known you were coming,

876
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:11,698
You would've been welcomed
like a king.

877
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,473
Where are my friends?

878
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:23,310
Take the food.
Be strong again.

879
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:26,163
But Tanya, the girl who was--

880
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:28,348
She is here in my palace.

881
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,251
I remember vaguely.

882
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:33,886
Someone brought us here...

883
00:53:34,822 --> 00:53:37,324
And you said--
what?

884
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:40,077
It's all foggy now.

885
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:45,399
Who are you?

886
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:47,634
You do not remember?

887
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:49,119
How can I?

888
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:51,205
I've never seen you before.

889
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:53,389
I was so sure
when you came at last

890
00:53:53,391 --> 00:53:55,592
You would remember.

891
00:53:55,594 --> 00:53:59,579
I was so sure
you could not forget.

892
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:03,883
I have summoned slaves
to attend you.

893
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:05,786
Later, you will hear
my judgment on those

894
00:54:05,788 --> 00:54:07,921
Who dared attack you.

895
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:13,744
But wait...

896
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:16,630
Tell me, how is it
you speak my language?

897
00:54:17,665 --> 00:54:20,984
And still, you do not understand.

898
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:43,273
I say, Tanya, what--
what's the meaning of this?

899
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:44,808
Where'd you get that outfit?

900
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,844
From the old man.
Billali?

901
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:50,714
He said I was to put it on
and look as well as I could.

902
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:52,999
I wonder why he cares how you look.

903
00:54:54,068 --> 00:54:56,436
Good. Young man will be pleased.

904
00:54:56,438 --> 00:54:57,671
How is Leo?

905
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:00,156
That, you will soon
discover for yourself.

906
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:01,141
Come.

907
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,429
If he's well, he will go
back to his own country?

908
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:07,897
Oh, yes.

909
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:10,433
Why, of course he will.

910
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:14,437
Then, I hope he'll soon be
well enough to travel.

911
00:55:26,434 --> 00:55:28,201
Tanya...And Holly.

912
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:29,852
Glad to see ya, how are ya?

913
00:55:29,854 --> 00:55:31,572
That's just what
I was gonna ask you,

914
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:32,906
But there's no need.

915
00:55:32,908 --> 00:55:35,208
Listen, Leo, I think
I've got some big news for you.

916
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,860
Leo, are you sure
you're all right?

917
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,044
How do I look?

918
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,397
Want me to squeeze ya
and try my strength?

919
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:43,333
( bugles sound )

920
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,975
Listen to this, I pumped
old Billali about the flame--

921
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:53,093
Shh!

922
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:58,231
She summons you.
Sit near the throne.

923
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,668
Go ahead, o king.

924
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,670
Aw. Come on, the both of ya.

925
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:04,938
You alone.

926
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,640
You two, come with me.

927
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:07,841
Huh?

928
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:09,342
Well, Leo, I'll see you later.

929
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:10,944
Got lots to tell you.

930
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,956
There are marvels to be seen today.

931
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:25,192
A stranger shares the throne,

932
00:56:25,194 --> 00:56:28,445
Where I may scarce approach.

933
00:56:28,447 --> 00:56:29,479
Hmm.

934
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:31,330
Come.

935
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:52,017
I've summoned you, Holly,

936
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:55,254
That you may observe how
justice is meted out in kor.

937
00:56:57,323 --> 00:56:59,425
Let the prisoners stand forth.

938
00:57:02,196 --> 00:57:05,130
( speaking foreign language )

939
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,244
( grunting )

940
00:57:20,664 --> 00:57:23,549
You earth-born people...

941
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:27,486
You haunters of darkness,

942
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:30,022
How you try my patience.

943
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:34,443
Point out those who
were reckless enough

944
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:35,878
To lay hands upon you.

945
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:41,183
Well, I'll point out
those I'm sure of.

946
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:52,912
Those two men there.

947
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:02,220
And this one.

948
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,593
This man.
I believe he was the leader.

949
00:58:14,418 --> 00:58:15,918
That's all.

950
00:58:18,405 --> 00:58:21,040
Only four, out of all
those men, attacked you?

951
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:23,593
That's all I'm sure of.

952
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:26,862
They will die.

953
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:29,248
What?

954
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:32,535
They shall be put to death.

955
00:58:32,537 --> 00:58:35,321
But I don't want that.

956
00:58:35,323 --> 00:58:37,322
Would you spare them?

957
00:58:38,775 --> 00:58:42,395
Oh, yes...A christian.

958
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,265
I'd almost forgotten.

959
00:58:46,267 --> 00:58:49,952
I remember in the market
place of Jerusalem,

960
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:54,389
They spoke of a man who
taught mercy and forgiveness.

961
00:58:54,391 --> 00:58:56,359
A man who died

962
00:58:56,361 --> 00:58:59,278
So that others might live,

963
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,898
As though death
could beget life.

964
00:59:06,202 --> 00:59:08,554
Tell them to stand up, Billali.

965
00:59:08,556 --> 00:59:11,023
( speaking foreign language )

966
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:26,071
( speaking
foreign language )

967
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:31,977
( continues
in foreign language )

968
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:47,693
( whimpering )

969
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,197
Aah!!

970
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:52,598
No!!

971
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,965
How could you be so calm

972
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,634
And send people
to their deaths like that?

973
00:59:55,636 --> 00:59:56,819
Silence!

974
00:59:56,821 --> 00:59:59,705
Is the girl
also tired of life?

975
00:59:59,707 --> 01:00:01,023
I'm not afraid of you.

976
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:02,558
Tanya.

977
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,810
She: There is an end
of my indulgence.

978
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:06,712
Come away, Tanya.

979
01:00:06,714 --> 01:00:08,647
Leo: Yes, Holly,
go with her.

980
01:00:11,118 --> 01:00:12,935
I'm the one
who spoke out of turn.

981
01:00:12,937 --> 01:00:14,370
We don't want
these fellows butchered

982
01:00:14,372 --> 01:00:16,421
Just because we
had a fight with them.

983
01:00:16,423 --> 01:00:18,791
Punish them if you like,
but-- but not that.

984
01:00:22,896 --> 01:00:26,432
Do you think I'm cruel
for the sake of cruelty?

985
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:28,083
Then why do you torture them?

986
01:00:28,085 --> 01:00:30,586
How do you think I
rule these people?

987
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:33,155
It's not by force.

988
01:00:33,157 --> 01:00:35,074
It's by terror.

989
01:00:36,409 --> 01:00:39,661
My empire is of the imagination.

990
01:00:39,663 --> 01:00:42,114
Still, I beg you, stop this.

991
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,585
( speaking foreign language )

992
01:00:46,587 --> 01:00:48,253
( speaking foreign language )

993
01:00:56,613 --> 01:00:58,614
Thanks. That makes
me feel a lot better,

994
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:00,616
All of us.

995
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:03,519
And don't hold anything
against Tanya.

996
01:01:03,521 --> 01:01:06,605
What is that girl to you?

997
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:11,794
Nothing, I...I feel
responsible for her.

998
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,651
May I--do you mind if I go now?

999
01:01:19,653 --> 01:01:21,771
I'd like to tell her
everything's all right.

1000
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:24,589
Go, then.

1001
01:01:38,722 --> 01:01:41,507
Yes, Billali?

1002
01:01:41,509 --> 01:01:43,709
The prisoners...

1003
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:47,612
Are they to be turned
back to the caves?

1004
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:51,733
No. Kill them.

1005
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:53,185
All?

1006
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:55,154
All. Kill them.

1007
01:01:55,156 --> 01:01:57,489
Make an end.

1008
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:07,182
Would I could kill
my fears so easily.

1009
01:02:10,702 --> 01:02:12,203
She's wicked, I tell you.

1010
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:14,138
Don't be too hard on her, Tanya.

1011
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,623
She's strange...

1012
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,058
And wonderful.

1013
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,160
Well, after all, she didn't
go through with it.

1014
01:02:19,162 --> 01:02:22,062
She would've killed
them, except for you.

1015
01:02:22,064 --> 01:02:25,066
Listen, Leo, I've got it.

1016
01:02:26,268 --> 01:02:27,535
Got what?

1017
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:29,854
We're going to find out
everything we want to know

1018
01:02:29,856 --> 01:02:31,189
Through you.

1019
01:02:31,191 --> 01:02:32,724
Good idea, huh?

1020
01:02:32,726 --> 01:02:34,358
What is there to find out

1021
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,960
Except how to escape
from this horrible place?

1022
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,030
You should've seen Billali
when I showed him this.

1023
01:02:40,032 --> 01:02:42,132
Almost knocked his
forehead on the floor,

1024
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,634
Frightened out of his wits.

1025
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:46,037
Said it was she's secret.

1026
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,072
Well, why didn't you tell me?

1027
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:49,424
All in good time.

1028
01:02:49,426 --> 01:02:51,309
We don't know the secret yet,

1029
01:02:51,311 --> 01:02:53,160
But I'll wager pounds to pence

1030
01:02:53,162 --> 01:02:55,880
That you're the one person
who can get it from her.

1031
01:02:55,882 --> 01:02:58,866
Leo, please don't go to her.

1032
01:02:58,868 --> 01:03:01,636
Don't you worry, Tanya.

1033
01:03:01,638 --> 01:03:04,806
Holly, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this.

1034
01:03:04,808 --> 01:03:07,275
If she knows where
the flame burns,

1035
01:03:07,277 --> 01:03:09,576
We're going to find it.

1036
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:14,349
Leo...

1037
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,369
It's hard to be kept waiting
when one has waited so long.

1038
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:37,004
You must have known I'd come.

1039
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:39,957
Do you think blind chance
brought you here?

1040
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:42,359
I came because of an old story.

1041
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,028
A woman escaped from this country

1042
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,797
And told of a strange adventure

1043
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:47,131
And died.

1044
01:03:47,133 --> 01:03:49,133
She left this for her son.

1045
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,421
This woman was the wife of--

1046
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:54,789
John Vincey.

1047
01:03:55,807 --> 01:03:58,876
John Vincey died 500 years ago.

1048
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,045
How can you know his name?

1049
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,095
Think back, far back.

1050
01:04:17,097 --> 01:04:20,031
Oh, my beloved...

1051
01:04:20,033 --> 01:04:22,132
You will, you can--

1052
01:04:22,134 --> 01:04:26,588
Another life, a far-off
forgotten place...

1053
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:29,574
This place.

1054
01:04:29,576 --> 01:04:32,393
And my voice uttering words
you vowed to remember

1055
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:33,994
Through endless time.

1056
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,630
Think.

1057
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:41,302
Your voice?

1058
01:04:41,304 --> 01:04:43,454
You...Were you the same?

1059
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:46,023
Always to you, always,

1060
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:49,059
Offering all, wanting all.

1061
01:04:49,061 --> 01:04:52,379
You mean, we...

1062
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:54,148
I can't believe...

1063
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,283
I have no memories.

1064
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:02,624
I will show you how to look
across the mist of time.

1065
01:05:22,327 --> 01:05:25,596
That one moment out
of all the centuries.

1066
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,468
That one instant when
I felt myself beloved.

1067
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,969
Who was that man?

1068
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:33,804
You do not know?

1069
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,138
No, it can't be.

1070
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,292
I dare not believe it.

1071
01:05:37,294 --> 01:05:39,277
You will believe.

1072
01:05:46,668 --> 01:05:48,335
Come.

1073
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:03,785
Do you wonder whose feet
have worn away this rock?

1074
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:06,220
Once, this stair
was new and level.

1075
01:06:06,222 --> 01:06:09,457
But I've passed here day by day.

1076
01:06:09,459 --> 01:06:11,476
And, see, my sandals

1077
01:06:11,478 --> 01:06:14,579
Have eaten off the solid stone.

1078
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:18,849
Now, in a moment, you will
remember that other life.

1079
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:41,989
I...I see myself.

1080
01:06:43,592 --> 01:06:45,943
Swept by the tides of time

1081
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:48,029
Back to my arms.

1082
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:55,002
Centuries ago, you
were someone else,

1083
01:06:55,004 --> 01:06:56,453
As I was this man here.

1084
01:06:56,455 --> 01:06:58,389
No, no. I'm the same.

1085
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:00,625
My life and youth endured.

1086
01:07:00,627 --> 01:07:02,026
All through the years,

1087
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,796
I've mourned here
where your body lay.

1088
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:06,179
But now...

1089
01:07:43,368 --> 01:07:45,136
You are reborn,

1090
01:07:45,138 --> 01:07:48,055
And my mourning has ended.

1091
01:07:48,057 --> 01:07:51,692
Your coming is the sign
of my forgiveness.

1092
01:07:51,694 --> 01:07:53,094
Forgiveness?

1093
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:56,080
For what?

1094
01:07:56,082 --> 01:07:58,249
I know why you've come to call.

1095
01:07:58,251 --> 01:08:00,618
You seek the flame of life.

1096
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,520
Even as I came, a young girl,

1097
01:08:03,522 --> 01:08:05,506
So many lives ago.

1098
01:08:05,508 --> 01:08:08,893
I took the burden of
immortality upon my shoulders

1099
01:08:08,895 --> 01:08:11,144
And wore it through
unbelievable years--

1100
01:08:11,146 --> 01:08:12,480
Dark, with a loneliness

1101
01:08:12,482 --> 01:08:14,181
Through which there
shone a single light,

1102
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:16,116
Fixed and unwavering--

1103
01:08:16,118 --> 01:08:17,935
The hope of love...

1104
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:21,789
And so I waited,

1105
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:24,892
Waited for a bridegroom

1106
01:08:24,894 --> 01:08:28,178
Whose passion for life
would be as fierce as my own.

1107
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,165
You came, John Vincey,

1108
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,867
And I loved you.

1109
01:08:32,869 --> 01:08:35,519
For one moment, you were mine.

1110
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:38,422
Then you turned from me.

1111
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:41,809
You had not come alone.

1112
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:44,645
And, in my jealousy, I...

1113
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:46,113
I killed you.

1114
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:51,535
Again, I waited, seeming
longer than before.

1115
01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:53,604
But I knew you must return.

1116
01:08:53,606 --> 01:08:56,541
Your love of life must
be stronger than death.

1117
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,644
And now you're here,

1118
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:03,564
Nothing shall stand between us.

1119
01:09:03,566 --> 01:09:05,416
But I'm not John Vincey.

1120
01:09:05,418 --> 01:09:07,534
Oh, my love.

1121
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:09,203
Take away my eyes.

1122
01:09:09,205 --> 01:09:11,204
Let darkness utterly shut me in,

1123
01:09:11,206 --> 01:09:13,374
And still my ears
would know the sound

1124
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,543
Of your unforgotten voice.

1125
01:09:15,545 --> 01:09:17,828
If I could only remember.

1126
01:09:19,965 --> 01:09:21,665
If you've forgotten me,

1127
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:25,869
Then that woman who
held you in spite of me...

1128
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:28,405
You've forgotten her as well?

1129
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:30,257
Yes.

1130
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:31,759
I've forgotten.

1131
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:34,328
She wasn't beautiful.

1132
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:37,364
She had no wisdom such as mine.

1133
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:40,401
Yet, you could never
quite leave her.

1134
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:43,738
I've forgotten everything but you.

1135
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,122
Everything--
no, no.

1136
01:09:45,124 --> 01:09:47,892
Now, as then, we two are
made of different clay.

1137
01:09:47,894 --> 01:09:50,828
Until you are as I
am, come no nearer.

1138
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,738
Today, in the hall of kings,

1139
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,707
The priest makes
sacrifice in gratitude

1140
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:05,142
For my enduring youth.

1141
01:10:05,144 --> 01:10:07,478
Then you shall come with me

1142
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,097
And share my secret.

1143
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:20,324
Leo!

1144
01:10:20,326 --> 01:10:23,660
I say, Leo, what did you find out?

1145
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:28,181
I've seen John Vincey.

1146
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:29,583
What?

1147
01:10:29,585 --> 01:10:31,118
I tell you, I saw him!

1148
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,671
Now, be reasonable.

1149
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:36,123
John Vincey's been dead
for--for 500 years.

1150
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,842
I--I tell you, I--

1151
01:10:37,844 --> 01:10:39,776
I saw him lying there.

1152
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:45,266
Holly, it was I, myself.

1153
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,971
Now, one thing at a time.

1154
01:10:49,973 --> 01:10:52,205
You mean a mummified body
that looked like you?

1155
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:53,557
No, no, Holly.

1156
01:10:53,559 --> 01:10:55,225
I saw myself lying there.

1157
01:10:55,227 --> 01:10:57,828
Are you trying to make me
believe in reincarnation?

1158
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,162
Rats! You knew before

1159
01:10:59,164 --> 01:11:01,065
That you were the image
of John Vincey.

1160
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:02,199
We both knew that.

1161
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:04,551
She has been waiting
for me to come back.

1162
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,804
She says I am John Vincey.

1163
01:11:06,806 --> 01:11:08,589
Leo, don't listen to her!

1164
01:11:08,591 --> 01:11:10,274
Let's get away
while there's time.

1165
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:13,577
Holly, she is going
to show me the flame.

1166
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:14,912
What? Do you hear that, Tanya?

1167
01:11:14,914 --> 01:11:17,281
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

1168
01:11:17,283 --> 01:11:18,582
When?

1169
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,305
When do we go?

1170
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:28,441
You are not
to see it.

1171
01:11:28,443 --> 01:11:29,777
But you said--

1172
01:11:29,779 --> 01:11:31,679
I said she promised me the secret.

1173
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:34,481
Well, then, I see.

1174
01:11:34,483 --> 01:11:36,116
Only you?

1175
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:37,735
Yes.

1176
01:11:37,737 --> 01:11:39,620
Oh.

1177
01:11:39,622 --> 01:11:40,987
You can't stay here.

1178
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:43,240
You'll go back the way
we came, you and Tanya,

1179
01:11:43,242 --> 01:11:44,992
As soon as the temple
ceremony is over.

1180
01:11:44,994 --> 01:11:46,360
You'll be protected.

1181
01:11:46,362 --> 01:11:48,278
Then I go to the flame.

1182
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,630
Leo...

1183
01:11:49,632 --> 01:11:51,148
Don't lose your head,

1184
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,449
Use it!

1185
01:11:52,451 --> 01:11:53,834
I haven't lost my head.

1186
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:56,470
I've found memories
you can't even imagine.

1187
01:11:56,472 --> 01:11:59,406
I've seen strangeness,
beauty, power--

1188
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:00,907
Yes, immortality--

1189
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:02,376
And I can share it.

1190
01:12:02,378 --> 01:12:03,761
But only I.

1191
01:12:03,763 --> 01:12:05,279
Those are her terms.

1192
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:08,182
What man would say no?
Be fair.

1193
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:11,152
Very well.

1194
01:12:11,154 --> 01:12:14,055
I'll take Tanya
back with me.

1195
01:12:14,057 --> 01:12:16,290
But let me tell you
one thing, Leo--

1196
01:12:16,292 --> 01:12:17,825
You're a fool,

1197
01:12:17,827 --> 01:12:19,459
And you'll die
for your folly

1198
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:21,796
Like your ancestor
John Vincey.

1199
01:12:44,886 --> 01:12:46,336
Leo.

1200
01:12:48,006 --> 01:12:49,539
I'm sorry, Tanya.

1201
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,809
Don't think of me,
think of yourself.

1202
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:54,095
I am thinking
of myself.

1203
01:12:54,097 --> 01:12:55,612
To live forever, it's--

1204
01:12:55,614 --> 01:12:57,598
It's what all men
have dreamed of.

1205
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,366
What's the use of living
a thousand years,

1206
01:12:59,368 --> 01:13:01,935
If you're going on
being cruel and selfish?

1207
01:13:01,937 --> 01:13:04,371
Is a thousand years of that
any better than 70?

1208
01:13:04,373 --> 01:13:06,006
But people would
change, grow good.

1209
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:07,657
Has she grown good?

1210
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:10,544
Yes.

1211
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:12,312
Did she let
John Vincey escape?

1212
01:13:12,314 --> 01:13:14,514
Would she
let you escape if...

1213
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,216
If you loved me?

1214
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:19,820
Tanya, I...

1215
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:22,489
You're not tempted as I am.

1216
01:13:22,491 --> 01:13:25,926
Think of it-- never to grow
old, never to feel age.

1217
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:28,512
I can't give it up.

1218
01:13:34,136 --> 01:13:38,421
You will live here
in this--this tomb...

1219
01:13:38,423 --> 01:13:41,274
Always young
with her.

1220
01:13:41,276 --> 01:13:44,544
You will never know
age nor grief.

1221
01:13:46,414 --> 01:13:48,749
That isn't the kind
of love I want.

1222
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:51,235
What is it you want?

1223
01:13:51,237 --> 01:13:53,286
Why...

1224
01:13:53,288 --> 01:13:55,689
Why..

1225
01:13:55,691 --> 01:13:59,994
Just two people
to live together

1226
01:13:59,996 --> 01:14:02,529
And to love each other.

1227
01:14:02,531 --> 01:14:06,333
To laugh
at little things and--

1228
01:14:06,335 --> 01:14:09,803
And sometimes cry
over big ones.

1229
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:13,106
To share what--
whatever comes along.

1230
01:14:13,108 --> 01:14:16,510
And to grow old together.

1231
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:18,612
And, someday,

1232
01:14:18,614 --> 01:14:21,815
When one is gone...

1233
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:25,969
To hope to be
together again somewhere.

1234
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:32,325
That isn't much
to offer, is it?

1235
01:14:32,327 --> 01:14:36,664
Compared to kingdoms
and power and glory

1236
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:39,200
That will never change.

1237
01:14:44,956 --> 01:14:46,356
Tanya...

1238
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:48,609
Hail, Vincey!

1239
01:14:50,796 --> 01:14:53,547
Hash-a-mo-tep
sends me to tell you

1240
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:55,049
That the festival
of the sacred well

1241
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:57,451
Will begin
at the setting of the sun.

1242
01:14:57,453 --> 01:15:00,354
You and Holly will be guided
through the hall of kings.

1243
01:15:00,356 --> 01:15:01,771
And Tanya?

1244
01:15:01,773 --> 01:15:03,407
The lady may not come.

1245
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:06,009
No woman may view
the ceremony of the well

1246
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:07,511
But the maidens
of the temple.

1247
01:15:07,513 --> 01:15:10,814
I don't want to see
any more ceremonies.

1248
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,485
I'm going
to talk to Holly again.

1249
01:15:18,373 --> 01:15:19,873
Tanya...

1250
01:15:35,856 --> 01:15:37,291
Man: Stop--

1251
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:39,092
Tanya: I must,
I've got to talk to her!

1252
01:15:39,094 --> 01:15:40,494
( speaks foreign language )

1253
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:43,230
Oh, why can't I
make you understand?

1254
01:15:44,365 --> 01:15:45,966
( speaking
foreign language )

1255
01:15:52,607 --> 01:15:55,308
I'm sorry, I...

1256
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:58,578
They wouldn't let me pass,
and I had to see you.

1257
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,748
Well?

1258
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,282
You--you
are sending us away.

1259
01:16:02,284 --> 01:16:05,235
You will return
to your own country.

1260
01:16:05,237 --> 01:16:08,171
Yes, I know.
Leo told us.

1261
01:16:08,173 --> 01:16:11,876
But...Please...

1262
01:16:16,064 --> 01:16:17,932
What is it you want?

1263
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:21,668
Let Leo come with us.
Send him away, too.

1264
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:25,038
Send him away?
Are you mad?

1265
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,007
Please.

1266
01:16:27,009 --> 01:16:30,110
He came here
following a dream--

1267
01:16:30,112 --> 01:16:31,912
A dream men
have followed

1268
01:16:31,914 --> 01:16:34,681
Since the first son
saw his father die.

1269
01:16:34,683 --> 01:16:37,584
He alone, of all men,
has realized that dream,

1270
01:16:37,586 --> 01:16:40,020
And you ask me
to send him away,

1271
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:42,089
To send him back to you

1272
01:16:42,091 --> 01:16:44,374
And your little mortal love.

1273
01:16:44,376 --> 01:16:46,776
No, no. Even if he
never loves me...

1274
01:16:46,778 --> 01:16:49,012
Why, I have
to make you understand.

1275
01:16:49,014 --> 01:16:50,881
It's not for myself.

1276
01:16:50,883 --> 01:16:52,532
I'm pleading for him.

1277
01:16:52,534 --> 01:16:54,901
You're pleading for him?

1278
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:58,138
What can you or the world
you live in offer him

1279
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,908
That will last longer
than a miserable human life?

1280
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:06,113
After the festival
in the hall of kings,

1281
01:17:06,115 --> 01:17:09,516
There will be slaves
waiting at the outer wall

1282
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:13,453
To guide you in safety
to your little world.

1283
01:17:14,956 --> 01:17:16,906
Go now.

1284
01:17:16,908 --> 01:17:19,026
Go if you fear my anger.

1285
01:17:27,402 --> 01:17:29,286
Then if you
won't send him back,

1286
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:31,805
Well, will you
let me stay here

1287
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:33,940
Where I
can see him sometimes?

1288
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:35,609
What harm can that do?

1289
01:17:35,611 --> 01:17:37,611
What can it
take away from you?

1290
01:17:37,613 --> 01:17:39,163
You will have everything.

1291
01:17:39,165 --> 01:17:40,964
You will have him.

1292
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:42,800
I shall have nothing

1293
01:17:42,802 --> 01:17:45,251
If you take away
being near him.

1294
01:17:45,253 --> 01:17:48,138
I'm taking nothing away
from you that was ever yours.

1295
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,307
He has been mine since...

1296
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:52,642
Why do I stand here
talking with you?

1297
01:17:52,644 --> 01:17:54,278
Go now!

1298
01:17:55,846 --> 01:17:59,082
Why are you afraid of me?

1299
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:02,202
Afraid?

1300
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,121
You are afraid.

1301
01:18:05,123 --> 01:18:06,757
And now I see why.

1302
01:18:06,759 --> 01:18:09,960
Because I'm human,
and you're not.

1303
01:18:09,962 --> 01:18:11,211
Because I'm young,

1304
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:13,313
And you know love
belongs to the young.

1305
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:14,814
Your magic
makes you seem young,

1306
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:17,283
But in your heart,
you're old, old!

1307
01:18:17,285 --> 01:18:19,803
You were young once like me,
but now you're old,

1308
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,521
And it's too late
for love forever.

1309
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:24,725
He will never love you.
I know that now.

1310
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:25,959
Keep him here!

1311
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:28,512
Make him king
over your slaves and savages!

1312
01:18:28,514 --> 01:18:29,796
But he
will never love you!

1313
01:18:29,798 --> 01:18:31,298
Never! Never! Never!

1314
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,099
Go!
( sobs )

1315
01:18:39,707 --> 01:18:43,710
She came here
from his arms.

1316
01:19:04,732 --> 01:19:07,667
The sacrifice
within the hour

1317
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:10,370
In the hall of kings...

1318
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:12,906
He shall sit beside you
on the throne

1319
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:15,776
And watch her die

1320
01:19:15,778 --> 01:19:18,094
And not know.

1321
01:19:18,096 --> 01:19:20,597
Who can be blamed
if she wanders away,

1322
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:22,165
And no one can find her?

1323
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,151
Send men to search.

1324
01:19:24,153 --> 01:19:27,738
Show concern
for his sorrow.

1325
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:32,526
All the while knowing
that he watched her die.

1326
01:19:32,528 --> 01:19:35,445
And she,
through her veil,

1327
01:19:35,447 --> 01:19:38,264
Saw him watching.

1328
01:19:50,844 --> 01:19:53,145
Tanya: What is this?!

1329
01:19:53,147 --> 01:19:54,897
Where are you taking me?!

1330
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:06,059
( speaking
foreign language )

1331
01:20:06,061 --> 01:20:08,144
( speaking
foreign language )

1332
01:20:08,146 --> 01:20:10,563
( continues
in foreign language )

1333
01:20:10,565 --> 01:20:12,831
( women speak excitedly
in foreign language )

1334
01:20:15,385 --> 01:20:17,486
What is this?
What are they doing?

1335
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:19,088
It is she's command.

1336
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,357
She sends you
as an offering to the flame.

1337
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:23,876
No! Leo!

1338
01:20:23,878 --> 01:20:24,810
Leo!

1339
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,330
Foolish one.

1340
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:30,399
Would you
destroy him, too?

1341
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:33,353
If he could hear you,
if he knew your fate,

1342
01:20:33,355 --> 01:20:35,555
What could he do?

1343
01:20:35,557 --> 01:20:37,490
Let him try to save you,

1344
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:40,410
And he will be set upon
by soldiers and priests.

1345
01:20:40,412 --> 01:20:42,144
He will die with you.

1346
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:47,149
But he shall not know.

1347
01:22:52,059 --> 01:22:54,843
( speaking
foreign language )

1348
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,597
( slow drumbeat plays )

1349
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:18,193
( speaking foreign language )

1350
01:24:52,912 --> 01:24:56,115
( sounding )

1351
01:24:56,117 --> 01:24:58,767
( marching music plays )

1352
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,780
This is a happy festival
for kor...

1353
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:27,916
The happiest of all
for me.

1354
01:27:30,736 --> 01:27:32,221
That girl
they're bringing in,

1355
01:27:32,223 --> 01:27:33,455
What does she do?

1356
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:36,375
She carries to the gods
my gratitude

1357
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:39,160
For the gift
of enduring life.

1358
01:27:39,162 --> 01:27:41,964
Carries to the...How?

1359
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:45,149
You shall see.

1360
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,097
Is she a dancer, too?

1361
01:28:19,635 --> 01:28:21,903
No...

1362
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:25,139
She will not dance.

1363
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:46,294
( gong chimes )

1364
01:28:46,296 --> 01:28:48,629
( music ends )

1365
01:29:40,215 --> 01:29:42,451
Is this
a human sacrifice?

1366
01:29:42,453 --> 01:29:46,254
It's the immemorial custom
of the people of kor.

1367
01:30:01,888 --> 01:30:03,155
Is that...?

1368
01:30:03,157 --> 01:30:05,057
No, it can't be.

1369
01:30:13,849 --> 01:30:15,350
Who is that girl?

1370
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,086
Who is it?
Is it Tanya?

1371
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:25,543
It's Tanya!!

1372
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,128
( shouts
in foreign language )

1373
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,718
Take her
to the stairs.

1374
01:30:37,523 --> 01:30:40,459
( crowd shouting )

1375
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:57,476
Through those doors!

1376
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,610
( crowd screaming )

1377
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:38,366
( shouting continues )

1378
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:53,865
( wind whistling )

1379
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:15,237
Ohh!!

1380
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:24,145
Aah!!

1381
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,291
Aah!!

1382
01:32:40,129 --> 01:32:42,063
Ohh! Ohh!

1383
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:12,277
You found my temple,

1384
01:33:12,279 --> 01:33:14,679
But you came
the dangerous way.

1385
01:33:23,356 --> 01:33:24,905
Here is what you sought.

1386
01:33:24,907 --> 01:33:27,475
So the flame of life
has leapt from the earth

1387
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:28,976
Since time began.

1388
01:33:30,195 --> 01:33:33,097
What does the flame
or anything else matter now?

1389
01:33:33,099 --> 01:33:35,033
I want no power
you have to give.

1390
01:33:35,035 --> 01:33:36,834
I want nothing
you have to give.

1391
01:33:39,872 --> 01:33:43,241
He thinks he loves you now.

1392
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:44,509
I can wait.

1393
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:50,448
Wait?

1394
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:51,700
For what?

1395
01:33:51,702 --> 01:33:54,352
For you to grow old.

1396
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:57,255
Until then,
you will be cared for

1397
01:33:57,257 --> 01:34:00,325
As my dearest possession.

1398
01:34:00,327 --> 01:34:01,892
And he?

1399
01:34:01,894 --> 01:34:04,595
He will bathe in the
flame and be as I am.

1400
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:07,148
You will grow old,
withered, ugly.

1401
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:09,317
And when at last, repelled,
he turns from you,

1402
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:12,553
I shall be standing
by his side unchanged.

1403
01:34:12,555 --> 01:34:15,356
And if I won't go
in the flame?

1404
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:18,543
You have no choice.

1405
01:34:18,545 --> 01:34:21,813
If you refuse,
the girl shall die.

1406
01:34:21,815 --> 01:34:23,381
Kill me, then!

1407
01:34:23,383 --> 01:34:25,350
You mean, if I refuse
to go in the flame,

1408
01:34:25,352 --> 01:34:26,584
You'll have her killed?

1409
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:28,386
Oh, Leo,
I'd rather die now.

1410
01:34:29,338 --> 01:34:30,805
I'll always love you,
Tanya.

1411
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:31,973
No, no.

1412
01:34:31,975 --> 01:34:35,210
Trust me.
Believe in my love.

1413
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,147
I'm ready.

1414
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:40,514
No, Leo,
it's a trick!

1415
01:34:40,516 --> 01:34:42,783
How do you know you
won't be burned alive?

1416
01:34:42,785 --> 01:34:44,185
If I stand in the flame

1417
01:34:44,187 --> 01:34:46,287
And come forth unharmed,

1418
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:47,922
Then will you follow?

1419
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:50,658
I will.

1420
01:34:58,934 --> 01:35:00,484
Don't think you can
go unpunished forever.

1421
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:02,086
Somewhere, there's a power

1422
01:35:02,088 --> 01:35:04,989
That won't let such
wickedness and cruelty go on.

1423
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:08,025
Your hair will whiten.

1424
01:35:08,027 --> 01:35:10,462
Your eyes will lose
their brightness.

1425
01:35:10,464 --> 01:35:12,764
Your cheeks
will wrinkle.

1426
01:35:12,766 --> 01:35:15,567
Your limbs will wither...

1427
01:35:15,569 --> 01:35:19,871
While I defy the years
and laugh at time.

1428
01:35:19,873 --> 01:35:22,740
I call upon the flame
most powerful, most swift--

1429
01:35:22,742 --> 01:35:26,110
Preserver of life
and youth and beauty.

1430
01:35:42,428 --> 01:35:45,964
Your eyes will lose
their brightness.

1431
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,438
Your cheeks
will wrinkle.

1432
01:36:36,765 --> 01:36:39,167
Your limbs will wither.

1433
01:37:06,862 --> 01:37:09,797
While I defy the years

1434
01:37:09,799 --> 01:37:12,250
And laugh at time.

1435
01:37:27,732 --> 01:37:31,636
Now do you believe
I spoke the truth?

1436
01:37:32,871 --> 01:37:34,455
My love.

1437
01:37:45,884 --> 01:37:48,687
I can't see you clearly.

1438
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:50,822
( gasping )

1439
01:37:50,824 --> 01:37:53,291
My eyes...

1440
01:37:53,293 --> 01:37:55,527
The flame.

1441
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,150
My voice sounds strange
to my ears.

1442
01:38:02,152 --> 01:38:06,237
( sobs )

1443
01:38:10,008 --> 01:38:12,092
( wails )

1444
01:38:22,054 --> 01:38:23,954
( sniveling )

1445
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,158
I die.

1446
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,660
I die!

1447
01:38:29,662 --> 01:38:32,163
( sobbing )

1448
01:38:32,165 --> 01:38:36,334
Have pity on my shame.

1449
01:38:36,336 --> 01:38:38,135
( sighs )

1450
01:38:47,663 --> 01:38:50,698
I remember, long ago,

1451
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,634
A garden...

1452
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:56,204
In the sun.

1453
01:39:03,078 --> 01:39:05,646
Dead?

1454
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,115
Dead!

1455
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:11,552
She cannot die!

1456
01:39:20,011 --> 01:39:22,547
A party of slaves
that were to guide you.

1457
01:39:23,782 --> 01:39:25,983
The gold symbol...

1458
01:39:25,985 --> 01:39:27,852
We'll be safe.

1459
01:39:29,054 --> 01:39:31,055
She told me.

1460
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,275
The greatest secret
in the world,

1461
01:40:08,277 --> 01:40:11,012
And we're turning
our backs on it.

1462
01:40:27,496 --> 01:40:29,680
Holly: "she staggered
to the ground,

1463
01:40:29,682 --> 01:40:32,517
"a withered creature,
incredibly old.

1464
01:40:32,519 --> 01:40:35,185
"and so she died
terribly and pitifully

1465
01:40:35,187 --> 01:40:37,754
"even as her lips
spoke of eternal life.

1466
01:40:37,756 --> 01:40:39,406
"but though she was dead,

1467
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:43,044
"the power of her golden symbol
reached out and held us safe.

1468
01:40:43,046 --> 01:40:45,813
"and so, after
incredible adventures,

1469
01:40:45,815 --> 01:40:47,748
"we escaped to the outer world.

1470
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,017
"and thus we lived
to record the story

1471
01:40:50,019 --> 01:40:52,519
In this manuscript."

1472
01:40:53,705 --> 01:40:56,574
It seems as though
it couldn't have happened.

1473
01:40:56,576 --> 01:40:58,076
Why, no one could believe it

1474
01:40:58,078 --> 01:40:59,577
Unless they'd been there with us.

1475
01:40:59,579 --> 01:41:02,613
Now that we're safe
in this friendly world,

1476
01:41:02,615 --> 01:41:07,235
Do you know, I
feel sorry for her.

1477
01:41:07,237 --> 01:41:10,221
We never shall know
what really did happen.

1478
01:41:10,223 --> 01:41:11,622
I sometimes think

1479
01:41:11,624 --> 01:41:13,824
That her bathing in
the flame a second time

1480
01:41:13,826 --> 01:41:15,159
Was an overexposure

1481
01:41:15,161 --> 01:41:17,995
To that terrifically powerful
unknown element.

1482
01:41:17,997 --> 01:41:19,730
And sometimes I think that such--

1483
01:41:19,732 --> 01:41:22,667
Such inhuman immortality
was never meant to be,

1484
01:41:22,669 --> 01:41:25,369
And some greater power than she

1485
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:27,871
Reached out and--
and destroyed her.

1486
01:41:28,974 --> 01:41:30,407
After all, Holly,

1487
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:33,244
Perhaps there is
no real flame of life.

1488
01:41:33,246 --> 01:41:34,879
I think there is.

1489
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:36,046
What?

1490
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:37,848
Yes. Right here.

1491
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:39,417
Holly: Here?

1492
01:41:39,419 --> 01:41:41,252
In this fireplace--

1493
01:41:41,254 --> 01:41:42,653
The flame in any fireplace

1494
01:41:42,655 --> 01:41:46,223
In any home where two people
live and love each other...

1495
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:49,126
And in their hearts.
