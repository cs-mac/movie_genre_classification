00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,348
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T CALLED
ANYBODY BACK IN THREE WEEKS.

156
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,184
AND NOW, YOU'RE UNWRAPPING
ALL MY HARD WORK.

157
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,652
COME ON, MEESH.
- QUESTION.

158
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,420
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
OUT IN THE CAR?

159
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:04,290
- RELAXING.
WHY, WHAT'D YOU SEE?

160
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,892
- BOXED WINE.

161
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,794
- I GET CRAVINGS
AROUND ALL THESE BOXES, OKAY?

162
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,129
YOU WOULD, TOO.

163
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,164
- THIS IS FUCKED, MUSH.
- I KNOW, MAN.

164
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,200
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU,
BUT I DID PROMISE MOM

165
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,135
THAT I WOULD SHOW YOU
THIS DEVICE

166
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,470
THAT WOULD BLOW YOUR MIND.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS?

167
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,238
IT'S CALLED A PHONE.
- OH, MY GOD.

168
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,906
- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TAUGHT
YOU THIS YET IN COLLEGE,

169
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,075
BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
WHEN IT VIBRATES OR RINGS,

170
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,845
YOU PICK IT UP AND SAY "HELLO."
- STOP. LISTEN, I CALLED HER.

171
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,580
LAST I HEARD,
SHE HAD A JOB OFFER IN TAMPA

172
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,348
AND SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT IT,

173
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,550
MAYBE THE MOVE WOULD HAPPEN
DURING CHRISTMAS BREAK.

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,853
- OKAY, FIRST OFF,
IT'S CLEARWATER, NOT TAMPA.

175
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,055
IT SOUNDS MELLOWER. I LIKE IT.
- [chuckles]

176
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,024
- AND THAT WAS IN SEPTEMBER,
BUD.

177
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:42,094
- NOTICE THE NUANCE HERE.
- IT'S GOOD.

178
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,363
- I COULD HAVE GONE FULL WIG,
BUT I SAID NO.

179
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,699
TERRY FONG OF
TERRY FONG STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHY

180
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,400
IS ON TO ME,

181
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,369
AND HE'S NOT GONNA LET JUST
ANYTHING SLIDE THIS YEAR.

182
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,104
- YOU KNOW
I'VE HEARD THIS STORY BEFORE.

183
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,274
- QUIET. AS YOU CAN SEE,
WITH THE SIMPLE UTILIZATION

184
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,677
OF MOM'S MATERNITY SWEATER
AND DAD'S BACKUP GLASSES,

185
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,648
I WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE AN EFFECT
FAR MUCH MORE IMPACTFUL,

186
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,250
NAY, PROFOUND,

187
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,686
THAN ANY SIMPLE WIG COULD EVER
BE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE.

188
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,421
- OKAY, MEESH. OKAY.

189
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,690
SHOULD I GO RIGHT UPSTAIRS
AND GRAB MINE?

190
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,626
- JUNIOR YEAR?

191
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,127
- WHEN I SLICKED MY HAIR BACK.

192
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,062
- WITH THE SEASHELLS?
- THE PUKA BEADS.

193
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,966
- GO GET IT.
- DEADLY. I'LL BE BACK.

194
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,737
- HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?
MOM IS NOT HAPPY.

195
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,772
- KATIE, THIS IS COURTNEY.

196
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:29,408
- COURTNEY HAS
A VOCAL CHORD INJURY,

197
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,043
SO SHE HAS TO SPEAK
REALLY SOFTLY RIGHT NOW.

198
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,145
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

199
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,447
- REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

200
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,149
- HEY, NEED HELP?
- YES, PLEASE.

201
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,185
THANK YOU.
- IS MOM MAD AT ME?

202
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,187
- UM, WELL, I MEAN,
A LITTLE BIT.

203
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,390
- OKAY.
- YOU GOT IT?

204
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,793
- YEAH, I GOT IT.
YOU LOOK PRETTY. COME ON.

205
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,563
- HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?

206
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,631
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GO SHOPPING
WITH MOM.

207
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,367
- UM, MY BUS WAS LATE.

208
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,305
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST WANTED
MY DAUGHTERS WITH ME.

209
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,607
THAT'S ALL. OKAY?
IT'S A TRADITION.

210
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,309
- WE HAD TO TAKE A XANAX.

211
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,444
- HMM.

212
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,313
- I'LL PICK YOU UP LATER.
- NO.

213
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,248
IF I GO, I'LL DRIVE MYSELF.
- HEY, WHAT LATER?

214
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:10,816
WHERE IS SHE GOING?
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

215
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,851
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT TONIGHT, NO.

216
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,186
IT'S THE NIGHT BEFORE
THANKSGIVING.

217
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,088
THIS IS A VERY BIG WEEKEND
FOR THIS FAMILY.

218
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,556
- DAD, I SEE YOU GUYS
ALL THE TIME.

219
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,192
- WE'RE NOT GUYS.
WE'RE YOUR PARENTS.

220
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,860
- YOU SEE US WHEN YOU WANT
TO DO YOUR LAUNDRY.

221
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,295
NOW, YOUR SISTER AND COURTNEY,

222
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,863
THEY CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM COLORADO

223
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:27,032
WITH A VOCAL CHORD INJURY,
I MIGHT ADD.

224
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,602
THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED.
- WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

225
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,971
- WHAT?
- GOD, I'M HOT.

226
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,939
ARE YOU HOT?
- OH, YEAH.

227
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:35,774
- IT'S LIKE A GREENHOUSE
IN HERE.

228
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,843
- I WANT TO PLAN THE ENGAGEMENT
PARTY FOR SATURDAY,

229
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,678
AND I WANT ALL OF YOU COOKING.

230
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,380
YOUR DAD WANTS TO BRINE
THE TURKEY THIS YEAR.

231
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,082
- YEAH, I'M GIVING UP
ON DEEP-FRYING.

232
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,217
DID YOU KNOW THAT 90% OF FIRES
DURING THE HOLIDAYS

233
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,752
ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE
DEEP-FRYING TURKEYS?

234
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:49,221
- WE READ ALL ABOUT IT
IN READER'S DIGEST.

235
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,990
- MM-HMM.
- STOP EATING THOSE.

236
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,391
PUT 'EM AWAY.
THEY'RE FOR SATURDAY.

237
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,792
WILL YOU CHOP THAT FOR ME,
SWEETHEART?

238
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,495
- YEAH, SURE.

239
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,733
- [over television]
FIND IT NOW. WE'RE ON IT.

240
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,968
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

241
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,437
I JUST WANTED ONE MORE
THANKSGIVING AT HOME.

242
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,806
- WELL, WE GOT LEFTOVER PUMPKINS
FROM HALLOWEEN.

243
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,708
WE COULD MAKE PIE.

244
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:12,177
- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK
THAT'S HOW DAD MAKES 'EM.

245
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,413
- HOW DOES HE MAKE 'EM?

246
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,148
SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT OUR FATHER,

247
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,350
BUT THAT MAN CAN
BAKE HIS BALLS OFF.

248
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,919
- HE CAN BAKE HIS BALLS OFF.
THAT'S WEIRD.

249
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,554
- I FEEL LIKE
IT DE-STRESSES HIM.

250
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,456
HUH.

251
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:28,094
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
YOU CAN NEVER GO HOME AGAIN.

252
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,031
- YEAH, MAN.

253
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,166
I GUESS NOT.

254
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,468
- NO, I MEAN, YOU ACTUALLY
CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN.

255
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,370
I'M PACKING EVERYTHING
IN THE U-HAUL

256
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,872
AND DRIVING IT DOWN
ON SUNDAY.

257
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,074
WE HAVE TO BE OUT BY THE 30th.
- YEAH.

258
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,542
MOM SAID.

259
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,744
- WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO
PACK YOUR ROOM BY THEN.

260
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,547
I HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT, SO...

261
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,684
- NO MORE HOUSE, MUSHY.

262
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,253
- NO MORE HOUSE, MEESHY.

263
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,188
- [over television]
THE BUILDING'S COMIN' DOWN!

264
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:59,124
EVERYONE OUT, NOW!
NOW! LEAVE IT!

265
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,694
- SO HOW'S PITTSBURGH?

266
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,028
SEEMS YOU'RE IN LOVE,
FROM YOUR E-MAILS.

267
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,697
- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE IT.

268
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,765
IT'S NOT NEW YORK,

269
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:09,234
BUT IT'S, LIKE,
100 TIMES BETTER THAN HERE.

270
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,904
- OH, I LIKE ALTOONA.

271
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,572
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

272
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:15,574
- WHAT DO YOU LIKE
ABOUT ALTOONA?

273
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,643
- COURTNEY THINKS THERE'S A KIND
OF CHARLES DICKENS

274
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,912
MEETS FLASHDANCE KIND OF THING
GOING ON.

275
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,181
- IT'S VERY POETIC.

276
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,616
- WHO'S EVEN COMING
TO THIS THING ON SATURDAY?

277
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,485
- IT'S ALL THEIR FRIENDS.
- MM-HMM.

278
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:29,121
- YOU KNOW? IT'S--
IT'S BEN KENNEDY AND KATHY,

279
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,723
THE GREENS.
- PHIL GREEN.

280
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,825
- PHIL GREEN.
WE DON'T LIKE PHIL GREEN.

281
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,493
WHAT THE FUCK?

282
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:38,530
WE SAID WHY DON'T WE JUST GET
SOME PIZZA AND SOME BEERS

283
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,332
AND WE'LL SHOOT THE SHIT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

284
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,000
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
- EXACTLY.

285
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,469
- BUT NO.
- MM-MM.

286
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:47,206
- SHE WANTS TO MAKE DEVILED EGGS
AND 40 FUCKING DESSERTS.

287
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,476
SHE BOUGHT PHYLLO DOUGH.

288
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,343
- PHYLLO DOUGH.

289
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:53,178
- WHOA.
- EXACTLY.

290
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:55,180
- PHE-LLO DOUGH.
- PHYLLO DOUGH?

291
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:58,350
- PHYLLO DOUGH, PHE-LLO DOUGH.
- PHE-LLO DOUGH.

292
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,419
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHICH IS IT?

293
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,621
- PHYLLO.
- PHYLLO, PHE-LLO?

294
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:05,090
- I LIKE PHE-LLO.
- I LIKE PHE-LLO, TOO.

295
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:07,159
YOU'RE RIGHT.

296
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,798
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO OUT,
GUYS.

297
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,267
- WITH KATIE?
- YEAH.

298
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,705
- HMM. HEY, REMEMBER WHEN KATIE
USED TO MAKE YOU DRESS LIKE HER?

299
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,574
COURTNEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.
- SOUNDS SO DEHUMANIZING.

300
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,343
- SEVENTH GRADE,
DARK TIMES FOR EVERYONE.

301
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,212
- REMEMBER THAT TIME
THAT SHE MADE YOU COME HOME

302
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,548
FROM THE DANCE AND SHE PRETENDED
TO HYPERVENTILATE

303
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,251
BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE SAW
HER DEAD GRANDMA?

304
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,586
- YEAH, I DO REMEMBER THAT,

00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,198
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
BECOME FAMOUS.

457
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,799
- OKAY, THAT GOT DARK FAST.

458
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,535
I OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET A DUI, POOPDICK.

459
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,037
- THIS ONE'S TOTALLY
UP TO YOU.

460
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,005
I CAN ALSO PUT YOU IN A CAB
TO THE HOSPITAL

461
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,508
YOU CAN TELL 'EM
IT WAS A HIT-AND-RUN.

462
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,076
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

463
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,544
AND I WILL TELL YOU
THAT I GOT A CONCUSSION

464
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,646
WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD
IN GYM CLASS,

465
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,515
AND ALL THEY DID AT THE ER
WAS SEND ME HOME

466
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,850
AND TELL MY PARENTS
TO KEEP ME UP ALL NIGHT

467
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,819
SO I DIDN'T SLIP INTO A COMA.

468
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:51,890
LET ME DO SOME RESEARCH
SO I'M "A" NOT DRUNK DRIVING,

469
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,326
AND "B" HELPING YOU,
WHICH ARE TWO THINGS

470
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,062
THAT A GOOD PERSON WOULD DO.
- SOUNDS GOOD. DO IT.

471
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:01,466
OKAY. IT SAYS THAT YOUR PUPILS
DILATE IF THEY'RE CONCUSSED.

472
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,636
- ARE THEY?

473
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,242
HOW WAS HARTMAN'S?

474
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,678
- EH, VIDEO GAMES.
- YEAH.

475
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,780
[siren blaring]

476
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:18,049
- DID YOU REALLY COME BACK HERE
FOR JUST FOUR DAYS?

477
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:20,785
- [laughs]
WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

478
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:23,855
MY ROOMMATE FLEW BACK
TO TEL AVIV FOR THE HOLIDAY.

479
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,323
- HMM.

480
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,093
DO THEY EVEN CELEBRATE
THANKSGIVING IN ISRAEL?

481
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,130
- HEY.
- HI.

482
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,837
- WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHIN'.

483
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,106
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

484
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,775
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SAY IT
LIKE THAT?

485
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,377
- SAY IT LIKE WHAT?

486
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,145
- "WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?"

487
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:48,880
- I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST
REALLY SURPRISED TO BE GETTING

488
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,682
ALL THESE "NEED WEED"
TEXT MESSAGES FROM YOU.

489
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:53,084
I SEEN YOU SMOKE,
I DON'T KNOW,

490
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,687
MAYBE ZERO TIMES.

491
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,055
I DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR NUMBER.

492
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,224
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I FIND THAT SO WEIRD.

493
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,159
- IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD.
YOU'RE SCOTT'S GIRLFRIEND.

494
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,662
- YEAH, I SEE YOU
ALL THE TIME.

495
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,563
- YEAH,
YOU'RE SCOTT'S GIRLFRIEND.

496
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:07,666
- RIGHT, SO NOT IN YOUR PHONE.

497
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,135
YOU DON'T THINK WE'RE FRIENDS.

498
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,638
- SCOTT WAS JUST HERE.

499
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,042
- OKAY.

500
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,578
- OKAY.

501
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:22,814
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA
TALK ABOUT SCOTT?

502
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:26,251
- NOT UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

503
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,620
- YEAH, PREFER NOT TO.

504
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,889
- GREAT.

505
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,726
SO ARE YOU GONNA SELL ME
SOME WEED OR NOT?

506
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,062
- [sighs]

507
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,766
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

508
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,235
WE'RE GONNA SMOKE
A LITTLE PINNER IN HERE NOW

509
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,538
UNDER MY SUPERVISION,
'CAUSE I'M ACTUALLY, LIKE,

510
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,274
A LITTLE BIT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

511
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,575
- [scoffs]

512
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,043
- IF I SEE YOU
INHALE YOUR SHIT,

513
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,212
I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER LITTLE BIT
TO TAKE HOME.

514
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,414
SOUND LIKE A FAIR DEAL?
- ARE WE TALKIN'

515
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:58,550
OR ARE WE SMOKIN'?

516
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,786
- WE'RE SMOKIN'.

517
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,590
- NO, NO, NO. WE WENT
TO WHIPPLE'S DAM WITH DANTE.

518
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:06,958
- WHAT?

519
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,493
- KATIE AND HEATHER
CAME IN ANOTHER CAR.

520
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,328
THAT'S WHY THEY MISSED
THE MAGIC HAILSTORM.

521
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:12,931
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NICE.
- I REMEMBER IT SO CLEARLY,

522
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,533
BECAUSE I WAS HANGING OUT
WITH YOU GUYS WITHOUT KATIE,

523
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:17,168
WHICH, LIKE, NEVER HAPPENED.

524
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,137
- YEAH, YOU GUYS WERE A 2-HEADED
MONSTER IN HIGH SCHOOL.

525
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,640
YOU KNOW WHAT? I COULD SWEAR
WHEN WE WERE IN SEVENTH GRADE

526
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:24,876
AND SHE BROKE UP WITH ME,
I COULD SWEAR

527
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,712
IT WAS YOU ON THE PHONE.

528
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,315
DOING HER DIRTY WORK.

529
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,218
- I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY
THAT FACT.

530
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,421
- HMM, THAT WAS SOME
FUCKED UP SHIT, POOPDICK.

531
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:39,657
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

532
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,793
YEAH.

533
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,194
- SHE JUST REALLY
DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT,

534
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,730
AND SHE THOUGHT OUR VOICES
SOUNDED THE SAME.

535
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,265
- I KNEW IT!
YEP, AW!

536
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,467
I CAN'T BELIEVE,
FINALLY ADMITTING IT, POOPDICK.

537
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,236
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

538
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,171
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ONE OF
THE MEANEST THINGS I'VE DONE.

539
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:54,639
HONESTLY, I THINK
I WAS JUST EXCITED

540
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,241
TO TALK TO YOU ON THE PHONE.
- GOD,

541
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,910
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS RIGHT.
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

542
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,845
BUT YOU CALLED ME POOPDICK
FOR THREE YEARS

543
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:02,180
BECAUSE OF ONE ORAL PRESENTATION

544
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,481
WHERE I MISPRONOUNCED
"POOP DECK."

545
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:04,849
I THINK WE'RE EVEN.

546
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:08,286
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU KINDA LIKED IT.

547
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,091
SO YOU WERE EXCITED
TO TALK TO ME ON THE PHONE, HMM?

548
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,226
- UH, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

549
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,295
- YOU SAID YOU WERE EXCITED
TO TALK TO ME ON THE PHONE

550
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:18,830
IN SEVENTH GRADE.
- I SAID THAT?

551
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,298
- MM-HMM.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

552
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:22,967
- YOU LIKED ME IN SEVENTH GRADE,
DIDN'T YOU?

553
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,903
I MEAN, YOU HAD A LITTLE
GIRL BONER FOR ME,

554
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,571
DIDN'T YOU, POOPDICK?
MM-HMM.

555
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,706
- [scoffs]

556
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,942
- HMM.

557
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,179
- SO THERE'S THIS
WHOLE GROUP OF GIRLS

558
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,915
FROM HIGH SCHOOL, YOU KNOW,
LIKE KYLEIGH DECECCHO

559
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,752
AND LINDSAY BEEGLE
AND LAUREN VON DAM HAGEN,

560
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,154
AND THEY ALL GO TO PENN STATE
WITH ME, RIGHT?

561
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:46,858
SO AS A GROUP,
THEY DECIDED TO MAJOR

562
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:50,662
IN RECREATION
AND PARKS MANAGEMENT

563
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,431
BECAUSE THEY HEARD
IT WAS EASY.

564
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:56,100
LIKE, I'M JUST FIGURING OUT
WHAT A SCAM IT IS.

565
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,436
- WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE?

566
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:01,039
ALL YOU REALLY NEED ARE BOOKS
IF YOU WANNA LEARN SHIT.

567
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,273
- YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT?

568
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:05,410
MEANWHILE,
I'M MAJORING IN ENGLISH.

569
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,046
I'M GONNA BE WORSE OFF
THAN THE PARK MANAGEMENT GIRLS.

570
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,782
LIKE, ARE THERE GONNA BE
THAT MANY PARKS

571
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,784
FOR THEM TO MANAGE
WHEN THEY GRADUATE?

572
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:15,620
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA MANAGE,
PLAYGROUNDS?

573
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,689
[sighs]
WHO AM I KIDDING?

574
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,124
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE UNEMPLOYED.

575
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:23,862
COLLEGE JUST FEELS LIKE
SOME BIG,

576
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:28,066
PRE-UNEMPLOYMENT,
BINGE-DRINKING,

577
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,303
LIKE, PARTY VACATION.
- I HEAR YA, SISTER.

578
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:36,174
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
NORTH DAKOTA?

579
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:39,544
- WHAT ABOUT NORTH DAKOTA?

580
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,579
- IT HAS OIL, TONS OF JOBS.

581
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,715
YOU CAN MAKE, LIKE,
HALF A MILLION A YEAR THERE.

582
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,517
BUT YOU GOTTA LIVE
IN YOUR CAR

583
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,819
'CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH HOUSES
YET WHERE THE OIL IS.

584
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:51,289
- YEAH? YOU THINKIN' ABOUT IT?

585
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:55,126
YOU GONNA GO RIDE THE RAILS
WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES?

586
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,428
- SHH.
- [laughs]

587
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:00,398
- MY FRIENDS WILL NEVER LEAVE
THIS TOWN.

588
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,233
FIGURED I'D HITCHHIKE
UP THERE

589
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,402
AND JUST MOVE INTO
SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR.

590
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:08,339
I DON'T MIND BLOWING A TRUCKER
TO GET SHIT DONE.

591
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:11,676
- YEAH, I TOTALLY PUSHED A KID
OFF THE SWINGS ONCE

592
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:15,179
TO GET AN ERECTION.

593
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,315
- [sighs]
- [laughs]

594
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,884
- THERE'S SO MUCH I DON'T
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT JOKE.

595
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,953
both: [laugh]

596
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:25,023
- OH, GOD.

597
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:28,493
I AM NOT AN OPTIMIST.

598
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,763
- ME NEITHER.

599
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,798
SCOTT IS.

600
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:43,174
[train whistle blows]

601
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,180
- YOU ASLEEP?

602
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:52,650
- NO.
BUT THE SMELL OF THAT STUFF

603
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,652
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING
ON YOUR FINGERNAILS

604
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:57,922
MIGHT CAUSE THE BRAIN DAMAGE
YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID.

605
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:01,393
- JUST DON'T FALL ASLEEP.
- OKAY.

606
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,599
YOU SEEM GOOD.

607
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,301
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
THAT MUCH LAST YEAR.

608
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,569
