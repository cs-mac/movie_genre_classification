{912}{975}JIMMY: My first memories|are kind of hazy.
{976}{1055}All I remember is|a place with white walls...
{1056}{1130}bright lights,|and a gigantic bird.
{1164}{1243}I was there because I was born|with no immunities.
{1244}{1300}A single germ could kill me.
{1301}{1405}But when I was four,|my mom took me home...
{1406}{1478}to beautiful|Palmdale, California.

{3064}{3132}and two pairs|of retractable arms.
{3133}{3215}MOM: "And the prince climbed to|the top of the tower and said...
{3216}{3248}'Come with me...
{3249}{3288}and we'll live|happily ever after.'
{3289}{3408}"And Rapunzel left|her plastic bubble and died."

{4174}{4209}JIMMY: And I had|the best teacher...
{4210}{4244}in the whole, wide world.
{4245}{4269}And then the Indians...
{4270}{4314}decided to move|to the reservations...
{4315}{4346}where they|could open casinos...
{4347}{4385}and sell|tax-free cigarettes...
{4386}{4437}and stay out of|the white man's way.
{4438}{4501}Another A-plus.
