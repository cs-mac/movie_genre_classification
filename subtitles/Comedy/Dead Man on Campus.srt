00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:56,473
COME ON.
BE A SPORT.

820
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,474
I MEAN,
YOU'RE FUCKED ANYWAY.

821
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:58,975
AT LEAST THIS WAY,

822
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,977
ONE OF US
COMES OUT ON TOP.

823
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:02,979
THEN YOU KILL YOURSELF.

824
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:04,481
NO, I CAN'T SEE THAT
WORKING.

825
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:05,482
LOOK, JUST FORGET IT.

826
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,484
JOSH, PLEASE. ALL I'M
ASKING YOU TO DO--

827
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:08,985
I'M DONE HELPING YOU.

828
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:10,487
People: SHH! QUIET!

829
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,988
JOSH, WAIT.

830
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:12,989
WHAT ABOUT KYLE?

831
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:13,990
WHO'S KYLE?

832
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,492
KYLE, OUR OTHER ROOMMATE.

833
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:17,494
THE ONE FROM
THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

834
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,996
HE COULD KILL HIMSELF.
IT'S PERFECT.

835
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:21,998
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT MURDER, COOPER?

836
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:24,000
'CAUSE IF YOU ARE,
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

837
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,502
NO, I AM NOT
TALKING ABOUT MURDER.

838
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,003
WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO BE PART

839
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,505
OF YOUR STUPID PLAN,
SO JUST DROP IT.

840
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:29,506
IT'S SIMPLE.

841
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,008
NO, I MEAN IT.
JUST SHUT THE SHIT UP.

842
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,009
YEAH, BUT ALL YOU--

843
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,011
AW. HO HO HO.

844
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:38,515
SUICIDAL IMPULSES
COME FROM FEELING POWERLESS

845
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,517
OVER ONE'S PROBLEMS.

846
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:43,019
SO WHEN SOMEONE
CALLS DALEMAN'S HOTLINE,

847
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,524
WE MAKE SURE THAT THE CALLER
 FEELS IN CONTROL OF THE--

848
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,527
YOUNG MAN, WOULD YOU
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT?

849
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,531
NOW, THE CALLER
SHOULD BE TOLD

850
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:57,534
THAT SUICIDE
IS NEVER THE ANSWER.

851
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:59,536
SAY THERE'S SOMEONE
REALLY DEPRESSED--

852
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:02,038
COULD YOU RAISE YOUR HAND?

853
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:05,041
WELL, YEAH. OK.

854
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,009
SAY THERE'S SOMEONE
REALLY DEPRESSED,

855
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,545
BUT HE MIGHT NOT
ACTUALLY KILL HIMSELF.

856
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,548
WHY DON'T I ANSWER QUESTIONS
AFTER THE SESSION?

857
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,550
WHAT WOULD PUSH HIM
OVER THE EDGE?

858
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,552
SEND HIM RUNNING
FOR THE RAZORS?

859
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:16,553
ANYTHING
COME TO MIND?

860
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:18,555
WHAT?

861
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:21,239
OH, HI, JOSH.
COME ON IN.

862
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,742
I GOT A NOTE.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

863
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,243
I JUST WANTED TO
CHECK UP ON YOU,

864
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:27,746
MAKE SURE YOUR HEAD'S
STILL ABOVE WATER.

865
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:30,248
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
I DID ON MY MIDTERMS.

866
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,751
I WAS DISTRACTED,

867
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,253
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
BUT STUDY FROM HERE ON OUT.

868
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,255
JUST REMEMBER YOU HAVE
TO KEEP A "B" PLUS AVERAGE

869
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:38,757
TO KEEP YOUR SCHOLARSHIP.

870
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,259
WHAT?

871
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,261
YOU MUST KEEP
A "B" PLUS AVERAGE,

872
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:44,763
OR THEY'LL REVOKE
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP.

873
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,266
NO, NOT MY SCHOLARSHIP.
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T DO THAT.

874
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,769
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I NEED THAT SCHOLARSHIP.

875
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:53,772
JOSH, THERE'S NO REASON
TO GET SO WORKED UP.

876
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,775
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS IF
YOU FAILED YOUR MIDTERMS.

877
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:58,276
HI, HONEY.

878
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:02,280
WHAT?

879
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:10,288
WELL, THANK YOU, SHIRLEY.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

880
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:11,790
YES, I'LL LET YOU KNOW

881
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,792
IF THE DOCTOR
NEEDS THOSE FILES.

882
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,293
ALL RIGHT.
TELL ME, WHAT--

883
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,295
HEY!

884
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:19,297
THAT WAS RUDE.

885
00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:22,801
WOW, JOSH.
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

886
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,803
WHY SHOULD I LOOK GOOD?

887
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:27,305
THESE ARE
MY MIDTERM SCORES.

888
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:28,807
AND THESE ARE THE SCORES

889
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:30,809
THAT I WOULD NEED
TO GET ON MY FINALS

890
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,310
IN ORDER TO KEEP
MY SCHOLARSHIP.

891
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:35,814
AND THERE'S NO MATHEMATICAL WAY
THAT I CAN GET THESE SCORES.

892
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,317
I WOULD NEED
4 "A" PLUS PLUS PLUSES.

893
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,318
I'M DOOMED!

894
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,821
WHAT'S THIS DOING HERE?

895
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:43,822
WELL, SEE, I--

896
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:46,825
COOPER, WHEN I GOT HERE,
I WAS ON A TRACK.

897
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:50,328
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A TRACK IS? CHALK.

898
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:54,833
A TRACK IS A BEAUTIFUL,
WONDERFUL THING.

899
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,835
IT'S A GOAL.
IT'S A TRACK.

900
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:00,839
IT'S ALWAYS MOVING FORWARD
ON A TRACK.

901
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,342
WELL, I DON'T HAVE A TRACK.

902
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:06,845
I HAVE NOTHING.
I'M DEAD.

903
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,347
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT A DEAD MAN.

904
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:12,350
WELL, THEN YOU'RE IN!

905
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,352
I MEAN, THIS IS GREAT.

906
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:15,854
GREAT?

907
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,355
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING--

908
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:17,856
COOPER!

909
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,357
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

910
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:20,859
YOU TAKE THE CAKE!

911
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,862
COOPER! DO YOU KNOW
THAT COOPER? UHH!

912
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,365
OHH! OHH.

913
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:29,868
YOU'RE OK.
YOU'RE OK, HUH?

914
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,870
HUH? JUST SHAKE IT OFF.

915
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,371
UHH.

916
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:34,873
NOW, WE HAVE A WAY OUT,

917
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,374
AND IT'S THE BEST
LOOPHOLE EVER,

918
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:38,376
AND IT'S GONNA SAVE
BOTH OF OUR ASSES,

919
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,878
SO JUST MELLOW.

920
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:41,379
HERE, PUT THIS
ON YOUR NOSE.

921
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:42,380
AH, COOPER.

922
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,884
NO. MY WHOLE VISION
IS RIGHT HERE...

923
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,885
ON THIS BLACKBOARD.

924
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:48,887
IN WHAT LANGUAGE?

925
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,890
WELL, MY PENMANSHIP'S
KIND OF GONE TO SHIT,

926
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,392
BUT BASICALLY,
HERE IS MR. Z.

927
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:55,393
WHO'S MR. Z?

928
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,397
MR. Z IS THE MOST
SUICIDAL GUY ON CAMPUS.

929
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,399
MR. Z IS THE GUY
WHO'S GONNA KILL HIMSELF

930
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,901
WHETHER HE LIVES
WITH US OR NOT,

931
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,402
SO I FIGURE, HE MIGHT
AS WELL LIVE WITH US

932
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,904
SO HIS DEATH
WON'T BE IN VAIN.

933
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:07,405
NOW, WE FIND HIM AT
THE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC,

934
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:09,407
HE MOVES IN,
HE KILLS HIMSELF,

935
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:11,910
AND HERE'S YOU KEEPING
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP,

936
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,412
AND HERE'S ME SAYING,
"FLUSH OFF, FLUSHLES."

937
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:15,880
HA HA HA HA.

938
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:18,416
LOOK, I HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH
WITHOUT YOU MIND-FUCKING ME.

939
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,920
NO, JOSH. I AM NOT
MIND-FUCKING YOU, OK?

940
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,423
I AM SO DEAD SERIOUS.
I AM, LIKE, IN THE ZONE.

941
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,926
COME ON, JOSH!
OH, JOSH.

942
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:28,927
OH, JOSH.

943
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,930
OK, THE BOTTOM LINE IS

944
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,932
YOU WORK IN
THE HOUSING OFFICE.

945
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:34,933
I NEED YOU.

946
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,434
I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU,

947
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:37,435
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE IT A GO.

948
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:38,937
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO LOSE?

949
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:39,938
FORGET IT, COOPER.

950
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:41,940
YOUR BRAIN IS
PERMANENTLY FRIED.

951
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,943
YOU NEED HELP. I WOULD
NEVER IN A BAJILLION YEARS

952
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:47,946
FOLLOW YOU ON SOME IDIOTIC
WILD-GOOSE CHASE! NEVER!

953
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:50,448
SAY NO MORE.
I UNDERSTAND, OK?

954
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:51,950
OH, BY THE WAY,

955
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,952
THERE'S A MESSAGE
FOR YOU ON THE MACHINE.

956
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:55,453
I THINK IT'S YOUR MOM.

957
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,457
[BEEP]

958
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:00,959
HI, JOSHIE, IT'S MOM.

959
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,961
YOU SOUNDED SO WORRIED
WHEN I TALKED TO YOU.

960
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:05,296
LISTEN, HONEY, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

961
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:07,465
I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU'LL
DO WELL IN COLLEGE.

962
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:10,468
YOU ALWAYS SURPASS
MY EXPECTATIONS.

963
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:14,973
AND I EXPECT TO SEE
STRAIGHT A's. OK? BYE.

964
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,474
WHO IS MR. Z AGAIN?

965
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:18,977
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

966
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:21,479
THERE'S ONE.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

967
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:23,481
OH, YEAH.
COME ON, BABY.

968
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:24,983
OH, COME TO DADDY.

969
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:27,452
OH, I GOTCHA. I GOTCHA.
DADDY'S GOTCHA.

970
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:30,488
JOSH, YOU'RE NOT
SAYING ANYTHING.

971
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:31,990
YAY. YIPPEE.

972
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,491
COME ON,
THIS IS GONNA BE EASY.

973
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:34,993
ONCE WE FIND OUT
WHO THESE GUYS ARE,

974
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,494
WE'LL STEAL THEIR FILES,
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT

975
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,496
WHICH ONE'S THE MOST
