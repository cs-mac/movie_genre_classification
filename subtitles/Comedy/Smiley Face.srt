your parents?

00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,816
(dealer)
It's all aBout capitalism

164
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,983
and shit like
that, you know?

165
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,790
Who creates the joBs?
Where do they come from?

166
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,559
The profits I make, for example,

167
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,504
trickle down through the economy
in ways I can't even comprehend.

168
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:46,670
It makes sense.
I'm totally vibing you, dude.

169
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:49,374
Yeah, simple Reaganomics
apply to the production of hemp.

170
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:55,154
Well, I don't think that really
qualifies as Reaganomics, but...

171
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:56,855
What are you
talking about?

172
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,491
Just because
weed isn't taxed

173
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,733
doesn't mean it exists in
some sort of,

174
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:06,745
you know, laissez faire paradigm
or whatever.

175
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,805
Did you just use "paradigm"
in a sentence?

176
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:10,077
Yeah, man.

177
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,121
I mean, what you do
is great and all,

178
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,557
God bless you
for it, but it sounds

179
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,359
like plain old market
capitalism to me.

180
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:19,093
It's Reaganomics.
Trust me.

181
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:24,074
What about it is Reaganomics?
The black market isn't taxed.

182
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,339
Listen, Jane,
you're fucking stoned

183
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,975
and I happen to be very knowledgeable
about this.

184
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:33,457
Whoopee! You own a UV lamp.
Let's start the revolution!

185
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,825
What the fuck do you know about
economics anyway?

186
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:40,997
Well... I majored in economics
in college

187
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:44,066
and graduated
fucking Summa.

188
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:46,477
I think I know a thing or two
about it.

189
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,615
I thought you
were an actress.

190
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:54,449
Economics didn't
really work out.

191
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,694
This is
where I'll be.

192
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,104
Meet me there with the money at
three o'clock.

193
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:05,305
Yeah.
Okay.

195

Oh.

197
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:22,500
Actually, my
roommate's hosting this

198

this weekend

199
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,145
with his buddies flying in from
Toledo and...

200
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,316
Hey!

201
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:34,261
Three o'clock!
Meet me in Venice

202
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,697
with the money
at three.

203
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,862
Do not make me send
my associates over here

204
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,804
to collect
the hard way.

205
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,241
You mean,
like kill me?

206
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,744
No, Jesus.
Of course not.

207
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,783
So you'll probably just break my
arms, then?

208
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,547
Break your arms? Janey, what
the fuck?

209
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:49,714
I'm a dude
who sells weed,

210
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,258
I'm not Tony
fucking Soprano.

211
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,659
Well, what then?

212
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,130
[Sigh]
I don't know.

213
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,997

or something.

214

215
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,343
So, Jane,

216
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,548
what's the deal
with your roommate?

217
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,253
Steve?

218
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,062
What about him?

219
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,533
He gives me
the creeps.

00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:21,401
Know what
I'm saying?

223
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:27,181
I bet that dude
fucks skulls,

224

He's a fucking freak.

229
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,315
So, listen.

230
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,013
It would be a shame if you didn't pay
me back today,

00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,921
and in addition to taking
your furniture,

232
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,323
I had to tell
your roommate

233
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:53,159
how you spent the cash for
the power bill.

00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,095
to remind you to go
to that audition?

This isn't really working out.

someone like this.

00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:46,300
But do not judge
her too harshly.

492
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,571
After all, how was she to know they
were pot cupcakes?

493
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:54,013
And ask yourselves,
who amongst you

494
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:55,779
might not have
done the same?

495

I thought you
had a boyfriend.

515
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,510
We're kinda taking a break right now.

00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,054
Mm-hmm.

517
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,989
What's that got
to do with anything?

00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:41,024
I 'm talking about something bigger
than our petty yearnings.

519
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:43,265
Of course.

[Clears throat]

521
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,636
So are we doing
this or what?

522
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,205
Well...

523
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:52,686
Come on, man. It's going to be
fucking transformative.

524
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:55,055
It sounds great.
I just...

525
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,651

[Pke]

527

I, uh...

528
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,672
So, you are sure you want to come to
the dentist with me?

529
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,812
Absolutely, man.
Absolutely.

530
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:14,757
Let me just drop you off at a coffee
shop or something.

531
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:17,457
No, not necessary,
my good man.

532
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm really looking
forward to it.

533
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:21,397
So last week they worked on
my left side.

534
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,634
Today they're gonna
finish on my right.

535
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:27,842
And I tell you, Jane, they really get
in there deep with the scraping.

536
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:31,285
A deep scraping?

537
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:32,914
Yeah.

That sounds
fucking awesome.

539
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,963
Maybe I
should get one.

540
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:41,028
I think you need
an appointment.

541

Oh, yeah.

542
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:45,805
An appointment.

543

Yep, that's pretty
funny I guess.

00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:14,786
I don't even know
what I'm laughing at.

545
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:21,063
So, how much do you think you'd need?

546
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:26,679
I don't know.
Like five...

547
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,014
Dollars?

548
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,918
Yeah, I need
to borrow $5.

549
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,357
Well, what then?
Like $500?

550
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:34,919
Yeah, that
should do it.

551
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,327
Really?

552
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:39,598
Hey, if you can't,
it's no biggie.

553
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:42,472
No, I can swing that.

554
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:44,308
Really?

555
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,009
You're gonna pay
me back, right?

556
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:49,783
Absolutely.
Of course.

557
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:54,763
My wallet's in the glove box.
Get it for me?

558
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:59,062
I may have five C notes right here.

559
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,233
That would be
so fucking great.

560
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:08,517
Nope. I don't
have it.

500 dollars again?

I don't think Steve
would fuck a skull.

565
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:37,530
Why do you keep it in the glove box?

566
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:38,834
What?

00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:40,706

It hurts my butt when I 'm driving.

total sense.

out there concepts.

Some pretty
radical ideas.

About what, the dentist?

606
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:39,076
No, I've never really been bothered
by going to the dentist.

607
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:43,246
It would freak the shit out of me
right now if I had to go in there.

I don't think
I could handle it.

654
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:56,686
It's really bright out.

655
00:43:56,755 --> 00:43:59,453

Uh...

00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,795
Christy?

658
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:07,738
You don't sound too sure of that.

659
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,369
No, it's Christy.

660
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:12,540
Well, Christy,

661
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:18,654
how come your friend just called you
Jane a second ago?

662
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:26,940
Jane's, uh, my...

663
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,873
religious name?

664
00:44:30,981 --> 00:44:32,711
Your religious name?

665
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:35,380
Am I under arrest?

666
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,447
Why would you be
under arrest?

667
00:44:37,525 --> 00:44:39,654
Have you done something I should
know about?

668
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:43,828
No, l... shit.
I mean, shoot!

669
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:51,515
Sir, do you mind opening your
trunk for me?

670
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,176
My trunk?

671
00:44:53,252 --> 00:45:01,461
No. Wait, excuse me. We called you
because... my car...

672
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,799
Now, Christy,

673
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:14,117
am I gonna find whatever kind of drugs
you're on in here?

674
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:17,318
Christy.

675
00:45:17,394 --> 00:45:19,523
Chris-ty.

676
00:45:19,598 --> 00:45:22,467
Oh, Jesus
Christ, Jane!

677
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:24,505
Yeah?

678
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:26,370
Her name's not Christy,
it's Jane.

679
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:27,876
I don't even know why you're
doing that.

What do you have in here, son?

681
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:33,050
I don't know.
Just some stuff.

682
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,919

What's that?

A tennis racket.

Okay.

Uh, do you have any lemonade?

Oh, no. I 'm sorry.
How about some orange juice?

Yeah, that sounds good actually.

All right.
Are you hungry?

Well... now that
you mention it,

703
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,571
I wouldn't mind something to
munch on.

704
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:25,773
You know, like chips or whatever.

705

Excuse me?

Oh, that's a photo of Peter's.

712
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,299
I suppose that's his idea of avant
garde or something.

How long have you been Peter's T.A.?

715
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:05,410
Peter.

716
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,248
Oh, you mean
Professor Harwood.

717
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:09,949
Yes.

718
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:13,223
Well, for quite a while now.

that other girl.

I guess not.

Well, it's very nice to meet you, uh...

so that you can
be on your way.

That is where corn chips come from.

732
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:12,896
Hmm, maybe old Professor Harwood
is onto something.

733
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:15,764
He probably really loves corn,

734
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:18,568
and all corn related products.

you're supposed to put in a frame?

Things you love?

737
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:26,011
I'm gonna do that.
When I get home,

738
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,819
I'm gonna frame
a Bunch of stuff I love.

739
00:49:28,891 --> 00:49:33,594
Like lasagna.
I love lasagna.

740
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:39,507
It's so good, and cheesy.

741
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:44,018
You know who else loves lasagna?
Garfield.

742
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:47,989
Man, that cat really
loves lasagna.

743
00:49:48,058 --> 00:49:51,929
MayBe I should put
a picture of Garfield in a frame.

744
00:49:51,998 --> 00:49:56,563
As a kind of shorthand way of saying
I love lasagna.

745
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,704
That would Be
so fucking inside.

746
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,980
Or how aBout a photo
of President Garfield?

747
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:08,183
Oh, shit. That'd
Be totally meta.

748
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:11,254
People would Be all like,
"Jane, why do you have a photo

749
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:13,460
of President Garfield
on your mantle?"

750

"Because I like lasagna, of course."

Are you hiding
from someone?

Of course not.
Why would you ask that?

00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,705
It seems like you're hiding
from somebody.

about, Shirley.

you this already,

but he wanted me to be sure to tell
you to take this

straight to his office
and put it in the safe.

991
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,412
We're on the freeway.

992
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:33,951

NumBer two. ; Try to convince Steve
not to steal my Bed.

999
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:12,982
You shouldn't be walking on the
freeway. It's dangerous.

1000
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,758
I guess.

1001
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:18,796
Where are
you headed?

1002
01:08:18,864 --> 01:08:20,526
Venice.

I'm going.

1013

Not any more.

1022
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:41,432
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!

1023
01:10:41,508 --> 01:10:43,603
I'm supposed to meet
my dealer here.

1024
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,580
Do you know him?
His name's Steve.

1025
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:49,052
Steve? Oh, yeah!

1026
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:53,151
Is he a dude, he's
got like two arms, two legs,

1027
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:54,753
And a head.

1028
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,697
That's Steve.
Yeah.

1029
01:10:58,771 --> 01:11:00,206

high aBove those
who had come so far to find her,

1037

Jane knew what
she had to do.

1038
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:04,981
Jane was
no schemer, no conniver,

1039
01:14:05,057 --> 01:14:06,787
no thief.

1040
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:14,898
Jane knew that
deep down she was pure of heart.

1041
01:14:14,974 --> 01:14:17,001
And that she
did not want to contriBute

1042
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:21,517
to the toll of human
misery and suffering in the world.

[Phone rings]

1044
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,913
She knew the time had come

1045
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:28,019
to take responsiBility
for what she'd done,

1046
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:32,001
and to return
the Book to its rightful owner.

1047
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:37,239
That her intentions were honoraBle,
that there'd Be no doubt.

1048
01:14:37,312 --> 01:14:43,017
But what puzzled many on that day
was not the virtue of her intentions.

1049
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:45,651
Hey!

1050
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:48,960
What puzzled
many was why.

1051

Hey!

1052
01:14:54,576 --> 01:14:57,809
By what Bizarre
and convoluted logic,

1053
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:59,975
did she arrive
at the decision
to do

1054
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:03,251
what you're
aBout to see?

1055
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:08,390
In short,
what the fuck was she thinking?

1056
01:15:08,466 --> 01:15:13,772
Whoa!
[Breathes heavily]

Whoa.

1067
01:18:32,282 --> 01:18:35,743
So, my dad plays
golf with this guy,

1068
01:18:35,822 --> 01:18:39,818
who is a pretty good
criminal attorney.

1069
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:42,091
I think he's
a criminal attorney.

1070
01:18:42,165 --> 01:18:43,724
He's definitely
a lawyer.

1071
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:47,332
I could try to hook
you up with him if you want.

1072
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:50,972
Yeah, that
sounds good.

1073
01:18:55,021 --> 01:19:00,554
Well, Brevin, it sure
has been a fucking day, huh?

1074
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:05,198
Yeah, I guess.

1075

[Moans]

1076
01:20:13,757 --> 01:20:17,525
What a weird
fucking dream.

1077
01:20:20,901 --> 01:20:24,465
Hey, stoner!
Back to work!

1078
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:28,412
[Breathes heavily]

1079
01:20:28,482 --> 01:20:30,713
Sorry.

1080
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:34,224
(Roscoe)
This has Been the story
of how a person started at A,

1081
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:37,661
got to Z, and
somehow ended up

1082
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:41,636
collecting garBage
By the side of the freeway.

1083
01:20:41,705 --> 01:20:45,803
And I think you'll all
agree that much like life itself,

1084
01:20:45,878 --> 01:20:52,118
it certainly has
Been... one hell of a crazy ride.

1085
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,802
THE END
