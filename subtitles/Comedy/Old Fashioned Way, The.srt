Real Estate Query Engine

2
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:05,721
is a virtual Rubicon of information

3
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:08,133
putting the lawyer himself
at the controls.

4
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:12,557
I'm going to take off, okay?
I'll try and catch the two o'clock back.

5
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:14,891
You're leaving the seminar now?
It's not even intermission.

6
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:18,520
- I don't think you can do that.
- It's fine. Cover for me.

7
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,856
- Get it all.
- I guess.

8
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,655
- Could we have your badge?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:26,699
It's worth two free drinks
at the Meet and Greet.

00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:42,885
Hello.

13
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:46,141
I'm going to the airport.
I'm kind of in a hurry, too.

14
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,597
Uh, sorry, your seat belt
seems to be broken.

15
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,398
What do you recommend I do?

16
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:55,062
I recommend you stop being such a faggot.

17
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,487
You're in the back seat.

18
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:59,360
Jesus.

19
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,359

Hello?

45
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,388
Hey, boy.

46
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,557
Good boy, Orson.
Where's Mommy?

47
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,269
Honey?

48
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,945
Heidi?

00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,698
<i>Ooh!</i>

Heidi?

00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:15,471
Mitch!

52
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:19,686
What are you doing home?
You totally scared me!

53
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:24,064
I scared you?
Because for a second, I thought...

54
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:26,736
I don't even want to say it.

55
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,531
<i>Mmm!</i>

56
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,072
Wow!

57
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:35,116
That's, like, pretty hard-core.

58
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,998
Yeah, I know.

59
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:40,453
No, I'm not judging.
Don't be embarrassed.

60
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,666
This is a major turn-on.
Let's go with this.

61
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,881
- Is this what you do when I'm gone?
- Wait.

62
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,098
I do it myself every once in a while,
but to magazines.

63
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,852
- Mitch, we need to talk.
- Hello!

64
00:04:58,316 --> 00:04:59,727
Be honest.

65
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:02,938
Please tell me this is the first time
this has happened.

66
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:07,732
You want me to be honest, or you want me
to tell you this is the first time?

67
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:11,872
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me!

68
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,784
I've tried to tell you about this.

69
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,785
What? When?

70
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:19,084
- All the time!
- Like when?

71
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:23,258
- Like, when we're in bed and stuff.
- In bed?

72
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:26,885
I thought you were just talking dirty.

73
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:30,223
I was, but I was being serious.

74
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:36,393
You've said some really sick stuff.

75
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,764
You have to admit,

76
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,443
we haven't been living the most exciting
lives in the world.

77
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,947
This is a totally different kind
of satisfaction for me.

78
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,695
It's purely sexual.

79
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:48,245
Whoo!

80
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,075
I'm really sorry.

81
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,674
- Hello.
- Yeah?

82
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:09,053
I'm here for the gang bang.

83
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,309
You look a little pale, Mitch.
You need to breathe.

84
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,611
Let a little blood up in your face.

85
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,735
- I don't want to breathe.
- You should be proud of yourself.

86
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:26,528
Do you know how hard it is to land
a girl as sexually enlightened as Heidi?

87
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:29,410
A girl like that comes around
once every hundred years.

88
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:31,743
I wasn't looking for a girl like that.

89
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:35,705
Columbus wasn't looking for America,
but that seemed to work out for everybody.

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,876
You're here.
You know what I mean?

91
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,469
I just want to thank you
one last time for being here.

92
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:43,216
It's the best day ever.

93
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:46,890
Don't even start with me, Franklin.
You need to walk away from this ASAP.

94
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:49,896
- What?
- You need to get out, Frankie.

95
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:59,983
It's now or never. Get out of here
while you're still single.

96
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,205
- I'm not single.
- You're still single right now.

97
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,074
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

98
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:10,624
Give that six months.
That will change.

99
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,706
I got a wife, kids.

100
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,670
Do I seem like a happy guy to you,
Frankie?

101
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,627
There's my wife. See that?

102
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,723
Always smiling? Hi, honey.
Judging, watching, "Look at the baby".

103
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,514
She's coming down the aisle, Beanie.
Let it go.

104
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:30,268
Let me be the first to say
congratulations, then.

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,145
You get one vagina for the rest of your life.
Real smart. Way to work it through.

106
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,739
- Don't listen to him, Frank.
- I need my inhaler.

107
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:42,532
It takes a man to give away an angel.
You're a sweetheart.

108
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,533
You look beautiful.

109
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,702
Great.

110
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:50,709
Dearly beloved,

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,876
we are gathered here together

112
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:55,217
to join Franklin and Marissa...

113
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:58,639
Don't do it!

114
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,427
My throat is dry.
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,802
I'm a smoker.

116
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,638
Okay.

117
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,228
# Turn around

118
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:11,236
# Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely

119
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,480
# And you're never coming round

120
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:15,152
# Turn around

121
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:18,529
# Every now and then
I get a little bit tired

122
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,661
# Of listening to the sound of my tears

123
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,291
# Turn around

124
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,496
# Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous

125
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,794

have gone by

126
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,507
# Turn around

127
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,878
# Every now and then
I get a little bit terrified

128
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,881
# But then I see
the fucking look in your eyes

129
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,468
# Turn around

130
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,350
# Bright eyes

131
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,345
# Every now and then I fall apart

132
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,932
# Turn around

133
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,351
# Bright eyes

134
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,478
# Well, fucking every now and then
I fall apart

135
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:49,607
# And I need you now tonight

136
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:52,903
# I fucking need you more than ever!

137
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,951
#... the look in your eye

138
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:59,322
# And now I find now
I need you more than...

139
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,413
Mitch Martin?

140
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,373
Yeah.

141
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,843
Nicole!

142
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,547
My God!

143
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,881
This is crazy!

144
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:15,300
I can't believe it's you!

145
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:16,853
Oh!

146
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:18,894
Oh! God.

147
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,692
- What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

148
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:23,974
Yeah, uh,

149
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:29,408
the last time that I had heard,
you had uh, moved to...

150
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:31,319
- What do you call it?
- Denver.

151
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:33,821
The Sunshine State.

152
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:35,159
Denver!

153
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,704
Gorgeous!
Gorgeous!

154
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,170
Hmm.

155
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,958
Oh, boy.

156
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:44,465
Are you okay?

157
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:45,837
No, I'm...

158
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,501
Uh, yeah, I just uh, I feel a little

159
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,218
fucked up.

160
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,100
Marissa told me about your girlfriend.
I'm very sorry.

161
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:01,481
The thing about that one is,
is it's not just that.

162
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,858
It's a combination of things.

163
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,784
We had a dog,
we had a great place,

164
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,945
but all just... phoo!

165
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,781
Just... mm-hm.

166
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:15,040
You know what?
I think you should have some of this.

167
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,618
- What's in this one?
- Coffee.

168
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:20,423
Mm.

169
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,753
Ow! Ow!

170
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,220
Jesus!

171
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,931
I am so sorry! Please, just...

172
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:31,639
I can fix it. Just...

173
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:35,263
- No, Mitch!
- What are you doing to this poor girl?

174
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:37,682
Mitch, stop it!
I got it.

175
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:40,398
No. Inappropriate.
Stop it right now.

176
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,445
There's a bathroom over here.

177
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,857
Mitch, honey? Hon?

178
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:46,944
Go get some air.
Walk it off.

179
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,863
Wait a second.

180
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:50,450
Yeah?

181
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,577
- Put in a good word for me.
- Okay.

182
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:58,710
# Le-oh-le, oh-le-ooh-ooh

183
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,923
# It's fuckin'

184
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:04,090
# Real lovin'

185
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,973
# You're my

186
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,639
# Lady #

187
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,054
Hey, Marissa!

188
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,892
You're the lady.

189
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,454
I'd like to say I'm...

190
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,747
- Can't hear you!
... glad and...

191
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,459
Excuse me.

192
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:35,246
I'd like to say I'm really glad
and proud to be here tonight.

193
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:40,846
I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.
I haven't seen him in eight years.

194
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,674
That's great.
Congratulations.

195
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,759
I love you, Dad!

196
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,521
True love is hard to find.

197
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,681
Sometimes you think you have true love,

198
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:53,107
then you catch the early flight
home from San Diego

199
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:56,397
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

200
00:11:56,488 --> 00:12:00,617
like a goddamn magic show,
ready to double-team your girlfriend...

201
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:04,451
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

202
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:07,909
because what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

203
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:12,162
Let's raise our glasses.

204
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:14,214
Salute. Health and happiness.

205
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,088
Cheers, everybody.

206
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,639
I love you so much, Frankie.
I love you.

207
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm not a talker.

208
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,931
I love you.
Congratulations.

209
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:48,376
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

210
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:50,670
This is great.
How did you land this place?

211
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,585
It was pretty easy.

212
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:56,426
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

213
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:57,843
That's awesome!

214
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,267
That's awesome.

215
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,553
A little housewarming.

216
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,605
To new beginnings.

217
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,140
Thanks.

218
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:10,063
Uh,

219
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:13,608
actually, I gave this to you
for your uh, wedding.

220
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:16,742
This model?

221
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:19,325
Uh, no, this exact one.

222
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:22,165
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,124
I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:25,456
It's okay.

225
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:27,289
I hope you like it.

226
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,331
I love it.
Thank you.

227
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,419
This place is unbelievable.

228
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,552
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

229
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,009
This is the best thing
that's happened to us.

230
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,679
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

231
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,606
Do not get selfish on me.
Stay with me.

232
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,600
Put a bar in over there, right?

233
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:48,904
Couple Lazy Boys, a smarter couch.
You could put a hot tub anywhere.

234
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,780
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

235
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:54,780
We'll get so much ass here,
it will be sick.

236
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,947
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

237
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,282
That sounds like a lot of fun, but

238
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,377
I need a little time to get
my life back together.

239
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:05,250
We need to throw a big
kick-ass party to start things off.

240
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:08,591
Absolutely.
Break it in, meet the neighbors.

241
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,635
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

242
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:11,967
Break it in.

243
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,468
The real estate guy was really
adamant about not having...

244
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,431
I don't think you realize what
a huge opportunity this is for you.

245
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,227
Girls love a guy in your situation.

246
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:22,480
What situation?

247
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,602
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

248
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:27,067
Like an injured fawn
nursed back to health

249
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:29,398
who will finally be re-released
into the wilderness.

250
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,615
Sorry.

251
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,280
Please be careful.

252
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,993
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Say it to the baby.

253
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,660
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

254
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,625
It's okay. It happens.

255
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,001
We should go tropical with this thing.

256
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,340
Sand from wall to wall.
I know a great sand guy.

257
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,506
Sand in here?

258
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,168
Or foam, whatever.
Something in here.

259
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,886
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

260
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,467
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

261
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:59,146
I'm messing with you guys!

262
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,650
It's not funny.
And now the baby is upset.

263
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:06,652
<i># Here I go again on my own</i>

264
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:12,909
<i># Going down the only road
I've ever known</i>

265
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,579
Hey.

266
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,704
<i># Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone</i>

267
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,041
Hey!

268
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,791
Hey, honey!

269
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,877
I brought you an iced tea!

270
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:25,258
No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.

271
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:27,469
Can you turn that off for a second?

272
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:32,515
Wow.

273
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:34,348
That's really loud.

274
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,768
Yeah. Thanks.

275
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,978
I took the restrictor plate off,
give the Red Dragon a little more juice.

276
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,281
But let's keep that on the down low.
She's not exactly street legal.

277
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:44,480
Hey, Mike!

278
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:45,690
Right.

279
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:48,822
- So, what's up?
- Nothing much.

280
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,749
I was hoping we might get to those
thank-you notes tomorrow night.

281
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,372
Honey, I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.

282
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,787
That's right.
I totally forgot.

283
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:58,672
But I can skip it.

284
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,379
Oh, no. No!

285
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,296
Don't be silly.

286
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:07,053
I wouldn't want you changing
your whole life just for me.

287
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:10,975
Um, I'll give Lara a call
and we'll plan a girls' night.

288
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:13,352
- It'll be fun.
- Thanks.

289
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:15,149
You're the best.

290
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:18,025
As long as you promise to take it easy.

291
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:21,399
<i>- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.</i>

292
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,492
You've come a long way since Frank the
Tank, and we don't want him coming back.

293
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:29,156
Honey, Frank the Tank
is not coming back, okay?

294
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,454
That part of me is over.
It's water under the bridge.

295
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:34,206
I promise.

296
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:48,934
Nice, right?

297
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:50,980
This is incredible.
How did you do this?

298
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,640
With all the people,
and the speakers.

299
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:56,192
I thought we were having
a small get-together.

300
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,901
This is one of many
small get-togethers.

301
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,865
That's why you got the house, brother.

302
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,446
You're having fun?

303
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:05,075
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

304
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:09,163
What else have you got planned?
A student band or something?

305
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:10,533
Yeah, that's it.

306
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,045
I got a student alt rock band
coming on stage next.

307
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,758
I own six Speaker Cities.

308
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:18,679
I'm worth $3.5 million,
that the government knows about.

309
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,681
I got more electronics up there
than a KISS concert.

310
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:26,144
You think I'd roll out that kind of red carpet
for a fuckin' marching band?

311
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,724
Make sure you can see the stage.

312
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,142
Excuse me. Pardon me.

313
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:33,438
I just want to get through this door,
if you don't mind.

314
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,645
Thank you.

315
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,492
This is the guy I was talking about.
This is his house.

316
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:40,992
- What's up, man?
- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

317
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,536
My friend Mitch, he owns the house.

318
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,290
Anyway, come hit this.
You need to hit this.

319
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:50,997
No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight.

320
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:54,717
I've got a big day tomorrow.
But you guys have a great time.

321
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,295
A big day? Doing what?

322
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,308
Well, um, actually,
pretty nice little Saturday.

323
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:01,971
We're going to Home Depot.

324
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:05,524
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

325
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,563
Stuff like that.
Maybe Bed, Bath and Beyond.

326
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,191
I don't know if we'll have enough time.

327
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:16,570
You know what? Give me that thing.
I'll do one.

328
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,911
He gonna do one!
He gonna do one!

329
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,406
Do it!

330
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,703
That's a talented man right there.

331
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,917
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fill it up again!

332
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,263
God, that's good.
It's so good!

333
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,055
Once it hits your lips,
it's so good.

334
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:42,596
Thank you very much, guys. This will be
happening at this house all year.

335
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:44,641
So don't burn yourselves out tonight.

336
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:48,566
Thank you very much for coming to the
official Mitch Martin Freedom Festival.

337
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:55,073
For those who don't know
who Mitch Martin is,

338
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:57,285
he's the very successful,

339
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,327
very disease-free gentleman
standing by the mini-bar.

340
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,217
Now, courtesy of Speaker City,

341

from beepers to DVD players,

342
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:15,468
give a warm Harrison University
welcome to my pal

343
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,143
and your favorite,
Mister Snoop Dogg.

344
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,235
Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:29,115
You know what?

346
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,074
# I'm thinkin' of a master plan

347
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,037
# Cos ain't nothin'
but sweat inside my hand

348
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,578
# So I dig into my pockets
All my money is spent

349
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,873
# So I dig deeper
But still comin' up with lint

350
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,250
# So I start my mission
Leave my residence

351
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:43,746
# I'm thinkin' how can I get
Some dead presidents

352
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,010
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

353
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:57,601
Frank the Tank!
Frank the Tank!

354
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,810
Frank the Tank! Frank the Tank!

355
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:02,402
Whoo!

356
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:05,773
You know it! You know it!

357
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,825
Whoo!

358
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,244
# A pen and a paper
A stereo, a tape

359
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:16,868
# Of me and Warren G
And a big, fat plate of chicken wings

360
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,076
# Cos that's my favorite thing...

361
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,630
You're that guy.

362
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:20,711
What?

363
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,673
Mitch-a-palooza, from the poster.

364
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,171
Yeah, that's me.

365
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:26,669
This party is great.
Nice work.

366
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,137
My friends put it on for me.

367
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:32,725
They're kind of re-releasing me
out into the wild.

368
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,055
What are you talking about?

369
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:36,691
Nothing. Sorry.

370
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:39,349
# Got to have some thangs

371
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,983
- # So what you need is some game
- Say what, say what.

372
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:44,611
- # To get your paper, man.
- Say what, say what.

373
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,026
- # Oh, baby
- Yeah, yeah!

374
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,614
# In a world of paper, paper

375
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,869
# Did somebody say make money, money
Make money, money, money

376
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,869
# Make money, money
Make money, money, money

377
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,833
# Say, make money, money
Make money, money, money

378
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,082
# Make money, money
Make money, money, money

379
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,456
# Take money, money...

380
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,127
We're going streaking!

381
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,682
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:15,849
We're going streaking through the quad
and into the gymnasium.

383
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,272
Come on, everybody!

384
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:18,904
Come on, Snoop!

385
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,655
Snoop-a-loop! Snoop...

386
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,240
No, it's cool. I'm cool.

387
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:26,202
Bring your green hat.

388
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:28,696
Come on, everybody, we're going!

389
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,250
Here we go!

390
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:33,122
Man, man.
Man, put the music back on.

391
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,087
Let's get the party back cracking up.

392
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,998
Whoo!

393
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:41,593
Come on! We're streaking. Come on!

394
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,468
Come on! Come on, everybody,
come on!

395
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,934
Whoo!

396
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,348
Whoo-hoo!

397
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:50,807
We're streaking! We're streaking!

398
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,180
Whoo!

399
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,648
Come on!

400
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:58,990
- Tell her!
- Vanessa, I totally forgot.

401
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:03,369
It's a little belated, but we got you
the perfect wedding present!

402
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:06,574
I told you, you don't have
to get me anything.

403
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,534
Our friend Ashley had this guy come over
and teach a blow job class.

404
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:13,287
- It was incredible.
- A class?

405
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:16,134
And he's really good,
so we had to book him way in advance.

406
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,879
Why should I go to a class?

407
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:21,755
Bernard should be the one going to class.
The man is orally challenged.

408
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,851
Wait a second, is that guy...

409
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:26,051
Whoo!

410
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,938
Oh, my God.

411
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:31,517
That's disgusting!

412
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,319
Why am I looking at that?

413
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:37,032
Why are you slowing down?

414
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:39,869
Just drive. Go.

415
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:41,569
Frank?

416
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:43,991
No way.

417
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:47,160
Frank!

418
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:50,536
Hey, honey. Hey.

419
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:52,625
What the hell are you doing?

420
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:56,846
We're streaking. We're going up
through the quad to the gymnasium.

421
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,557
Who's streaking?

422
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:01,469
There's more coming.

423
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:04,144
Frank, get in the car.

424
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,016
- Everybody's doing it.
- Now!

425
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,104
Okay.

426
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,949
Scooch over.

427
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,782
Oh. Hey.

428
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,866
Hey, ladies.

429
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,663
Hey, Frank.
Looks like it's a little cold out there, huh?

430
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,258
Please, guys.

431
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,883
Honey, do you think KFC is still open?

432
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,072
Oh.

433
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,197
Oh, shit.

434
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:56,913
Good morning.

435
00:23:58,374 --> 00:24:00,414
Now, that was a party.

436
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:06,336
Since when are you so shy?

437
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,168
No, I'm not.
I just...

438
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,760
Did I snore last night?
Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.

439
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,172
I don't remember.

440
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:17,308
I don't think so.

441
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:22,104
Um, listen, about last night.

442
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:27,315
I just got out of a very serious
and traumatic relationship.

443
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:31,315
I'm kind of in a weird place right now.

444
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:33,609
What?

445
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,993
Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.

446
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,752
Mitch, with an "M."

447
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:42,996
Right, um, look.

448
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:48,254
Whatever. We were just having a little fun.
You have nothing to worry about.

449
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,674
No.

450
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:52,220
Yeah, you're right.
I'm okay with it.

451
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:57,055
- It's casual. I was just...
- Um, I got to go to class, so...

452
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:00,648
So, how do we do this? Shall I...

453
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:02,858
You want to leave me your number?

454
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,615
- You don't even have to worry about it.
- Okay.

455
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:11,410
See you around.

456
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,079
Bye.

457
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,333
I love you.

467
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,279
What do you think? Honestly.
Shoot me straight.

468
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:47,615
Really good.

469
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,697
- You look great.
- Really?

470
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:53,741
- Yeah.
- God, I went a little bit...

471
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:56,161
- Got crazy last night.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:59,422
I still haven't heard from Frank.
I'm worried.

473
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,875
Hello?

474
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,005
Come on in.

475
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,925
Is this one of your guys here?

476
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:09,804
- Three fire hazards over here.
- What are you doing?

477
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:17,441
Cheese, is that you?

478
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:22,068
Hello, Mitch, Bernard.
See you guys haven't changed much.

479
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:23,066
Who is this?

480
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,532
Remember Cheese,
Rodney's kid brother?

481
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:29,370
Actually, my name isn't Cheese any more.
It's Gordon Pritchard.

482
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,657
Oh, yeah!

483
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:32,661
Chee-eese!

484
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:34,996
Didn't we lock you in a Dumpster once?

485
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,048
I got out.

486
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:40,052
Cool, man.
I'm glad you did.

487
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:44,673
- You had a good time last night?
- Yeah.

488
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:48,267
There might be some whippits
lying around if you want them.

489
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:50,846
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

490
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,768
Campus patrol?

491
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,268
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

492
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,150
I'm the dean.

493
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,233
Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

494
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:02,492
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

495
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,700
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

496
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,203
What are you talking about?

497
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,958
You can't do that. I've already paid
the first and last month's rent!

498
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,126
Look at that.

499
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,125
You have a week to vacate the premises,
and I thank you for your cooperation.

500
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,335
Great.

501
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,590
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

502
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,720
It's been good seeing you.
It looks like you're doing great.

503
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,316
Frank, this is a safe place.

504
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:43,196
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

505
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,834
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

506
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:49,332
We can say anything here.

507
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:51,294
Anything?

508
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,882
It's okay, honey.
That's why we came.

509
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:04,895
Well, uh, I guess I...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

510
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:09,107
I mean, suddenly you get married

511
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:11,567
and you're supposed
to be this entirely different guy.

512
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,483
I don't feel different.

513
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,363
Take yesterday, for example.

514
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:20,498
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

515
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,243
And uh,

516
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:27,292
I happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order,

517
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:32,589
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

518
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,007
Her panties.

519
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,261
Uh...

520
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:42,394
Odds are they're probably
basic white, cotton underpants.

521
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:47,108
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties. "

522
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:48,903
"Maybe it's a thong. "

523
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:54,529
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about. "

524
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,989
You know? And I started feeling...

525
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,411
What?

526
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:03,246
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest. Are we not?

527
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,911
We are. It's okay.

528
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:10,129
It's okay. Please continue.

529
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:13,170
I don't know
where I was going with that.

530
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:18,769
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

531
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:22,640
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

532
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:26,947
<i>that I'm gonna have sex
with only one person</i>

533
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:30,650
for the rest of my life.

534
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:35,079
Walsh tells me
your San Diego trip was a blast!

535
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:36,577
Yeah.

536
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,912
How was Hooters?

537
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,208
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

538
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:41,754
Yeah, right!

539
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:43,244
Skittles?

540
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,669
No, thanks.

541
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:47,250
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

542
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:51,592
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

543
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:53,058
What's wrong with it?

544
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:56,594
For one thing, it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth

545
00:29:56,688 --> 00:30:00,307
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1966.

546
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:03,106
Most notably, clause four.

547
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:04,571
Shall I continue?

548
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:07,064
- I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

549
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:09,116
- Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

550
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:10,614
- Hi.
- Hey.

551
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:13,908
I don't think you've met my daughter.
Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

552
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:18,125
Nice to meet you, Mitch.

553
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,122
Hi. Nice to meet you.

554
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:22,623
- How was the slumber party?
- Great.

555
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:24,757
Movies and popcorn.

556
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:26,844
She's an angel.

557
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:31,057
It makes me sound old, but I can't believe
how fast she's growing up.

558
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:33,931
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

559
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:37,890
To think in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school!

560
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,197
You okay?

561
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:45,275
I thought you said high school.

562
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:47,277
Yeah.
Shocking, isn't it?

563
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,246
Yes, it is.

564
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:00,789
Give me a break.

565
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:02,379
Hey, Mitch.

566
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:09,511
Hey, man. Did you have a good day?

567
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:11,430
Not too bad.

568
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:14,059
What's going on?

569
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:18,313
I thought maybe I could crash here
tonight, if that's all right.

570
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:21,322
Marissa is going through
some personal stuff.

571
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:27,281
Personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked?

572
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,908
That and some other stuff.

573
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,377
No problem.
Make yourself at home.

574
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:35,709
Thanks.

575
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:36,916
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

576
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:40,135
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

577
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,761
In other words, forget the normal rules
that apply to college and society,

578
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:48,473
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

579
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:52,727
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

580
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:55,772
where community status
and more importantly, age,

581
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:58,105
have no bearing whatsoever.

582
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:01,365
Yeah? From the guy who probably
won't get in.

583
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,205
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

584
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,204
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

585
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:10,375
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

586
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,797
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

587
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:17,216
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

588
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:21,253
As well as provide no public service
of any kind. This much I promise.

589
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,638
What the hell is going on here?

590
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:26,182
Guys, this is a very special occasion.

591
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:30,186
The Godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence.

592
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:31,651
The Godfather!

593
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:35,022
This is his damn house.
He sleeps 20 feet away.

594
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:39,283
We need to talk.

595
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:40,567
Kitchen.

596
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:44,991
Sit good for me. I'm gonna talk
to Uncle Mitch for a second.

597
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,787
There you go, buddy.

598
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:50,128
- How long have these people been here?
- All day.

599
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,788
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

600
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,545
What are you talking about?

601
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:58,136
This is called "rush. "
We're officially starting a fraternity.

602
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:00,181
I like it. It's genius!

603
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,810
You've got to be kidding me.

604
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:04,018
You heard Pritchard.
We're obligated to do this.

605
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:08,186
This house is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

606
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,151
Fraternity solves both of those.

607
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,811
But this is my house.
I live here, Beanie.

608
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,323
I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

609
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,994
I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

610
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,083
Did you or did you not
have a good time at the party?

611
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,912
I had an awesome time.

612
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,372
I know you had an awesome time.

613
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,921
The entire town knows
you had an awesome time.

614
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,547
I'm trying to ask Mitch whether
he had an awesome time.

615
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,297
- I had a good time.
- That's good.

616
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,428
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

617
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:38,841
- More good...
- God. I mean...

618
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:42,636
I don't understand. I don't know why it's
so hard for you to admit you want this.

619
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:46,017
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

620
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,399
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

621
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:52,355
I know you guys are trying to help,
but the truth of the matter is,

622
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,235
I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

623
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,410
And the fact is,
I've got 40 strangers out in my living room

624
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:03,206
and all I want to do is
get some fuckin' sleep.

625
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:07,590
So, I'm sorry, but we're not
starting a fraternity.

626
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:10,843
I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "effing. "

627
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,006
All you got to do is
say "earmuffs" to him.

628
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,175
Then you can say,
"fuck, shit, bitch," whatever you want.

629
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:16,513
Cock. Balls.

630
00:34:16,602 --> 00:34:19,354
I'm just proving a point.
You don't have to celebrate it, Frank.

631
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,847
- Sorry.
- Take them off. Don't say sorry to me.

632
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:24,563
You let down Frank, you let down me,
you let down Max.

633
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:27,191
And right about now,
I'm having a real hard time

634
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:30,448
trying to figure out why I take my time
to try to help you get over...

635
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,693
Earmuffs. That whore that you dated.

636
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,577
Wanna go out and see the other guys?
Uncle Mitch is sorry.

637
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:40,628
Say "yes. "

638
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:41,876
Yes.

639
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:50,921
Here's the deal.
Listen up!

640
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,720
All together, we've picked
14 pledges.

641
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,767
Wait, who's this guy?

642
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,265
That's Blue.

643
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,681
He's an old Navy vet
who hangs around my store.

644
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:01,483
But don't worry.
He's legit.

645
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:04,107
He looks like he's 100 years old.
He wants to pledge?

646
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:07,780
Are you kidding me?
The Old Man River won't shut up about it.

647
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,825
Go time!

648
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:27,967
Don't make this any harder
on yourself!

649
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,946
What's going on?

650
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:44,652
You tell anyone about this,
I'll fuckin' kill you!

651
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,068
I'm kidding. We'll have him back tonight.
Okay, sweetie?

652
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:48,537
Let's go!

653
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:02,710
Come on, let's go.
There we go, Blue.

654
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:14,897
Congratulations, gentlemen.

655
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:17,060
You should all be
very proud of yourselves.

656
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:20,107
Each and every one of you
has been hand-picked

657
00:36:20,198 --> 00:36:23,697
to represent our inaugural
pledge class.

658
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:26,276
Over the next 21 days,

659
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:32,991
you're all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain.

660
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,462
Frank, just pace yourself.

661
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:41,505
Copy that. Just got
a little overexcited. Sorry.

662
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:45,844
At this point
you may be asking yourself,

663
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:50,514
"Why am I holding
this 30-pound cinderblock in my hands?"

664
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:54,559
You might also ask yourself,

665
00:36:55,612 --> 00:37:00,952
"Why does this cinderblock
have a long piece of string

666
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:03,488
tied to it?"

667
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,411
And finally,

668
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:12,292
"Why's the other end of this string
tied securely

669
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,791
to your penis?"

670
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:19,256
And the answer, ladies, is trust.

671
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:23,556
This is your first test.

672
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:25,929
Spanish!

673
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:28,310
Do you trust we've provided you
with enough slack

674
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:30,937
so your block will land safely
on the lawn?!

675
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,569
Sir, yes, sir.

676
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:34,445
- And Blue!
- Yes, sir?

677
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,986
Do you trust that I do not want
to see you die tonight?

678
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:39,364
- Sir, yes, sir.
- You're my boy!

679
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:40,733
Thank you, sir.

680
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:44,868
About face.

681
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:49,962
Step to the edge!

682
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:56,335
Pledges, prepare to release!

683
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,135
One...

684
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,758
two...

685
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:03,978
three! Release!

686
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,741
Wasn't meant to happen
like that, Weensie!

687
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,403
Walk it off, big guy.
We're coming down.

688
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:25,244
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

689
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,579
<i># I've been laid more times than God</i>

690
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,880
<i># Got six kids in Laung-Pau-Lad</i>

691
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,841
Two, three, four!

692
00:38:31,928 --> 00:38:33,921
One, two, three, four

693
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:38,308
<i># I don't know, but it's been said
One more lap and I'll be dead</i>

694
00:38:38,393 --> 00:38:39,887
<i>Faster!</i>

695
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:45,018
Jesus. Who are these people?

696
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:50,066
Patricia, get security
to the South Lawn.

697
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:52,991
We have an illegal off-road vehicle
operating without a permit.

698
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:55,033
<i>They've already been called, sir.</i>

699
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,409
Uh, call them again.

700
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:06,672
It's been two weeks.
How are these guys still a fraternity?

701
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,501
They're not a fraternity, sir.

702
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:11,548
They've been approved for temporary
status by the student council.

703
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:13,927
Half these guys don't even
go to the school.

704
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:15,973
You see the one guy, he's like 90.

705
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,847
Technically, that doesn't matter.
They found a loophole.

706
00:39:18,938 --> 00:39:20,397
- A loophole?
- Yes.

707
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:22,059
It's interesting, sir.

708
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,484
As stupid as they appear,
they're actually very good at paperwork.

709
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,729
It's quite an anomaly.

710
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,480
I'm sorry, is that funny?
Are you a stand-up comic?

711
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,905
Is that what you do now?

712
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,872
This is me leaving. This is me leaving.

713
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,472
There he is.

714
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,052
What's going on, brother?

715
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:56,104
Nothing.
Just making some copies.

716
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:58,429
- Mm-hm.
- See you later.

717
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:00,730
Hey, Mitch, hang on a second.

718
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:03,605
I heard you guys are
starting up a fraternity.

719
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:05,071
Who told you that?

720
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,232
Nobody. Is it true?

721
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,733
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Right.

722
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:12,284
It sounds cool, man.
I want in.

723
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:17,202
Listen to me.
There is no fraternity.

724
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:19,620
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

725
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:22,419
You listen to me.
I need this, okay?

726
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:26,673
My wife, my job, my kids.
Every day is exactly the same.

727
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:29,089
I go golfing on Sundays.

728
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:31,259
I hate golf.

729
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:33,641
Don't blackball me, Mitch.
Please.

730
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,348
I am not blackballing you.
We work together, Walsh.

731
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:40,609
And I don't want to mix work
with whatever it is I do at home.

732
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:44,072
Trust me, you're not
missing anything, anyways.

733
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,447
Really? Heard you hooked up
with Goldberg's daughter.

734
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:48,995
Oh. Sorry.

735
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,539
Sorry.

736
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,951
That is untrue!

737
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,415
Mitch, all I'm saying is
think about it, okay?

738
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,969
Think about it!

739
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:04,129
Who cares if you work with the guy?

740
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:06,630
I do. I have a career to worry about.

741
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:10,769
You're killing me. You really need
to start embracing this whole thing.

742
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:13,725
I don't think you appreciate
everything I've done for you.

743
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:15,808
- For me?
- Yeah, for you.

744
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:19,151
You think I like avoiding my wife and kids
to hang out with 19-year-old girls?

745
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:20,898
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, I don't, man.

746
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,149
- I'm doing this for you.
- Hello.

747
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:26,493
Nicole, how's it going?
Who's this?

748
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,786
This is my daughter, Amanda.
Say hi.

749
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:31,199
Hi, Amanda.
You remember Nicole, right?

750
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:34,745
Yeah, we did a little chicken dancing
at the wedding, actually.

751
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,998
- How you been?
- Fine, thanks.

752
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:37,838
Good.

753
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:40,880
I actually wanted
to apologize to you about the wedding.

754
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:42,845
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

755
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,849
It's okay.
You just embarrassed yourself.

756
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:49,518
- I brought you a housewarming gift.
- That is really nice.

757
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:53,307
It's just a CD holder for your desk.
I thought it was...

758
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:55,975
That thing's a piece of crap.
Awful.

759
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:00,034
- I stopped selling it months ago.
- Please, Beanie.

760
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,742
- Thanks.
- A lot of complaints.

761
00:42:01,828 --> 00:42:03,785
But it's a nice gesture.

762
00:42:03,913 --> 00:42:05,657
Hey, Godfather!

763
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:08,121
- What's up?
- You the man, dog!

764
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,621
See you around, homey!

765
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,704
Did that guy just call you
the Godfather?

766
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:14,467
Must be joking around or something.

767
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,210
Where are you guys living now?

768
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:19,387
We're staying with my dad for a while,
until I find something better.

769
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:21,465
The move's been rough on Amanda.

770
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:26,185
My son Max is turning six on Sunday.
We're having a birthday party for him.

771
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:28,643
Just like, petting zoo and clowns.

772
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:30,606
But you guys are welcome to come.

773
00:42:30,692 --> 00:42:32,769
That's a great idea.
You should come.

774
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:36,397
What do you guys like better?
Nurse or cheerleader?

775
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:39,701
Hi, Nicole.

776
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,656
Hi, Frank.

777
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:44,238
It's a nice doll you have there.

778
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,409
Yeah, thanks.
She's okay.

779
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:48,878
Did you have fun at the wedding?

780
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,630
Yeah, it was fun.

781
00:42:53,134 --> 00:42:55,756
I'm just staying here, for right now.

782
00:42:55,846 --> 00:42:57,589
Anyways, we'll see you Sunday.

783
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:59,555
Sunday, right. Okay.

784
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,848
- Bye. Say bye.
- Bye.

785
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:03,927
Bye.

786
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:07,898
<i># Ain't no sunshine when she's gone...</i>

787
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:13,188
<i>- Hi, you've reached Marissa.
- And Frank!</i>

788
00:43:13,282 --> 00:43:15,607
<i>We're not here. Leave us a message.</i>

789
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:17,326
Hey, honey, it's me.

790
00:43:17,412 --> 00:43:21,077
Uh, listen, just was calling to check in.

791
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,784
I been kind of busy lately.
A lot of paperwork, stuff like that.

792
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:25,874
Damn it.

793
00:43:25,963 --> 00:43:30,542
<i>If you are satisfied,
press "1." To rerecord, press "2."</i>

794
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:34,465
Hey, Marissa, it's me.
Uh, listen.

795
00:43:34,556 --> 00:43:36,881
Gonna be in the neighborhood
a little bit later. Uh...

796
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:40,808
Didn't know if you wanted to
get together for frozen yoghurt sometime,

797
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:43,185
or maybe even a whole meal of food.

798
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:45,847
If that'd be agreeable...
Stupid.

799
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:50,023
<i>If you are satisfied, press "1."
To rerecord, press "2."</i>

800
00:43:50,948 --> 00:43:53,522
Hey, Marissa, it's Frank Ricard...

801
00:43:54,953 --> 00:43:56,115
<i>Okay, ladies.</i>

802
00:43:56,246 --> 00:43:59,200
The secret to a good B.J. is focus.

803
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,498
I don't care
if it's your husband of 10 years

804
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:06,580
or some hot sailor you met
at TGI Friday's a couple months ago.

805
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:08,334
Who never did call me back.

806
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:11,131
But did leave me
with a little something called Herpes.

807
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:14,047
Which I then gave to the dog.

808
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,723
But that's neither here nor there.

809
00:44:17,812 --> 00:44:20,848
Grab your vegetables.

810
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,687
Who's hungry? Who's hungry?

811
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,859
Come on.
Is this guy for real?

812
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:34,155
Yeah, he's fine.
He's the best there is.

813
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:37,290
Ladies, our thumbs are down,
our wrists are flexed,

814
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,831
and we're positioning ourselves
for insertion.

815
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:44,790
Ready? Do it.

816
00:44:48,805 --> 00:44:52,221
Good, Marissa. You can use a little teeth
but you don't want to be a biter.

817
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:59,682
You're gonna do the work, ladies.
These carrots won't ejaculate themselves.

818
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,689
Get into it. Very good.

819
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,113
Good. Good. Not so good.

820
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,901
Please, you're not Romulus
sucking on the teats of the mother wolf.

821
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:13,154
If you know your Greek mythology.

822
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:16,748
We are giving head, not breast-feeding
from a mythological beast.

823
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:22,960
Funny? You won't be laughing when
somebody prematurely pops in your face.

824
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:26,385
It stings
and that is now why I have a lazy eye.

825
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:29,556
Thank you. Please continue.

826
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:31,136
Up and in.

827
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:34,513
And mind the stepchildren.

828
00:45:34,605 --> 00:45:36,645
Mind the stepchildren.

829
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,446
<i># I'm on the hunt I'm after you</i>

830
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,624
<i># Smell like I sound</i>

831
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,287
<i># I'm lost in a crowd...</i>

832
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:57,628
Marissa, come on.
That's it.

833
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:01,795
Mmm.

834
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:04,212
I like what I see.
Don't be afraid to arch it.

835
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:09,262
Marissa, come on.
That's it.

836
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:15,184
Everybody can learn from Marissa.
I'm gonna take a quick five.

837
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:17,268
You guys continue.

838
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,437
Good one!

839
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,404
Nice work, Marissa.

840
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:25,368
Way to give a hundred and ten percent.

841
00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:27,944
When I get back there,
I'm gonna show you something I call

842
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:30,745
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Penis. "

843
00:46:31,668 --> 00:46:32,867
Did you see that movie?

844
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:36,580
I really like it cos of
the flying and the magic.

845
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:39,423
Bastard!

846
00:46:40,178 --> 00:46:42,550
Someone just made a bad mistake!

847
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:54,899
Jesus Christ, Frank!
What the hell are you doing here?

848
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:56,647
You know this person?

849
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:58,862
I am so sorry.
Are you hurt?

850
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,197
Yes, I'm hurt.

851
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,122
Bob's not here. They're on the rocks.

852
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:14,956
You've outdone yourself once again.

853
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:17,968
It's nice, right?
Spanish, what the hell are you doing?

854
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:20,676
I'm just getting some water.
This suit is crazy hot.

855
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:24,508
Put your head on. Are you nuts?
That can be very traumatic for kids.

856
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:27,011
- I'm sorry.
- Don't "sorry" me.

857
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:29,514
Shake the tail when you walk.
You're better than that.

858
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:30,771
Take it easy.

859
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,604
You don't see me breaking
the fourth wall.

860
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:34,521
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

861
00:47:34,613 --> 00:47:36,440
- Nice costume.
- Thanks a lot.

862
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:38,774
- This is a great party.
- When'd you get here?

863
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:41,786
Just a few minutes ago.
This is my boyfriend, Mark.

864
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:45,288
Flew over from Colorado yesterday.
This is Mitch and Beanie.

865
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,953
How's it hanging, boys?

866
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,075
Pleasure.

867
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,708
So, listen, uh, somebody told me

868
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:53,206
you guys are in a fraternity,
is that right?

869
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,709
- No.
- Is that true?

870
00:47:55,804 --> 00:48:00,431
Not really. I mean, no.
It's more kind of like a social club.

871
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:02,925
We just watch football
and hang out.

872
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,594
Hang out and spank each other, I bet.

873
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,813
It's not like that.
We don't take it too seriously...

874
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,985
Blue! How come there's no ice
in my lemonade?

875
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,530
Sorry, sir!

876
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:15,022
You drop down
and you give me ten!

877
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:18,202
Now! Let's go!

878
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:19,450
It's Frank.

879
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:23,536
I'm gonna give you these.
It's my work phone. Call me.

880
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,211
I own all six locations.

881
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:29,461
Max wants to open up his gifts,
but I thought maybe one would be all right?

882
00:48:29,592 --> 00:48:32,427
Come on in here, Maxy.
You guys mind giving me a minute?

883
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:35,217
We'll talk surround sound later.
I'll cut you a deal.

884
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:37,346
I'm not gonna hold you over
the coals for it.

885
00:48:37,434 --> 00:48:39,059
How you doing, bud?

886
00:48:39,144 --> 00:48:41,932
We can open Uncle Frank's,
but we got to wait for the others.

887
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:44,692
I don't know who's more excited,
Frank or Max.

888
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:47,397
Rip it up! Go at there. What is it?

889
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:50,736
Could it be a space ship?
Let's see what we got!

890
00:48:50,823 --> 00:48:53,148
Yeah!

891
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:56,490
What do you think, Max?
It's got three speeds.

892
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:05,332
Damn it.

893
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:12,299
Excuse me.
I'll have one of those.

894
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:15,724
I'm Mark. What's your name?

895
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,767
- Tracy.
- Right.

896
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,022
Nice meeting you... Tracy.

897
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:24,103
- Right on there.
- There we go.

898
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,650
Okay, you can go back out
and play now.

899
00:49:26,738 --> 00:49:28,019
Come on.

900
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,024
There. Take your doll.

901
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,499
I think she likes you.
She ignores most people.

902
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,042
I feel honored.

903
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:44,380
So, uh, Mark, he seems like
an interesting guy.

904
00:49:44,466 --> 00:49:46,127
He's harmless.

905
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,716
- How long have you been together?
- Two years.

906
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:53,179
I told him I had a crush on you
in high school and I think I got him jealous.

907
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,177
You had a crush on me?

908
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,437
You got to be kidding me.
I was obsessed with you.

909
00:49:58,524 --> 00:50:03,103
Not in a dangerous way.
I just watched you a lot, from a distance.

910
00:50:03,196 --> 00:50:05,355
How come you never
asked me out?

911
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:08,021
You were pretty intimidating back then.

912
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:12,578
You were always with older guys.
You had that Whitesnake jean jacket.

913
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:15,665
You smoked Marlboro Reds.
You were way out of my league.

914
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:17,126
Mm-hm.

915
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,625
I still have the Whitesnake
jean jacket.

916
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:25,089
I'm still pretty intimidated by you.

917
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:32,173
You're bad.

918
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:34,558
You're right. I am bad.

919
00:50:37,525 --> 00:50:39,684
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry...

920
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:42,067
- I guess we're not knocking?
- Excuse me.

921
00:50:42,155 --> 00:50:44,444
Excuse me, I've got to get
back to work.

922
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:47,071
...just returning these Band-Aids.

923
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,369
What are you gonna do?
Tell on me?

924
00:50:50,456 --> 00:50:54,371
You know you can't, buddy.
It's guy code. Okay?

925
00:50:54,628 --> 00:50:57,664
Guys don't tell on other guys.
That's, uh...

926
00:50:57,756 --> 00:50:59,416
something chicks do.

927
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:04,128
You're not a chick, are you?

928
00:51:05,765 --> 00:51:07,841
All right.

929
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:10,761
Good talk.
I'll see you out there.

930
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,773
Hey there, buddy.

931
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:22,608
Need a friend?

932
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:25,117
Yeah, me, too.

933
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:30,117
Hey.

934
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:39,760
Wow.

935
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:43,169
- She's a beauty, ain't she?
- Yeah.

936
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:45,423
What kind of gun is this?

937
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:47,427
That's a tranquillizer gun.

938
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,770
If any of these little fuckers
decide to freak out on the kids,

939
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:52,315
I get to take them down.

940
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,817
Ain't that right, mother? What?

941
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,861
That's what I thought. Shut up.

942
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,617
Hey, be careful with that.

943
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,406
That's the most powerful
tranq gun on the market.

944
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:05,074
Got her in Mexico.

945
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,371
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

946
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,246
They say it could puncture
the skin of a rhino from a hundred...

947
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:11,250
Ow!

948
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,417
Oh!

949
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,096
Yes!

950
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,840
That's awesome!

951
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:22,928
What?

952
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:26,015
You just took one
in the jugular, man!

953
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:28,017
Ha!

954
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:29,649
Whoa.

955
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:30,938
Yes!

956
00:52:32,487 --> 00:52:34,278
Oh, my God.

957
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,861
Oh, my God, I did.
Is this bad?

958
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:39,861
Is this bad?

959
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,704
Pull that out.
That shit is not cool.

960
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:49,410
Wait. Wait. Pull what out?

961
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:53,040
The dart, man.
You got a fuckin' dart in your neck.

962
00:52:56,095 --> 00:52:59,013
You're craz... You're crazy, man.

963
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:00,973
You're crazy.

964
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:02,768
I like you.

965
00:53:03,562 --> 00:53:05,222
But you're crazy.

966
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:08,732
I feel tired.

967
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,356
Look who's coming!
The spaceman's coming.

968
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:19,824
# Happy birthday to you

969
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:29,916
# Happy birthday dear...

970
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:36,507
Help me, Mommy!

971
00:53:58,498 --> 00:54:02,033
<i># Hello darkness my old friend</i>

972
00:54:03,045 --> 00:54:06,544
<i># I've come to talk with you again</i>

973
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:11,500
<i># Because a vision softly creeping</i>

974
00:54:12,472 --> 00:54:16,173
<i># Left its seeds
while I was sleeping...</i>

975
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:20,473
This is the most beautiful day.

976
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:23,108
Yes.

977
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:25,692
It really is.

978
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,828
I've missed you, Frank.

979
00:54:34,914 --> 00:54:37,286
I'm so glad you're back.

980
00:54:38,293 --> 00:54:40,286
I've missed you too, honey.

981
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,457
You look gorgeous.

982
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:46,756
You're sweet.

983
00:54:46,844 --> 00:54:50,344
<i>#... I turned my collar
to the cold and damp</i>

984
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,596
<i># When my...</i>

985
00:54:56,146 --> 00:54:58,139
Urgh! Urgh!

986
00:54:58,232 --> 00:55:01,019
- He just French kissed me!
- Urgh!

987
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,233
Shit!

988
00:55:06,408 --> 00:55:07,783
This better work.

989
00:55:07,868 --> 00:55:11,735
The board members are beginning to ask
questions about this "civilian fraternity. "

990
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:14,118
Don't worry, it'll work.

991
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:19,118
Here she comes.
Her name is Megan Huang.

992
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:20,588
She's student council president,

993
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:24,422
prelaw, star of the tennis team,
a very promising young woman.

994
00:55:24,552 --> 00:55:26,426
A young woman with a lot to lose.

995
00:55:26,513 --> 00:55:28,055
- Megan, hello.
- Hi.

996
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:29,717
Have a seat.

997
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:38,603
I'm sure you know Dean Pritchard.

998
00:55:38,693 --> 00:55:40,187
Don't turn around.

999
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:46,531
Megan, this little uh, fraternity
over on Brook Street

1000
00:55:46,618 --> 00:55:50,451
has become quite an inconvenience
for us, okay?

1001
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,704
And as student body president,
you approved their temporary status.

1002
00:55:54,794 --> 00:55:58,745
Unfortunately, you alone
have the ability to revoke it.

1003
00:55:58,841 --> 00:56:01,296
So, we're gonna need you
to go ahead and do that.

1004
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:04,671
Revoke it? Why?
Everybody loves those guys.

1005
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:09,058
They throw the sickest parties.
I met my boyfriend at their casino night.

1006
00:56:09,144 --> 00:56:10,971
Uh-huh, that's great.

1007
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:14,479
It says here you are applying
to Columbia Law School.

1008
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:17,272
Wow, that's a tough school
to get into.

1009
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:21,360
You know, Dean Pritchard has
some serious connections at Columbia.

1010
00:56:22,158 --> 00:56:23,902
Are you bribing me?

1011
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:25,488
Hey.

1012
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:28,988
Don't make life
harder on yourself, Chang.

1013
00:56:29,082 --> 00:56:30,624
It's Huang.

1014
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:34,294
Whatever.
How's the tennis season going?

1015
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:38,498
I made some um, minor changes,
but overall it's okay.

1016
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:41,380
- It's a pretty standard lease.
- Great.

1017
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:45,516
Thank you for taking a look at it for me.
This stuff always confuses me.

1018
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,846
Anytime.

1019
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:50,684
So, you and Mark are
moving in together?

1020
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:55,479
Yeah.
Well, financially it makes sense, so...

1021
00:56:55,945 --> 00:57:00,524
You know, there's something
I think you should know...

1022
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:03,279
uh, about Mark.

1023
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,865
What is it?

1024
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,997
Well...

1025
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:13,082
Relationships are a lot of work.

1026
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:16,210
And, I guess what I'm saying is uh...

1027
00:57:21,057 --> 00:57:22,551
Good luck.

1028
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:25,926
Oh. Okay. Well, thank you.

1029
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:28,014
Yeah. Listen, um,

1030
00:57:28,106 --> 00:57:32,484
I was thinking maybe sometime
we could get some dinner or something?

1031
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,527
- Yeah.
- If that's okay with you.

1032
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:36,441
- I'd like that.
- Yeah.

1033
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:41,112
Of course, leave it to me to wait until
you've got a boyfriend

1034
00:57:41,205 --> 00:57:42,996
to finally ask you out.

1035
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:44,824
Timing was never your thing.

1036
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,245
No.

1037
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:50,792
- Okay, so, thank you.
- Yeah.

1038
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:54,380
And, um, call me about dinner.

1039
00:57:54,468 --> 00:57:56,592
- I will.
- Excuse me, sir!

1040
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,719
We have a situation, sir!

1041
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:01,013
What are you guys doing here?
I said never at work.

1042
00:58:01,101 --> 00:58:02,476
But it's an emergency.

1043
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:05,017
We can only buy KY Jelly
in the 4-ounce tubes.

1044
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:10,101
Industrial size cans will take up to
3 to 4 business days, so we're screwed.

1045
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:11,274
What's all that for?

1046
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,486
It's Blue's birthday.
We're having a KY wrestling match.

1047
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,907
You know what?
Can we talk about this later, please?

1048
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:24,365
I'm born again, baby! Whoo-hoo!

1049
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,296
Yeah! Yeah!

1050
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:38,386
This doesn't seem fair!
I'm on a roll!

1051
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:51,364
Rip his head off!

1052
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,816
Rip his head off!

1053
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:08,047
I like your room.

1054
00:59:08,134 --> 00:59:11,669
Thanks a lot. It's kind of
a home away from home for me.

1055
00:59:11,763 --> 00:59:13,921
All the posters are mine.

1056
00:59:14,265 --> 00:59:17,599
I don't usually like fraternity guys.
They're such losers.

1057
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:21,815
But, you're like... mature.

1058
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:23,604
Mature?

1059
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,891
Yeah.

1060
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:28,355
So, where do you sleep, anyway?

1061
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:31,070
Usually, I sleep at home.

1062
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,567
Sometimes I do crash here.

1063
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:36,996
This is a futon, actually.
It pulls out, you know.

1064
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,708
Boy, I didn't realize.

1065
00:59:39,294 --> 00:59:41,002
Can I see it?

1066
00:59:41,463 --> 00:59:42,957
The futon?

1067
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,715
Yeah.

1068
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:49,754
Wow. Um...

1069
00:59:51,516 --> 00:59:53,425
Amy, I'm sorry.

1070
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:57,269
I'm married.
And I can't do this.

1071
00:59:57,356 --> 00:59:59,313
I don't want this to get weird, but...

1072
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,021
Right. I see.

1073
01:00:02,653 --> 01:00:05,441
But why don't you
leave me your number?

1074
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:08,652
This way, if something happens to my wife,
I can give you a call.

1075
01:00:08,743 --> 01:00:11,828
- I don't think so.
- Okay, that was a bad idea.

1076
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:17,499
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to tonight's main event!

1077
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,339
Yeah!

1078
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:26,217
In this corner,
weighing in at 110 pounds,

1079
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:29,222
and pushing 89 years of age,

1080
01:00:29,307 --> 01:00:32,427
the recent recipient of a brand-new
plastic hip,

1081
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:34,808
Joseph "Blue" Pulasky!

1082
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:43,731
And in the opposite corner,
with a combined weight of 210 pounds,

1083
01:00:43,823 --> 01:00:46,529
hailing from Hayden dormitory,

1084
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:48,741
Jenny and Jeanie!

1085
01:00:54,544 --> 01:00:57,545
Fighters, are you ready?

1086
01:00:58,423 --> 01:00:59,834
Hey,

1087
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:01,918
Blue, you sure
you're okay with this?

1088
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,798
Just ring the fucking bell, you pansy.

1089
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:08,173
Let's get it on!

1090
01:01:13,023 --> 01:01:15,645
- Come on.
- Come on, grandpa, let's go.

1091
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:17,895
Let's go, birthday boy!

1092
01:01:17,987 --> 01:01:20,822
What's the matter, you scared?

1093
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:22,187
Hello?

1094
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:42,386
# I close my eyes

1095
01:01:43,389 --> 01:01:47,518
# Only for a moment
and the moment's gone

1096
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:52,482
# All my dreams

1097
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:57,648
# Pass before my eyes in curiosity

1098
01:01:59,157 --> 01:02:01,613
# Dust in the wind...

1099
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:04,952
Looks like we better put the KY wrestling
on hold for a while.

1100
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,913
Good idea.

1101
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,579
Please don't beat yourself up
over this thing. It's not your fault.

1102
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,960
Damn it, Blue was old.

1103
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:16,836
That's what old people do.
They die.

1104
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:18,552
I'm sorry.

1105
01:02:19,013 --> 01:02:26,012
# All we are is dust in the wind

1106
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:31,642
# Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh #

1107
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:34,105
You're my boy, Blue!

1108
01:02:34,614 --> 01:02:36,523
You're my boy.

1109
01:02:40,162 --> 01:02:42,451
It's been a weird month, huh?

1110
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:44,034
Yeah.

1111
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:49,328
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't call you
on your birthday.

1112
01:02:49,422 --> 01:02:51,461
My birthday, what do you mean?

1113
01:02:51,548 --> 01:02:53,292
Yeah, last Thursday.

1114
01:02:54,677 --> 01:02:57,595
You forgot your birthday,
didn't you, Frank?

1115
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,720
I'm such an idiot.

1116
01:03:01,017 --> 01:03:06,012
- What have you been doing?
- I've been keeping busy.

1117
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:11,527
I uh... tried to join a new gym.

1118
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,195
That was one thing.

1119
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:18,697
And there's other stuff.
I can't remember, but, keeping busy.

1120
01:03:18,787 --> 01:03:22,488
You know, I've missed you.
You know?

1121
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,243
I want you to know that.

1122
01:03:24,335 --> 01:03:27,954
I was even thinking maybe tonight
we could get together back at home,

1123
01:03:28,048 --> 01:03:30,800
and, I don't know,
maybe put on the Sisqo CD...

1124
01:03:30,884 --> 01:03:33,554
I don't think that's such a good idea.

1125
01:03:33,846 --> 01:03:36,254
Really? You don't?

1126
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:38,306
I don't know.

1127
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,479
Maybe we rushed into this,
you know?

1128
01:03:42,397 --> 01:03:46,526
I mean, it just doesn't
feel right, does it?

1129
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:50,028
Being married?

1130
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:53,401
What do you mean?

1131
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:57,579
I mean, I think we should
get a divorce.

1132
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,242
Like a real divorce?

1133
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:03,628
Yeah.

1134
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:05,583
Gotcha.

1135
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,876
Okay, well um...

1136
01:04:09,593 --> 01:04:10,589
Huh.

1137
01:04:10,678 --> 01:04:11,709
I'm sorry.

1138
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:14,556
No. Actually, I got to run.

1139
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:16,016
Um...

1140
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:19,636
But, if I don't talk to you,

1141
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,351
keep on, keep trucking, you know?

1142
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,275
Okay, good stuff.

1143
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,166
Well, what do you think?

1144
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:43,377
Yeah, it's okay.

1145
01:04:43,465 --> 01:04:45,671
- Just okay?
- Yeah.

1146
01:04:46,885 --> 01:04:50,836
I had Mitch look at the lease.
He thinks it sounds like a good deal.

1147
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,719
You had Mitch look at the lease?
When?

1148
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,182
Last week,
I stopped by his office.

1149
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:58,560
- Oh, God.
- What?

1150
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,273
I don't know.

1151
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,650
I'm not so sure about that guy.

1152
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:05,980
Mitch? Why? He's so sweet.

1153
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:09,694
Something I saw last week,
at the birthday party.

1154
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:11,411
What did you see?

1155
01:05:11,496 --> 01:05:14,367
I didn't want to get into this, but...

1156
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:18,784
I walked in on him, and he was
harassing one of the caterers.

1157
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,290
A young girl.

1158
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,333
- Really?
- Yeah.

1159
01:05:22,425 --> 01:05:26,090
He was being aggressive
and grabbing her. It was disgusting.

1160
01:05:26,178 --> 01:05:29,512
I know he's your friend.

1161
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,924
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's Mitch.</i>

1162
01:05:32,018 --> 01:05:33,561
Hi, Mitch.

1163
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:36,516
I was thinking, if you're not too busy,

1164
01:05:36,607 --> 01:05:38,564
maybe I'd take you up
on that cup of coffee.

1165
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:42,186
<i>- Uh, now's not really a good time.
- Look.</i>

1166
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,488
I'm really sorry about the other day.
I want the chance to explain everything.

1167
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,116
<i>- I don't think so.
- It's uh...</i>

1168
01:05:50,205 --> 01:05:53,491
It's been kind of a tough day,

1169
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:55,957
and it'd really mean a lot.

1170
01:05:59,132 --> 01:06:02,383
Listen, there are a few things
I wanted to clear up,

1171
01:06:02,469 --> 01:06:06,966
because I get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who I am.

1172
01:06:07,058 --> 01:06:09,727
Really? What would
ever give you that idea?

1173
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:12,765
Okay, that's one pecan pie
and two coffees.

1174
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:16,190
And don't worry. For the Godfather,
it's always on the house.

1175
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,186
- Not here.
- I know who you are.

1176
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,569
I am Avi. I'm a big supporter
of what you guys are doing.

1177
01:06:21,657 --> 01:06:22,523
Thank you.

1178
01:06:22,617 --> 01:06:26,152
You are beautiful.
No offence, though. He is the king.

1179
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:28,784
You are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend.

1180
01:06:28,874 --> 01:06:31,282
That's very kind,
but I insist, I'll pay.

1181
01:06:31,377 --> 01:06:33,286
Your money, it's not good here.

1182
01:06:33,379 --> 01:06:35,835
- Okay.
- I look forward to pledging next semester.

1183
01:06:36,883 --> 01:06:40,631
Okay, now don't you think
this is going a little far?

1184
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,887
I heard one of your pledges died.
Is that true?

1185
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:47,558
Well, yes.
But he was really old.

1186
01:06:47,644 --> 01:06:50,431
And I feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back,

1187
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,729
it'll show that it was probably
of natural causes.

1188
01:06:52,816 --> 01:06:56,731
Look, to be honest, you're really not
the person I thought you were.

1189
01:06:56,821 --> 01:06:59,229
But it's okay. It's not a big deal.

1190
01:06:59,324 --> 01:07:01,613
I think that I am that person.

1191
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:05,616
And I feel more like myself now
than I have in a really long time.

1192
01:07:05,706 --> 01:07:08,493
So, that's why you go around
harassing young women?

1193
01:07:08,584 --> 01:07:10,624
- Doing what?
- The caterer.

1194
01:07:10,712 --> 01:07:13,417
At the birthday party.
Mark told me about her.

1195
01:07:13,506 --> 01:07:16,840
Wait a second.
I didn't want to say anything,

1196
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:20,130
but Mark is the one
who was acting inappropriate.

1197
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:22,429
- You are unbelievable.
- It's true.

1198
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:24,260
Hey, look who it is.

1199
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:26,060
Hey, Mitch.

1200
01:07:26,479 --> 01:07:27,760
Darcie, hey.

1201
01:07:27,856 --> 01:07:30,774
Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

1202
01:07:30,859 --> 01:07:33,148
I just didn't want you
to worry about my dad.

1203
01:07:33,237 --> 01:07:36,072
He doesn't know anything,
so it's totally cool.

1204
01:07:36,157 --> 01:07:38,363
- Her dad?
- Yeah.

1205
01:07:38,493 --> 01:07:44,781
Yeah. You know, it's nothing, really.
I mean, they actually work together.

1206
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:50,750
Um, we gotta run, cos we got this prom
committee thing, so I'll see you around.

1207
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,378
- Sorry.
- Bye.

1208
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:56,093
Prom committee thing?

1209
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:58,795
That I actually can explain.

1210
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:00,929
Right, I'm sure you can.

1211
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:03,555
- I have to go.
- Please wait a second.

1212
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:06,516
No, really. I have to go.

1213
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:13,442
Hey. Chicks.

1214
01:08:13,531 --> 01:08:15,441
Don't worry for her.

1215
01:08:15,533 --> 01:08:18,700
Love, it's a motherfucker, huh?

1216
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:29,335
Holy shit!

1217
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:54,447
<i>Dear Mitch, if you're holding
this letter, you already know.</i>

1218
01:08:54,536 --> 01:08:58,830
<i>The house has been boarded up.
The windows, the doors, everything.</i>

1219
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:01,703
<i>We're at the Comfort Inn,
room 112.</i>

1220
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:03,833
<i>I love you. Frank.</i>

1221
01:09:04,338 --> 01:09:08,502
<i>Due to these infractions,
not only will your house be repossessed,</i>

1222
01:09:08,593 --> 01:09:12,093
<i>but those of you who are students
will be expelled from the university</i>

1223
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,346
<i>for your participation in
a non-sanctioned fraternity.</i>

1224
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:19,134
<i>Please take a moment to
allow this information to sink in.</i>

1225
01:09:23,484 --> 01:09:26,604
<i>Good. Believe me,</i>

1226
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:31,773
<i>the actions taken by the student council
have come as a great shock to me.</i>

1227
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:34,950
<i>But unfortunately, there's nothing
I can do about it.</i>

1228
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:38,953
<i>Thank you for your time.
Good luck, and God bless America.</i>

1229
01:09:44,215 --> 01:09:46,255
He can't do that.

1230
01:09:46,343 --> 01:09:48,419
This guy's playing hardball.

1231
01:09:49,263 --> 01:09:52,430
I got to say,
I'm kind of impressed by him.

1232
01:09:52,516 --> 01:09:53,845
Well, we're expelled.

1233
01:09:53,935 --> 01:09:56,391
My life is over and I'm gonna wind up
working at Red Lobster.

1234
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:00,228
- You already work in Red Lobster.
- Yeah, but it's part time, Dick.

1235
01:10:00,317 --> 01:10:02,891
- Guys.
- Hey, listen.

1236
01:10:02,986 --> 01:10:07,483
This is a serious situation.
I mean, I'm kicked out of school.

1237
01:10:08,952 --> 01:10:11,359
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My mom's gonna kill me.

1238
01:10:11,454 --> 01:10:13,661
Come on, she's not gonna kill you.

1239
01:10:13,749 --> 01:10:17,083
Yes, she is. I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

1240
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:18,829
When I left, she said,

1241
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:22,622
"Weensie, screw this up, I'll kill you. "

1242
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:24,757
She showed me the knife.

1243
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:28,429
Shh.

1244
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:32,886
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.
He's gonna take care of this thing, okay?

1245
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,638
It's gonna be all right.

1246
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,023
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

1247
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,732
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

1248
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,777
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

1249
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,111
Good. I need your help with something.

1250
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:52,779
Off the record.
You do this, you're in.

1251
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,286
Sir, yes, sir.

1252
01:10:54,377 --> 01:10:58,244
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7-A,

1253
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:00,379
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

1254
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:02,792
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

1255
01:11:02,886 --> 01:11:05,757
Booker, make two copies of this petition,
have it notarized,

1256
01:11:05,848 --> 01:11:08,386
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then...

1257
01:11:08,476 --> 01:11:11,845
Listen, Donald tells me you got these guys
working prep for the arbitration.

1258
01:11:11,938 --> 01:11:15,142
I told you five times, I want them working
the Sunshine Square deal.

1259
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:17,772
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

1260
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:20,150
so now I have them helping
with the arbitration,

1261
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,813
and I'd appreciate it if you let me
handle my own team,

1262
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:26,029
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

1263
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:28,991
All right.

1264
01:11:29,082 --> 01:11:31,040
Wanna make sure
you're on top of it.

1265
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:32,585
Well, I am.

1266
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:34,746
Well, good. Carry on.

1267
01:11:34,839 --> 01:11:37,923
See? That's why they call him
the Godfather.

1268
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:39,634
Hey.

1269
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:42,170
Just take care of it.

1270
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:49,096
Gentlemen, got some good news
and I got some bad news.

1271
01:11:49,187 --> 01:11:51,061
Did a little research.

1272
01:11:51,148 --> 01:11:54,482
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

1273
01:11:54,568 --> 01:11:56,561
We have the right to a formal evaluation

1274
01:11:56,654 --> 01:11:59,276
before they can deny
our official application.

1275
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:03,280
However, we're now subject to
a charter certification review

1276
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:04,829
given by the board of trustees.

1277
01:12:04,913 --> 01:12:06,289
Damn it.

1278
01:12:06,707 --> 01:12:09,993
Wait. Wait, what does
that mean exactly?

1279
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:13,954
According to university bylaws,
it's a thorough inspection of the fraternity,

1280
01:12:14,048 --> 01:12:16,041
and our contribution to the community.

1281
01:12:16,134 --> 01:12:18,376
Focuses on five categories:

1282
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,756
Academics, athletics, community service,

1283
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:24,519
debate, and school spirit.

1284
01:12:24,852 --> 01:12:27,723
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

1285
01:12:27,814 --> 01:12:29,688
And I'll see you around campus.

1286
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:32,692
Actually, all of us are
being tested. Yeah.

1287
01:12:32,778 --> 01:12:35,779
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

1288
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:39,448
It's in the bylaws. Every member
of the fraternity is subject to review

1289
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:41,991
in every category,
including academics.

1290
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,951
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

1291
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:47,580
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

1292
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,878
This is unbelievable.

1293
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:53,748
What happened to, "needing brotherhood
now more than ever?" They need us.

1294
01:12:53,843 --> 01:12:55,919
Come on, college is
overrated anyway.

1295
01:12:56,012 --> 01:12:59,216
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

1296
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:03,305
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

1297
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:05,387
and now people's lives are ruined.

1298
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,603
Ruined? Like, whose life is ruined?

1299
01:13:07,691 --> 01:13:09,351
Well, let's see.

1300
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:11,851
Uh, Blue's dead.

1301
01:13:11,946 --> 01:13:13,855
Frank's divorced.

1302
01:13:13,948 --> 01:13:17,780
I've lost my house.
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

1303
01:13:17,869 --> 01:13:22,164
And now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school,

1304
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:24,456
and you're not even gonna
help 'em out.

1305
01:13:38,017 --> 01:13:42,181
Is this thing gonna go down smooth?
I'm missing 18 holes of golf here.

1306
01:13:42,272 --> 01:13:45,107
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

1307
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:46,734
It should make for
a very entertaining day.

1308
01:13:46,818 --> 01:13:49,392
I'm going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus.

1309
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:50,354
Ditto.

1310
01:13:51,782 --> 01:13:55,780
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

1311
01:13:56,955 --> 01:13:59,327
Uh, unfortunately,

1312
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:03,663
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

1313
01:14:03,754 --> 01:14:07,420
So, we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

1314
01:14:07,967 --> 01:14:12,713
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's Crossfire,</i>

1315
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:17,718
famed political consultant,
the Raging Cajun, Mr. James Carville.

1316
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,643
- Thank you.
- Don't clap.

1317
01:14:24,735 --> 01:14:27,902
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here.

1318
01:14:27,989 --> 01:14:30,112
Topic number one.

1319
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:34,907
What is your position
on the role of government

1320
01:14:34,996 --> 01:14:38,864
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

1321
01:14:39,668 --> 01:14:42,076
Well, Dean, I'm glad you
asked that question...

1322
01:14:42,171 --> 01:14:45,338
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

1323
01:14:46,968 --> 01:14:48,795
Have at it, hoss.

1324
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:50,797
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

1325
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,676
Frank, no...

1326
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:00,682
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

1327
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,397
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited.

1328
01:15:03,487 --> 01:15:06,737
And as a corollary, the market
for technologies is shrinking.

1329
01:15:06,824 --> 01:15:09,196
As a world leader,
it is important for America to provide

1330
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:11,492
systematic research grants
for our scientists.

1331
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:15,447
I believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well-articulated innovation policy

1332
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:18,080
with emphasis on
human resource development. Thank you.

1333
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:26,338
- Where'd that come from?
- What happened? I blacked out.

1334
01:15:26,429 --> 01:15:27,924
It was awesome.

1335
01:15:28,014 --> 01:15:30,766
That was interesting.
Thank you very much.

1336
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:34,137
And, your rebuttal,
Mr. Carville?

1337
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:38,309
Uh, we have no response.

1338
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,442
That was perfect.

1339
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:47,115
That's the way you do it!
That's the way you debate.

1340
01:15:57,505 --> 01:15:59,379
Number 12.

1341
01:15:59,465 --> 01:16:04,211
Which of the following is
a generally accepted graphical technique

1342
01:16:04,304 --> 01:16:07,804
for determining first order
system parameters?

1343
01:16:08,517 --> 01:16:12,847
Is it, A, Herriod's method
of solving cubics?

1344
01:16:13,398 --> 01:16:16,150
B, Pythagorean triplets?

1345
01:16:16,234 --> 01:16:20,529
<i>Or C, the migration method of graphing
quadratic functions?</i>

1346
01:16:23,534 --> 01:16:25,361
Herriod's method of solving cubics.

1347
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:28,538
<i>The answer is A, Herriod's method
of solving cubics.</i>

1348
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,458
Good test.

1349
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,010
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

1350
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,303
Go Harrison!

1351
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:51,892
<i># Everybody dance now</i>

1352
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,773
<i># Everybody dance now</i>

1353
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:10,375
<i># Give me the music</i>

1354
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,753

01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,127

01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:25,926

1358
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,940
- Yes!
- Wow.

1359
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:42,070
Let's go, Cougars!

1360
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:49,335
Oh, no!

1361
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:52,209
Help me! Help me!

1362
01:17:55,762 --> 01:17:57,636
Dean Pritchard,
can I talk to you for a second?

1363
01:17:57,722 --> 01:17:59,964
Megan, I'm a little busy.

1364
01:18:00,058 --> 01:18:02,181
I didn't get into
Columbia Law School.

1365
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:03,847
How awful.

1366
01:18:03,938 --> 01:18:07,022
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

1367
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:08,139
I did say that.

1368
01:18:08,234 --> 01:18:10,356
No-one at Columbia
has even heard of you.

1369
01:18:10,444 --> 01:18:12,069
Oh, Megan.

1370
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:15,274
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

1371
01:18:15,366 --> 01:18:17,692
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work.

1372
01:18:17,786 --> 01:18:20,621
I bribe people all the time,
but I changed my mind. It's a free country.

1373
01:18:20,705 --> 01:18:22,414
Lesson learned.

1374
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:27,623
Damn it!

1375
01:18:28,631 --> 01:18:32,546
Sorry, guys, I lost my composure out there.
I'm an idiot.

1376
01:18:32,636 --> 01:18:37,179
Don't worry. We'll make those points up.
Your skin's gonna grow back, too.

1377
01:18:37,266 --> 01:18:39,757
I'm sorry.

1378
01:18:39,852 --> 01:18:42,178
How many events
do we actually have left here?

1379
01:18:42,271 --> 01:18:45,807
One. Frank's accident
definitely set us back.

1380
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,063
But if we pass...

1381
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:49,394
If we pass athletics, we're in.

1382
01:18:49,488 --> 01:18:52,323
All right, everybody!
That's what I'm talking about.

1383
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:54,899
We've made a great effort so far.
Let's just keep it up!

1384
01:18:54,994 --> 01:18:58,826
That's right! We can't have anyone
freak out out there, okay?

1385
01:18:58,915 --> 01:19:02,201
We've got to keep our composure!
We've come too far.

1386
01:19:02,294 --> 01:19:06,126
There's too much to lose!
We've got to just keep our composure!

1387
01:19:06,257 --> 01:19:10,504
For your final test, I've chosen the men's
gymnastics team's all-around competition.

1388
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:14,510
And participants in the three events
will be chosen at random by me,

1389
01:19:14,599 --> 01:19:15,762
right now.

1390
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,140
Let's see, uh, rings.

1391
01:19:18,228 --> 01:19:19,639
Uh, Bernard.

1392
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,482
Okay, great.
Floor exercise.

1393
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:25,188
How about uh, Frank? Great.

1394
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:29,525
And for the vault competition,
oh, I don't know...

1395
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:31,655
How about um...

1396
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,578
- You.
- Me?

1397
01:19:35,664 --> 01:19:38,369
Yeah. Is there a problem with that?

1398
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:20,835
I'm still holding.

1399
01:20:22,049 --> 01:20:23,425
Still holding!

1400
01:20:27,764 --> 01:20:29,887
It's physically impossible.

1401
01:20:29,975 --> 01:20:32,383
Don't worry.
Abdul is there to spot you.

1402
01:20:37,149 --> 01:20:39,107
We're waiting, gentlemen.

1403
01:20:39,193 --> 01:20:41,980
Just hit the board as hard
as you can and shut your eyes.

1404
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:43,898
- You ready?
- Have fun with it.

1405
01:20:43,989 --> 01:20:46,563
Go! Come on!

1406
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:54,370
Come on!

1407
01:21:06,765 --> 01:21:08,224
Yeah!

1408
01:21:08,308 --> 01:21:10,978
Oh, my God! Yes!

1409
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:30,372
Congratulations, gentlemen.
You put forth quite an effort.

1410
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:31,490
You really did.

1411
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:34,705
But, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

1412
01:21:34,797 --> 01:21:36,789
You didn't pass your review.

1413
01:21:38,175 --> 01:21:41,545
What are you talking about?
We finished with an 84%.

1414
01:21:41,638 --> 01:21:44,343
Yes, you people did finish
with an 84%,

1415
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:48,596
but unfortunately, another pledge of yours
scored a "0" in every category.

1416
01:21:48,687 --> 01:21:49,802
What pledge?

1417
01:21:49,897 --> 01:21:53,397
A Joseph "Blue" Pulasky.

1418
01:21:56,112 --> 01:22:00,192
Hey, man, Blue's dead.
He passed away two weeks ago.

1419
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:03,200
He's listed right here
on your official chapter roster,

1420
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:06,738
and those zeroes drop your average
to a 58%.

1421
01:22:06,832 --> 01:22:09,239
Come on, you got to be kidding me.

1422
01:22:09,334 --> 01:22:11,327
It's been quite a journey.

1423
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:15,541
You're gonna be all right, Frank.

1424
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,919
- Come on, now, big cat.
- I have no reason to live.

1425
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:21,219
We're gonna find you
a one-bedroom apartment,

1426
01:22:21,306 --> 01:22:24,224
get you back on your feet,
maybe move you in over at Beanie's...

1427
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,934
It's not gonna be the same.

1428
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,476
Didn't quite work out
for you fellas, did it?

1429
01:22:28,564 --> 01:22:33,061
I recommend you drive off immediately,
before something bad happens.

1430
01:22:33,153 --> 01:22:34,778
Ooh, I'm scared!

1431
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:36,986
Excuse me, Mitch?
Am I interrupting?

1432
01:22:37,074 --> 01:22:40,324
Megan, you are. If you could leave,
it would be tremendous for all of us.

1433
01:22:40,411 --> 01:22:42,949
I thought you guys might
find this interesting.

1434
01:22:43,206 --> 01:22:46,575
<i>You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.</i>

1435
01:22:46,668 --> 01:22:48,460
<i>- I did say that.
- Look...</i>

1436
01:22:48,545 --> 01:22:51,997
<i>I did my part, now you have to do yours.
That's how bribes work.</i>

1437
01:22:52,091 --> 01:22:53,716
<i>I know how bribes work...</i>

1438
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:55,509
You know what?
Just, let me...

1439
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:58,672
Bird-dog him, Frankie!

1440
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,852
Coming through!

1441
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,346
- Go that way!
- Slow down, man!

1442
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:13,443
Pritchard, hey, it's over.

1443
01:23:14,074 --> 01:23:18,153
Hand over the tape. It's over.
It's over, okay?

1444
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:19,573
You know where the rest
of the guys are?

1445
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:22,242
I don't know, we all spread out... Ow!

1446
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,621
What are you doing?
What are you...

1447
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:27,710
Time out. Time out.

1448
01:23:32,802 --> 01:23:35,294
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1449
01:23:35,388 --> 01:23:37,346
Gentlemen...
Oh, God!

1450
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:47,434
Wait, wait, my shoulder.

1451
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:55,783
This man accosted me!

1452
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,198
You are all witnesses!
He accosted me!

1453
01:23:57,288 --> 01:24:00,457
Frank!

1454
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:05,044
Frank, are you okay?

1455
01:24:05,339 --> 01:24:08,755
Mitch, I'm so cold.

1456
01:24:11,137 --> 01:24:12,929
Come on, big cat.

1457
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:15,221
I think I see Blue.

1458
01:24:15,308 --> 01:24:16,719
Shh.

1459
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,684
He looks glorious.

1460
01:24:18,771 --> 01:24:20,598
- Stay with me.
- Okay.

1461
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,232
I did good.

1462
01:24:25,028 --> 01:24:26,771
You did great.

1463
01:24:40,711 --> 01:24:42,620
Man, I'm telling you!

1464
01:24:57,396 --> 01:24:58,641
Hi.

1465
01:25:00,692 --> 01:25:01,972
Hey!

1466
01:25:02,569 --> 01:25:03,980
Wow.

1467
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,269
How are you?

1468
01:25:05,364 --> 01:25:06,644
I'm okay.

1469
01:25:07,366 --> 01:25:08,777
You know, I got that apartment.

1470
01:25:08,867 --> 01:25:11,074
Good for you. That's great.

1471
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:13,320
And you were right about Mark.

1472
01:25:13,414 --> 01:25:15,158
What happened?

1473
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:19,711
Let's just say I caught him red-handed
and it wasn't pretty.

1474
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:23,088
I guess I thought he could change,
you know?

1475
01:25:23,175 --> 01:25:24,456
I don't know.

1476
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:28,177
So, you're moving out?

1477
01:25:28,515 --> 01:25:32,180
Um, yeah, I'm uh,
moving into a new place,

1478
01:25:32,269 --> 01:25:34,226
far, far away from here.

1479
01:25:34,313 --> 01:25:36,353
What about your little fraternity?

1480
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,141
Well, they're upgrading,
moving into a new facility.

1481
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:42,562
And uh, to tell you the truth,

1482
01:25:42,655 --> 01:25:45,491
they don't have much use for
the Godfather any more.

1483
01:25:46,743 --> 01:25:51,405
I hope you'll still think I'm cool
even without all this.

1484
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,033
I think I can deal with it.

1485
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:55,703
I appreciate it.

1486
01:25:55,878 --> 01:25:58,286
Although, you know,
I have to say,

1487
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:02,960
I have always been a little curious
about what goes on inside these places.

1488
01:26:03,052 --> 01:26:04,595
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1489
01:26:07,265 --> 01:26:10,469
I do have another 12 hours
on my lease.

1490
01:26:10,561 --> 01:26:14,393
I'd be more than happy to
show you around.

1491
01:26:14,941 --> 01:26:15,972
Really?

1492
01:26:16,067 --> 01:26:17,016
Yeah.

1493
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:19,528
Maybe for a minute.

1494
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:21,649
Great.

1495
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:24,485
Happy Tuesday to you out there.

1496
01:26:24,577 --> 01:26:28,160
It's "Frank the Tank" here at
Harrison Cougar Radio, 88.6.

1497
01:26:28,247 --> 01:26:31,118
Wanna give a shout-out
to the Godfather.

1498
01:26:31,209 --> 01:26:34,127
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here today, Mitch.

1499
01:26:34,212 --> 01:26:36,004
I'd probably be dead.

1500
01:26:36,215 --> 01:26:39,501
Face down in
a drained pool somewhere.

1501
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,764
<i>A quick note to all you
future brothers out there,</i>

1502
01:26:42,847 --> 01:26:47,177
<i>brand-new house on campus, located

1505

<i>for some chips, soda,
and some late-night streaking.</i>

1506
01:26:58,698 --> 01:27:01,190
Little right. Little more.

1507
01:27:01,702 --> 01:27:03,825
Yeah, that's good enough.
That's good enough.

1508
01:27:04,455 --> 01:27:06,577
- Welcome aboard, Booker.
- Thank you, sir.

1509
01:27:06,665 --> 01:27:09,072
- Walsh. Well done.
- Frank the Tank.

1510
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:11,041
Why don't you get me
a fresh beer?

1511
01:27:11,128 --> 01:27:12,291
You serious?

1512
01:27:12,379 --> 01:27:13,494
Now!

1513
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:17,167
Now! Hurry,
you sorry son-of-a-bitch!

We gotta stay in the goal.
You can't be walking around.

You're killing me.
Can we stay between the posts?

Woofers!

Go, go, go, eat 'em up!
Hungry, hungry, hungry! Eat 'em up!

1531
01:28:47,735 --> 01:28:51,816
Caleb, you know what to do in the box.
We talked about it, in the box!

1532
01:28:51,907 --> 01:28:53,864
Chill out, we're up by six.

1533
01:28:53,951 --> 01:28:58,697
That ref's a real prick out there.
That's right, you heard me, my man!

1534
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:02,539
Number four's been throwing elbows,
and someone's kid's gonna get hurt.

1535
01:29:02,627 --> 01:29:04,003
What?

1536
01:29:04,087 --> 01:29:05,914
Let's make it official then, jackass!

1537
01:29:06,006 --> 01:29:07,798
Let's make it official!

1538
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:11,671
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

1539
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:13,839
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

1540
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:17,512
Is that Frank the Tank?

1541
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,726
Hey. Heidi.

1542
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:23,477
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

1543
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,403
I got into body painting.

1544
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:28,279
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1545
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:29,479
That's great.

1546
01:29:29,574 --> 01:29:32,244
Well, you're looking
very healthy.

1547
01:29:32,327 --> 01:29:35,613
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, so are you.

1548
01:29:35,706 --> 01:29:37,579
Oh, thank you.

1549
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41,035
So, I heard you and Marissa split up.
Is that true?

1550
01:29:41,128 --> 01:29:42,539
Yeah, we did.

1551
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:45,666
Oh! You poor baby.

1552
01:29:46,467 --> 01:29:49,801
You know, I'm having this get-together
at my place tomorrow night.

1553
01:29:49,888 --> 01:29:53,589
Just like a few Internet friends.
You should swing by.

1554
01:29:53,684 --> 01:29:55,676
- Really?
- Totally.

1555
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,931
- Okay.
- All right.

1556
01:29:58,022 --> 01:30:00,691
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

1557
01:30:04,028 --> 01:30:05,357
Awesome.

1558
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:06,858
Yes!

1559
01:30:09,785 --> 01:30:11,659
I am back!

1560
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,288
Whoo!

1561
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,577
You know it!
